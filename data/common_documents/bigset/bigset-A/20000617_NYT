WILL SHANE GET OSCAR?

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The biggest fight ever in Los Angeles. One would
think local products Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley would be
thrilled to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are, but for reasons that have little to do with civic
pride. Oh, they say the right words. They say how exciting it is to
be fighting in front of the home folks, but clearly this isn't what
has driven them as tonight's bout before an expected crowd of
21,000-plus at Staples Center has approached.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tremendously important fight in the careers of both
men.
</P>
<P>
   For De La Hoya, this is a chance to regain some of the respect
he lost as a result of his debacle against Felix Trinidad in
September, in which he lost a fight he was winning by running the
final three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses again, the De La Hoya we've come to know - the
Golden Boy, the money-making machine - could be only another
marketable fighter.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, one of the most complete fighters in the world, this
is a golden opportunity to claim stardom and his piece of the
lucrative boxing pie.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, such a chance comes only once in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is big for reasons other than the fact the fight will
clear a state-record $8 million gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've waited for my whole career for,'' Mosley
said.
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry actually started when the fighters threw their
first punches as grade-school amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   They fought one another when Mosley was 12 and De La Hoya was 11
and sparred many times later in their amateur careers, although it
remains unclear who got the better of the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   What !ital!is!off! clear is that their careers went in separate
directions as a result of the 1992 Olympics: De La Hoya won the
nation's only gold medal and went on to become one of the richest
athletes in the world; Mosley didn't go to Barcelona and has had to
work harder to make his name.
</P>
<P>
   Today, De La Hoya (32-1, with 26 knockouts) remains among the
biggest draws in boxing, but his hold has never been more tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya who destroyed one opponent after another at
lighter weights has not given a spectacular performance for years,
often fighting tentatively and barely squeaking out victories in
his biggest fights - against Pernell Whitaker and Ike Quartey, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   And his last big fight, against Trinidad, was a public-relations
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It could've been worse. He could've been beaten up and rendered
a has- been on the spot. However, it was bad enough. He outboxed
Trinidad - as unsatisfying as it was - for nine rounds only to
shift into reverse and cruise the final nine minutes, which cost
him the decision and sullied both his perfect record and
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's learned the error of his ways. He's promised four
knockouts in four fights this year, tonight being KO No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   His objective: Regain that big-punching reputation and take the
result out of the judges' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style is an aggressive style,'' he said. ``That's what I
am, what comes naturally to me. I'm going back to the basics, what
got me here today.''
</P>
<P>
   With no gold medal and a novice promoter early in his career,
Mosley (34-0, 32 KOs) has built his impressive record in relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   He has rarely been seriously challenged but simply hasn't fought
the same class of opponents as De La Hoya. He's faced such solid
fighters as Philip Holiday, John John Molina, James Leija and
Wilfredo Rivera, but that's nothing compared to faces De La Hoya
has stared into: Whitaker, Quartey and Trinidad, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's career began to take off only after he signed with
promoter Cedric Kushner, with whom he won a world title at 135
pounds - against Holiday - and is in position now to become a star
and earn huge sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make as much as $5 million or $6 million tonight (to De La
Hoya's $15 million) and this would only be the start if he were to
win.
</P>
<P>
   However, some believe that De La Hoya is too much too soon for
Mosley, who has fought only twice since moving up to 147 while De
La Hoya has fought 10 times at the weight.
</P>
<P>
   The significance could be that De La Hoya is too strong
physically for Mosley at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosley's going to get to the top,'' said Robert Alcazar, De La
Hoya's trainer. ``But this is a little too soon for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the fight doesn't appear to have had an impact
on Mosley, who is as even-keeled as anyone you'll meet. He
dismisses the doubts of others.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he recently moved up to De La Hoya's weight class? He
struggled desperately to make the 135-pound limit toward the end
and walks around heavier than De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in big-fight experience? He fought in hostile
territory many times as an amateur when the U.S. team traveled to
compete against other countries and knows what it is to fight for a
professional title.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he has the ability - which no one disputes - and
the confidence to use it on the biggest night of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya has a lot of casual boxing fans,'' he said. ``They
support him, they follow him. Me? The real boxing fans know who
Sugar Shane is.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this fight, everyone will understand how great a fighter
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he must convince De La Hoya.

MYSTIFIED AS EVER, KNOBLAUCH GOES BACK TO WORK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch explained that the first thing he did
after leaving Yankee Stadium on Thursday night was to call his
mother, he intimated that he had received some undisclosed
treatment for his chronic throwing difficulties after the 1999
season and he claimed that he is not thinking about retiring from
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman who does not always throw straight was back
at the Stadium Friday night, and back in the lineup and back trying
to cope with the unexplainable.
</P>
<P>
   A little anxious and a little tentative, Knoblauch talked about
feeling as if he has little control over the simple act of throwing
a ball from second base to first base. It is something that
Knoblauch had done successfully since he was a boy, but he has been
plagued by his wobbly throws for about two years, and that problem
exploded when he made three errors in a 12-3 loss to the White Sox,
and ended up departing before the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if I was in Central Park,'' said Knoblauch,
``not Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch knew he was definitely in Yankee Stadium Friday
night as the fans gave him a standing ovation before he batted in
the first inning and gave him a partial standing ovation when he
corralled a pop fly in the second. There were banners supporting
Knoblauch through his ordeal, including one that said, ``We love
you Knobby and our teams needs you.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, there were no grounders hit to Knob-H lauch in the
eight innings that he played in a 3-1 loss to the White Sox, so he
did not need to make any throws.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Clay Bellinger replaced Knoblauch, who injured his
left ankle on a slide, and handled one grounder flawlessly, causing
some apparently inattentive fans to howl because they thought it
was Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   It was one game, one step, but Knoblauch still felt something
was missing. He said he still felt as uncomfort- able as he had
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is different,'' said Knoblauch, who had two of the six
Yankee hits in the game, but was disappointed that he did not have
a chance to make a throw. ``Nothing has changed. It's not gone
away.''
</P>
<P>
   As manager Joe Torre discussed how Knoblauch was being embraced
as a sympathetic figure after Thursday's fiasco, he said, ``I think
he only proved that he was human.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch ended some of the suspense about his future by showing
up for work with teammate Jason Grimsley at 2:30 p.m. About 50 fans
cheered Knoblauch when he sauntered from the parking lot to the
Stadium and they also scolded a television camera operator who was
filming the second baseman. Knoblauch kept his eyes focused ahead
of him, mostly oblivious to the attention.
</P>
<P>
   After a security guard escorted Knoblauch to the Yankees'
clubhouse, the Yankees kept the doors closed to reporters for an
extra 20 minutes so Knoblauch could meet with Torre. Torre asked
Knoblauch what he wanted to do and also told him, ``You're my
second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Knoblauch had spoken to Torre, he basically invited
reporters over to his locker. Knoblauch said he had received so
many calls from teammates that he called it a ``suicide watch,''
but he stressed that despite trashing some items in the clubhouse
Thursday night, he would not have ``done anything crazy'' because
of his current funk.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last October, Alan Hendricks, Knoblauch's agent,
had said that he did not want to talk about Knoblauch's throwing
problems and he did not want his client to discuss them either. But
Knoblauch acknowledged that he will now seek some treatment,
although he refused to specify what kind. He has previously
mentioned a sports psychologist or a hypnotist as options.
</P>
<P>
   Before saying Friday night that he would seek treatment,
Knoblauch first said, ``You got to remember you guys don't know
exactly what I did last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's speculation that I didn't do anything,'' he
added, before inferring that he had. ``Obviously, through the
Yankees, something's going to take place. Whatever road that might
be, we're still deciding.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman said that whatever
Knoblauch does or does not do will be a personal decision and will
not be divulged by the Yankees. When Cashman was asked if it
behooved the Yankees to ask Knoblauch, who will make $6 million
this year, to seek treatment, he said, ``I think it's a good idea
that we support him as best as we can. To define that, I won't do.
We're in it together. We'll work it out together.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Knoblauch won a Gold Glove with Minnesota in
1997, when he made just 12 errors. Last year, he made 26, 14 of
them throwing. This season, he has eight throwing errors, and 12
overall, more than any other second baseman in baseball. His .938
fielding percentage is the worst at his position.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of his dilemma Friday, Knoblauch was
self-deprecating at times and private in other moments. He would
not say why he tapped Torre on the knee and asked to speak with him
after the sixth inning on Thursday, even though the answer was
obvious. Torre said that Knoblauch, his eyes filled with
frustration, told him, ``I don't know what to do. I'm tired of
hurting the team.'' That is when Torre and Knoblauch agreed that he
should leave the game, return to his apartment in Manhattan and
thus avoid having to talk to reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're stuck for anything to say,'' Torre said Friday. ``You
just want to hug him.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Knoblauch said that the wild throw that he made in
Chicago on May 24 was actually worse than Thursday's three errant
pegs to first base. In a similar moment of frustration three weeks
ago, Knoblauch spoke about retirement three weeks ago, but he said
he did not think about it in this instance and gave ``very little''
consideration to not showing up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the desire,'' said Knoblauch. ``This is what you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Knoblauch said he was not sure if playing was the best
thing for him. Knoblauch, who singled in his first at-bat Friday
night, declined to take any infield practice while joking that he
knows how to catch grounders. Knoblauch sifted through words like
scared and apprehensive to vainly try to express how he felt. He
said his life is ``great,'' refusing to blame his father's
Alzheimer's disease or a complicated divorce after the 1998 season
for his throwing woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't fix something like this,'' said Torre. ``This is
something you have to endure more than you fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who had deep bags under his eyes and who had not
shaved in a few days, was standing beside Roger Clemens' locker
after doing two rounds of interviews. He was relaxed and loose as
he talked about how many people called him and how his mother,
Linda, wished she could fly from Texas to New York and hug him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Knoblauch glanced into Clemens' locker and pointed to a
miniature stone football on the shelf. Knoblauch told a reporter
that Clemens had given him one of the footballs with a saying from
Vince Lombardi inscribed across it. Lombardi's words were
meaningful to Knoblauch, who nodded in agreement while he read
them, ``The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.''

RATS MAKE NEWS AS FOOD, SYMBOLS AND VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By EUN LEE KOH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rats were very much on the agenda, as well as the
menu, this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night's episode of ``Survivor,'' the CBS game show,
contestants on the island of Pulau Tiga skinned, roasted and ate
rats to stay in the running to win $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the very next day, New York's labor unions
paraded their favorite props _ giant inflatable rats, representing
nonunion workers _ through Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, the most striking convergence of all occurred: At
the exact moment that animal rights advocates were in front of a
CBS office protesting the culinary choices on ``Survivor,'' public
officials were discussing the growing rat menace on another island,
Manhattan, and in the city's other boroughs, where by some accounts
they outnumber people 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bite children,'' Councilman Bill Perkins said at a City
Council hearing on rat eradication. ``They are dangerous. They
carry diseases. They contaminate food. They are unsightly. We live
in a culture where rats aren't friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they usually for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And they certainly should not be eaten for television
entertainment, said members of People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, protesting outside a CBS office on 57th Street Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they are not cute and snuggly, it doesn't mean
they don't feel pain,'' said RaeLeann Smith, 27, a spokeswoman for
the group who traveled from Norfolk, Va., to attend the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and seven other demonstrators _ including one in a furry
rat costume _stood outside the office for two hours Friday morning,
pumping their fists and chanting: ``Don't kill animals. Rats have
rights. Survive on veggies. Rats have rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, said the network respected the
protesters' views, but added, ``We truly believe our viewers
recognize that hunting and fishing for the purpose of sustenance
has been acceptable since the dawn of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ender said the contestants on the show were instructed not to
harm monkeys, lizards or other creatures indigenous to Pulau Tiga,
a deserted Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
   But rats are not indigenous, he said, having arrived on the
island aboard ships.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Council hearing, where officials talked quite a bit
about getting rid of rats, the subject of eating did not come up.
</P>
<P>
   And Perkins declined to step into the ``Survivor'' controversy.
``They can do whatever they want with rats on that island,'' he
said after the hearing. ``But for us, in a civilized society, we
don't need rats.''

LUIS BAPTISTA, 58, AUTHOR AND EXPERT ON BIRD SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luis F. Baptista, a leading expert on bird song who had learned
to recognize not just bird languages, but also dialects and
regional accents, died on Monday at his home in Sebastopol, Calif.
He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista was tending to a wild barn owl that had moved into a
shed on his property when he collapsed, said his companion, Helen
Mary Horblit. The cause of death was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista, curator of ornithology and mammalogy at the California
Academy of Sciences, was the author of more than 176 papers and the
co-author with J.C. Welty of the widely used textbook, ``The Life
of Birds.'' He had spent his life studying how different species of
birds developed their songs and calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``His knowledge of the living bird and its habits was more
comprehensive and sound than that of any other person,'' said the
noted philosopher and zoologist Ernst Mayr, a professor emeritus at
Harvard University. ``He had the most precise, correct and reliable
information on what is innate and what is learned in bird song.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he studied dozens of different bird species, Baptista was
best known for his research into the habits of white-crowned
sparrows, which nest in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, where the
California Academy of Sciences is based.
</P>
<P>
   He could recite the personal stories and mating habits of each
of the park's white-crowned sparrows, and recognized the birds from
bandings, natural markings and songs.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Filipe Baptista was born in Hong Kong on Aug. 9, 1941, and
grew up there and in Macao. His passion for birds began in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hong Kong, the top floor of tea houses was reserved for
bird lovers,'' he told a reporter for The New York Times in April.
``You brought your caged birds and drank tea and enjoyed their
songs. My father would take me and I loved it. Also, my brother and
I would often go to the countryside near where we lived to watch
the wild birds. So when I came to this country in the early 1960s
and learned that there was such a thing as ornithology, I thought,
`Good Lord, you can actually be paid to go out, watch birds and
study their songs.'''
</P>
<P>
   He earned a bachelor's degree in zoology from the University of
San Francisco and a doctorate from the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he traveled to the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral
Physiology near Munich to study the chaffinch, a bird that makes
specific noises in response to different kinds of threats _ signs,
Baptista believed, of a kind of language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a vocabulary of 10, 12 different sounds,'' he recently
explained. ``But it has different alarm calls. There's one for the
hawk flying over head: `This is not a serious danger.' A different
call means, `Let's get the hell out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States and joined the Moore Laboratory
of Zoology of Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he had the
opportunity to study the birds of Mexico and Central America. In
1980, he became chairman of the department of ornithology and
mammalogy at the California Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Horblit, a keeper of nocturnal lemurs at the
Golden Gate Park Zoo, Baptista is survived by his mother, Thelma;
two brothers, Antonio and Gaspar, and a daughter, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis was the Henry Higgins of the bird world,'' said James
Harris, an avian veterinarian for the California Academy of
Sciences. ``He believed dialect was history. Luis could stand in
the park, hear a call and declare, `That white-crowned had a
Canadian father and a California mother. It has half an Alberta
accent and half a Monterey accent. The parents probably met at the
Tioga Pass near Yosemite.'''

DAVID HEAPS, 84, HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: No Byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Heaps, whose work contributed to a decision by the the
Ford Foundation to start a large-scale international human rights
program, died on June 10 in Montclair, N.J. He was 84 and lived in
Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps was the foundation's representative in Nigeria, and then
in Tunisia, during the 1960s, and was an important figure in the
foundation's presence in Africa during that period. For much of the
early 1970s, Heaps was a program officer dealing with international
affairs at the foundation's headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps contributed to a paper titled ``Human Rights and
Intellectual Freedom'' that was presented in 1975 to the
foundation's trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The report came after a series of military coups in Latin
America. Based on its findings, the foundation formulated an
ambitious human rights program, now one of its largest in terms of
budget and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps retired from the foundation in 1976, but was a
Manhattan-based consultant to it on human rights matters from then
until 1982. He was also active in Amnesty International and other
organizations concerned with human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Heaps attended the Universities of
Southern California and Manitoba and won the Military Cross for
bravery while serving in the Canadian Army in Europe in World War
II. He worked for Unesco and other organizations before joining the
foundation in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mabel, and three sons, Jonathan and
Daniel, both of Manhattan, and Alan, of Montclair.

PROPOSAL WOULD END BAN ON ODDS ADVERTISING BY N.J. CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gamblers would be able to weigh their odds of winning at
different casinos in New Jersey under a proposal by state
regulators to lift a ban on odds advertising. The ban was written
into the New Jersey Casino Control Act, which legalized casino
gambling in the state in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The change is one of several amendments to the gambling law now
being drafted by the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the Casino
Control Commission, the two state agencies that regulate New
Jersey's 12 casinos in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement division had already notified the casinos, in an
April 19 letter, that it would no longer enforce the ban, following
a June 1999 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court
overturned a similar, federal ban involving Indian casinos after a
lawsuit was filed in 1994 by the New Orleans Broadcasting
Association.
</P>
<P>
   As it was written, New Jersey's gambling law banned casinos from
advertising odds-related elements, like the frequency of
slot-machine jackpots and the house's winning percentage at
blackjack tables.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also propose lifting bans on advertising the size of
a casino and the types of table games and electronic gambling
available. J.P. Suarez, director of the gaming enforcement
division, said the amendments would be submitted to the New Jersey
Legislature this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez, who is an assistant state attorney general, said that
the amendments would merely bring state law in line with the
Supreme Court's ruling, and that he fully expected them to be
approved and signed by Gov. Christie Whitman. ``Commercial speech
such as advertisement of odds is good for the consumer,'' Suarez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the odds advertising ban had been intended to
prevent what were considered deceitful advertising practices by Las
Vegas casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Laura M. Letson, executive director of the New York Council on
Problem Gambling, agreed that odds advertising might be a useful
tool for casino visitors, but she cautioned that it might also
aggravate compulsive-gambling problems. She said the state must be
willing to ensure truth in advertising, and Suarez vowed that his
agency would do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But within the gambling industry, there is concern that odds
advertising could lead to an ``odds war'' among casinos that are
now able _ even obligated, by demands of the marketplace _ to
advertise their odds. While beneficial to consumers, it could hurt
New Jersey's gambling industry, which employs tens of thousands of
people and provides hundreds of millions of dollars in annual tax
revenues to the state each year.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Grand, which is developing an
Atlantic City casino with Boyd Gaming of Las Vegas, said, ``I think
our industry needs to use a lot of discretion in the way it
promotes itself.''

HOUSE VOTE IS A SENSIBLE APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Although not much has
been made of it by the media, the House this week did American
business a huge favor by blocking implementation of major
worker-safety regulations until late 2001.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if the move will be to the detriment of the
country's work force, although organized labor certainly will try
to use the vote against House Republicans in this fall's election.
One labor lobbyist gleefully noted that the action ``will be worth
six pieces of attack mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but it would take fairly far-fetched distortions of the
truth to make the issue an effective negative campaign weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The rules involve the ergonomics of trying to protect workers
from repetitive-stress injuries, but critics contend the resulting
massive compliance cost will far outweigh any potential benefit to
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Missouri's Kit Bond, a leading Senate opponent
of the regulatory initiative, called it ``a devastatingly broad and
intrusive regulation.'' Bond, who heads the Small Business
Committee, said the rules lacked sufficient scientific
justification and were so fundamentally flawed regulators should
scrap the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   To this end he introduced a bill that would force the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to stay
implementation until a National Academy of Sciences study of the
regulation was completed. The House bill apparently goes a long way
toward achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   While OSHA has estimated the cost of compliance at $4.2 billion
a year, the American Health Care Association has estimated that the
cost for nursing-homes alone would range from $5.6 billion to $6.5
billion. OSHA, meanwhile, claims its regulations would prevent
300,000 work injuries a year, and thus save businesses more than $9
billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Practical experience, however, shows the numbers used in these
regulatory debates are virtually useless. Over a generation of
regulatory activism, the federal government has been notorious for
low-balling regulatory costs in an apparent effort to make
proposals more acceptable. The best recent example is the cost of
reformulated gasoline designed to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by the Center for the Study of American Business at
Washington University in St. Louis recently noted that major
corporations have been working on the problem for years because
it's in their best financial interest to do so. The result is a
steady decline for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), from 750,000
in 1992 to 600,000 in 1997. Business groups, the study notes,
contend they already are well along in efforts to fix what is
fixable. A major problem, business says, is that many injury causes
are not known and some thought to be work-related aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem beyond mere cost is the dense regulatory thicket
these initiatives create. The center's study says the regulation
takes 50 pages to list the rules, 250 pages to explain the rules,
and more than 1,000 pages to enumerate the 100-plus injury
categories OSHA describes.
</P>
<P>
   The House's delaying action doesn't mean such regulations will
never come to pass. Rather, it ensures government won't err in
haste with the result business is forced to bear expensive but
ineffective regulation in perpetuity. ( 30 )

AREA BUSINESSES ENJOYING MORE CASUAL ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Todd Isom's hangers
dress better than he does.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isom wears a golf shirt and jeans to work most days. Pressed
cuffs and collars stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had almost all white shirts,'' he said. ``Now, they just sit
in the closet, waiting for a wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Isom didn't change jobs. He still mines data from computers at
American Century Investments. But he does it at a company site with
a relaxed dress code.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City mutual fund company has gone business casual.
Not everyone gets to wear jeans. But almost no one routinely has to
meet a business-professional standard anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer we had sort of a trial run,'' said Jerry Bartlett,
whose title is chief people officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company had allowed business-casual dress on Fridays for
some time. Last year it made every day a dress-down day between
Memorial Day and Labor Day. At most sites the suits and ties came
back into vogue with autumn.
</P>
<P>
   This past May the relaxed dress code became policy year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The same happened last month for the 200 lawyers at the Kansas
City offices of Blackwell, Sanders, Peper, Martin. The staff
already had gone casual, but policy expanded casual Friday for
lawyers to cover the entire week, for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come to our firm these days, you see a mixture of business
professional and business casual,'' said Jim Borthwick, a partner
on the executive committee at Blackwell Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Suits still circulate, because they are needed in courtrooms and
for some client meetings, Borthwick said. And some lawyers still
wear the coat and tie just because they want to.
</P>
<P>
   Business casual also became permanent last month for area
employees of Aventis Pharmaceutical, which is what remains of the
old Marion Laboratories Inc. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Traci Seaman said the policy changed in mid-May.
Normally, casual would not kick in until after Memorial Day and
would expire with summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   But Aventis is shifting its headquarters to New Jersey. That
affects people in sales, marketing and administrative posts. By the
end of summer, most of them will be gone, having transferred or
left the company's employ altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed code, however, will stick around for the several
hundred Aventis workers who will remain. Many already have a
relaxed dress code because of their jobs in production, Seaman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Business-casual dress is nothing new. It spread so widely and
quickly that it shook up the apparel industry for a time.
</P>
<P>
   But casual still is finding open ground for new roots in Kansas
City. American Century, Blackwell Sanders and Aventis are just the
latest to give in.
</P>
<P>
   Butler Manufacturing Co. went business casual year-round last
year, said Phil Jones, corporate human relations manager. It, too,
had started with dress-down Fridays, then a few relaxed-standard
summers until turning business casual for good.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Hersh, with Robert Half and Accountemps of Kansas City
Inc., said many of the clients who hired permanent or temporary
employees through the firm had been business casual throughout the
year for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, most workplaces are business casual most of the
time, said Ann Marie Sabath, the Cincinnati author of Beyond
Business Casual: What to Wear to Work If You Want to Get Ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Sabath said the trend was merely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business casual will go away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, younger workers would drive it away. Sabath
said she heard from employees in their 20s and 30s that casual
dress had gone too far. They want a professional image at work, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday, 35-year-old Dana Spoor wore a
double-breasted suit to work in American Century Tower I, where
business casual became the norm five weeks ago. Although she took
part in casual Fridays, she has taken advantage of the new weeklong
policy only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice option if you wake up on a Wednesday and say, `I
don't want to put on hose,' '' said Spoor, an intranet project
manager. ``I just feel more professional when I dress nice.''
</P>
<P>
   American Century still requires business-professional attire in
some circumstances. For example, an employee who travels to a
client or company that is not business casual should dress to that
firm's standard.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the e-mail that announced the full-time relaxed
standard reminded employees that business casual did not mean there
was no standard.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans qualify only in a few buildings where customers and
clients do not visit. Isom works on Broadway with about 275 others
who can wear jeans. Jeans are OK for the 850 employees in American
Century's Ward Parkway offices, for 400 in Denver and sometimes for
the 200 in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   No jeans are allowed in the American Century Towers, where about
1,000 work, or the Plaza Steppes Building, where 350 work.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, business casual still bans ``spandex, Lycra and other
body-clinging fabrics, jeans of all colors, anything tight,
tattered or ripped, leggings, shorts and skorts, sweatshirts,
sweatpants and jogging suits, flip-flop sandals or tennis shoes,
hats, caps and sunglasses,'' the e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the relaxed standard, American Century employees need
to show up in ``neat, ironed clothes,'' and they have to wear
hosiery or socks. Permanent press counts.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, khakis, polo shirts, ``flat shoes or loafers'' and
even denim shirts and dresses pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   Not so at Blackwell Sanders, despite the business-casual dictum.
Borthwick said there was not a written description of business
casual, but a lawyer wearing Dockers slacks likely would attract
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody probably would be saying, `You know, that's not
really what we were talking about,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the business world nothing happens without a
motive. Bartlett, American Century's chief people officer, said the
new, relaxed apparel ought to make employees more productive.
</P>
<P>
   He said the total work environment affected how productive
workers could be. That is especially true when folks put in nine,
10 or 11 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a fulfilling experience, pretty soon you have a
lot of people who don't want to be here anymore,'' Bartlett said. (

SPIKING GAS PRICES PROMPT KANSAS CITIANS TO RE-EVALUATE THEIR
SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Holy moly!''
thought Phil Wall as he watched the dollars and cents on the gas
pump tick higher and higher.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the nozzle clicked off, Wall had spent almost twice
as much money as he did a year ago to fill the tank of his 1994
Toyota 4Runner.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has historically enjoyed low gasoline prices, but in
the current price surge Midwesterners are paying well above the
ever-rising national average.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fact that area motorists drive almost one-third
more miles than the average American urban driver, and high gas
prices are hitting harder here than almost anywhere in the country.
If current prices keep up, an average two-car family could see an
extra $1,300 a year go toward filling up their gas tanks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many people are shifting their spending priorities,
or at least thinking about it. And businesses that depend on
gasoline are feeling the reverberations as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wall, he's changed his vacation plans. Originally, he and
his girlfriend, Cynthia Harris, and her dog, Cody, were going to
drive to the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're cutting the number of miles they're willing to
drive by half and will end up somewhere in western Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Wall has switched from premium grade gas to mid-grade,
and sometimes regular. And when Wall gets back from vacation, he's
going to start looking for a used, four-cylinder Toyota Camry for
trips around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'd have to budget at least a couple of hundred
dollars more if I wanted to go ahead and go to the Grand Canyon,
but why should I?'' Wall said. ``I have better things to spend my
money on.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason _ tight supplies, a pipeline problem and new
cleaner-burning gas are among those suggested _ Kansas City area
residents no longer enjoy below-average gas prices. AAA of Missouri
surveyed prices at area pumps Friday morning and found consumers
paying $1.73 on average for regular unleaded. But by Friday
afternoon, some stations had boosted regular unleaded to $1.80.
Meanwhile, the national average was $1.63.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying organization for
the gasoline industry, says that in today's dollars, Americans were
paying $2.55 a gallon for gas in 1981. But the distant past is no
comfort, especially when pump prices were below $1 just last year.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most sprawling cities in the United States, the
Kansas City area has the lowest population density among metro
areas of more than 1 million people. Additionally, the area has the
highest number of freeway lanes per capita at 120 miles for every
100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is Kansas Citians do a lot of driving, and it's
getting more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math for an average two-car household in the
metropolitan area. If each vehicle is driven 18,480 miles _ 32
percent above the national average _ and gets the national average
21.4 mpg, the household was spending $1,727 a year for gas when it
cost $1 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   At $1.80 a gallon, that household is paying $3,109, a difference
of $1,382.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a vacation, that's a washer and dryer,'' said Mike
Right of AAA of Missouri. ``What this means is that household
expenditures are shifting from disposable _ eating out, travel, new
furniture _ to essentials.''
</P>
<P>
   If people have less disposable income because they're spending
more on gasoline, Right said, it's logical to surmise that those
types of businesses that have enjoyed and prospered from America's
long-lived economic expansion will get hit first and hardest.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to see evidence of that, Right said. But he
thinks if prices stay where they are, or move higher, effects soon
will be apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Kite Singleton, a Kansas City area architect, noted that it took
the oil crisis of the 1970s to get the automobile industry to start
making more fuel-efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But during the 1990s that whole tendency changed considerably
because fuel costs were so much lower relative to people's
incomes,'' Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel efficiency peaked in 1997 at 21.7 mpg but dropped to 21.4
in 1998, the last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly half of the vehicles sold in the United States in
the past few years have been sport utility vehicles, some of which
get 12 mpg in the city, fuel efficiency has probably declined.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Right said, if prices stay at these levels or higher, he
thinks people will again turn more of their attention to fuel
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to move much higher on the radar screen
when people are buying a new car, whereas two years ago it wasn't
even a factor,'' Right said.
</P>
<P>
   But John Michaels, new vehicles sales manager at Jay Wolfe
Chevrolet in Kansas City, Kan., said pump-price shock so far
doesn't seem to be slowing sales of SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Most people buying SUVs, Michaels said, are 35 years of age to
55. They're used to seeing swings in prices, whether it's at the
gas pump or the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tug on the gas tank doesn't seem to be hurting us,''
Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   But others are already making adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Wall Street analyst David Tannehill said he had
turned cautious on his outlook for the recreational vehicle
industry because of the rise in interest rates and gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   And calls to Rideshare, a program that helps area residents
coordinate car-pooling and other commuting options, are up 20
percent over a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Area Transportation Authority official Dick Davis
thinks higher gas prices will spur bus ridership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take (people) a couple of times to look at gas prices
for them to re-evaluate their transportation options,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cab drivers also are feeling the squeeze, although on Thursday
the Kansas City Council approved a 50-cent per trip surcharge for
whenever the average cost of unleaded regular in the area exceeds
$1.40.
</P>
<P>
   Others are taking action as well, including Bill Nigro of
Torre's Pizzerias, who said his delivery drivers were getting a
raise of 25 cents an hour to help offset their increased costs for
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Right isn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any business that uses a car, a truck, a snowblower, a weed
chopper, a forklift, a lawn mower, is going to feel the effects of
this,'' he said. ``Those costs are going to have be absorbed
somewhere _ either by the business or the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who will be hurt the most, Right said, are those on the
lowest rungs of the economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of full employment those on the bottom rungs have been
able to find jobs, and to have jobs they have to have a way to get
there and get back,'' Right said. ``When they have to start paying
these kinds of prices, it can knock them right out of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Right doesn't hold much optimism for the future, at least for
the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices are staying above $32 a barrel; wholesale
gasoline prices are at about $1.10 a gallon; there's been a
drawdown in stocks; output hasn't picked up much; and OPEC is
sending signals that its members are going to stick together and
not increase production.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may just be posturing on their part,'' Right said. ``But
if not, we're going to be in for even more dire straits.'' ( 30 )

KU PALEONTOLOGISTS UNEARTH T. REX FOSSIL ON WYOMING RANCH  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MHARI DOYLE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Dinosaur bones
stick to your tongue.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the advice Craig Sundell, a University of Kansas
paleontology graduate student, gave a few Wyoming rancher friends
who wanted to help scout for dinosaur fossils.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to know whether something was rock or bone, touch
it with your tongue, Sundell said. Because a bone is porous, your
tongue _ for a brief second _ will stick to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sundell's advice seems to have paid off. On a tip from the
ranchers, Sundell and a small digging team from KU two weeks ago
uncovered fossil bones from what is believed to be a
65-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ranchers) were moving their cattle,'' Sundell said at a
news conference Friday at Olathe (Kan.) North High School, where he
graduated in 1971. ``They were looking for some strays and found a
piece of dinosaur bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundell's team, which already was in Wyoming hunting for
Triceratops bones, first scouted the area and found scattered on
the ground hundreds of bone shards belonging to a meat-eating
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a tooth socket,'' said team member Matt Christopher,
who graduated from KU in 1999. He was too excited to say then that
it could be a T. rex fossil. ``We brought it to Craig, and all we
could say was, `This isn't a Triceratops.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said when Sundell identified it as a T. rex tooth
socket _ because of the composition of the bone and the double
serration of the tooth _ ``we were blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon a major excavation was under way. About two weeks ago,
Sundell's wife, Jackie, brushed away soft shale sediment to reveal
the upper jaw and a tooth from the beast, which the team named
``Monte'' after the owner of private land in east-central Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major skull parts already have been recovered, including an
upper jaw with teeth in place. We've also found a majority of the
ribs,'' Sundell said. ``These indicate that much of the skeleton is
present and is yet to be unearthed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundell's team also has found some gastralia, which are bones
formed in the skin that encase the lower abdomen and act as ``belly
ribs.'' Sundell said he'd uncovered about 15 percent of what he
hoped would be a complete skeleton of what was a 45-foot-long,
10-ton carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Brochu, a research scientist at the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago, knows Sundell and has heard of his
recent T. rex excavation. Brochu said Sundell's findings could
prove to be important. Brochu said about 20 nearly complete T. rex
fossils were on display, including the Field Museum's ``Sue,'' the
largest and most complete T. rex fossil to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding a T. rex isn't as rare as we thought, but it's still
an exciting find,'' Brochu said, adding that finding a complete
skeleton was difficult. ``All dinosaur fossils are potentially
important. I'm looking forward to hearing more about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow uncovering of Monte follows closely on the heels of the
May 17 unveiling of Sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue is 90 percent complete,'' Brochu said. ``Finding a more
complete skeleton is not as common.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundell hopes Monte will prove to be at least as complete as
Sue, but he acknowledges that he and his team have a long way to
go. Most paleontologists don't announce a find until all the bones
had been excavated, Sundell said. But he wanted to go public to
share Monte's uncovering on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go from dirt to digital,'' Sundell said, calling
the project ``rexcavation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring daily updates, and let people see what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a Web site, which hasn't been established yet, Sundell
also hopes to attract a home for Monte once it's completely
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   Sundell said he held the press conference Friday at Olathe North
because he didn't want to pressure KU or other institutions to make
on offer for the fossils.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, museums buy dinosaur skeletons for between $2 million
and $4 million, Sundell said. He added that because Monte was found
on private land, the land owners would receive the money.
</P>
<P>
   Monte's fetching price depends on how much of the skeleton
Sundell's team can uncover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still finding new bones every day,'' Sundell said.
``That's a good sign....The story will continue in the shales,
clays and sands of Wyoming.'' ( 30 )

CHECKS, MAILBOX LINK JOHN E. ROBINSON SR. TO MISSING MOTHER,
DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA and MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ John Edward Robinson
Sr. picked up what appeared to be monthly government checks for two
missing women at a commercial mail center in Olathe, Kan., the
center's owner said Friday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sheila Dale Faith, who would be 51 now, and her daughter, Debbie
Lynn Faith, who would be 21, have been missing since 1994, when a
neighbor said they left their Pueblo, Colo., home with a man named
John. Robinson collected their checks regularly until police
arrested him this month, said Mailroom owner Randy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faith box has a lot of checks,'' Davis said. ``They each
got one every month.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davis saw news that police had arrested Robinson _ whom he
knew as Jim Turner, an alias police said Robinson used _ he told
investigators about the mailbox where the June checks would be
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 56, of Olathe is not charged in the Faiths'
disappearance. On Tuesday, he was charged in the beating deaths of
five women whose bodies were found in barrels on his property in
Linn County, Kan., and in a storage locker in Raymore.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Faiths, police are looking for three other women and
a 4-month-old baby who disappeared as early as 1984 and had
connections with Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bodies in the Raymore locker was Beverly J. Bonner,
who received mail in another box at Mailroom. According to her
ex-husband in Cameron, Mo., her mail included monthly checks he
sent to that box as part of a property settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson picked up her mail after she disappeared in 1996, Davis
said. That box was closed for non-payment about a year later, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   - Agents from the Social Security Administration have joined the
criminal investigation into Robinson, an agency spokesman confirmed
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Garlinger, regional communications director for Social
Security, said the administration's Office of Inspector General
recently entered the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Garlinger said federal agents were participating ``essentially
to provide expertise in matters that relate to Social Security as
(state investigators) ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Inspector General is Social Security's
investigative arm and looks into allegations of fraud and abuse in
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security's participation in the Robinson probe began
about the time investigators were considering asking the public for
help in locating the Faiths.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Faiths were receiving a monthly income of $1,016 in
Social Security benefits, The Orange County (Calif.) Register
reported then in a feature article about needy people.
</P>
<P>
   Garlinger said that federal privacy laws do not allow him to say
whether Faith or her daughter were receiving federal benefits when
they disappeared in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   - Colorado school records appear to narrow the period in which
the Faiths vanished to the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Darrow, a spokeswoman for School District 60 in Pueblo, said
Friday that after Debbie finished the 1993-94 school year, she did
not appear the following September for the 1994-95 session.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow further noted that district documents reflect no request
from any other district for Debbie's academic records from the
Pueblo district. Such requests are routine for students
transferring to new districts so they can receive credit for
courses they already have taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no record of a request for a transfer,'' Darrow said.
``She was a no-show.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado records also confirmed that Debbie transferred from a
school in Fullerton, Calif., in September 1993. Though family
friends have said Debbie suffered from cerebral palsy, school
records show her condition as spina bifida. Friends have said she
used a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow said Debbie, who school records indicate was born in
Dallas, attended regular classes at East High School in Pueblo and
participated in sessions with physical therapists.
</P>
<P>
   - The task force investigating Robinson will be cut in half
Monday, to about 15 investigators, and officials plan to meet
toward the end of the week to discuss how the investigation should
continue, Lenexa Sgt. Rick Roth said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No investigators assigned to the case will be in the office to
answer calls this weekend, but Lenexa, Kan., dispatchers will take
tips for them at (913) 477-7300. ( 30 )

DEDICATED CIVIL WAR RE-ENACTORS INVADE MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   REPUBLIC, Mo. _ As a campfire crackled,
Shelby Clement reclined under a canopy of shade trees with other
Confederate re-enactors. Only hours before, they had finished a
four-day, 55-mile march. They subsisted on the food of the times:
salt pork and biscuits hard enough to bust a filling.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clement wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to keep alive that memory, and do it right,'' said
Clement, who portrayed a member of the Missouri State Guard. ``I
want to know what it felt like to be there. I want to dress like
them, live like them.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 Civil War enthusiasts have taken over a farm
field southwest of Springfield, Mo., this weekend for Wilson's
Creek 2000, thought to be the largest re-enactment ever held west
of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hoped to bring attention to Missouri's role, often
overlooked, as a venue for key battles such as Wilson's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The event also highlights the thriving subculture of Civil War
re-enactors, who crisscross the country with trailers full of
equipment, uniforms and weapons. This is no game. Many plunge into
their roles by researching the 1860s to get every detail perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to play a good dead guy,'' said Clement, of Hartville.
``I'm not going to sit around resting on my side. I don't want to
flop around and make it over-dramatic either. I make it
authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactors' passion for their sides varies. Some
re-enactors identify closely with the Union or Confederacy,
depending on their own family history. Some re-enactors also
strongly believe in the causes: to the Union, abolition; to the
Confederates, states' rights. Other re-enactors have no problems
alternating between the two sides out of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the battle, the event replicates 1860s life with
a village marketplace that some compared to a theme park. Vendors
sold root beer made from authentic herbs. Craftsmen hawked period
clothing and equipment for soldiers, such as canteens and lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   The three days will be filled with pastimes of the period, such
as a revival, camp dance and military dress parade.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers did bow to modern needs, situating portable toilets a
few hundred yards from food stands that included gyro sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Although some complained about the $29 admission, visitors at
times filled the back roads to the event site. Rain dampened
Friday's attendance, but organizers hoped that more than 80,000
would attend the event, which ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's Creek 2000 is the only national event by the
North-South Alliance, one of the nation's pre-eminent Civil War
groups. Re-enactors say the event has generated buzz as far east as
Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Fix of the Civil War Preservation Trust said this
weekend's event, if everything goes according to plan, could be the
largest re-enactment ever west of the Mississippi River. She called
the event a ``coup for Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's highlight, of course, was the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Three skirmishes, one on Friday, another today and a third on
Sunday, showcase the Battle of Wilson's Creek of Aug. 10, 1861.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, black powder boomed from cannons. Fields filled with
smoke as the sound of artillery fire rang through the air. Both
generals, surveying the scene on horseback, relayed orders from the
back line.
</P>
<P>
   The actual battlefield is only a few miles away, but federal law
prohibits re-enactments on National Park Service property.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Wilson's Creek, the war was only 4 months old.
Missouri's strategic position made it vital for both sides. A
pro-Southern governor had been dislodged, but the Confederates were
building a sizable force in southwest Missouri to reclaim the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Because Union Gen. Nathaniel Lyon arrived at Wilson's Creek
outnumbered, he launched a surprise attack. The Southerners
eventually won the battle, but both sides lost more than 1,000 men.
The Confederates' momentum was slowed, and Missouri remained in
Union hands.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's Creek was the first major battle west of the
Mississippi River. Missouri is third in the nation in the number of
Civil War battles and skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bentley of Olathe, Kan., portraying a member of the 2nd
Kansas volunteer infantry, Company C, said he hopes the event will
allow Missourians to appreciate that rich history. He already saw a
boost in interest from ``Ride With the Devil,'' a recent Civil War
film set in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, we'd just be a couple of guys hanging around a
tree. We have more than 20 here this weekend,'' Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope the event will give a boost to preservation
efforts, especially near Wilson's Creek. Development threatens
battlefields nationwide. Christian County, which includes part of
the Wilson's Creek site, is one of the fastest-growing counties in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in this event, however, didn't need to be convinced
about the importance of history. They skipped work, dipped into
their savings accounts and often drove hundreds of miles to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactors organize themselves into units _ the same ones
with which some of their ancestors fought. When they talk about
their unit's history, they make no effort to conceal their pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know,'' asks a man from Madison, Wis., ``that it was
our company that captured Jefferson Davis at the end of the war? I
bet you didn't know that. I have all kinds of interesting facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Other re-enactors become experts in the war and the time period.
Some leaders study military strategy. Other participants can
identify specific types of stitching on uniforms. They share their
interests at meetings and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Davis of Lenexa, Kan., paused while marching through a dry
creekbed with Jerry Cigich of Kansas City, Kan. The Union soldiers
were sweating in the humid, 80-degree weather. Davis anticipated
the question he often gets.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing,'' he said. ``My wife thinks I'm an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said he has a deep appreciation of history. He also
loves the outdoors and the camaraderie of his fellow re-enactors.
</P>
<P>
   Davis might be on the opposite side from Clement, the
Confederate re-enactor who marched 55 miles, but he shares his
desire to make the experience authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Because Davis' real-life unit was hastily called into Wilson's
Creek, they only packed the provisions they could carry. Davis did
too. Unlike other re-enactors, they camped outside without tents.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours, they already had encountered ticks, heat and
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is no real way to duplicate the hardships,
privation and horror they experienced. But we try,'' Davis said.
``That way, you get a greater appreciation for what they went
through. Both sides. They believed enough in something that they
were willing to die for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is worth remembering.'' ( 30 )

REPORTER BECOMES A WITNESS TO (RE-ENACTED) HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   REPUBLIC, Mo. _ They say the pen is
mightier than the sword. Yeah, right. That's little comfort when
you've stepped onto a battlefield armed with a Bic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Invited by a Confederate general, I joined the field of battle
Friday afternoon at the Wilson's Creek 2000 re-enactment. Civil War
leaders often invited journalists as a way to take their message to
the people. Unlike those reporters, I didn't fear for my life. Only
blanks were shot.
</P>
<P>
   The re-enactors thrive on authenticity. I was outfitted with a
ragged white shirt, powder-blue wool pants, a black vest and black
boots. Our photographer, Joe Ledford, was forced to hide his
cameras in burlap sacks with holes cut out. One re-enactor groaned
when a wayward spectator cut across the field. With those
distractions, I didn't expect the feel of a real battle.
</P>
<P>
   We took cover in a thicket of trees and tall grass as Union
troops massed at the bottom of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, about 15 Confederates on horseback surfaced
behind us. They were scouting. Several had pistols beside their
ears, pointing upward. In a low voice, the leader asked, ``Ready?''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was getting interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels rode down, guns firing. The Union Cavalry rode back
in even greater numbers. The battle was on.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos of battle was clear, even from my short stint. A
flurry of gunfire filled the gap between both lines of soldiers,
almost 200 men long. Artillery boomed behind us, location unknown.
Soldiers seemed to appear from the trees or on hilltops.
</P>
<P>
   We were escorted by Mike Bolley, the general's aide-de-camp. We
were never in any danger except for galloping horses. They
certainly didn't know this wasn't real. The booms of gunfire would
send their heads jerking.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enactors talk of the ``magic moment'' of each event when the
present day disappears and one is completely in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I ever felt that. The closest I came, perhaps, was
late in the battle when Union soldiers cut through our trees about
15 feet from us. An officer shouted: ``Go, go, go! Hurry, hurry,
hurry! Get up there, (expletive)! Load and go! Load and go!'' The
men scampered to fill in the line, hoping to catch the Confederates
from the side.
</P>
<P>
   I met eyes with a boy, probably no more than 13, who was serving
as the unit's drummer. I detected something. Not fear, exactly. But
he seemed to be feeling his ``magic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   At battle's end, the men returned to camp. A heavy rain was
starting to fall. The general lined up his men _ in real life,
teachers, accountants, firefighters. ``You fought like the demons
you are!'' he shouted. They roared back their approval with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   This sure beat sitting at my desk. I could finally understand
Bolley's line: ``A bad re-enactment beats a good day at the office
any time.'' ( 30 )

PACERS PUT THE LAKERS' CELEBRATION ON ICE
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ He called for the basketball again, motioning
wildly to his teammates, flapping his sinewy arms like a goose in
flight. Reggie Miller, who was standing behind the arc, would not
let the season expire for the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   He squared, fired and flapped those arms some more. The range.
The form. The rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   It was all there for Miller, whose shots splashed repeatedly
into the nylon.
</P>
<P>
   The Conseco Fieldhouse Friday night roiled with sound and
passion, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant's mighty Los Angeles
Lakers came tumbling down in Game 5 of the NBA finals. The Lakers
lead the series, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   All net. Almost even.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the 3-point line or getting to the foul line _
and with unending support from Jalen Rose and Mark Jackson _ Miller
and the Pacers ran the Lakers off the floor, 120-87, before an
almost-disbelieving crowd of 18,345.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Champagne out of the coolers and pack up the
championship hats and T-shirts already embroidered and stitched.
The best-of-7 series is going to the Staples Center for Game 6 on
Monday night in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shared the ball on offense, whizzing the ball around
the perimeter. They rotated and helped on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored 25 points on 7-of-12 shooting. His last of four
3-pointers came with 10 minutes 44 seconds remaining, a 26-foot
shot from the right wing that made the arena rumble.
</P>
<P>
   That shot put Indiana ahead, 93-68, and sent Miller into the
ecstatic arms of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He received all the help needed from them. Rose could not be
stopped, scoring 20 first-half points as Indiana took the game to
the Lakers early. He finished with 32.
</P>
<P>
   Against the most accomplished defensive team in the league,
Miller and Rose combined for 42 points and the Pacers shot 61
percent while taking a lead of 64-45 into the locker room at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trimmed the margin to 13 midway through the third
quarter, but another Pacers binge sent Indiana into the final
period with an insurmountable 86-67 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who ended with 35 points and 11 rebounds, was the only
Laker who had presence on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   After the indefatigable Bryant played 47 minutes and scored
eight of his 28 points in the Lakers' Game 4 overtime gem on
Wednesday, he returned to earth Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up his fifth foul with 1:44 remaining in the third
quarter, he missed 10 of his first 14 shots and never found the
rhythm that carried his team to victory after O'Neal had fouled out
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven teams in NBA history have recovered from a 3-1
deficit in a seven-game series to win it, and no team has ever
accomplished the feat in the finals. Indiana cannot take much
solace in the idea of having to beat a 67-victory team twice on its
home court over the next four days to record its first NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers have had their problems in close-out games,
falling to 3-6 with the Game 5 loss. They lost their composure at
several junctures, none more noticeable than when Derek Fisher
rushed out to defend a Miller 3-pointer at the outset of the fourth
quarter and was called for the foul.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing vehemently, he was hit with a technical. Miller made all
three free throws, plus the technical. The Lakers had given up
their second four-point possession of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and his team have a lot of hope. At least they will not
have to deal with the locals from the heartland, whooping and
hollering and going berserk each time Miller or his teammates
scored.
</P>
<P>
   The noise inside the fieldhouse was more deafening than even for
Game 4, when Indiana seemed on the cusp of knotting the series at
2-2 before falling by 120-118 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits, too, gave Indiana a monstrous lift. He followed his
24-point night in Game 4 with a 12-point performance in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The more he makes O'Neal respect his jump shot on the offensive
end, the more energy the Lakers' 7-foot-1, 330-pound center
expends.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers simply could not overcome a first-quarter onslaught
from the Pacers. Making 15 of their first 20 shots and leading by
39-28 after 12:00, Indiana looked intent on sending the series back
to Los Angeles for Game 6 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After Rose dunked with 5:56 left in the second quarter and
scored on a reverse layup moments later to push the lead to 54-35,
Lakers coach Phil Jackson looked disgusted at Glen Rice, who looked
like a cardboard cutout as Rose went around him for 20 first-half
points. Miller had 18.
</P>
<P>
   He and Rose looked as cocksure and confident as ever, shooting
an unreal 8 of 10 from behind the 3-point line in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first quarter, Miller shot a 26-footer from
the right wing, drawing a foul from Ron Harper and finishing a
four-point play with a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   Miller found himself alone again behind the line on the left
baseline with time running down in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Brian Shaw a pump fake and calmly set himself and
released a picturesque shot with 44.1 seconds left as Shaw went
crashing into the first row.
</P>
<P>
   All net. Almost even.

WOODS LEADS BY 3 STROKES AT FOG-PLAGUED PEBBLE BEACH  
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The fog disappeared, they played until
darkness, and Tiger Woods kept making birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating his day with a fist pump and a 35-foot putt for
birdie at No. 12, Woods moved to nine under par through 12 holes
and led the U.S. Open Friday by three strokes when play was
suspended because of darkness. And Woods, who was the first-round
leader after his opening 65, was threatening to separate himself
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Jimenez was in second place at 6-under through
seven holes, Thomas Bjorn of Denmark was two under through 16
holes, and Angel Cabrera of Argentina was two under through nine
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round play will be completed Saturday morning, followed
by the start of Saturday's third round. But Woods continued to play
brilliantly, making birdies on his last two holes Friday _ a 4-foot
putt for birdie at No. 11, followed by his long putt for birdie at
No. 12 to end the day.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also muscled a shot out of the rough at No. 6 that lead to
a birdie, made a 20-foot putt for birdie on No. 3 and sank a
15-foot putt for birdie at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jimenez was steady, making par on his first five
holes, then making an 8-foot birdie putt at the par 5 No. 6. Bobby
Clampett, a 40-year-old golf analyst for CBS who grew up a few
miles from Pebble Beach, continued to be the surprise player of the
tournament at 1-over through 15 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Many people probably expected Clampett to falter after his
opening-round 68, considering that he rarely plays tournament golf
and basically retired from the PGA Tour five years ago. But
Clampett, who used to sneak onto Pebble Beach as a child, made the
most of his local knowledge, looked confident around the greens and
continued a memorable two-day experience.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made his first bogey of the tournament at the par 3 No. 5,
hitting his tee shot into the right bunker, blasting out to within
eight feet of the hole and then missing the putt. But after hitting
his tee shot into the right rough at the par 5, 524-yard No. 6, he
hit a shot that few others can make, reaching the green from the
rough with a remarkable approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   From there he missed a 20-foot putt for eagle, but tapped in for
birdie and followed that up by another birdie at No. 7. Woods,
however, made his second bogey at the par 4 No. 9, missing the
green on his approach shot, and failing to get up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Among players who finished the second round, Kirk Triplett was
the clubhouse leader at 1-under (141), after an even-par 71. It was
an impressive round for Triplett, who reached 5-under par through
eight holes and then hung on through the back nine, with the
temperature dropping and the greens becoming more unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were back to the typical U.S. Open conditions, where
there's hardly any guys breaking par,'' said Triplett, who won this
year's Nissan Open to capture his first career victory on the PGA
Tour. ``The guys breaking par are playing great, hitting phenomenal
shots and great up-and-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it felt to be the clubhouse leader, Triplett said,
``Do they write the check based on that?''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't. And with Woods and many others still on the
course, Triplett knew he would have to wait until Saturday to learn
his position heading into the third round.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day, but some managed to gain ground. Those
who finished the second round in decent position included Nick
Faldo and Vijay Singh (both 1-over), Lee Janzen (2-over), and Fred
Couples and Tom Watson (both 3-over). But Colin Montgomerie, at
5-over after a second-round 74, had catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's heavy fog that suspended first-round play, followed
by more fog that delayed Friday's start by more than an hour, only
wreaked more havoc with tournament proceedings. If there are more
weather delays, this could become one of the longest U.S. Open
tournaments in history. As it was, many players had to wake up at 4
a.m. and report to the golf course, only to find that the 6:30 a.m
start time had been pushed back.
</P>
<P>
   Those who finished the second round Friday and remained in
contention did well. Among those was Faldo, playing his best golf
in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it will lead to better things the rest of the
year,'' said Faldo, a six-time major winner who has not won since
February 1998. ``I'll learn from it, go back and analyze it, and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are really firming up. The wind is tricky. You've
got to really play great to keep the ball where you intend for it
to go. Every hole is tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent players were already out of contention _ Davis
Love III (12-over), who shot an 81, and Greg Norman (17-over), who
shot an 82. Both were certain to miss the second-round cut, which
was scheduled to be made sometime Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even those who did well had some bad holes. Triplett
reached 5-under par for the tournament after eight holes, but
bogeyed No. 9 and then double-bogeyed No. 10 when his approach shot
went into a hazard and onto the beach. Triplett also double-bogeyed
No. 13, but he regrouped to make birdie at No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the verge of throwing everything away,'' said
Triplett. ``But I was proud of the way I finished.''
</P>
<P>
   John Huston, who started the second round at four under,
recovered from a difficult start to reach the clubhouse at even par
(142) through 36 holes after a 75.
</P>
<P>
   Huston started the day at 4-under par, but he made a
triple-bogey at No. 2, a par 4 hole. His second shot at No. 2 found
a bunker, and when he hacked at the ball on his third shot it
barely moved. The next shot did not make it out of the bunker.
Then, after finally hitting his fifth shot onto the green, Huston
two-putted for a seven. But he also ended his day on a high note,
making a birdie on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all chasing Woods. And the weekend was certain to
be unpredictable, with the weather always a story, Woods playing
with confidence, and others trying to work their way into
contention.

SPRING 2000 TOPS AMERICA'S HEAT RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The United States panted through the hottest
spring on record this year. The National Climatic Data Center
announced the breaking of a 90-year-old national record Friday,
roughly three months after it reported that the winter of 1999-2000
set its own record for warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the mean temperature for the three months
was 55.5 Fahrenheit, or 0.4 degrees hotter than the previous record
set in 1910. It's also 3.3 degrees hotter than the average over the
106 years for which measurements exist.
</P>
<P>
   Of the past 106 springs in California, only 13 were hotter than
this year's. The historical average is 58.3 degrees. This year's
was 2.5 degrees hotter on average.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so amazing is that there was not a single state that
was below normal and we had 22 states that had their top 10 warmest
years,'' said Jay Lawrimore, a climatologist at the data center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrimore hesitated to play the information into the debate
whether man's activities are inordinately warming the planet, but
he said the continued warming trend presages ever more dramatic
consequences. Already seemingly contradictory phenomena such as
droughts and floods have delivered a one-two punch to parts of the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the natural oscillation in the climate and there's a
probability that global warming is magnifying the natural
oscillation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Redmond, regional climatologist at the Western Regional
Climate Center in Reno, Nev., pointed to earlier blooms of flowers
and earlier melting of the Sierra Nevada snowpack as evidence that
California springs has gradually gotten hotter over the past 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is sort of backing into winter,'' he said. ``The
current year works into that trend.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, declined to read a global warming scenario into the
long warming trend, but has no other answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look at the usual suspects like El Nino and La Nina, I
don't see anything that explains this,'' Redmond said. ``There's a
basket of question marks.''
</P>
<P>
   The warmth or chill of a season is determined in large part by
the strength of air blown into the country from the Arctic. Dan
Cayan, a climatologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said
the Arctic blasts happened to be weak this year and he cautioned
against reading too much into the record-setting spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not necessarily a global warming symptom, but it is a
situation that bears some consideration along those lines,'' Cayan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the data center announced its finding that the winter
of 1999-2000 set its own heat record, shattering a record set just
the year before.

CITY COUNCIL RECEIVES $4 MIL REQUEST FROM DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A formal request for $4 million in city funds was
made to the Los Angeles City Council on Friday to help bail out the
committee paying for the Democratic National Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   Council President John Ferraro introduced the proposal,
scheduled for consideration next Tuesday, saying it is important
for the city to present a good image.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set very high goals and I think they did well,'' Ferraro
said. ``But now is the time for the city to step forward. We don't
want to have an event that is embarrassment to the city with the
whole world watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Joel Wachs disagreed, saying he didn't believe
the city needed to provide any money for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention will go on whether we give this money or not,''
Wachs said. ``I can't believe the disconnect there is here in City
Hall with the rest of the city. We can't pay for sidewalks and now
they want us to pay for a bunch of parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs said his Public Works Committee has held hearings around
the city and it continues to receive the same complaints over the
need to repair streets and sidewalks, trim trees and provide other
governmental services.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we tell them we can't do the basics, but can find $4
million for this convention?'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the Host Committee, dated Friday, urged the city
to advance the money, saying the committee expects the convention
to generate $135 million for the city, and pointed to the financial
contributions from other cities that host conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago gave $7 million to the Democrats in 1996 and
Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania are contributing $7
million each to Republicans this year. New Jersey, which also will
benefit, is giving $3 million to the GOP, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles already has agreed to provide up to $7 million in
in-kind services - such as security and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   However, the letter signed by committee co-chairman Eli Broad
and chief executive Noelia Rodriguez said the committee still has a
$10 million gap for its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This includes not only its remaining cash obligation to the
DNCC (Democratic National Convention Committee), but also the Los
Angeles Community Celebration, the Media Festival, Volunteer
Appreciation Festival and other special projects,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the final preparations are made for this world-class event,
it is important for all parties to work together to maximize this
moment in Los Angeles' history.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential nominating convention, to be held Aug. 14-17 at
Staples Center, is expected to draw attendance of 35,000, including
delegates, media representatives and others. Protesters also plan
to descend upon the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sheriff Lee Baca wrote to the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors, telling them he has been asked by the Los
Angeles Police Department to help with security by having deputies
on the buses of delegates as they travel from their hotels to
various convention events.
</P>
<P>
   Baca took note of the riots that marked the World Trade
Organization meetings last November in Seattle and pointed out that
the convention offers a similar opportunity for disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the proposal
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most City Council members said Friday that they want to hear the
debate next week before deciding whether to support the spending
request.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Alex Padilla seconded the Ferraro motion and
Councilman Nate Holden said he thought it was appropriate for the
city to provide funding.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said she believed more
information was needed before she would support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they would be able to raise enough money,''
Miscikowski said. ``I'd like to know what they have done and what
they plan to do. I have a number of questions.''

 COURT RECORDS SHOW STANFORD DOCTORS' DATA SUSPECT  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL and WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two nationally acclaimed Stanford doctors may
have falsified data and omitted surgical complications in a medical
journal article describing a series of controversial operations
they performed on women eight years ago, according to court
documents released this week.
</P>
<P>
   A review of medical records of 16 women who were operated on by
Drs. Camran and Farr Nezhat and their colleagues in Atlanta in
1991-92 found discrepancies of ``the highest order'' when the
records were compared with an article the doctors wrote about the
surgeries and published in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   The Nezhats, who have practices in Palo Alto, Calif., and
Atlanta, claimed that the procedures they performed through
``minimally invasive surgery'' were superior to earlier surgical
techniques and would benefit as many as 185,000 women who suffer
from a medical condition called endometriosis of the rectum. In the
article, the Nezhats reported that ``no unusual short- or long-term
ill effects were evident.''
</P>
<P>
   But the review of the 16 cases found that the operating times
were twice as long as reported and that four of the women suffered
serious complications, including major blood loss, intestinal
injury and fecal incontinence, according to the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   During the past five years, 20 doctors and surgeons from around
the country have signed statements expressing concern about the
Nezhats' surgeries and published research and have called for an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians have called the procedures ``bizarre'' and
``barbaric'' experiments and have charged that they were performed
on vulnerable women without sufficient consent.
</P>
<P>
   The sworn affidavits, based on a review of 4,510 pages of
medical records, were filed by Drs. Nick Spirtos and Tom Margolis
earlier this year as part of a medical malpractice lawsuit in
Fulton County Court in Atlanta. Spirtos and Margolis are serving as
unpaid expert witnesses for the plaintiff in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors, who, like the Nezhats, are voluntary faculty at
Stanford Medical School, have been frequent critics of the Nezhat
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In their affidavits to the court, Spirtos and Margolis said:
``Either the 16 records submitted for review are different patients
than the ones reported in the Surgical Laparoscopy and Endoscopy
article of September 1992, or they are the same patients, which
would make the article data flagrantly fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Judge Melvin Westmoreland unsealed the affidavits
without comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spirtos and Margolis asked the court to allow their audit of the
records to be released because they felt ``an ethical
responsibility to communicate this information to the medical
community due to the continued risk to the public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a response filed Friday with the court, attorneys for the
Nezhats charged that Spirtos and Margolis have ``a long history of
personal and economically motivated bias and antagonism directed
toward the Nezhats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The affidavits are so rife with false statements that one must
wonder whether Drs. Spirtos and Margolis were truthful even in
stating that they had reviewed the records.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite allegations that they conducted unethical and fraudulent
medical research, the Nezhats enjoy strong support from Stanford
University Medical School, where the brothers are clinical
professors.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have insisted that all allegations against
the Nezhats have been thoroughly investigated and that no
misconduct has been found. Indeed, 58 Stanford physicians recently
wrote a letter to The Chronicle declaring that the Nezhats ``have
brought with them a standard of surgical excellence,
professionalism and integrity that we have admired and that has
enriched our community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford officials acknowledge that they have never reviewed
the records of the controversial 16-patient series of surgeries.
Nor have they asked the Nezhats for the records so that they could
be compared with the journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Stanford attorney Deborah Zumwalt said university
officials would be interested in looking at Spirtos' and Margolis'
affidavits. ``We'll look at anything anyone has done to review the
records,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are interested in what the results are. It is hard
to tell what's going on without the underlying records. We're
concerned with assuring the best in care of our patients. We've
always been concerned with accuracy of research.''
</P>
<P>
   The series of operations on the 16 women involved laparoscopic
surgery, the use of long-stemmed instruments worked inside the body
through dime-sized incisions. The Nezhats are internationally
recognized pioneers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The patients were treated for severe endometriosis of the
rectum, a condition in which uterine cells migrate and bind to the
lower colon, causing debilitating pain.
</P>
<P>
   During the operations, Camran Nezhat and his brother Farr, with
colorectal surgeon Dr. Earl Pennington assisting, spent hours using
laparoscopic techniques to remove endometrial tissue from the
women's bowels.
</P>
<P>
   In the September 1992 article about the surgeries, Nezhat and
his colleagues wrote that all patients ``tolerated the procedure
well, with no major intraoperative or postoperative complications
noted.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the affidavits, three women suffered
hemorrhage, one required a second operation on her ureter (the tube
from the kidney to the bladder), and another suffered bowel
ischemia, a cutoff of blood supply to part of her intestines.
Doctors had to perform an ileostomy on that patient, a temporary
bypass of the intestine that pipes the contents of the bowel into a
plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the authors reported ``no visceral injuries'' among the
patients and suggested that ``the positive results in these first
cases lead us to believe that this procedure will be recommended
for additional patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the complications omitted from the published
report, the affidavits disclosed a number of significant
discrepancies:
</P>
<P>
   -- In the article, the average operating time per surgery
reported by the Nezhats was slightly longer than three hours.
According to the affidavits, the average operating time reflected
in the records is about six hours, ``with patients undergoing
surgical procedures lasting 8.5 hours and 10 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The authors claimed in the article that the average blood
loss was 77 cubic centimeters, with the exception of one patient
who lost 400 cc. But the review of the medical records found three
patients with losses of 1,800 cc, 1,200 cc and 800-1,000 cc,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cases,'' the affidavits said, ``(required) either
transfusion or the use of cell saver.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The article reported an average length of hospital stay of
3.4 days. The actual average stay was 4.8 days, Spirtos and
Margolis said.
</P>
<P>
   The operations, however, were declared a success by the Nezhats
and Pennington in the journal article.
</P>
<P>
   In press releases and presentations at medical conferences
sponsored by Ethicon, the company that manufactured the surgical
instruments used in the surgeries, the Nezhats promoted the
procedure as a means of bringing relief to tens of thousands of
women.
</P>
<P>
   In their written response, Nezhat lawyers Henry Green and David
Walbert accused Spirtos and Margolis of filing affidavits ``replete
with serious distortions and outright falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys wrote that the complications reported in the
patients' records routinely occur in bowel surgery and would not be
normally reported in the journal article. They also cited anal
incontinence and bowel dysfunction as common and temporary symptoms
of such surgery and not complications.
</P>
<P>
   They denied that any patients had to be readmitted as a
consequence of the procedures or that the length of hospital stay
was misreported by the Nezhats. The blood loss was normal for such
abdominal surgery, and the larger losses of blood were caused by
other procedures performed during the surgeries, not the rectal
procedures, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Miller, a Texas gynecologist who has published
extensively in medical journals, said the affidavits raise serious
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these complications (as stated in the affidavits) are true,
they should have been reported. This appears to be fraud,'' said
Miller, a cancer specialist who is director of gynecologic oncology
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say you operated only two or three hours and the
evidence shows it is much longer, that is very serious
misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Grimes, a former chief of obstetrics and gynecology at
San Francisco General Hospital who briefly served as a paid expert
witness for the plaintiff in the malpractice case, said the
affidavits, coupled with previous testimony by Camran Nezhat that
described a record-keeping system that cannot directly link patient
records to journal articles, raise ``troubling concerns about the
validity of all Nezhat research and claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicist Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for
Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said it would be
appropriate for Stanford to request to see the underlying medical
records at issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had physicians in my faculty embroiled in a major
research controversy, I'd feel obligated that Stanford's interests
and standards were protected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The records lie at the heart of a 7-year-old malpractice case
brought against the Nezhats and Northside Hospital in Atlanta by
Stacey Mullen, a California woman who contends that she was maimed
by the doctors in a similar procedure, which she calls an
unauthorized experiment gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, 39, argues in her lawsuit that she suffered severe
complications as a result of the surgery, which ultimately required
her to undergo a colostomy, a permanent operation that requires her
to use a surgically implanted tube in her side to have a bowel
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen's case, however, was not included in either the medical
journal report, even though she underwent the procedure during the
same time as the surgeries described in the article.
</P>
<P>
   The Nezhats contend that Mullen's case was excluded from the
article because her surgery was not experimental and because
subsequent pathology reports determined she did not have rectal
endometriosis in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Through their attorney, the Nezhats said Mullen's surgery did
not cause her bowel problems, which they say predated her
operations in the Atlanta hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Spirtos and Margolis were among five medical experts who were
given copies of the 16 patient records after Judge Westmoreland
agreed in December to allow Mullen's attorneys to view them.
</P>
<P>
   Spirtos said he believes most of the large body of research
published by the Nezhats is fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn 1994 affidavit, Camran Nezhat described a medical
record filing system with 20,000 patients, each listed only
alphabetically, with no index, no computer database and no
cross-referencing by type of treatment, surgery performed or
journal publication.
</P>
<P>
   Spirtos and other skeptics insist that such a record-keeping
system would make it virtually impossible to produce the kind of
research the Nezhats have regularly published, which purports to
link charts and data involving hundreds of patients treated as far
back as 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the affidavits, Miller said that if he published a
journal he would go back and ``critically evaluate'' everything
that the Nezhats published before allowing them to write for his
journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you publish results,'' he said, ``you should have the
records that substantiate everything you publish.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, four tourists from Texas
left the galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and began to
make their way through the crowds gathering for the National Puerto
Rican Day Parade along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   They were petite, middle-aged women, and they said they were
made uncomfortable by the odor of marijuana and alcohol. Clutching
their purses, avoiding eye contact, searching for a quick escape,
they said they headed for an opening between two groups of young
men, perhaps 20 in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they started patting our bottoms,'' said Sharon Brown,
52, a retired school teacher. ``Then they started spitting in their
hands and then rubbing it in our hair. And then the hitting got
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers lined Fifth Avenue, but Brown said that not one
tried to stop the humiliation. Maybe, Brown offered, they did not
see what had happened. But, she added, ``They really didn't appear
to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Richard Walsh, a 43-year-old businessman, was
running laps around the Central Park reservoir, which is near Fifth
Avenue, when he noticed several young men spraying water on women
and yelling lewd insults at them. On three consecutive laps, Walsh
said, he alerted a nearby contingent of some 40 police officers
taking cover in the shade to what was happening. The officers, he
said, never budged in the 90-degree heat, and the young men
continued to menace women.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the worst of the violence broke out at the fringes
of this year's Puerto Rican Day Parade, the central elements of
trouble were already starting to gel in dangerous and unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a thundercloud is fueled by moisture and heat, Sunday's
wild, uncontrolled mob attacks on women in Central Park appeared to
be fueled by an alchemy of alcohol, marijuana, oppressive weather,
testosterone and lapses in police strategy, tactics and
communication.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ embarrassingly displayed to a worldwide audience,
thanks to grainy amateur videos _ was a day of simply awful terror
for 47 women and an ironic black eye for a police force more often
criticized for being overly aggressive. For days now, city
officials have struggled to explain the sight of weeping,
beer-soaked women stumbling out of the park after being robbed,
groped and stripped bare in one of the most well-policed areas of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   As more victims and eyewitness accounts have surfaced, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and other top police officials have rapidly
retreated from early statements that seemed to minimize the
violence and exonerate the Police Department's handling of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Even as detectives continue to round up suspects _ eight more
were arrested Friday, bringing the total to 16 _ another police
investigation is focusing on how the 4,000 police officers assigned
to the parade were deployed, when officers were sent home, and how
senior commanders communicated with one another about the movements
of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to critique this very closely to make sure that it
doesn't happen in the future,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Any examination of the department's performance during and after
the parade will have to try to reconcile a certain indisputable
level of enforcement _ the department wrote hundreds of citations
for public drinking, which is illegal _ with a widespread sense
among people at and around the parade that gross misconduct went
virtually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   All week, for instance, city officials have battled direct or
implicit allegations that the police deliberately took a hands-off
approach because of the department's tense relations with minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has strongly disputed this notion, and police officials
have provided statistics showing, if anything, a history of
somewhat tougher enforcement. During this year's St. Patrick's Day
Parade, for example, police confiscated 200 open alcohol
containers, compared with 2,601 confiscations during this year's
Puerto Rican parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're in a period of time in which the police can't
win,'' Giuliani said Friday on his weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said there was no letup this year, and
according to police figures, officers issued hundreds more
summonses for petty crimes and noise complaints than they did at
last year's parade.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``a lot of complaints fairly recently that the
police have become too strict in quality of life enforcement,'' one
police official said. ``That in my mind is one of the main things
that keeps the control of various types of events, such as parades,
such as New Year's Eve in Times Square. The enforcement is
necessary. That helps to set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a growing number of witnesses, police officers
failed again and again on Sunday to provide even the mildest of
responses to scenes of obvious disorder and lawlessness. What's
more, several witnesses have alleged in interviews this week, some
officers failed to react to specific complaints about women being
mistreated and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it normal to just turn the city over to those kinds of
people?'' asked Brown of Texas, expressing one common view.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department reported that it made one marijuana arrest
during the parade and confiscated 16 bags of marijuana. But many
witnesses described dozens, if not hundreds, of people openly
smoking marijuana, many of them in plain view of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about second-hand smoke, that's how bad it
was,'' said one 37-year-old jogger, recalling her run through
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman, denied
those claims, arguing that it did not make sense for officers to
ignore blatant drug use. ``If I have a parade detail and I walk my
route and smell marijuana, I'd go ballistic,'' he said. ``Why?
Because I know my boss is going to come along soon, and if he
smells something, he's going to ask me what the hell I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Special police teams, each with 24 officers, roved along the
parade route, confiscating open alcohol containers and writing
summonses, but many thousands more teen-agers and young people
clearly drank alcohol with impunity, many people at the parade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some men circulated in the crowds openly hawking miniature
bottles of rum and vodka. ``There was alcohol all over the street,
bottles of liquor, people offering shots,'' said Nathan Poe, 27, a
Web site developer from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said that officers sometimes decide, quite properly, that
it is a better use of their time to direct traffic than to go after
someone with an open can of beer. But police officials have
acknowledged in interviews that the department's tactical and
strategic decisions contributed to a set of circumstances that
permitted some of the worst incidents of violence to go forward
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the most serious string of assaults, those
that happened inside the park on Center Drive, just north of the
intersection of Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas,
also known as Sixth Avenue. Roughly half the assaults occurred
there during a frenzy of attacks about 6 p.m., police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that 950 officers were deployed
inside Central Park during the parade, 120 more than last year. But
none, they now say, were assigned to cover the stretch of Center
Drive where the assaults took place. The 10 or so amateur videos
that have surfaced thus far seem to support that point: No
uniformed officers can be seen in the crowd on Center Drive, senior
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, this could be seen as a crucial oversight on the
part of police commanders. But police officials said that they
deployed officers based on their analysis of past trouble spots,
and that analysis, they said, is why the vast majority of the 950
officers were stationed along the eastern edge of the park, by the
parade route itself.
</P>
<P>
   A number of parade veterans, though, have said Central Park
South has for years been the scene of a kind of rowdy overspill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at least six people _ including hot-dog vendors,
doormen, store employees, victims _ recalled seeing between 5 and
10 police officers positioned in and around the intersection of
Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas. And from that
intersection the officers could have had a clear view of the mob
some 30 to 70 yards away on Center Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, though, a vagary in the Police Department's
deployment worked against the victims. Central Park South marks the
dividing line between the Manhattan North zone, which includes
Central Park, and the Manhattan South zone, which covers everything
below the park _ including Central Park South itself.
</P>
<P>
   And according to police officials, as the parade wound down,
senior commanders in Manhattan South began sending their officers
home after a long, hot day on the street. As best as police
officials can determine at this point, it appears that most of the
extra officers at the crucial intersection may have been pulled out
at roughly the time that the mob violence was starting to rapidly
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a riot going on,'' Fahey said. ``We did what we
always do. The parade was over, we waited an hour, and we let some
of the officers go home. We didn't know about what was going on in
the park off Sixth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at the moment when things began to spiral out of
control, the area of greatest menace was virtually empty of police
protection.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, then, for the mix of police bad luck and
emboldened, brutish young men to yield disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the Avenue of the Americas has been a
popular gathering spot for young people both during and after the
parade _ a kind of parade off the main parade. Young motorcyclists
gun their tires so that great clouds of burning rubber fill the
street, primping teen-agers hang out of car windows, waving flags,
and gang members in do-rags flash hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 5:15 p.m., still above 90 degrees, when a burly
young man stole a bag of ice from an ice van that had stopped on
the Avenue of Americas just south of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man, a distinctive figure with a lion's face
tattooed across his bare back and the words Puerto Rico shaved into
the back of his head, began pressing the ice bag against the backs
of young women. Someone punctured the ice bag, and young men began
dropping ice cubes down women's shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Several women laughed and smiled and sassed the young men. But
at least one woman grew angry when men surrounded her and trapped
her against a storefront, dousing her with water, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several police officers in the area, and one, a
supervisor in a white shirt, was seen leading off a young man who
had been involved in the ice cube horseplay. Things quieted for a
bit, but then the group re-formed just inside the park, on Center
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Now self-appointed ``scouts'' began to signal to the larger
group when they spotted women who fit their calculus of sexual
appeal, witnesses said. ``Yo, yo, here comes a good one!'' they
would call out, witnesses said, as unsuspecting women approached.
Several older women got through. For the young and attractive,
nearby fences helped form a natural chute into which they were
steered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had no idea what they were entering until it was
too late. Men would close around them from all sides, spraying
water on their heads, their backs, everywhere. The men, when their
water bottles and squirt guns ran dry, simply filled them back up
from a water trough used by the horses that pull carriages through
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Some women said they tried to stay near their friends, but they
were quickly separated by the crowd. So they screamed their
friends' names, to no avail. Some women tried to run, only to be
chased down and surrounded once more.
</P>
<P>
   There was yelling of ``Get 'em, get 'em,'' and chants of ``Go,
go, go,'' and misogynistic curses, witnesses said, and more young
men joined the mob _ men who wore crucifixes. And some of these men
began to tear at shirts, to pull on bras, to tug on shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The women, of course, fought to stay clothed. They clutched torn
shirts to their chests, and they tried to swat sweaty hands away
from their straps and zippers. But they were hopelessly
outnumbered, and several of them suddenly found themselves half
naked in a bleary, swirling crowd of strange men. Even then, the
women tried to hold their arms across their chests, and yet men
pulled at their arms, too. Ashanna Cover, 21, of New Jersey,
recalled that a man squeezed her breast so hard that it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, hair matted with beer and water, her top torn
off, huddled against a wall, and still men tried to grope at her.
Some women said they were groped and grabbed and prodded so
violently that their genitals were scratched and bruised. Some
women began to fear that they were going to be gang raped right
there in the shadow of Trump Parc, right there inside the crown
jewel of New York City. Some feared they were about to be trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Abrams, a 42-year-old Web site designer, said she remembered
screams of, ``Yeah! Yeah! Get her!''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, who was pulled to the ground off her in-line
skates, curled up in a fetal position. She said the men, hooting
and giggling, would yank her shorts down to her thighs, and she
would yank them back up. Over and over this happened, even as she
kicked and thrashed with her skates.
</P>
<P>
   More men were drawn to the mob. Some took pictures. Some took
videos. Police said some robbed the women of cell phones, purses,
jewelry. Some surged closer to get a peek at what they could. Every
now and then, a man would tell another man to cool it, to back off,
but only every now and then, and not a single one among them dialed
911 to summon help.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some men had strangely bored looks on their faces, as
if what they were watching was a tired Jerry Springer rerun,
according to people in the park. It was as if the crowd had turned
a patch of Central Park into an outdoor version of Scores, the
notorious strip club. Only it was worse; there were no bouncers to
protect the women.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, stripped naked, managed to make it to the safety of a
small, three-wheeled police scooter, and still men converged on the
scooter to get a look. Watching from just across the street was
Rita Berlin, 26, manager of the Whiskey Park, an upscale bar at 100
Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin said she had enduring unrelenting harassment as she
pushed through unruly and drunken street crowds late Sunday
afternoon to get to work. Now, as she watched the poor naked woman,
as she wondered why there were not more police officers about, she
felt a deep sense of shame and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she said later, ``was the worst day I have ever seen
in New York in my entire life _ the trash, the people, the complete
disregard for anything.''

 TAX-CUT DISPUTE DELAYS PASSAGE OF STATE BUDGET  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Attempts to pass the state budget stalled early
Friday morning because Assembly Republicans don't want $850 million
in new tax cuts to wipe out an old tax cut to reduce vehicle
license fees.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut debate torpedoed Democratic efforts to send a $95
billion spending plan to Gov. Gray Davis before the midnight
deadline Thursday for legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the taxpayers should be paying for their own
tax cut, which in essence is what would have happened if we didn't
object,'' said George Runner of Lancaster, the Assembly's chief
budget negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their Senate counterparts, who helped pass a budget
Thursday morning on a bipartisan 31-to-9 vote, Assembly Republicans
voted as a bloc to stop Democrats from reaching the two-thirds
majority needed to approve a spending plan for the fiscal year that
begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Their stated reason for doing so lies in the mechanics of a cut
in the vehicle license fee approved by Davis' GOP predecessor and
the Democratic majority Legislature in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agreed to a 75 percent cut in the license fees that
California's 23 million vehicle owners pay every year, phased in
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The cut began with an initial 25 percent decrease that would
grow over time, if the state had enough revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis accelerated the effective date of another 10
percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   What caused Assembly Republicans to object this week is a caveat
in the license fee cut that says new tax cuts might cancel out the
license fees.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say legislative Democrats reneged on a pledge that
such a thing would not happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers this year said that $850 million of the new
budget's $2.7 billion in tax cuts not only would cancel out another
10 percent decrease in license fees scheduled for 2002 but would
slash the existing 35 percent cut to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, told reporters Thursday, ``If I had my
druthers, no tax relief we provide would impact on any tax relief
provided before.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner said by early Friday morning _ the Assembly quit at 2
a.m. _ a deal was struck with Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg,
D-Sherman Oaks, that would make the new tax cuts not count against
the next scheduled license fee cut.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CALBUDGE (15234 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But, Runner said, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, could not be found to make sure he agreed to such a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I run both houses?'' Burton said in an interview, adding
that he opposes whatever deal the Assembly is working out on the
license fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is: We passed a budget, 31 to 9,'' he said. ``They
don't want to pass a budget _ that's their problem. You can't have
tax cuts on tax cuts on tax cuts because eventually you end up with
no money to spend on other programs like education.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats have a different version of the deal than
Runner. They said they offered to correct the license fee problem
in return for Assembly Republicans voting for the budget, a
commitment Republicans refused to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wondering what the real problem is,'' said Paul Hefner,
Hertzberg's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Runner also said Assembly Republicans are not enamored of a $224
million tax cut proposed by Davis that would reduce each of the
state's tax brackets by 0.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the tax savings would be reaped by
Californians earning $100,000 or more a year. And even that relief
would not be much, Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you earn $60,000 you would get something like $7 in
savings,'' said Runner. ``If you earn $250,000 you get maybe $250.
Neither of those groups really needs that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner said his caucus was ``evaluating'' the income tax cut _
and he recommended Democrats do the same in light of the cut's main
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly will take up the budget again on Monday.

ONE LAST BEAR HUG FOR NICKLAUS, FANS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ As the mists drifted in over the 18th
hole late Friday afternoon at Pebble Beach Golf Links, Jack
Nicklaus faded out, finishing at 11-over-par 82 to miss the cut in
his 44th and probably final U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Bear didn't go without one final roar - knocking a
3-wood 245 yards to reach the green in two shots and set up an
eagle putt on that 543-yard, par-5 hole.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be. Nicklaus couldn't even get birdie, settling
for a tap-in par for his highest total in 160 Open rounds. He
stared at the ball on the lip of the cup and then shrugged at the
heavens, as if in agreement that perhaps it was time for his
lengthy Open odyssey to end.
</P>
<P>
   What a journey it was. No one has played in more U.S. Opens than
Nicklaus, who has won four of them - including the first held at
Pebble Beach, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   His dramatic 1-iron tee shot to within two inches of the
flagstick on No. 17 cemented that win, but there was comparable
drama in his other Open victories. He set tournament records at
Baltusrol twice - 275 in 1967 and 272 in 1980 - and upset Arnold
Palmer on the King's home turf at Oakmont for his first Open title
at age 22 in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He exits with an Open legacy that could be measured by the size
of the roar that went up on No. 18 Friday, when a 60-year-old man
set up an eagle putt worth no more than an 80. Nicklaus appreciated
the show of support that left him misty-eyed. He claimed later with
a wink it was the wind but 'fessed up in a final press conference
that produced a rare round of applause from the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I get emotional,'' Nicklaus said ``Absolutely. It's
difficult ... knowing it will probably be the last time you're
going to come up a U.S. Open fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's fairly certain this was his last:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the chances would be very slim if I would ever play
(the Open) again,'' said Nicklaus, who will miss the experience not
for the memories but for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open to me is a complete examination of a golfer,''
he said. ``The competition, what it does for you, how hard it is to
work at it, how hard it is to make it happen. When the conditions
aren't your conditions, you have to persevere and work at it - I
enjoy that. I enjoy the punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   He wished only that he could have worked at it two more days
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still dumb enough, I guess, whatever you might want to
say, to think that .... I was thinking that I could play well
enough to compete in this tournament. Maybe I still feel that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   As late as the eighth hole Friday, Nicklaus felt in contention
to make the cut. Then, ``I hit three shots as good as I could hit
them and walked away with a double bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a matter of sniffing the flowers from the rest of a round
in which Nicklaus said he hit the ball well but ``couldn't get it
on the green, couldn't make a par.'' In the end, he had to settle
for the memories of past Opens and Pebble Beach, where Nicklaus
also won his second U.S. Amateur in 1961 and won Crosby National
Pro-Ams in 1967, 1972 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Pebble Beach,'' he said, ``even shooting 82
</P>
<P>
   what difference does it make what I shot? The place sort of
started in many ways my golf game .... almost 40 years later, it's
a pretty fitting place to stop.''

LONG DELAY DRAINS GOLFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It wound up more sweeter for some than
others, but Friday's second-round yawner in the 100th U.S. Open was
draining on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The problem started with fog that rolled in Thursday afternoon
and prevented 75 players from completing first-round play at Pebble
Beach Golf Links. That set up the second-round long day's journey
into nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard work,'' said England's Nick Faldo, who finished
5-over par for his 23 holes Friday and almost certainly will make
the cut with his 69-74-143. But he never worked so long in any of
the 48 previous rounds he had played in U.S. Opens, completing his
second round 11 hours after he arrived at the course Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up at 4 (a.m.) and I was out in position at 6:45. Then
they all came back in again.''
</P>
<P>
   They came back because the fog came back, pushing resumption of
first-round play back to 7:45, then 8:15, when play finally resumed
and concluded with no further weather interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 - three hours after its originally scheduled starting
time - second-round play got underway, making historical footnotes
out of Ken Krieger, Rick Heath and Rodney Butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the final tee time of the second round, they
stepped to the first tee at 8 p.m - 37 hours after they launched
this championship on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The delay proved more costly to Jack Nicklaus, the 60-year-old
Hall of Famer who had to play 27 holes Friday in what was likely
his last U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In contention to make the cut at 1-over par through nine holes
when play was halted Thursday, Nicklaus finished his first round at
2-over 73 but slumped to 82 in his belated second round and wound
up 13-over 155, missing the cut for only the ninth time in a record
44 consecutive appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the greens got so hard overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Costan, a 44-year-old qualifier who has run a golf academy
for the past six years, found himself near the leaders after
finishing his interrupted round at 70, but he said it was a
difficult proposition:
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay was challenging, especially when you're playing
well,'' Costan said. ``I was kind of in a groove, so it was tough
not to finish the round.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the most of the delay, sinking a par-saving putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated, very elated,'' he said. ``I'll remember that putt
forever.'' Perhaps because it seemed to take forever for him to get
to the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin wound up happy with his position after shooting 68 in
his interrupted round, but slipped to 78 in the delayed second
round. Sitting at 146, he will have to sweat out today's continued
second-round play to see if the projected cut score of 149 holds
up, or if he will go home early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tough part is getting up at four o'clock,'' Irwin said. `I
don't usually see four o'clock very often. You know I'm on the
senior tour. We have those nice, relaxed starting times.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts, who also shot 68 in his interrupted round, said
afterward he ``thought it was a nice break because the golf course
is very playable right now,'' then went out and shot 78 in his
second round to join Irwin among the worried waiting.
</P>
<P>
   They'll wait for 56 more golfers to finish today - 10 of them
having completed only five holes - in a tournament that could
extend into Sunday due to the twosome format the USGA uses for the
final two rounds of the Open.

5 NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS FACE DISCIPLINE AFTER PARADE MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Updates throughout with new arrest)  
 (With NY-PARK-CRIME)  
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Friday that as
many as five officers would probably be disciplined for failing to
respond properly to people who complained about a group of men
attacking women in and around Central Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Safir also announced eight more arrests in the attacks, which
occurred after the National Puerto Rican Day parade, bringing to 16
the total number of young men arrested after the frenzy of sexual
assaults, including seven who turned themselves in after seeing
their pictures broadcast on television or published in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have also identified 14 more suspects being sought in
the attacks, in which men poured ice and water on dozens of women,
tore at their clothes and groped their breasts and buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives continued to hunt for the attackers, investigators
from the department's Internal Affairs Bureau pursued their own
inquiry, looking into complaints that some officers failed to
respond properly to people who notified them of the roving bands of
men. By late Friday, department investigators had questioned more
than 100 officers, mostly supervisors, a senior investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prejudging, my sense is that we will probably find
four or five police officers who acted inappropriately, while the
vast majority acted appropriately,'' Safir said. ``Those who acted
inappropriately will be subject to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator said that the Internal Affairs Bureau
had identified three or four officers who they said they believed
had acted improperly, and said they were close to identifying one
or two others. The official said it was possible that one or more
of the officers would face dismissal, but called that possibility
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   One of the police officers who has become a focus of the inquiry
was assigned to a traffic detail and was seen on a videotape on
which a man who is not visible is upbraiding him for failing to
take some action, a senior police official said. But the
investigation has not yet determined whether the officer had failed
to take any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is identification,'' the official said.
``We have to be clear who was where.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator pointed out that if the Internal Affairs
Bureau determines that an officer behaved improperly, the
department would bring administrative charges against the officer,
who would then be tried before an administrative law judge. The
judge's recommendation would be given to the police commissioner,
who makes the final decision on departmental discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that of the seven victims who reported their assaults
to police immediately after the incident, two complained about the
officers and five praised their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The eight suspects arrested Friday were Julio Delacruz, 22, of
7717 Bergenline Ave. in North Bergen, N.J.; Isaiah Forbes, 18, of
119 Beach 56th St., Queens; Mark Daniels, 21, of 67 Harrison Place
in Irvington, N.J.; Anthony Bryant, 25, of 312 Delancey St. in
Manhattan; Leslie Marcano, 19, of 995 Simpson St. in the Bronx;
Soto Jensen, 16, of 99 Varet St., Brooklyn; Trevor Britton, 29, of
1401 East New York Ave., Brooklyn and David Gar- cia, 33, of 2406
Grand Avenue in the Bronx. The police said all would be charged
with first-degree sexual abuse and and first-degree riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can tell you is there is no pattern here as far as
groups of people who are associated with each other,'' Safir said.
``This appears to be something that happened relatively
spontaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also urged the other men involved in the attacks to turn
themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked the public for its cooperation, saying the
department's release of photographs of the suspects, lifted from 10
amateur videotape recordings, prompted scores of calls to the
city's Crime Stoppers phone line. One tip came from as far away as
Italy, where someone who had been in New York on Sunday sent an
e-mail to the police with what Safir said was helpful information.
</P>
<P>
   The new suspects whose photographs were released Friday had all
been identified by one or more of the 47 victims who the police
said had been molested, and in some cases, assaulted or robbed.  &QL;

 RECORD HOT SPRING FUELS GLOBAL WARMING DEBATE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Spring 2000 has been the warmest on record in the United States,
government climate trackers reported Friday.
<P>
   Adding one more bit of fuel to the debate over global warming,
the National Climatic Data Center reported the national average
temperature from March to May was a balmy 55.5 degrees _ 3.3
degrees above the norm for the past 105 years and beating the
record of 55.1 set in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   All the 48 contiguous states experienced warmer-than-normal
temperatures for the three-month period. The pattern was
particularly notable in California and much of the West, where the
lilacs and honeysuckle have been blooming earlier and earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite amazing,'' said Kelly Redmond, deputy director and
regional climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Center in
Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the La Nina phenomenon, which has been lingering
in the equatorial Pacific, produces shifts in sea surface
temperatures and wind patterns that usually translate into
cooler-than-normal temperatures for big sections of the country,
particularly north of the Bay Area on up into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that effect appears to have been wiped out for
reasons scientists cannot explain _ at least not to everybody's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a La Nina year, it's been rather out of character,''
Redmond said. ``It certainly has been warm through much of the
western region.''
</P>
<P>
   Average temperatures in 23 states this spring ranked within
their top 10 warmest springs in 106 years of record-keeping. Texas
had its warmest spring on record, while New Mexico had its
second-warmest since records began in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   California and Nevada averaged 56.0 degrees, 3.4 degrees above
the norm, while the Northwest region _ including Washington, Oregon
and Idaho _ showed a 47.4 degree average for the three months,
compared with a 45.3 degree norm.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it strictly a springtime phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The new data _ based on preliminary readings from 344 `'climate
divisions'' nationwide _ showed a record temperature of 48.5
degrees for the five-month period from January through May. The old
record was 47.4 degrees set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The data came from the Climatic Data Center located in
Asheville, N.C., which is part of the federal National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. The Western regional weather center in
Reno, which is financed by NOAA, is part of the independent Desert
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on all sides of the global-warming issue cautioned
against jumping to any conclusions. In fact, global data for this
year so far showed the worldwide temperatures have been 0.07 degree
below average, apparently due to the cooler-than-normal Pacific
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those concerned about potential cataclysmic climate
shifts due to human activity saw Friday's numbers as one more
telling piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly consistent with the projections of global
warming that are being made,'' said Peter Frumhoff, director of
global resources at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean this particular episode is direct evidence
of global warming, but it's consistent with the trend over time,''
he added. ``The fingerprint of global warming is beginning to
emerge from the noise of natural climate variability.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some ``conservative projections'' show California
in line for a 4 to 6 degree warming shift by 2030, which could
bring more rain than snow at lower elevations in the mountains,
increase wildfire hazards and produce some profound biological
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Dire forecasts aside, the increasingly predominant view among
scientists is that warming trends are indeed showing up, and are
likely to be at least partly due to human activity, most notably
the burning of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   But global warming critics remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas Friday, H. Sterling Burnett, senior policy analyst at
the National Center for Policy Analysis, a think tank that promotes
private-sector solutions to public policy issues, spoke of enjoying
cool 80-85 degree days around his North Texas lakeside home,
ordinarily sunbaked this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we were in the 100s in May, and we haven't
broken 95 this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers, he added, ``are just a bit of evidence, and
there is other evidence on all sides. One particular three-month
period does not stand out as particularly telling to me.''
</P>

 ASTRONOMERS SAY THEY'VE FOUND SUGAR MOLECULE INSIDE THE MILKY WAY  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers hunting for radio signals far out in space have
discovered the first molecules of sugar inside a huge cloud of dust
and gas near the center of the Milky Way galaxy, they reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery makes it increasingly likely that the chemical
precursors of life formed long before planets developed around
their parent suns, said Jan M. Hollis of NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., the leader of the research team.
</P>
<P>
   The sugar molecule, called glucolaldehyde, is a simple one,
composed of only eight atoms containing carbon, oxygen and
hydrogen. But its importance lies in the fact that it can combine
with other molecules to form more complex sugars, such as ribose
and glucose. Ribose, in turn, is a building block of RNA and DNA,
the genetic material that is the basis of all living organisms,
Hollis noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery may be an important key to understanding the
formation of life on the early Earth,'' said Philip R. Jewell of
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W.Va.,
another member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Hollis and Jewell, together with Frank J. Lovas of the
University of Illinois, detected evidence of the sugar molecule in
signals from the National Science Foundation's 12-meter radio
telescope atop Kitt Peak near Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Organic molecules reveal their presence as they tumble
end-for-end in space emitting faint radio waves at precise
frequencies that differ with each molecule. More than 100 of them
have been discovered during the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The radio frequencies identifying the sugar molecules were
detected in the giant star-forming cloud of gas and dust known as
Sagittarius North, 26,000 light-years away, the astronomers
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The interstellar molecular clouds are extremely rarefied
compared with clouds that form in Earth's atmosphere, and they can
be many light-years across. But they are the sites of increasingly
complex chemical reactions that occur over hundreds of thousands
and even millions of years, Hollis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding glucolaldehyde in one of these interstellar clouds
means that such molecules can be formed even in very rarefied
conditions,'' Hollis said. ``We don't yet understand how the
glucolaldehyde could be formed there,'' he added, and it will take
more astronomical observations ``and theoretical chemistry work''
to solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The three astronomers have submitted a full report on their
discovery to the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

AGBAYANI HITS THIRD STRAIGHT HOME RUN AS METS BLAST BREWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The New York Mets do not want Benny Agbayani to be
satisfied with his role _ and he is not. Agbayani is among the
group of Mets who get just enough starts to taste regular playing
time, but not enough to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   He is caught between being an everyday player and a forgotten
man on the bench, and he knows that when he starts, he must
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani hit home runs in his last two at-bats against the
Chicago Cubs on Wednesday, and he homered Friday night to lead off
the game in the Mets' 7-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. He
became the first Met since Gary Carter in 1986 to hit home runs in
three consecutive at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Agbayani added a two-run single to give
the Mets a 3-0 lead and give Al Leiter more than enough run
support. The Mets won for the 11th time in 12 starts by Leiter, who
improved his record to 8-1 by working eight innings, allowing three
hits and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   After his game against the Cubs _ a command performance, with
one home run landing on the center field backdrop and the other on
Waveland Avenue beyond left field _ Agbayani was asked if he
thought he would get more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say so, because of what I've been through
this whole year,'' he said. ``Any way I can help the team, that's
what I'm going to do. I really want to play, but I don't have
control over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani started eight of nine games on a road trip at the end
of May. But he batted .214 (6 for 28), with no extra-base hits, and
when the Mets returned home, Agbayani sat, not starting the next
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had an off day on Thursday, but manager Bobby Valentine
said he wanted to try to capitalize on Agbayani's Wednesday
performance by starting him Friday night _ and batting him leadoff.
``We'll keep him a little hot while we can,'' said Valentine, who
planned to put Jason Tyner back in left field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After Agbayani smashed a curveball from Jimmy Haynes (7-5) over
the left field fence in the first inning, the Mets loaded the bases
with one out. But Todd Zeile, the Mets' hottest hitter lately,
grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (36-28) went right to work in the second, when Jay
Payton singled and Melvin Mora reached on an error. Two batters
later, Agbayani singled the runners home, and the Mets again loaded
the bases but could not convert. Payton singled again in the third,
and Mora doubled him in to give the Mets a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Woodard relieved Haynes in the sixth inning, and Mike
Piazza ripped his 18th home run, a two-run shot to left field that
put the Mets ahead, 6-1.

EDITORIAL: TAKING ACTION ON HATE CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years the New York State Assembly has passed bills to
increase punishment for bias-related crimes committed against gays
and minority members. For that entire time, Republicans in the
State Senate have blocked the legislation because they were
unwilling to include gays as a protected group in any hate-crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   This month, at the request of Gov. George Pataki, the Senate
finally dropped its objections and approved a bill increasing
penalties for crimes that single out victims because of their race,
gender, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation. But
now this effort may be jeopardized because of a ridiculous contest
of egos and credit-taking in which the two houses appear to be
engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the governor's bill, and insists that it will
not vote on any other bill. The Assembly, which passed its own
bill, has not approved the Senate legislation, perhaps because it
has championed this issue for years and does not want the Senate to
get credit now for producing the final legislation. There is some
difference in the language of the two bills, but they would both
achieve the same goal _ increasing punishment for crimes driven by
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no difficulty reaching a workable compromise.
The legislative leaders need to start behaving like grown-ups, stop
this spat and enact a measure that has been held up by politics for
more than a decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   James Billington, the Librarian of Congress and a historian of
Russian culture, has come up with a simple but effective way of
advancing democracy in Russia. Borrowing a page from the Marshall
Plan, which brought young German politicians to the United States
after World War II, Billington has devised a program that gives
thousands of Russian civic leaders a chance to see the American
political and economic system at work. With $10 million from
Congress last summer, and a similar amount this year, the Russian
Leadership Program offers Russians _ many under 40 years old _ a
brief but intense encounter with a noisy, often messy but
remarkably open form of governance.
</P>
<P>
   An effort like this is easily overshadowed by the great
political and military issues that dominate relations between
Washington and Moscow, and $10 million is a microscopic dot in the
annual federal budget. But from no-frills programs like this can
come invaluable gains, including the development of a generation of
Russian leaders who better understand the workings of an
independent judiciary or the benefits of private property. This
summer's 2,000 or so visitors, including 130 members of the Russian
parliament, will divide into specialized groups that concentrate on
subjects like banking, taxation, the rule of law, agriculture and
other topics relevant to the development of Russian democracy.
After a few days in Washington the participants will disperse to
cities and towns in nearly every state, where they will be housed
in the homes of their hosts and get a first-hand look at the work
of mayors, judges, doctors, teachers, farmers and political party
activists, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of America is better than the theory of America,''
Billington likes to say. By inviting Russians here to experience
the story, he and his congressional sponsors, most notably Sen. Ted
Stevens of Alaska, are making an important investment in Russia's
future.

EDITORIAL: OIL PRICE MYSTERIES  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have risen above $2 a gallon in Chicago and
Milwaukee, about 25 percent higher than two months ago, angering
drivers and sending political shock waves through Washington.
Drivers blame retailers. Refiners blame federal regulations, the
courts and OPEC. Federal regulators suspect price fixing. Some of
these charges are just plain wrong. Others have more merit but do
not account for the whole problem.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that gasoline prices across the country are about 25
percent higher than they were a year ago is unsurprising. OPEC
refuses to keep crude oil prices under $28 a barrel as it promised
in the spring. As of June 1, refineries have been required to sell
cleaner-burning gasoline _ which refiners say creates production
problems. A federal court recently ruled that the Unocal Corp.
could charge refiners royalties for a specific technique for
producing cleaner-burning gasoline _ forcing refiners to turn to
more expensive methods.
</P>
<P>
   As for the particularly high prices in Chicago, the industry
points to problems specific to the Midwest. A broken pipeline has
reduced gasoline flow by 20 percent. The Midwest relies on ethanol
to satisfy a federal requirement to cut down on carbon onoxide
emissions. But the use of ethanol makes it hard to also satisfy the
June 1 requirements, leading to supply disruptions in the Midwest.
For gasoline, it takes only a small reduction in supply to trigger
large price hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are unconvinced by the industry's laying
blame elsewhere. They say the companies have known about the June 1
requirements for five years. And they challenge industry estimates
showing that gasoline supplies are low in the Midwest. The Federal
Trade Commission will investigate price fixing. But previous
investigations of the oil industry have proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   No clear explanation for $2-a-gallon gasoline may emerge. The
price surge could well turn out to be the product of a combination
of factors that will dissipate as quickly as they emerged.

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   The recent fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the war in
Sierra Leone are adding to Africa's outcast multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and the internally displaced _ those who flee their
homes without crossing borders _ are among the saddest byproducts
of the continent's wars. Africa has more than 3 million refugees
and some 15 million internally displaced, a much higher number than
10 years ago. These outcasts are straining the resources of their
host communities and the good will of donors, and yet there is no
end to the stream of people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The average refugee from Kosovo received more than $1 a day from
the international community. In Africa, the average refugee gets 11
cents. The internally displaced, who are only now starting to
receive assistance from the outside world, most often get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In many refugee camps, the only nourishment provided by the
World Food Program and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is
flour and oil. Powdered milk is sometimes available, and
nutritional biscuits are given to malnourished children.
</P>
<P>
   Because donor nations are giving less, the refugee agency has
had to cut back on health care and education, which only goes
through age 10 or 12. Some refugees from Somalia and Sudan have
lived in these conditions for 20 years, unable to return until
their homelands are at peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of these refugees are not much worse off than their
hosts. Guinea, a very poor country, now has more refugees per
capita than any other nation. Some countries, such as Sudan,
produce refugees in one region and host them in another. Host
nations get some reimbursement from the United Nations and
sometimes get food aid, but they must provide land and some social
services and keep order in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   African countries, historically generous to refugees _
especially when they were fleeing colonial oppression _ are now
balking at the burden. Many politicians are finding it profitable
to restrict refugees' rights and blame them, rightly or wrongly,
for problems like crime.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus from the Rwandan genocide in 1994 illustrated a new,
debilitating obstacle to protecting refugees. Perpetrators of the
genocide fled to the camps across the border, turning them into
internationally funded military bases. Rwanda was an extreme
example, but many camps _ which host countries tend to build on the
border to emphasize their temporary nature _ become recruiting
zones or rest stops for combatants.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for camps to be controlled by one side in the
conflict. Some camps of refugees from Sudan in Ethiopia, for
example, are essentially run by the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
and relief workers must carefully negotiate their access.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' refugee relief agency is weakly managed and
needs more oversight _ in part because member nations use it as a
patronage pit _ and its dependence on host countries to provide
services is another breeding ground for corruption. But the agency
is struggling with a difficult and dangerous mission: 24 members of
its staff, and 23 workers for the World Food Program, have been
killed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of donors has also crippled the agency, which
finds it easier to raise money for emergency appeals than to
alleviate the chronic miseries of most African refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Although current refugee aid is meager, its most important
shortcoming is that it does not go to the vast majority who have
not crossed a border. The internally displaced should get aid when
countries request it, or when a state has collapsed to the point
where no one can give permission.
</P>
<P>
   Improving the lives of refugees also requires new attitudes
within Africa. Host governments should not build camps close to
borders. Countries such as Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa have
joined many European nations and the United States in passing or
considering laws that would turn away refugees or restrict their
rights. These laws are pernicious everywhere. But what refugees
need most is what all Africans need most _ an end to the wars that
have diverted the continent's resources and created so much
suffering.

WOODS STAYS ON TOP WITH PLAY SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ First the fog, then the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The interminable centennial celebration of the U.S. Open
continues to play catchup at Pebble Beach Golf Links, where play
was suspended for a second straight round Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 hours play wasn't enough to make up for Thursday's
fog-out, and it didn't help that more fog delayed resumption of
competition early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Once they got the second round started, it began to look an
awful lot the the first round - with Tiger Woods continuing to lead
the field.
</P>
<P>
   His 30-foot birdie putt on the 12th hole put an exclamation mark
on the decision to halt play at 8:15 p.m., dropping Woods to 9
under par and giving him a three-stroke lead over Miguel Angel
Jimenez, who was 6-under through seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long way to go,'' Woods said. ``We're not even
finished with the second round. And we need to go out - I need to
go out and play early tomorrow morning and continue to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't a problem Friday, almost from the time Woods made
his 4 p.m. start.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied three holes on his front nine and added a fourth
birdie on No. 11 before draining the dramatic 30-footer as the
decision was being made to suspend play.
</P>
<P>
   He thought a 15-foot put to save par on the second hole was
critical to his early success.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything it was a good, solid way to start,'' said
Woods, who added birdie putts of 30 feet on No. 3, 15 feet on No.
6, 10 feet on No. 7 and 12 feet on No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   He is confident he can keep up the solid play for a second
straight interrupted round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before, I've done this before,'' said Woods,
who has won a Masters and PGA Championship in less than five full
seasons as a pro. ``It's nothing new. Only difference is, it's the
U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Jimenez were well-separated from the remainder of the
pack, led by Thomas Bjorn of Denmark (2 under through 16) and
Argentina's Angel Cabrerra (2 under through nine).
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, who won this year's Nissan Open at Riviera, and
Robert Damron are tied at 1 under - Triplett with a completed round
and Damron through seven.
</P>
<P>
   John Huston, Hal Sutton, Tom Lehman, Rocco Mediate, Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabel, New Zealand's Michael Campbell and Ireland's
Padraig Harrington were all even as play was halted, none more than
14 holes into the round.
</P>
<P>
   Should the fog accommodate, second-round play will resume at
6:30 this morning, followed by a determination of cut survivors,
who will then go out in the traditional U.S. Open twosome format
that might force yet another carryover Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he tried to remained focused only upon the play, not
how difficult it has been to get it completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting at the U.S. Open is not exactly the best thing to
do,'' he said. ``If you're playing a golf course that's a little
bit easier and a golf course that's more forgiving, it's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, who completed a first round of 70 Friday morning,
followed with five birdies in his delayed second round and seems to
have the game going that earned him his first PGA Tour win at
Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   He thought steady play was the key to survival at Pebble Beach,
given the narrow fairways, deep rough and hardening greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the kind of tournament where you don't think
about the score so much,'' Triplett said. ``Pars are so precious
that you just spend all your energy (thinking) I've just got to par
this hole in front of me, and on we go.''

ANOTHER INJURY STRIKES ANGELS IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Almost as though it were on cue, an Anaheim Angels
starting pitcher went down with an injury, creating room on the
roster for another.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis had to leave Friday night's game against the
Baltimore Orioles with a strained muscle on the right side of his
rib cage after his first pitch of the fourth inning in a game
eventually won by the Orioles 4-3 before 45,006 at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the injury coincides with the return of Tim
Belcher, who will make his first start of the season tonight after
recovering from offseason elbow surgery. The Angels anticipated
sending down a reliever to make room for Belcher, but now they
won't have to because Schoeneweis was placed on the 15-day disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Schoeneweis means none of the five pitchers who
began the season in the starting rotation - Ken Hill (rib cage),
Kent Bottenfield (shoulder), Jason Dickson (hip), Ramon Ortiz and
Schoeneweis - are there now. All are on the disabled list except
Ortiz, who was demoted to Triple-A Edmonton. They also lost pitcher
Kent Mercker, who had a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage, Mark
Petkovsek, who has recovered from meningitis, and shortstop Gary
DiSarcina, who had shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it to this extent,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``You expect to have a couple of nicks here and
there, guys that might have to be shut down for a while. It's part
of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meningitis, a cerebral hemorrhage, pulled ribs, pulled hip
flexors, it's a little out of the ordinary. But I'll tell you what.
This club is going to be there. This club is going to get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in curses, but (gosh darn),'' first baseman Mo
Vaughn said. ``Two ribs, a brain and a hip. I don't know what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis has overcome testicular cancer and reconstructive
elbow surgery during his pitching career, so he's dealt with worse.
Still, he was near tears in the clubhouse after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to start the whole year,'' he said. ``I wanted to
keep going and pitch a lot of innings. This is a real big
disappointment. It's pretty frustrating. I went through a lot of
stuff ... it's too much for one person to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   What is even more exasperating to Schoeneweis is that he
believes he suffered the injury in his previous start in Arizona
when he was batting in the National League ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   `'I narrowed it down to hitting,'' he said. ``It was the only
thing I did different in the last couple of weeks. I hadn't picked
up a bat in the last eight to 10 years, so that must be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he left the game, Schoeneweis (5-5) got a double dose of
Albert Belle, who hit a three-run homer in the first and a solo
homer in the third to account for all four Oriole runs. Belle also
hit two homers Thursday and has hit nine homers in his past 13
games.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles starter Mike Mussina (5-6) continued his mastery of the
Angels, even though he wasn't dominating. He gave up single runs in
the second and seventh innings, allowing eight hits in 6 innings
overall to improve to 12-4 in his career vs. the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Angels' third in a row, their longest losing
streak of the season. All three losses were by one run. They also
fell four games behind first-place Oakland in the AL West, their
largest deficit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For the Orioles, the win was their sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis said he felt tightness in his side throughout the
game, but it got gradually worse and finally was too much when he
made his first pitch of the fourth inning to Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I can't even hardly move,'' said Schoeneweis, who
said he had the same injury in 1997 while in Double-A and missed
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis also said he'll be more sensitive about needling
other players who are injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around comes around,'' he said. ``I was giving guys
a hard time in a joking manner. I'll never do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, the Angels remain in the race with a rotation
that includes three pitchers - Jarrod Washburn, Seth Etherton and
Brian Cooper - who began the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, we have a lot of confidence in the depth
of our starters in the organization, but it's been tested to the
limit,'' Scioscia said. ``We've got a whole new rotation from
opening day.''

DELAYS PLAGUE PLAY AT PEBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Golfers started showing up at 5 a.m. for
a tee time. Play was painfully slow. Groups sat bunched on hole
after hole.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach; it's the Saturday
morning men's club at Pacific Grove Muni.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, things have been so backed up in this national
championship, from fog and slow-playing players, rush hour on the
Golden Gate Bridge looks inviting by comparison. We might have a
winner by next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the roadblocks, the Open leaderboard boasts a guy from
the Pacific Northwest and a bunch of incomplete scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, the tourney favorite, first-round leader and our
next president, stood at 9-under-par overall when the sun went
down, three shots better than his closest pursuer. Trouble was, he
played only 12 holes Friday. He teed off on the first hole at 4:45
p.m., something he probably hadn't done since high school. He
started his second round nearly 28 hours after the end of his first
trip around Pebble.
</P>
<P>
   The only guy to post two rounds under par is the man from
Pullman, Kirk Triplett. He played five holes in the morning to
finish off a round of 1-under 70, then came back in the afternoon
with a 71.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's the leader in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they write a check based on that?'' Triplett joked. ``Is
that something we can do, maybe a partial deal, split it up, day
money or something? It feels great. I love this place, Pebble
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win would just be a dream come true. If I could pick one
course to win a tournament on or be a champion, this would be the
one.''
</P>
<P>
   No champion will be determined any time soon. Play was stopped
at 8:15 p.m., with 56 players still on the course. Weather
permitting, the third round won't start until 10:30 this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Local forecasts call for morning fog Saturday, with afternoon
clearing, meaning more backups and incompletes are likely. NBC is
supposed to televise this thing, but so far the only coverage has
come from the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumes, Triplett will have to contend with Woods, who
hasn't let much bother him. The prodigy had four birdies and two
bogeys among his partial second round, dropping a 25-foot birdie
putt to put an exclamation mark on his final hole last night.
</P>
<P>
   One player who won't be around is Jack Nicklaus. He followed up
an 82 with a 73 and won't make the cut in what has been advertised
as his final U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The projected cut is 8-over-par, which means Washington's
three-man contingent will make it through the weekend intact.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle natives Fred Couples and Jeff Coston were at 3-over 145
and 5-over 147, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Coston, the Semiahmoo Golf Academy teacher and former PGA Tour
player, endured a 6-over 77 after posting a 70. He was still
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the respirator,'' he joked. ``Stick an IV in me and
we'll see what happens (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Said Triplett, ``It's a good Northwest showing. These are
Northwest kinds of courses, really, with the greens and the
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett had an adventuresome second round, literally finding
the beach on the 10th hole _ he sent a ball over the bluff and into
the oceanside sand. Three holes later, he took a penalty stroke for
an unplayable lie after failing to convince two rules officials
that his ball had landed in a mole hole 125 yards from the green.
</P>
<P>
   Both situations resulted in double bogeys and helped drop his
overall score from 5-under to 1-under. But he took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nature of Pebble,'' he said. ``Always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 446-yard 10th, Triplett was 200 out, staring into a stiff
breeze. He couldn't keep a 4-iron from leaking right and heading
for the Pacific. He climbed the embankment and found his ball. He
momentarily thought about chipping up but took the safe route.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in a big, deep footprint,'' he said. ``If I had a good
lie, I could have hit it. I was smart enough to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett found his ball in what he described as ``a trough'' in
deep grass on the 399-yard 13th hole, short of a bunker. The
discussion that followed with two rules officials took 20 minutes,
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a mole tunnel; I could put a hand inside for a
foot in each direction,'' he said. ``It was totally a judgment
call. There was no obvious evidence of an animal, no droppings. I
just got in a bad spot.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the only one. Otherwise, he's first and finished,
a major accomplishment in this muddled major.

TWINS INTERRUPT SELE'S CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Aaron Sele has never pitched in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   After Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez, Sele went into the game
Friday night with a 7-2 record and as the player most likely to
represent the Mariners on July 11 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Sele didn't win any votes in his campaign stop in the
Metrodome, lasting just four innings of a 7-2 defeat to the
Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   He went into the game with an 11-2 career record against
Minnesota. And he went in hot _ with five victories and a 2.95
earned-run average in his previous six starts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Twins had been all but frigid, having lost
three in succession.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. The Twins scalded Sele for five runs on 10 hits in
winning behind Brad Radke, the only pitcher on the Minnesota staff
to have pitched in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Sele and Radke are similar pitchers in many ways, but Sele
pitches for a team that gives him lots of run support _ almost
eight runs per game _ and Radke pitches for a team that gives him
no offensive backing _ about 2.5 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have a (4-8) record, but he's never pitched like that
kind of pitcher,'' Mariners leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson said of
Radke. ``He's always tough. Always.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who was picked to the 1998 American League All-Star team
but didn't pitch in the game, said Radke ``is one of the best
around, and you know he'd have that (4-8) record turned around if
they'd scored some runs for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Twins did just that. Radke, whose only
All-Star Game was in 1998, hadn't gotten more than five runs all
year before the Twins finally broke free against Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous when we got four runs (in the fourth inning),''
Radke said. ``When I got a lead like that, it would have been
terrible to blow it. If I'd blown it, it would have been a long
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke didn't blow it, but it was a long night _ for Sele and for
the Mariners. Sele, who had fewer than six runs to work with just
once in his previous seven starts, got just a fraction of his usual
support.
</P>
<P>
   Sele was staked to a 2-0 lead when the Mariners touched Radke
for runs in the second on a Mike Cameron RBI single and in the
third on Tom Lampkin's solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, the offense dried up for Seattle _ after
Mark McLemore's single in the third, the Mariners didn't get
another hit _ while the Twins hadn't even warmed up their bats.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota shortstop Cristian Guzman, who would finish the night
with a career-best four hits, singled home a run in the third. With
the game tied at 2 in the fourth, Guzman's laser triple to
right-center brought home two more. Guzman scored on Ron Coomer's
RBI single, and Seattle was staring at a 5-2 deficit, from which
Radke would not let the Mariners escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about support,'' Twins All-Star candidate Matt Lawton
said. ``Tonight we finally got some for Brad. He'd been pitching
good, but we haven't been scoring for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke, who gave way in the ninth inning to reliever Bob Wells
after throwing 125 pitches, retired the last 10 men he faced. Of
the 20 men Radke faced after McLemore's third-inning single, the
Mariners went 0-for-17 with three walks. Just the kind of stuff to
impress the handful of scouts from other organizations in the
stands _ not to mention the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right at us,'' hitting coach Gerald Perry said. ``He
had the good changeup, like always, and he had a nice cut fastball.
Tonight, we were no match for him. Once he got the lead, he shut
the door on us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of ability that has the Twins trying at one
moment to sign Radke to a new long-term contract, and in the next
talking with the Yankees, Mets, Reds, A's and Devil Rays about a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'd trade for him,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that the Twins have to do something. Radke will walk
as a free agent at the end of the season if the Twins can't get him
signed. If he doesn't sign in the next week or so, the pressure to
trade him might be irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy we've been wanting for a long time,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``Besides that, he's got good blood lines. He went
to Jesuit (High School) in Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you hadn't guessed, that's Piniella's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the Mariners might have been in the running for
Radke, but he was never available. Now that he is _ or at least
might be _ available, the Mariners don't list starting pitching as
their top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle could do a lot worse than make a run at a pitcher
who could be dominant for them _ or against them, if the A's win
the Radke derby. After winning 8-3 Friday night in Kansas City,
Oakland is one game ahead of the Mariners in the West.

FOR KOREAN-AMERICANS, SUMMIT TALKS OFFER HOPE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALISADES PARK, N.J. _ Along Broad Avenue here, where most of
the businesses are owned by Korean-Americans, the summit meeting
this week between ``the two Kims'' _ Presidents Kim Dae Jung of
South Korea and Kim Jong Il of North Korea _ was universally hailed
as the first tentative step toward reunification of a country that
never should have been partitioned in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a fault line, it was generational, evidenced in the
comments of Lisa Joo, 54, and her daughter, Jeannie Joo Aigner, 31,
as they worked Friday in the family-owned Benjamin's Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want it, and we really want to believe it,'' said
Joo, the mother, explaining that many like her with relatives in
North Korea feel they have a large stake in the easing of tensions
and want very much to believe it will happen. But for her daughter
there is a deep skepticism, born of being raised in the United
States, within a community that until recently condemned all things
North Korean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older generation's belief may be outrunning the reality,''
Joo Aigner said. ``I have never met those relatives in the North,
and so they are not as real to me. Many younger people believe that
North Korea wants something now and once they get it, they will
close down like in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a community in which cynicism seems to reside more with
the young, weaned on Cold War pieties created by their elders.
</P>
<P>
   Joo concedes that much of the haranguing of the North by the
South was propaganda, intended ``to make you hate more, dislike
more.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``But I have changed a lot in the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 400,000 Americans of Korean descent in
the New York City metropolitan area and about 150,000 of them are
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest concentration is along the Hudson River, from Fort
Lee north: some 80,000 Korean-Americans live there, said Kun Y.
Lee, president of the New Jersey Korean Chamber of Commerce and an
appointee to the State Commission on Civil Rights. In fact, some
have jokingly suggested that Fort Lee was named for a Korean.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last two days, wherever Korean-Americans gathered,
the talk was of the summit meeting in Pyongyang, its meaning and
interpretations of subtle gestures between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the offices of the Korean-American Senior Citizens
Association in Palisades Park, the tiles for Jangki, the
traditional, chess-like strategy game, and the black and white
stones of the game Badook were put aside.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the table was strewn with Korean-language newspapers,
and about a half-dozen elderly men pored over them. They talked
about the leaders' body language and tried to gauge the meaning of
Kim Jong Il's decision to meet Kim Dae Jung at the airport and to
provide a military honor guard.
</P>
<P>
   Chung Yun Taik, 76, with a smile that enveloped his face,
pronounced it all ``very wonderful because we are all the same
race.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm for the prospects of better relations and even
reunification of the two Koreas was not dimmed even as he recalled
that just a year ago a North Korean submarine was seized in a
provocative attempt to penetrate South Korea's border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some distrust, but we must try,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most important feature of thawing relations is the
possibility of reuniting with brothers, sisters and other relatives
in the North who were last seen 50 years ago, said Chu Ok Kun, 67,
the association's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family reunification is the most important thing for the
seniors,'' he said, as Kun Y. Lee translated his Korean into
English. ``They are the ones who are anxious to reunite. That is
their first priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Park, 40, the president of the Korean-American
Association of Northern New Jersey, said that the community was not
naive and understood that the opening that North Korea had made to
the South was required if the diplomatically isolated and
famine-riven country was to get help in solving its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kim Jong Il is involved too deeply now to pull back,''
said Park, noting, as other Korean-Americans did, that there had
been very secretive past diplomatic attempts at easing tensions
between the two countries that came to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world has been watching Pyongyang for the last three
days and I think he cares too much about what the world community
thinks about him to pull back,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the real story of the summit meeting to
Korean-Americans here was the humanizing of the North Korean
leader, who, like his despotic father, Kim Il Soong, has been
shrouded in a mythic secrecy that was fertile ground for demonizing
him. To see him smile and joke with Kim Dae Jung and reporters
about his reputation for being reclusive, and to see him physically
embrace his counterpart from the South, had a powerful impact, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a leader who can do whatever he wants without
consulting anyone, and he chose to do this,'' Lee said. ``That has
a lot of meaning. Before, no one knew who this guy was and he chose
the leader from the South to be the one to bring him out from
behind his curtain. This is no joke. This is no baloney.''

   NY-PARK-CRIME (New York) _ Long before the worst of the violence
in this year's Puerto Rican Day Parade, the central elements of
mayhem were already starting to gel in dangerous and unpredictable
ways. Just as a thundercloud is fueled by wind and moisture,
Sunday's wild, uncontrolled mob attacks on women in Central Park
were fueled by a complex alchemy of alcohol, marijuana,
mind-numbing heat, male idiocy and errors of police strategy,
tactics and communication. By David Barstow and C.J. Chivers. 1,100

   SINGER-HEIR (Jackson, Miss.) _ The legend was that if you
touched Robert Johnson you could feel the talent running through
him, like heat, put there by the devil on a dark delta crossroad in
trade for his soul. It is why Claude Johnson's grandparents would
not let him out of the house that day in 1937 when Robert Johnson,
his father, strolled into the yard. Robert Johnson, the famous,
almost mythical blues man, had come to Lincoln County to see Virgie
Jane Smith and a son he had never seen. Claude wants to believe
that Robert came for him that day, and he always wondered what
would have happened if he had run across that porch to him, so that
everyone would know he was Robert Johnson's son. Now, 63 years
later, the Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled that Claude Johnson,
a retired gravel truck driver who lives quietly in Crystal Springs,
truly is the flesh and blood child of a man so mythologized that
many people do not know where the legend ends and the truth begins.

Nagako spent her life insulated deep inside a Japan that no longer

overlooking the chocolate-colored waters of the Amazon River has
been the main source of guarana, a bright red, highly caffeinated
berry that is believed by many Brazilians to be an aphrodisiac.
Inspired by a legend that guarana originated from a tempestuous
affair between two teenagers from rival Indian tribes, Brazilians
have consumed guarana in the form of teas, tablets and even soft
drinks. These days, guarana provides a clear example of the way
Brazilians living in the Amazon River Basin are seeking to harness
the region's exotic flora and fauna to promote economic
development. By Simon Romero.

that he evaded taxes on about $5 million worth of diamonds he had

RUSTY RELIEVERS FAIL DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a five-day vacation of sorts, the Los
Angeles Dodgers relievers returned to work Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They were rested, refreshed - and rusty.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen failed to keep the Dodgers in the game as St. Louis
beat L.A. 6-3 before 43,971 on Friday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Things have been slow lately because the Dodgers starters have
been taking care of business. Three of the last five, including
Kevin Brown on Thursday, pitched complete games. The other two went
at least seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I don't have enough innings to keep the bullpen
sharp,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said before Friday's game.
``They're not overworked at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest ended with Orel Hershiser starting for L.A. Making his
first start since being recalled Tuesday from Single-A San
Bernardino, Hershiser had a rocky first inning on the way to giving
up five earned runs and six hits in four-plus innings with three
walks, one hit batter and one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson planned to limit Hershiser to 60-80 pitches (he threw
76).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Dodgers, when Hershiser left in the fifth
inning with two runners on, none out and the score tied, Matt
Herges couldn't retire the side before those two runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   Herges started by striking out Mark McGwire and Ray Lankford.
But then he gave up RBI singles to Eric Davis and Mike Matheny for
a 5-3 St. Louis lead.
</P>
<P>
   Herges walked one and struck out a career best-tying five,
including McGwire twice, in three innings. He retired seven of the
last eight batters he faced. Terry Adams went one inning with one
walk and a strikeout, and Mike Fetters walked one and gave up Jim
Edmonds' second home run of the game in the ninth. It was Edmonds'
first multi-homer game as a Cardinal and ninth in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (1-3), who entered with a 10.70 ERA, retired the first
two batters before giving up a home run to Edmonds. Then he hit
McGwire and walked Lankford. Davis followed with a double that
scored McGwire, and Lankford came home on the throw to second for a
3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That took care of the scoring, but Hershiser wasn't out of
trouble yet. He threw inside to the next batter, Matheny, and the
ball hit Matheny's bat and went foul, prompting Cardinals manager
Tony LaRussa to come out of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Matheny eventually walked, and Hershiser ended the inning by
inducing Placido Polanco to ground to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got on the scoreboard on Eric Karros' 19th home run
in the second inning off St. Louis starter Pat Hentgen (6-6), then
tied the game with two runs in the fourth. Shawn Green doubled in
Mark Grudzielanek and Gary Sheffield. For Green, it was the 42nd
consecutive game he has reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, L.A. loaded the bases, but Hershiser
grounded to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen gave up three earned runs and seven hits in six-plus
innings. That included getting Green to ground into a 1-6-3 double
play to kill a fifth-inning rally. Hentgen walked two, struck out
three and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matthews and Alan Benes combined on two scoreless innings,
and Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his 12th save.

KOBE CRASH LANDS

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Maybe this was about the way the ball bounces.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this was about the unpredictability of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this was about life's inevitable ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your cliche, and it will fit Kobe Bryant's performance
Friday better than the cliche that people rushed to apply to his
performance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was the cliche about the Lakers' 21-year-old guard being
the new Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights back, Bryant was floating somewhere over basketball
countrylike a god, dropping 28 clutch points on the Indiana Pacers
in the overtime victory that put the Lakers in charge of the NBA
Finals with a three games to one lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was Jordanesque. But, we would soon see, he was not Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Kobe came crashing back to earth as the Lakers were
crushed 120-87 in their first attempt to wrap up the championship.
</P>
<P>
   He does everything else spectacularly. So why not failure?
</P>
<P>
   Finding an occasion to which he could not rise, Bryant missed 16
of his 20 shots and finished with 8 points, his playoff low if you
don't include the June 9 game at the Staples Center in which he
sprained an ankle and went to the locker room early.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the Jordan legend that should have been affixed
to Bryant this time was the cologne, Kobe having stunk up Conseco
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the game I played,'' he said afterward,
appearing characteristically unfazed by the flop. ``But you put it
behind you, move on and get ready for Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Was his ankle bothering him? That's an unlikely excuse. It
hardly slowed him down Wednesday, and he'd had Thursday to continue
healing.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped quickly into foul trouble, though. He earned his
second and third fouls on consecutive Reggie Miller possessions
shortly before halftime, his fourth and fifth before the end of the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And he appeared tight early on. He missed shots he normally
makes. He missed shots he shouldn't have tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers fell behind by 10 in the first quarter. That was no
cause for panic because the Pacers were making 75 percent of their
shots, a pace they couldn't possibly maintain. It's just that by
the time the Pacers cooled off, the Lakers were behind by 20 going
into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time we try to close it out, the whole
(opposing) team is in a zone,'' Bryant said, referring to the
Lakers' failures in their first attempts to eliminate Sacramento,
Phoenix and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had been in a zone Wednesday, sinking 4 of 5 shots and
scoring 9 points in the overtime that tipped this series.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the 0 zone Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Bryant failed to earn a trip to
the free-throw line, this in a stretch in which he has taken 47
shots from the floor. A player with his quickness and finishing
ability who can't draw fouls is either a victim of the referees or
doing something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not that failing to live up to the Jordan comparison is
something wrong. The NBA is populated entirely with young men who
are not Michael Jordan, and most of them don't rate an MJ allusion
even on their best days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Michael play maybe 115 playoff games. He probably had 90
games at the level (Bryant has) had this one,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson had said before the game, when he was asked to explain why
he dances around the natural comparison questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from Kobe, but we (in Chicago) got
used to the way Michael played and the level he played at. To see
someone reach close to the way he could play is enough of a hint to
want to make us recapture that lure that Michael held out for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Kobe's young. He's probably a better player at 21 than
Michael was at 21 ... He's got a lot of years to develop into that
(Jordan) role.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Jackson again was measured in his assessment,
this time tempering his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe was game for it, but he just didn't find his shot,''
Jackson said. ``Indiana did a nice job on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers guarded him mostly with Miller and Jalen Rose and
threw some bigger players at him too.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant missed 10 of 11 shots in the second half before going to
the bench for the last time with three minutes left and the Lakers
down 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played defense on him. Anytime you're a young player,
you're going to have your great moments and you're going to have
your moments when you struggle,'' said Rose, the Pacers' leading
scorer with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kobe Bryant held himself to eight points,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   What went up just came down. Kobe and the Lakers are comforted
by the assumption the Pacers, 57 percent shooters Friday, a whole
team of Michael Jordans for a night, will fall to earth in Game 6.

 JAYS-RED SOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a night when the American League East was up for grabs, the
Red Sox asserted themselves in a 7-4 victory over the Blue Jays
beford a crowd of 33,638 at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 14th sellout and the largest crowd of the season. The
fans got their money's worth. Home runs. Stolen bases. Defense.
Relief pitching. And a spot on top.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the Yankees' 3-1 loss to the White Sox, the Red Sox
regained the lead by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pounded 12 hits, including nine off starter Kelvim
Escobar (5-8), although they were behind 2-0 before they faced him
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Toronto first, Raul Mondesi his a 406-foot two-run home
run off Red Sox starter Pete Schourek. Mondesi, who came to Toronto
from the Dodgers in the Shawn Green deal, is a star.
</P>
<P>
   But so are Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Everett, and Brian Daubach.
So is the Bull Crew of Hipolito Pichardo (2-0), Rich Garces, and
Derek Lowe (Save No. 16), who followed Schourek with 5 1/3 inings
of shutout ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox came charging back in the bottom of the first. It
started with a one-out single by Jeff Frye off Escobar. Frye moved
to third on a double by Trot Nixon and both runners scored on a
wall single by Nomar Garciaparrra.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the heavy stuff. Everett hit a two-run blast to
center, his 22d home run of the year for a 4-2 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach followed with his 11th home run, a line drive into the
seats in center.
</P>
<P>
   Nice to be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a night like this,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams, ``You
don't know what is going to happen. When the game first started
out, it looked like it was going to be an offensive night. But both
sides pitched well after that. It was big for us to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   After that opening volley, Toronto had a hard time coming up
with key hits. The Blue Jays stranded 12 men. Twice Picharo struck
out Tony Bastita with the tying run on third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was very good for me,'' said Pichardo, one of six
Dominicans on on the Red Sox' roster. ``I had a good fastball and
moved it around pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' recent road trip up and down the East Coast had
taken its toll on the lineup. But fresh from a day off and two
nights of sleep in their own beds, the rested Red Sox got back to
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long, long road trip,'' said catcher Scott Hatteberg.
``Everybody was happy to be back because we had a day of rest. Now
we have to get after them again. We have two great teams coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to perform well. If you'd told us in spring this was
the situation we'd be in, everybody would have been very excited.
We're only half way through the season. There are only so much ball
to be player.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra says it takes a team effort like Friday night to
stay abreast with the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that we caught them early,'' he said.``It gave our
team confidence and we were able to shut it down afterwards. Our
bullpen did its job and we appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red sox should have had more in the first but slumping Troy
O'Leary, who was hit by a pitch, made a running error that cost the
Red Sox. A single past short by Wilton Veras put O'Leary on second
and both men advanced on a fly to center by Hatteberg. The throw
went into the visitor's dugout, allowing O'Leary to score and
moving Veras to third. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the next pitch could be thrown, Escobar appealed to
second and O'Leary was called out for leaving too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays struck in the third inning for two runs to cut the
lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored two insurance runs in the seventh inning.
Frye walked and, after Lance Painter relived Escobar, Nixon singled
to left. After John Frascatore replaced Painter, Garciaparra
singled to left to bring home Frye. Everett flied out, but Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi went to his bullpen for Pedro Borbon. Once
again the move backfired, as Mike Stanley, hitting for Daubach,
singled to left to score Nixon.

WOODS LEADS OPEN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ For nearly two days, an intrusive fog
hugged the rugged coast of Monterey Peninsula, blocking any view of
what had been rumored to be the 100th US Open.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed late Friday afternoon as two eras passed in
the twilight, an almost symbolic handoff that seemed to turn on the
power at Pebble Beach Golf Links. As Jack Nicklaus, arguably the
greatest player the game has ever known, was playing the 18th hole
in what most likely will be his 44th and final US Open appearance,
Tiger Woods, who has made Nicklaus's records his personal crusade,
was on the first tee, preparing for his second round.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who rarely came up short of expectations in his
heralded career, did so with his eagle bid, then missed his birdie
attempt to finish at 82_155 and miss the cut.
</P>
<P>
   That left it up to Woods to demonstrate the magic that Nicklaus
is only able to remember. He did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a fire that was needed to guard against a winterlike air
blowing in across Carmel Bay, Woods closed down the curtain with a
30-foot birdie at the par-3 12th that pushed him to 9 under in a
performance that is looking more like his coronation, which, up
until this point, was somewhat unofficial as he has yet to win a US
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended for the day at 8:15 p.m. with Woods and 55
others on the course, including Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, who
birdied the par-5 sixth and is 6 under through seven holes. But,
for all intents and purposes, it appears as if only Woods can beat
Woods, and images of Augusta 1997 are taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' said Woods, whose 12-shot victory at the
Masters three years ago turned on the Tiger Mania that has not
slowed a lick. ``There's still a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means some will return with flickering hopes, including
Denmark's Thomas Bjorn (playing the 17th) and Argentina's Angel
Cabrera (though nine), who are both 2 under. Robert Damron (through
seven) is at 1 under, tied with Kirk Triplett (71_141), who is
fondly referred to as your ``clubhouse leader.'' In theory, all
that means is he's warming the seat for Woods, who will get to the
course early, most likely complete his round in favorable
conditions, then go home for a nap before a late-afternoon tee time
to play Round 3.
</P>
<P>
   Still, having a lead in the US Open is OK with Triplett, the man
who wears the funny fisherman's hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they write the check based on that,'' said Triplett,
smiling. ``Is that something we can do?''
</P>
<P>
   No, not really, not unless they change the rules, which is
something that might have to happen if Woods is to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In search of his fifth win of the year, in just 11 starts, Woods
did not tee off until 4:42 p.m. thanks to all the fog woes
Thursday. No one knows if they gave him the twilight rate on greens
fees, but it appears more and more that he could shoot 64 at 3 a.m.
in a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Woods drained a 15-foot par-save at the second, then a 25-footer
for birdie at the third. He recovered from his first bogey of the
tournament (he missed the green at the par-3 fifth and failed to
get it up-and-down out of a bunker) with a two-putt birdie at the
par-5 sixth, then birdied the par-4 eighth to get to 8 under.
</P>
<P>
   A bogey at the par-4 ninth slowed things _ but not for long. At
the difficult 11th, Woods almost made an eagle 2, but settled for
tapping in a 3-foot birdie putt. Seconds earlier, Jimenez had made
his birdie to get within a shot, but when Woods made his birdie in
falling dusk at the 12th, the lead was back to three.
</P>
<P>
   All of this took place hours after Triplett had left the course,
most likely headed right to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett was one of 75 players forced back to Pebble Beach Golf
Links early Friday morning to complete Round 1, which was rudely
interrupted Thursday by what they call ``June Gloom'' out here.
That is a thick soup that hovers over the coast, confused by cooler
temperatures over the Pacific and stifling numbers inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out here at 6:45,'' said Triplett, who was 3 under
through 13 when play was halted Thursday, ``and things were pretty
soft and calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they weren't clear, so the start of play was
delayed until 8:15, at which time Triplett, unlike most of his
peers, held things together by losing only one shot to par. After
signing for that 70, he went directly to the first tee, did not
pass Go or collect $200, and made birdie to jump-start an explosive
front side.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett made four birdies, but made bogey at the ninth, then a
double at the par-4 10th to fall back to 2 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have recognized the fact that the golf course was
playing different,'' said Triplett, who misjudged the wind and his
approach to the 10th onto the beach right of the hole. It's been
done many times before, but Triplett did not make the mistake
others have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was smart enough to pick it up, go up, take my drop,'' only
he hit a poor wedge and three-putted from about 60 feet to give
back two shots.
</P>
<P>
   But in this championship, said Triplett, who won earlier this
year for the first time in his 10-year PGA Tour career, you take
that medicine and go forward because ``the guys breaking par are
playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's one guy who is really breaking par _
which means by midday Saturday, Triplett and others may be battling
for second place.

PACERS STAY ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The yellow ribbons on the lightposts along
Meridian Road can stay where they are. The same goes for all those
``Go Pacers'' signs that dot the windows in downtown office
buildings. Even the Pacer window flags _ only $13.99 at Osco _ can
stay in all those SUVs for another few days.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite son Larry Bird lives to coach another game. Facing
elimination, not to mention the end of his three-year coaching
stint, Bird Friday night left Conseco Fieldhouse for the final time
a most happy fellow. Or as content as an NBA coach can be these
days.
</P>
<P>
   His Pacers routed the Lakers, 120-87, in a thorough whuppin' in
Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Shaq &AMP; Co. still are in good shape; they
lead the series, 3-2, and have two games to win one, both in
Staples Center, the site of their first two wins. Game 6 will be
played Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have the upper hand and we know that,'' Bird said.
``It's up to us to keep the pressure on. I still think they feel
good about themselves, up 3-2, with two at home, and Shaq playing
well. We're 96 minutes away from winning the championship. We
understand that. We have to win two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird hoped for an energized, intense, celestial effort from his
on-the-brink boys similar to the one they had given him in a noble
losing cause in Game 4. He got that _ and more. The Pacers were
juiced from the get-go, putting the complacent Lakers on their
heels with an early jaw-dropping shooting display (75 percent in
the first quarter) and some tough defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers who, by the way, are improving as the series
progresses, shot 57 percent overall. They got 57 points from Jalen
Rose (32) and Reggie Miller (25), had 33 assists, hit 32 of 36 free
throws, had a 46-34 rebounding edge, and trailed only once, 1-0.
The Pacers knocked down 10 treys, including six in the first
quarter, and were in control throughout as the Lakers, again,
failed to close out a series. The Lakers are 0-4 in
first-opportunity closeouts this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is shooting like that, there's not much you can
do,'' said Shaquille O'Neal, who had 35 points in a losing cause.
``They played inspiring basketball. It was Larry Bird's last home
game and they gave him a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they did. You know it's a blowout when a coach references
a first-quarter play as a key. But that's what Lakers coach Phil
Jackson did. He cited a 4-point play by Miller _ he made a trey and
was whacked by Ron Harper _ that ended a run that snapped the
game's last tie (8-8) and put the Pacers ahead, 22-11.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was fast-forward, as Indiana raced to an 11-point
lead after one quarter (scoring 39 points) and a 19-point bulge at
the break. Rose had a sensational first half, scoring 22 points, as
he more than atoned for a disappointing outing (5-of-16 shooting)
in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be steady, I try to be persistent, and I understand
we have what it takes to beat LA,'' said Rose, who was 12 of 18
from the field in 44 minutes. ``But it means nothing talking about
it. And since I felt like I've been doing nothing but talking about
it, especially when they got up, 3-1, I figured I was going to shut
up and go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made one half-hearted run in the third, pulling to
within 70-57 at the 7:18 mark after drives by that dynamic duo of
Glen Rice and A.C. Green. Bird, understandably, had seen enough. He
called time and then Mark Jackson (10 points, 7 assists, 6
rebounds) made a big hoop, sinking a running hook as the shot clock
expired. That seemed to pump life into the Pacers, who then got a
couple hoops from Rik Smits (14 minutes, 12 points) and soon the
lead was back to 19 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter quickly turned into garbage time with yet
another 4-point play by Miller (four free throws on a technical and
fouled trey) and appearances by the likes of Jonathan Bender and
Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was worried about giving Indiana new life, Phil
Jackson smiled and said,``I guess that would be an obvious yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ever-cryptic LA mentor was even more concerned about his
own team. O'Neal came through, as usual, but Kobe Bryant looked
more like Vernon Jordan than Michael Jordan. He was 4 of 20 from
the field (1 of 11 in the second half) as he never found his rhythm
and tried to do too much with too little. Brian Shaw and Derek
Fisher were a combined 0 of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a good game,'' Bryant said with a shrug. ``You
bounce back. You put it behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Jackson saw little to no defense from a team which
specialized in that department over the course of the season. The
margin of defeat was the largest for the Lakers in the postseason,
topping the 29-point humbling at home to Portland. And the 120
points? That was the most any Laker foe scored all season and 38
more than their average points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers us most as a coaching staff is
defensively,'' Jackson said. ``We bounced back from games like this
before. I don't like to think of a team that has championship
quality in it that loses by 33 points. We have to prove something
to ourselves when we go back home.''

ROSE A THORN IN LAKERS' SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Surprise, it was not. Not anymore, anyway. Jalen
Rose has established himself now. People have come to expect this.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even those certain that the 6-foot-8 forward would rebound
well from his poor showing in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, could not
have foreseen this.
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of first half that helped ignite the Pacers to a
stunningly easy 120-87 victory Friday night over the Lakers in Game
5.
</P>
<P>
   Rose hit on nine of his first 12 field goals, including 4 of 5
on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers jumped out to a 19-point lead at the half, and it was
never a game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalen's very good with the ball, can take quick dribbles and
pull up,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ``He keeps the defense
off balance. When he's hitting his shots, it's almost impossible to
stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished with 32 points on 12 of 18 field goals. He added
six rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block.
</P>
<P>
   This after he went 5 of 16 in a tough overtime loss in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated that Jalen was going to respond, not quite like
this, but going to respond,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``He
had some first half against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose is still something of a slight secret among casual NBA
followers. The frustrated point guard did not become a starter
until this season his sixth in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   By midseason, he blossomed into a star. He even did the
unthinkable surpassing Reggie Miller as Indiana's leading scorer.
He finished the year averaging 18.2 points and 4.8 rebounds per
game and was named the NBA's Most Improved Player.
</P>
<P>
   If Rose had just a routine night in Game 4, maybe the Pacers win
the game and lead the Finals by one, instead of the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you're disappointed any time you don't play the way
you're capable,'' Rose said. ``The thing that makes it
disappointing is when your team doesn't win. I could live with 5 of
16 or 1 for 16 if we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose wasted no time in trying to make amends Friday. He hit his
first four shots, including three 3-pointers as the Pacers jumped
out to a quick 12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he was scoring early in the first half,'' Bird
said. ``Then in the second half, he was making plays for people.
He's unselfish, moving the ball, his defense excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose hit from outside, hit medium-range jumpers, drove to the
basket. The Lakers had no answer for any of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jalen is a tough matchup problem for anybody,'' Pacers
guard Mark Jackson said. ``He's a 6-9 guy that can handle the ball,
post, that's strong, a slasher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a bigger guy on him, a smaller guy on him, he's going
to have an advantage one way or another. And when he gets going,
he's extremely tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rose found himself guarding Kobe Bryant for much of
the night. Bryant, coming off his sensational Game 4 performance,
hit just 4 of 20 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose started hitting, Miller quickly joined him. Miller
finished with 25 points, hitting 4 of 6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jalen had it flowing tonight, and that made it a lot easier
for me,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile, but once Miller and Rose learned to play
together, they evolved into a troubling pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see,'' Jackson said. ``From a point guard's
perspective, watching them from Day One to now, it's just a drastic
change. They really play off one another so well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``It took some time for us to find our balance with
each other, to get our rhythm. Now that we've found a comfortable
balance between us, it's starting to show a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   For those still learning Rose's game, know this: He has never
not even in five years of coming off the bench in Indiana and
Denver lacked for confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a tough matchup for a lot of guys,'' Rose said.
``I'm taller than people expect. Then I have the ability to shoot
the three as well as dribble, drive and post. There aren't too many
guys who can do that.''

INDIANA SENDS FINALS BACK TO L.A. WITH ROUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They were like middle-aged parents checking up on
rebellious teenagers left home alone on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers wanted badly to spoil an unwanted party.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they blow away the Los Angeles Lakers with a 120-87
Game 5 victory Friday night in Conseco Fieldhouse, but the Pacers
sent the NBA Finals back to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Pride, the security of playing on their home court and a
relentless offensive explosion were enough for the Pacers to avoid
having the best-of-seven series end on their home floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still lead the series 3-2 and will host Game 6 Monday
in Staples Center. If necessary, Game 7 would be Wednesday in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' 33-point victory made a statement: They refuse to
become innocent bystanders, waiting around for the Lakers'
championship coronation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard about the parade that they had planned,'' Indiana's
Jalen Rose said. ``That won't be tomorrow, though.''
</P>
<P>
   To say that Rose took the apparent disregard personally is an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The wiry, 6-foot-8 forward scored 11 of his team-high 32 points
in a first quarter that embodied the game. There was little the
Lakers could do to stop Rose, who rebounded nicely after a 5-for-16
performance in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   He made all four shots he took in the first, including three
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand we have what it takes to beat L.A. But it does
nothing to talk about it,'' said Rose, who shot 12-for-18 from the
floor. ``I feel like I've done nothing but talk about it, so I
decided to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rose leading the way, Indiana whipped Los Angeles in every
way imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers beat the Lakers off the dribble, dropped 3-pointers
(10, to be exact) on their heads and controlled the boards.
Defensively, Indiana held in check every Laker except center
Shaquille O'Neal, who finished with 35 points and 11 boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played as well as we can play,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sluggish effort by the Lakers, whose only lead was 1-0.
Indiana held a double-digit lead for the last 36 minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers cut a 21-point deficit to 13 with 7:20 left in
the third, the Pacers went on a 23-11 run. They led 93-68 after
Reggie Miller's 3-pointer with 10:44 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Rose each sank four 3-pointers as the Pacers shot 57
percent for the game. Miller was feeling so good from long range
that he made a couple of 30-foot shots _ one that did not count,
because the basket came after the shot clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good that we continued to attack them,'' Miller said.
``That was key. It would be nice if we could have put some of those
points in the bank. I'm sure we're going to need them. But staying
on them was key.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it Pacer pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people got ready for a celebration tonight, which was
disrespectful to us and our character as a basketball team,''
Pacers point guard Mark Jackson said. ``We wanted to give ourselves
a chance to go back to California and see what we can do. ... We
look forward to going back to California, because we're in it to
win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time the Lakers failed to close out a
series. They held a 2-0 lead over Sacramento, but the first-round
series went the distance. It took five games to dispatch Phoenix in
the Western Conference semifinals. And after taking a 3-1 lead
against Portland in the conference finals, the Lakers miraculously
won Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we try to close it out, it seems like the other
team is in a zone,'' said Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, the hero of
L.A.'s Game 4 overtime victory, who didn't help matters by shooting
4-for-20 and finishing with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers have not lost three consecutive games all
season. Nor have the Pacers won at Staples this year. Indiana would
have to accomplish both to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to get a ballgame and we did it,'' said Lakers
coach Phil Jackson, who seemed disappointed, but not dejected, by
the loss. ``We're sitting in the driver's seat, and we're not in a
situation where we have to get in a panic mode.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, on the other hand, have conditioned themselves to
push on.

HISTORY SUGGESTS IT'S JUST A BUMP IN ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ So the Los Angeles Lakers couldn't close out
Indiana on the Pacers' home court Friday. So they fell behind by 20
points in the second quarter, couldn't catch up and squandered one
of their three match points in this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   So what.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, these Lakers are a little careless with the dagger.
If they had been standing in for Macbeth, King Duncan wouldn't have
died until the final act.
</P>
<P>
   These Lakers aren't natural-born killers. Their 120-87 loss in
Game 5 simply confirmed that which has been self-evident throughout
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely laid an egg,'' said starting guard Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Any more eggs and they'll have enough to make creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' inability to put away opponents doesn't necessarily
make them soft or spiritless. Unless, of course, those are the
adjectives you'd use to describe the 1987 Lakers' championship
squad with Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or the 1993 and
1998 Chicago title teams with Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Give the Pacers their proper due; they were desperate to play
another day and they rode a wave of emotion that broke on the
Lakers, leaving them gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, especially, was sputtering and flailing so badly,
the temptation was to throw him a life preserver. Two days removed
from his transcendent performance in Game 4, Bryant fought against
his own energy current all night.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's heart was in the right place but his head was buried in
the clouds. So eager was he to cuddle and kiss the championship
trophy, the 21-year-old swingman forgot everything coach Phil
Jackson has been speaking in his ear all year about picking his
spots.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 16 of 20 shots, accumulated more fouls (five) than
assists (three) and generally wasted enough energy to keep all the
air conditioners whirring in the Valley. As much as Indiana's
Reggie Miller would have liked to have pumped himself up for
Bryant's poor performance, he was gracious enough to give credit
where credit was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe Bryant held himself to eight points,'' said Miller, who
finished with 25 points on the strength of his unconscious
perimeter shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In his misery, Bryant has plenty of company. The Lakers were
looking to close out the Celtics in Boston in Game 5 of the 1987
NBA Finals after stealing Game 4 - not unlike the Bryant-led Lakers
did Wednesday - on Johnson's baby hook in the final seconds of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what happened? James Worthy missed 13 of 19 shots,
Byron Scott went 7 for 10 from the field, Abdul-Jabbar misfired 13
times in 21 tries and the Lakers lost 123-108. Just like that, the
Hollywood Hills were alive with the sounds of people griping about
how the Lakers were a few guts short of intestinal fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lakers returned to L.A., clinched the championship by
beating Boston 106-93 in Game 6 and the vibrations were so good in
the Forum that Johnson called it the best team he ever had played
on and then head coach Pat Riley guaranteed a repeat in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 Bulls broke to a 3-1 lead over Phoenix and the city of
Chicago immediately began planning its championship parade, only to
see the Bulls lose Game 5 at home (they won Game 6). Five years
later, the Bulls took the first three games against Seattle and
gave back the next two before winning Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   There's a pattern there. We trust the Lakers will study it as
though it were a Rorschach test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just waiting to get home,'' said Indiana coach
Larry Bird, who, as a Celtic, had a close-up view of the Lakers'
1987 travails and ultimate triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the Lakers,'' Miller said, ``they still have to feel
good about themselves. I'm sure they'll throw this game away.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they put the game through their memory shredder, the
Lakers should give it one more close look, no matter how much it
pains them. In particular, the Lakers should note how an Indiana
team not known for its rebounding during the regular season won the
battle of the boards, 46-34.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a matter of height but of heart. In the next two
days, the Lakers have to find a way to match the Pacers' will. That
was their biggest matchup problem Friday, not Jalen Rose on Robert
Horry or A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson, ``We have to prove something to ourselves when we
go back home in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the final win in any championship series usually is:
Not a war of attrition but of self-affirmation.

WISE-GUY PACERS LEARNING HOW TO PLAY LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Believe it or not, the Indiana Pacers began the
NBA Finals with a game of 87 points.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Reggie Miller missed 15 of 16 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Seems so long ago, the contest might have been played in short
pants.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate they're going, the Pacers might be putting
up summer gas-pump numbers by a seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   They have to get there first, of course. But after a 120-87
bonking of the Los Angeles Lakers Friday night in Game 5, the odds
no longer are as goofy as Miller's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they beaten us by 33 points, I'm pretty sure we would have
been wrote off,'' said Indiana's Jalen Rose. ``So we'll see what's
said about this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's one view: The Lakers still lead the series, 3-2,
still need to win just one of two at home, which they will be
favored to do. And one more thing that is becoming virtually
inarguable:
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are getting smarter, faster, about playing the Lakers
than the Lakers are wising up about the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers missed a sweep of the 2-3-2 series' Indiana segment
by three inches _ the distance Miller's potential game-winning trey
fell short in the overtime of Game 4 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Pacers followed a 118-point overtime game with
Friday night's net-shredding, in which they shot 57 percent,
including 10-for-20 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; rr &LR; On defense, they have shifted power forward Dale Davis onto
Shaquille O'Neal instead of foul-prone center Rik Smits, and Friday
night had 6-8 forward Jalen Rose harassing L.A.'s Kobe Bryant _
morphing from Golden Child into the Addled Adolescent in 48 hours _
into 4-for-20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't mean the Lakers can't get smarter too, over the next
couple of off-days. But losing this badly this deep in a series,
well, even the inscrutable Phil Jackson is scratching his gray
beard a little more furtively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think of a team that has championship quality
in it that loses by 33 points,'' said the somber Lakers coach.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't appear rattled, said all the right things about not
panicking, noted it was the purple fellows in the series' driver's
seat. But still ...
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three points, virtually wire-to-wire, not even a Lakers
run ... jeez. The margin equaled the worst fifth-game defeat in
Finals history, and was the fourth-worst whacking in any Finals
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Pacers were closing out a splendid year in their new
Conseco Fieldhouse, and it was the last home-state game in the
coaching career of the folk hero, Larry Bird. Predictably, emotions
ran to flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   As Bird said, ``We've had such a great year here, so it was
extremely important for us to play well because of the support.''
</P>
<P>
   But after that adrenaline petered out, the Lakers figured to
bust a move.
</P>
<P>
   Never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson outlined before the game three must-do's: Keep Smits
from easy baskets; contest closely Miller and Rose; win the
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Smits had 12 points in 14 minutes, Miller and Rose scored
57 points on 19-for-30 shooting and the Pacers had a 46-34 rebound
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Implodable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid an egg,'' said Lakers guard Ron Harper. ``There's
nothing I can really say. We just laid an egg out there. We didn't
have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rare words so late in a series for a potential champion.
</P>
<P>
   Again Friday night, the laconic Lakers played with games to
give; it has been their playoff pattern. They had chances in each
previous playoff series to put early close-outs on Sacramento,
Phoenix and Portland. L.A.'s record in those games: 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's 3-6. The saving grace is that they recovered to win all
those series.
</P>
<P>
   The worrisome aspect for L.A. is that the Pacers are the
craftiest team they have met. Indiana is taking notes, finding
weaknesses, gaining confidence. In playing two straight superlative
games against a more physically gifted opponent, the Pacers have
shed whatever intimidation factor compromised them in the first two
defeats in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely, positively have nothing to lose and everything
in the world to gain,'' Miller said. ``From the get-go, they were
supposed to sweep us. We can come out and play free and loose,
which I'm sure a lot of guys are going to like, especially
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Game 5 was a one-time aberration, a gift of
Indiana's manic fans and their wonderful house of hoops, the best
building ever for modern pro basketball. Now that the series
returns Monday to sterile, soulless Staples Center, which is to
hoops atmosphere what a first scratch is to a new car, the Lakers
figure to muster a response more becoming a team that won 67
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played well there this year,'' said Miller,
referring to an 0-3 mark in the new building. ``But now, we have
more confidence than we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Pacers have gone to school. It's hardly
cap-and-gown time for them yet, but the dunce cap they once wore is
woefully outdated.

LAKERS CAN'T PUT PACERS AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ An opportunity came and went Friday, and a Lakers
team searching desperately for a championship identity instead had
to settle for playing a more familiar role: themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tantalizingly close to greatness. Excruciatingly prone to
big-time failure before they can reach it.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the story of the Lakers all season, so it almost
wasn't a surprise - and seemed oddly appropriate - when they moved
within one win of the NBA championship ... then fell 33 points
short of grabbing it.
</P>
<P>
   Only the magnitude of the pratfall was shocking, as the Lakers
suffered a 120-87 rout at the hands of the Indiana Pacers, who
staved off elimination before 18,345 at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still lead the NBA Finals 3-2 but must cope once more
with their most familiar and most frustrating character flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it and I say it's a sad thing that we couldn't
celebrate tonight,'' said Rick Fox, ``but maybe it wasn't meant to
be. And whether that's just the way this team seems to roll, you've
got to hang in there with us, because we always seem to find a way
to cap it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Because, of course, the Lakers' other most notable trait has
been that these sudden dives are almost always followed by a sharp
U-turn and an equally rapid burst back into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That part will have to wait a couple of days. The Lakers flew
back to Los Angeles early this morning and will try to close out
the series Monday night in Game 6 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be home. Our place is going to be rockin', our
place is going to be loud, our place is going to be hostile,'' said
Shaquille O'Neal. ``We'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers need improvement all around if they are to christen
their new arena with champagne and not tears.
</P>
<P>
   They got nothing after O'Neal's 35 points, shooting 40 percent
as a team and allowing the Pacers to score at will. Indiana shot
57.4 percent, riding the hot hands of Jalen Rose (32 points) and
Reggie Miller (25 points).
</P>
<P>
   Indiana took two of three games at Conseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just waiting to get home now,'' said Pacers
coach Larry Bird. ``They didn't play that well tonight. We played
extremely well. They know that they have the lead, they came here,
got the game they needed. It's up to us to put the pressure on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal, Glen Rice was the only other Laker in double
digits, with 11 points. Kobe Bryant, fresh off his incredible
28-point effort in Game 4, came out flat, got into foul trouble and
missed 16 of 20 shots. He finished with eight points - or as much
as he scored in overtime alone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all right,'' said backcourt mate Ron Harper. ``He will
respond in Game 6. I'm not worried about him.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of setback in a series might be familiar - the Lakers
are 3-6 in elimination games - but it's not comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're upset with ourselves,'' said coach Phil
Jackson. ``There's no one to blame but us in this situation. We're
not going to be angry about it one way or the other. We're
frustrated that we didn't execute very well, we did too many things
off the dribble. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers us most as a coaching staff is
defensively. Our inconsistency, really playing the kind of defense,
coming off screens, challenging shooters and putting some pressure
on the ball so that they haven't got the rhythm that they like to
play with.''
</P>
<P>
   First the Lakers lost control of the game, falling behind by
double digits in the first quarter. Then they lost control, period.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed by a manageable 15 points late in the third and
might have been able to mount another storybook comeback. Then they
got panicky.
</P>
<P>
   Fox collared Austin Croshere for a flagrant foul and it turned
into a four-point play. And it got worse. Croshere made both free
throws, and as the Pacers retained possession, Bryant picked up his
fifth foul, sending Mark Jackson to the line for two more free
throws. With 1:52 left in the quarter, the Lakers trailed 84-65.
</P>
<P>
   Then they opened the fourth quarter by giving the Pacers another
four- point play. Derek Fisher was called for a foul as Miller
attempted a 3- pointer, then earned a technical for jawing at
referee Jack Nies. Miller made the technical free throw, then three
more for the foul.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight seconds into the fourth and the Lakers had sunk
themselves into a 90-67 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unfortunate situation. I think we tried to get a
little bit too feisty,'' Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the Pacers looked like anything but a team
ready to roll over, as they raced to a 64-45 halftime lead that had
the Lakers shaking their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Miller came out firing, each going 4 for 4 to start the
game, each scoring 11 points by the end of the first quarter, as
the Pacers established a 39-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy gets into a groove like that, it's hard to stop him,''
Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also proved difficult to sustain the incredible energy
level that carried the Lakers to victory in Game 4. Or to suppress
the obvious excitement of being on the verge of a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always a comedown,'' Fox said. ``There's a lot
of emotion, in terms of buildup towards the game, what the game
meant, the anticipation of becoming champions, their energy of
obviously not wanting to be eliminated on their home court and
watch us celebrate. We did not match that.''

LAKERS FIGHT TO KEEP SHARP FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS -- There was only one task left for coach Phil
Jackson on Friday, prior to potentially the Lakers' last game of
the season: Eliminate overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   And, Jackson admitted before tipoff, ``it's a mystery to me''
how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about it, it's just difficult to do. There's too
much speculation and plans,'' Jackson said before Game 5 of the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Losing focus seemed to be the only thing that would stand
between the Lakers and a fourth victory over the Indiana Pacers to
claim the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to talk some period of time today about being in
the moment, you know, simple, task-oriented kind of details,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no question the Lakers were feeling the excitement
of being on the verge of winning it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a natural excitement that you can feel about this team
and I'll work on that before the game,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mike: The overtime heroics and 28-point night in Game 4
naturally elicited comparisons between Kobe Bryant and Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Michael play maybe 115 playoff games. He probably had 90
games at the level (Bryant)'s had this one,'' Jackson said. ``And
not to take anything away from Kobe, but we got used to the way
Michael played and the level he played at. To see someone reach
close to the way he could play is enough of a hint to want to make
us recapture that lure that Michael held out for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Kobe's young. He's probably a better player at 21 than
Michael was at 21. He has a wonderful future and we hope that he
can fill those mighty big shoes. The chances are, he's not. Because
he's just a special player, but he's still going to be a terrific
player. He's got a lot of years to develop into that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Idols: Shaquille O'Neal expressed his great respect this week
for Indiana coach Larry Bird, calling the former Boston Celtic
``one of my favorite players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I had this game (with a friend), his
name was Mitch Riles, he was my best friend. A white guy. Of
course, he was Bird and I was Magic (Johnson),'' O'Neal said. ``We
used to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But watching my friend play, I learned to appreciate what Bird
did for the game. I knew Bird was good when that one time where he
had the ball, he was falling out of bounds, he didn't have anywhere
to pass it to, he shot it over the backboard. I knew (then) he was
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Idols II: O'Neal's list of role models at the center position
offered a surprise or two. Among the obvious, he named Patrick
Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson. But he raised eyebrows
and got a few laughs with his other choices - Charles Shackelford
and Rony Seikaly.
</P>
<P>
   Seikaly? ``No really. Remember how Seikaly used to dunk at
Syracuse, he used to lift his legs up? That's why Seikaly,'' O'Neal
said. He called Shackelford ``my favorite center'' and ``the
original Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   But as for his all-time favorite, it was Olajuwon, ``and still
is Hakeem, because he was a competitor, never really complained
when he played against me. He was a warrior, never raised his
voice, always smiled. Off the court, he was a nice, calm guy. I
always said to myself, if I was compared to anybody, I would like
to be compared to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Bryant continued to receive treatment Friday on the
sprained left ankle he suffered a week ago and Jackson said the
injury is ``about the same. I don't think there's a lot of
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The sprain will require a few weeks to heal, but Bryant was able
to play 47 minutes on Wednesday without aggravating the injury. He
was limited to light work at Friday morning's shootaround.

ROUGH STUFF BREAKS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Series have a way of getting rougher the deeper
they go, so it came as no surprise that each team was tagged with a
pair of technicals Friday in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, according to Pacers guard Reggie Miller, is who's
initiating the rough play: Not the nasty guys from the physical
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the scuffles are coming from them, which is a
shock,'' Miller said. ``Everyone thinks they're so nice and pretty
and, you know, they're the glamour boys. It's Los Angeles, Evian,
cafe latte, all that crap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing all the pushing, the holding. They look at the
refs like they're not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, it should be noted, gave an elbow to Rick Fox as he
walked by him during a stoppage in play in the fourth quarter. Fox
started walking closely behind Miller and was tagged with a
technical, as was Pacers guard Mark Jackson, who wouldn't stop
barking, irritating Indiana coach Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's nonsense,'' Bird said. ``He wouldn't quit. The
referees told him at least three, four times to get away, and he
wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's going to give Rick Fox a kiss, get away
and let's get on with it. We had a good lead at the time. Just play
and get the game over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, naturally, had a different take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach has his opinion,'' Jackson said. ``He's the head
coach. But I think we have to step it up. I think as leaders of
this basketball team, we have to spark something, to make a
statement that we're not going to lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye, Larry: Bird wasn't caught up in winning Friday
because it was his last game as the Pacers coach in Indiana, as
much as wanting to keep the Finals alive and not end the season at
home on a losing note.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had such a great year in this building,'' Bird said.
``We were very disappointed we lost on Wednesday. You hate to end
the year losing two in a row. Our fans have supported us. We've had
great success here. We didn't want to go out here with a loss
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, too, were too concerned with the bigger picture to get
sentimental over Bird's last game at Conseco Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last game here for a lot of guys, not just Larry,''
said Miller, one of six Pacers who can become free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Best of it: Left-hander Travis Best, who sprained his left
shoulder when slammed to the floor after a flagrant foul on
Shaquille O'Neal in the previous game, played 10 minutes in the
first half, hitting both of his field goals and passing out three
assists.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pacers up in double-figures throughout the second half,
he did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got into the second half, it was too sore and too
tight,'' Best said. ``And we were up by 20 points, so there was no
need to go back in the game. Hopefully, with a couple of days rest,
it'll be better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude thing: Forward Austin Croshere, who added 13
points and nine rebounds off the bench, said the Pacers' confidence
had been dragging after Wednesday's overtime loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much of a pulse after Game 4, to be honest,''
he said. ``In the locker room after the game, in practice the next
day, it was like a morgue around here. Confidence builds from
humble beginnings, and certainly now, we feel like we're right back
in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``We absolutely, positively, have nothing to lose
and everything in the world to gain. So we're going to play free,
loose, we don't care. There's no pressure on us. All the pressure's
on them. From the get-go, they were supposed to beat us. They were
supposed to sweep us. We have nothing to lose, ... so who cares?''

DE LA HOYA TO FACE BATTLE IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the ring tonight, Oscar De La Hoya will face
one of the toughest challenges of his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime around 8 p.m., De La Hoya will defend his welterweight
championship at Staples Center against a challenge from Shane
Mosley. But, when the fight's over, win or lose, De La Hoya has
another battle on his hands. He must defend himself in Los Angeles
Superior Court against civil charges that he raped an underage girl
after getting her drunk.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya and members of his camp vociferously deny that the
welterweight champion of the world forced himself upon 15-year-old
Nicole Rao in June 1996. Rao, now an adult, claims she was raped by
the boxer after meeting him in a Cabo San Lucas nightclub. She was
visiting Mexico with high school friends.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya denies Rao's claim, which is graphically detailed in
court papers filed by Rao's attorney in May.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no physical evidence linking De La Hoya to the
alleged crime, a former De La Hoya bodyguard, identified as Eric
Purvis, could provide some damaging testimony if ever called to
testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Purvis told Rao's attorneys that it was a
common practice for De La Hoya to go to nightclubs in search of
underage girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``(One time) Purvis declared he saw Oscar and a friend in a
bedroom in De La Hoya's condominium in Whittier with a girl who
looked, at most, 17, and De La Hoya was trying to take the girl's
jeans off, despite her express protestations of `no, no' and her
appearance of fear,'' the court papers read.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De la Hoya's promoter and president of Top Rank, Inc.
said he doesn't take the comments of Oscar's ex-bodyguard
seriously. Many of those comments were printed in Sports
Illustrated earlier this week
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course not,'' he said. ``That piece was one of the
worst pieces of journalism I've seen. Oscar's attorneys are
considering taking legal action against SI. That article is
slanderous. Oscar doesn't deserve anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The court papers also contain accounts from Rao's friends that
indicate De La Hoya knew he was leaving the Cabo Wabo club with an
underage girl. He has denied those claims.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Rao's said he yelled to the boxer, ``Oscar, what are
you doing? She's only 15 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Another classmate said she yelled to De La Hoya in Spanish,
``Quince anos'' - 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the boxer, Rao has filed suit against his brother, Joel
De La Hoya Jr., and friend Joey Gonzales. Both men have denied
Rao's claim that they assisted the boxer and attempted to cover up
for him.
</P>
<P>
   A key point of Rao's case relies on depositions from Joel De La
Hoya Jr. and Gonzales that greatly differ from Oscar De La Hoya's
account of his meeting with Rao.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the court papers - essentially a motion asking for
detailed financial information about the boxer - describe the
alleged assault in graphic detail.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the motion, originally scheduled for Wednesday, has
been postponed until Aug. 17. Trial in the case is tentatively
scheduled for Nov. 13. Rao is seeking an unspecified amount of
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Attending a weigh-in for tonight's fight, De La Hoya's father,
Joel De La Hoya Sr., admitted he knows little about the allegations
against his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say nothing because I don't know nothing,'' the elder
De La Hoya said. ``These things only Oscar knows. I don't know
nothing.''

DODGERS' HERSHISER DISAPPOINTING IN RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That April afternoon at Dodger Stadium seems like
ancient history, the exception rather than the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser believes he can still pitch, but nights like
Friday's 6-3 loss to St. Louis are disheartening for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start for the Los Angeles Dodgers since being
recalled from Single-A San Bernardino on Tuesday, Hershiser (1-3)
gave up five earned runs and seven hits in four-plus innings. Three
of those runs came in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser blamed shooting pain in his hip as a factor but added
he wasn't feeling all together anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw pretty poorly,'' he said. ``It's been a struggle.
Including the minors, that's the worst I've been throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hershiser remains in the rotation (his next start will
be next week in Houston), but one wonders how many more chances he
will get with more starts like this.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring the first two batters he faced, Hershiser gave up
the first of Jim Edmonds' two home runs. Then he hit Mark McGwire
and walked Ray Lankford and gave up an RBI double to Eric Davis,
Lankford scoring on the throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I battled through it but didn't get results,'' Hershiser said.
``You need to execute enough good pitches to have the breaks of
baseball go your way. I didn't give us continued opportunities to
do well.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hershiser left, his ERA had increased from 10.70 to
10.80, and his six innings of one-run ball in the home opener April
14 against Cincinnati seemed as far away as 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He left the game with two runners on, none out and the score
tied at 3-3. Matt Herges failed to retire the side before those two
scored on RBI singles by Davis and Matheny.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's woes seem to be lower on Johnson's priority list.
With suspensions looming, the personnel juggle continues.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Johnson said third baseman Adrian Beltre, who
has been disabled since May 28 with a strained hamstring, will be
activated today. That leaves a roster move to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said something will be done with catcher Adam Melhuse,
who was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque earlier Friday. Melhuse,
who came up when pitcher Al Reyes was sent down, made his
major-league debut in the ninth inning as a pinch hitter and struck
out against Dave Veres. Veres earned his 12th save in relief of Pat
Hentgen (6-6).
</P>
<P>
   Melhuse either will be optioned or traded but doesn't know
which. He said the Dodgers told him to report to the stadium today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know as much as you do,'' Melhuse said. ``All I know is
Beltre's coming off. They need a spot and I'm the spot. I think I
could help this team, but (he shrugged his shoulders) that's just
my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, the former Angel playing in his first game in Los
Angeles as a Cardinal, added a ninth-inning home run off Mike
Fetters. It was his first multi-homer game for St. Louis and ninth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros hit his 19th home run in the second inning, and the
Dodgers tied the score with Shawn Green's two-run double in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen went six innings and gave up the three earned runs and
seven hits with two walks, a hit batter and three strikeouts.

THE HARVARD FAST TRACK: FROM INCORPORATION TO FUNDING IN 4 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Repeating to correct slug. No other changes.)  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JOHN SOLOMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On their first day at Harvard Business School, a dean told the
students of the class of 1975 that what they would learn there
would prepare them less for the job they would take immediately
after graduation than the job they would have in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, one of those students is up for a
big management position that has never been filled by someone with
such preparation. If he gets the job, George W. Bush would be the
first president with a master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not a part of his biography that he often discusses,
Bush is in many ways the archetypal Harvard Business School-trained
manager. As someone who went through the same training, 16 years
after Bush, I find it striking how his style _ generalist, big
picture, highly delegative _ is almost exactly in line with the
management approach taught at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But is that a good thing? Is a Harvard MBA appropriate training
for the presidency? How much of George W. Bush, presidential
candidate, is really a reflection of his Harvard years?
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Charge To Keep'' (William Morrow &AMP;
Co., 1999), Bush mentions his time at Harvard only briefly, calling
it ``a turning point for me'' that taught ``the principles of
capital, how it is accumulated, risked, spent, managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates and professors say that while the raw elements of
Bush management were in place when he arrived at Harvard, business
school had a significant role in melding his style.
</P>
<P>
   They remember a relaxed attitude and an unusual confidence that
stood out even in a class of some of America's most confident. They
scoff at the suggestion that Bush is not smart enough to be
president _ though, of course, that is not necessarily an impartial
view, given that his grades fell in the middle of the bell curve,
along with most of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was known as a quick study _ not a very deep thinker, but
an efficient one. In class, he was more of a listener than a
participant. (That may be why Bush left Harvard without having
substantially improved his extemporaneous speaking abilities,
though it also may be that heredity ultimately trumps business
school.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he distinguished himself more in team-oriented
activities. Whether in the campuswide business simulation game or
on the intramural basketball court, he was often the consensus
choice to run things.
</P>
<P>
   ``George's leadership was not based on raw brain power,''
recalled Mitch Kurz, a classmate who now runs his own marketing
consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn. ``He had an intangible quality
about him, that there wasn't a problem that couldn't be solved _
not necessarily by him, but somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   In 92 years of training presidents, Harvard Business School has
never trained a president of the United States. The MBA has not
been widely viewed as proper preparation for a career in politics,
in part because of the management failings of one of the school's
best and brightest: Robert S. McNamara, the former Defense
Secretary. But McNamara's quantitatively driven analytical style,
which led him astray in Vietnam, is actually antithetical to the
more broad-based, qualitative general management taught by Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a misperception _ even among many students in the
school _ that Harvard's management training is applicable solely to
business. It is true that a high percentage of the case studies
used in its courses are corporate situations. Most students come
from the private sector and return there upon graduation. But
Harvard Business School training is much more about process than
content; its problem-solving and decision-making methodology is
easily transferable to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's class, that point was made presciently during
discussion of one of the very rare public-sector case studies, on
the paper flow in the office of Edward M. Kennedy, then as now a
senator from Massachusetts. Classmates said that when a student
challenged the case's relevance to a business degree, the professor
responded: Who knows? Someone in the class could end up as
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From his seat in the top row, Bush _ often relied upon for humor
_ raised his arms over his head in a Nixonesque victory gesture.
</P>
<P>
   MBAs now in elective politics say that course work at business
school _ including marketing, finance, accounting and political
economy _ has become as relevant to governing as any other academic
training, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat who
graduated from the school in 1981, ``is the manager of the largest
and most powerful corporation in the world.'' Of course, the public
sector is different: there, popularity is a more important
performance criterion than profitability, and checks and balances
are not financial terms but constraints on executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Bush made a distinct impression on Section C,
the group of 84 students with whom he would go through his first
year of course work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the front row, and I heard this strange noise
coming from up behind me,'' Kurz recalled. ``I remember thinking,
`What the heck is that?' I turned around and there was George
spitting tobacco juice into a cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the school's forced grading curve, about 5 percent of the
800 or so students in each class will be asked to leave after the
first year. Early on, almost everyone thinks it might be him or
her. ``Plenty of students were scared out of their wits when they
got there,'' said Rudy Winston, who taught Human Behavior and
Organization to Section C that year.
</P>
<P>
   But not Bush, who was 27 and had just completed his service in
the Air National Guard when he arrived at Harvard. Winston
remembers entering the class the first day and seeing Bush flying
paper airplanes. ``George felt that this environment was something
he could handle,'' Winston said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three daily, 80-minute classes at the school, one
student is ``cold called'' to ``open'' with a five-minute action
plan and analysis of a case study, a well-researched narrative of a
real-life situation seen through an executive's eyes. A
free-for-all Socratic discussion follows, with classmates either
building upon or tearing apart the presentation. The stakes are
high, because class participation can count for up to 50 percent of
the grade _ not to mention the thrice-daily opportunity to
embarrass yourself in front of your peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case method relentlessly trains you come up with solutions
to problems,'' said Michael Porter, the Christensen Professor of
Administration, whose first teaching assignment at Harvard was
Bush's Section C class.
</P>
<P>
   The back row of the amphitheater-style classroom is called the
Sky Deck, and ``if the seating chart is an allegory, then George
was the perfect Sky Decker,'' said Charles Braxton, a section mate
who is now an energy company executive in Charlotte, N.C. ``He
wanted to take it all in, hear everybody and pick his spot to make
a big-picture comment.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It was in team activities that Bush asserted himself. In the
three-day, campuswide business simulation game, Section C elected
Bush one of six team presidents. His 15-person ``company'' did not
win, but Porter, the group's faculty supervisor, told the class
that it worked best together and would have had the best long-term
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a star academic performer here,'' said Porter, now
an economic policy adviser to the Bush campaign. ``But he was very
good at getting along with people and getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more evidence of those abilities in the highly
competitive intramural basketball league. Despite hoop skills that
one teammate described as ``mediocre at best,'' Bush, at point
guard, took control of a squad of more talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schroer, a 6-foot-5 former college basketball standout,
acknowledged having been the toughest management challenge. ``I was
a prima donna. I know the rest of the guys appreciated that George
was able to get through to me,'' said Schroer, now vice president
of global marketing at the Ford Motor Co. ``Not too many people in
my life were able to whip me into shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-70s, distrust of the cold certitude of the McNamara
style _ expert-oriented management by numbers _ put a premium on
the consensus-building style of someone like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was keenly aware that the model of putting the expert
_ the smartest guy _ in charge was changing,'' Braxton recalled.
``George was not leading from technical expertise. He was of the
new model that was not afraid of teamwork and of not knowing the
answer to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not yet announced if he will attend the 25th reunion of
his Harvard Business School class in late September, in the heat of
the presidential campaign. If he does, he can be assured his
classmates will be attentive to his comments during planned reunion
classes like ``Business and Politics Along the Technological
Frontier'' and ``National Economies in the Global Village.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to him 25 years ago,'' Kurz joked. ``But the fact
that he could be the leader of the free world does give him a
little more credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gebhard, another Section C student who now runs a
metal-finishing company in Providence, R.I., even has a possible
campaign slogan ready: ``The lawyers and the generals have had
their chance. Why not give an MBA a shot?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Which side are you on?'' goes an old union song.
It's a question patients might be asking their doctors, in the wake
of the Supreme Court's decision, shielding health maintenance
organizations from some lawsuits by patients in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Pegram vs. Herdrich, concerned a woman whose appendix
burst after she was made to wait eight days to take a diagnostic
test for abdominal pain. She contended that her HMO, which, like
many health plans, gave doctors financial incentives to hold down
costs, improperly restricted patients' access to medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision for the health plan made blunt comments
about the role of HMOs in rationing care. Such rationing, the court
said, is intrinsic to the design and mission of HMOs, blessed by
Congress since 1973. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice David
Souter said, ``No HMO organization could survive without some
incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the form of an HMO, ``there must be rationing and
inducement to ration'' care, Souter declared. Such inducements, he
said, especially ``the profit incentive to ration care,'' go ``to
the very point of any HMO scheme.'' If plaintiffs could challenge
such incentives in federal court, he said, it would open the courts
to ``wholesale attacks'' on HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Bloche, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center,
said it was ``stunning to see the Supreme Court say openly that
HMOs ration care.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, when President Clinton was trying to overhaul
the nation's health care system, and in the next three years, when
congressional Republicans tried to encourage the use of HMOs in
Medicare, ``they never talked openly about denying beneficial care
in order to restrain costs,'' Bloche said.
</P>
<P>
   Among HMOs the very word `'rationing'' is radioactive, because
it suggests that some patients are denied treatments they need.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, the industry's main trade association, said: ``HMOs make
decisions weighing costs against benefits. Souter called that
rationing, but there are other ways to talk about it. We try to
provide broad access to care of the highest quality at the lowest
cost. In doing so, a health plan makes decisions about the
appropriateness of care.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say they weigh costs and benefits more systematically than
doctors or hospitals acting alone. However, critics, including many
doctors, say that HMOs, in effect, practice medicine, by putting
pressure on doctors to keep the cost of care within limits set by a
distant corporation, without regard to the needs of a particular
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Some people _ ethicists, mainly _ have suggested that doctors
should talk more openly about cost as a factor in medical
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedside rationing must be done with intelligence and
fairness,'' said Dr. Steven Pearson, director of the Center for
Ethics in Managed Care at Harvard Medical School. ``Rationing of
medical services by individual doctors is both necessary and good.
People want unlimited medical care without unlimited spending. If
you are going to limit health care spending, you must consciously
allocate resources and say no to some beneficial services while
trying to use the money available to produce the greatest good.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Pearson said, ``We can be more up front in talking to
patients about rationing, just as we learned that we can talk to
them about the reality of cancer and imminent death.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Souter simply treated rationing as a fact of life,
and said Congress should distinguish between good and bad forms of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legal principle purporting to draw a line between good and
bad HMOs would embody, in effect, a judgment about socially
acceptable medical risk,'' Souter said. He invited Congress to make
this judgment, saying it was better equipped than the judiciary to
collect and evaluate the data bearing on such complex issues.
</P>
<P>
   Did Souter use the word ``rationing'' in a purposeful way, to
educate the public and foster a more candid debate? Or was he just
unfamiliar with the word's negative connotations?
</P>
<P>
   Bloche said: ``I think Justice Souter knew exactly what he was
doing. The court is trying to shape the debate and make it more
honest.'' In effect, Bloche said, the court was saying to the
American people: ``Wake up. Health plans are holding down costs by
denying beneficial care. The essence of the HMO concept is
rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Alan Bloom, senior vice president and general
counsel of Maxicare Health Plans, a managed care company in Los
Angeles, said: ``The court did not understand the use of the word
`ration.' It's an unfortunate word, which implies that needed care
is being cut back. I'd call it changing the incentives, or changing
the site of care, as medically appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs claimed the court's decision as a victory, but it could
prove costly. Souter, while shutting the door to federal court to
some patients, may have opened the doors of state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sara Rosenbaum of George Washington University, whose
casebook on health law was cited in last week's ruling, said:
``Justice Souter cleared the way for states to create new remedies.
The HMO has a life as a medical provider. If it causes injury by
itself or through its doctors, it may be liable to the patient for
negligence under state law.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, lower courts rejected malpractice and negligence
claims against HMOs providing care through employer-sponsored
health plans. But in rulings over the last 30 months, judges across
the country have allowed patients to pursue such claims in state
courts. Souter's opinion may encourage that trend, for he appeared
to endorse the view of lower federal courts, which have held that
patients may sue HMOs in state court for negligence.
</P>
<P>
   However the issue plays out on the state level, last week's
decision increases the pressure on Congress to clarify the rights
of patients. Jamie Court, a consumer advocate at the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, Calif., said, ``The
decision is a challenge to Congress to settle the question whether
patients should be able to sue HMOs in state court, just as they
can sue companies in other industries that mistreat or injure
consumers.''

   WASHINGTON _ ``Which side are you on?'' goes an old union song.
It's a question patients might be asking their doctors, in the wake
of the Supreme Court's decision, shielding health maintenance
organizations from some lawsuits by patients in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Pegram vs. Herdrich, concerned a woman whose appendix
burst after she was made to wait eight days to take a diagnostic
test for abdominal pain. She contended that her HMO, which, like
many health plans, gave doctors financial incentives to hold down
costs, improperly restricted patients' access to medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision for the health plan made blunt comments
about the role of HMOs in rationing care. Such rationing, the court
said, is intrinsic to the design and mission of HMOs, blessed by
Congress since 1973. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice David
Souter said, ``No HMO organization could survive without some
incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the form of an HMO, ``there must be rationing and
inducement to ration'' care, Souter declared. Such inducements, he
said, especially ``the profit incentive to ration care,'' go ``to
the very point of any HMO scheme.'' If plaintiffs could challenge
such incentives in federal court, he said, it would open the courts
to ``wholesale attacks'' on HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Bloche, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center,
said it was ``stunning to see the Supreme Court say openly that
HMOs ration care.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, when President Clinton was trying to overhaul
the nation's health care system, and in the next three years, when
congressional Republicans tried to encourage the use of HMOs in
Medicare, ``they never talked openly about denying beneficial care
in order to restrain costs,'' Bloche said.
</P>
<P>
   Among HMOs the very word `'rationing'' is radioactive, because
it suggests that some patients are denied treatments they need.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, the industry's main trade association, said: ``HMOs make
decisions weighing costs against benefits. Souter called that
rationing, but there are other ways to talk about it. We try to
provide broad access to care of the highest quality at the lowest
cost. In doing so, a health plan makes decisions about the
appropriateness of care.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say they weigh costs and benefits more systematically than
doctors or hospitals acting alone. However, critics, including many
doctors, say that HMOs, in effect, practice medicine, by putting
pressure on doctors to keep the cost of care within limits set by a
distant corporation, without regard to the needs of a particular
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Some people _ ethicists, mainly _ have suggested that doctors
should talk more openly about cost as a factor in medical
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedside rationing must be done with intelligence and
fairness,'' said Dr. Steven Pearson, director of the Center for
Ethics in Managed Care at Harvard Medical School. ``Rationing of
medical services by individual doctors is both necessary and good.
People want unlimited medical care without unlimited spending. If
you are going to limit health care spending, you must consciously
allocate resources and say no to some beneficial services while
trying to use the money available to produce the greatest good.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Pearson said, ``We can be more up front in talking to
patients about rationing, just as we learned that we can talk to
them about the reality of cancer and imminent death.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Souter simply treated rationing as a fact of life,
and said Congress should distinguish between good and bad forms of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legal principle purporting to draw a line between good and
bad HMOs would embody, in effect, a judgment about socially
acceptable medical risk,'' Souter said. He invited Congress to make
this judgment, saying it was better equipped than the judiciary to
collect and evaluate the data bearing on such complex issues.
</P>
<P>
   Did Souter use the word ``rationing'' in a purposeful way, to
educate the public and foster a more candid debate? Or was he just
unfamiliar with the word's negative connotations?
</P>
<P>
   Bloche said: ``I think Justice Souter knew exactly what he was
doing. The court is trying to shape the debate and make it more
honest.'' In effect, Bloche said, the court was saying to the
American people: ``Wake up. Health plans are holding down costs by
denying beneficial care. The essence of the HMO concept is
rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Alan Bloom, senior vice president and general
counsel of Maxicare Health Plans, a managed care company in Los
Angeles, said: ``The court did not understand the use of the word
`ration.' It's an unfortunate word, which implies that needed care
is being cut back. I'd call it changing the incentives, or changing
the site of care, as medically appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs claimed the court's decision as a victory, but it could
prove costly. Souter, while shutting the door to federal court to
some patients, may have opened the doors of state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sara Rosenbaum of George Washington University, whose
casebook on health law was cited in last week's ruling, said:
``Justice Souter cleared the way for states to create new remedies.
The HMO has a life as a medical provider. If it causes injury by
itself or through its doctors, it may be liable to the patient for

BUSH, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL AND THE MAKINGS OF A PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to correct hed. No other changes.)  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JOHN SOLOMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On their first day at Harvard Business School, a dean told the
students of the class of 1975 that what they would learn there
would prepare them less for the job they would take immediately
after graduation than the job they would have in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, one of those students is up for a
big management position that has never been filled by someone with
such preparation. If he gets the job, George W. Bush would be the
first president with a master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not a part of his biography that he often discusses,
Bush is in many ways the archetypal Harvard Business School-trained
manager. As someone who went through the same training, 16 years
after Bush, I find it striking how his style _ generalist, big
picture, highly delegative _ is almost exactly in line with the
management approach taught at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But is that a good thing? Is a Harvard MBA appropriate training
for the presidency? How much of George W. Bush, presidential
candidate, is really a reflection of his Harvard years?
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Charge To Keep'' (William Morrow &AMP;
Co., 1999), Bush mentions his time at Harvard only briefly, calling
it ``a turning point for me'' that taught ``the principles of
capital, how it is accumulated, risked, spent, managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates and professors say that while the raw elements of
Bush management were in place when he arrived at Harvard, business
school had a significant role in melding his style.
</P>
<P>
   They remember a relaxed attitude and an unusual confidence that
stood out even in a class of some of America's most confident. They
scoff at the suggestion that Bush is not smart enough to be
president _ though, of course, that is not necessarily an impartial
view, given that his grades fell in the middle of the bell curve,
along with most of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was known as a quick study _ not a very deep thinker, but
an efficient one. In class, he was more of a listener than a
participant. (That may be why Bush left Harvard without having
substantially improved his extemporaneous speaking abilities,
though it also may be that heredity ultimately trumps business
school.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he distinguished himself more in team-oriented
activities. Whether in the campuswide business simulation game or
on the intramural basketball court, he was often the consensus
choice to run things.
</P>
<P>
   ``George's leadership was not based on raw brain power,''
recalled Mitch Kurz, a classmate who now runs his own marketing
consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn. ``He had an intangible quality
about him, that there wasn't a problem that couldn't be solved _
not necessarily by him, but somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   In 92 years of training presidents, Harvard Business School has
never trained a president of the United States. The MBA has not
been widely viewed as proper preparation for a career in politics,
in part because of the management failings of one of the school's
best and brightest: Robert S. McNamara, the former Defense
Secretary. But McNamara's quantitatively driven analytical style,
which led him astray in Vietnam, is actually antithetical to the
more broad-based, qualitative general management taught by Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a misperception _ even among many students in the
school _ that Harvard's management training is applicable solely to
business. It is true that a high percentage of the case studies
used in its courses are corporate situations. Most students come
from the private sector and return there upon graduation. But
Harvard Business School training is much more about process than
content; its problem-solving and decision-making methodology is
easily transferable to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's class, that point was made presciently during
discussion of one of the very rare public-sector case studies, on
the paper flow in the office of Edward M. Kennedy, then as now a
senator from Massachusetts. Classmates said that when a student
challenged the case's relevance to a business degree, the professor
responded: Who knows? Someone in the class could end up as
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From his seat in the top row, Bush _ often relied upon for humor
_ raised his arms over his head in a Nixonesque victory gesture.
</P>
<P>
   MBAs now in elective politics say that course work at business
school _ including marketing, finance, accounting and political
economy _ has become as relevant to governing as any other academic
training, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat who
graduated from the school in 1981, ``is the manager of the largest
and most powerful corporation in the world.'' Of course, the public
sector is different: there, popularity is a more important
performance criterion than profitability, and checks and balances
are not financial terms but constraints on executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Bush made a distinct impression on Section C,
the group of 84 students with whom he would go through his first
year of course work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the front row, and I heard this strange noise
coming from up behind me,'' Kurz recalled. ``I remember thinking,
`What the heck is that?' I turned around and there was George
spitting tobacco juice into a cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the school's forced grading curve, about 5 percent of the
800 or so students in each class will be asked to leave after the
first year. Early on, almost everyone thinks it might be him or
her. ``Plenty of students were scared out of their wits when they
got there,'' said Rudy Winston, who taught Human Behavior and
Organization to Section C that year.
</P>
<P>
   But not Bush, who was 27 and had just completed his service in
the Air National Guard when he arrived at Harvard. Winston
remembers entering the class the first day and seeing Bush flying
paper airplanes. ``George felt that this environment was something
he could handle,'' Winston said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three daily, 80-minute classes at the school, one
student is ``cold called'' to ``open'' with a five-minute action
plan and analysis of a case study, a well-researched narrative of a
real-life situation seen through an executive's eyes. A
free-for-all Socratic discussion follows, with classmates either
building upon or tearing apart the presentation. The stakes are
high, because class participation can count for up to 50 percent of
the grade _ not to mention the thrice-daily opportunity to
embarrass yourself in front of your peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case method relentlessly trains you come up with solutions
to problems,'' said Michael Porter, the Christensen Professor of
Administration, whose first teaching assignment at Harvard was
Bush's Section C class.
</P>
<P>
   The back row of the amphitheater-style classroom is called the
Sky Deck, and ``if the seating chart is an allegory, then George
was the perfect Sky Decker,'' said Charles Braxton, a section mate
who is now an energy company executive in Charlotte, N.C. ``He
wanted to take it all in, hear everybody and pick his spot to make
a big-picture comment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was in team activities that Bush asserted himself. In the
three-day, campuswide business simulation game, Section C elected
Bush one of six team presidents. His 15-person ``company'' did not
win, but Porter, the group's faculty supervisor, told the class
that it worked best together and would have had the best long-term
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a star academic performer here,'' said Porter, now
an economic policy adviser to the Bush campaign. ``But he was very
good at getting along with people and getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more evidence of those abilities in the highly
competitive intramural basketball league. Despite hoop skills that
one teammate described as ``mediocre at best,'' Bush, at point
guard, took control of a squad of more talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schroer, a 6-foot-5 former college basketball standout,
acknowledged having been the toughest management challenge. ``I was
a prima donna. I know the rest of the guys appreciated that George
was able to get through to me,'' said Schroer, now vice president
of global marketing at the Ford Motor Co. ``Not too many people in
my life were able to whip me into shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-70s, distrust of the cold certitude of the McNamara
style _ expert-oriented management by numbers _ put a premium on
the consensus-building style of someone like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was keenly aware that the model of putting the expert
_ the smartest guy _ in charge was changing,'' Braxton recalled.
``George was not leading from technical expertise. He was of the
new model that was not afraid of teamwork and of not knowing the
answer to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not yet announced if he will attend the 25th reunion of
his Harvard Business School class in late September, in the heat of
the presidential campaign. If he does, he can be assured his
classmates will be attentive to his comments during planned reunion
classes like ``Business and Politics Along the Technological
Frontier'' and ``National Economies in the Global Village.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to him 25 years ago,'' Kurz joked. ``But the fact
that he could be the leader of the free world does give him a
little more credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gebhard, another Section C student who now runs a
metal-finishing company in Providence, R.I., even has a possible
campaign slogan ready: ``The lawyers and the generals have had
their chance. Why not give an MBA a shot?''

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Washington) _ The remarkable summit meeting

<P>
   NATIONAL-GUARD-BOSNIA (Eagle Base, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ For
years, the National Guard and Reserves have had to endure lingering
doubts within the regular Army that their part-time soldiers have
what it takes to carry out important military operations. But as
the Army relies more heavily on Guard and Reserve units, Guard and
Reserve commanders argue that the nation's citizen-soldiers bring
something else that their active-duty counterparts cannot:
experience and skills honed in the civilian world. ``In the
National Guard, we deal with civilians a little better,'' said Lt.
John K. Bahrami, a computer consultant for IBM and a member of the

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICAL-SATIRE (Moscow) _ In what looks to many here
like a twilight struggle over the future of free speech, the
Kremlin has handed one journalist over to Chechen guerrillas,
demanded that newspapers obtain federal licenses and, on Tuesday,
slapped Russia's leading press baron in a notoriously lice-ridden
prison. But the litmus test of the Kremlin's intentions may be
whether it tries to crack down on a bunch of grotesque, legless
latex dolls. The dolls _ a jug-eared, sheep-eyed President Vladimir
Putin; his Rasputinesque staff chief, Alexander Voloshin; dead-on
renditions of balding Communists, woolly-headed right-wingers and
other famous rogues _ are the cast of ``Kukly,'' which has long

exercised from the shadows in the last two years of his father's

   ITALY-REGULATIONS (Rome) _ Vittorio Giunta, 48, is a rebel with
an unlikely cause. He is fighting city government, two
hairdressers' unions and dozens of small trade associations for the
right to keep his hairdressing shop open when the moon is full. He
and some of his clients believe that the best time to cut hair is
under a full moon, an ancient superstition that has not entirely
died out in Italy. That belief, however, clashes with a more

   ARIZ-BORDER (Douglas, Ariz.) _ With new law enforcement

with Mexico harder to penetrate, the rugged area around Douglas has
come under siege by desperate migrants seeking illegal entry into
the United States. After federal agencies bolstered security at
once-popular crossing points, hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants began flooding the Douglas area two years ago, risking
inhospitable desert conditions, including poisonous snakes and
daytime temperatures well above 100 degrees. But lately, they have
encountered another threat: angry ranchers on the outskirts of
Douglas who have grown so weary of border crossers tramping across
their land in groups of 50 and more that some ranchers, taking
matters into their own hands, have detained them at gunpoint until
Border Patrol agents arrived. By Michael Janofsky.

   SUMMER-JOBS (Undated) _ For the last 10 years, fewer teen-agers
and young adults have been venturing into the summer work force.
Last year, even with desperate managers dangling finder's fees,
tuition plans and other lures, just 62 percent of America's 16
million people between 16 and 19 years old were in the labor force.
That compared with a high of 71.8 percent in 1978, and was the
lowest percentage since July 1965. The trend is most pronounced
among young men, whose summer employment rate of 65 percent is down
from 73.5 percent in 1989 and is the lowest since the Bureau of
Labor Statistics started keeping track in 1948. By Mary Williams
Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME-STATS (Undated) _ With the number of homicides in some of
the nation's big cities rising in 1999 and the first five months of
2000, after eight years of sharp drops, concern is rising among law
enforcement officials and criminologists about whether the decline
in violent crime has finally come to an end. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   ALLIGATOR-FARM (Camilla, Ga.) _ Mark A. Glass is one of the
largest alligator farmers in Georgia, and one of 10 in the state
who are exploring the synergies of raising chickens beside gators.
Officials with various poultry associations said that there might
be a few such operations in other states but that Georgia, which
calls itself the largest chicken-producing state, seemed to be the
epicenter of experimentation. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SLUSH-FUND (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The office of
California's insurance commissioner has been hit by a scandal that
threatens to cost him his job and the tottering California
Republican Party some of its hopes for rejuvenation in Election
2000. The commissioner, Chuck Quackenbush, one of only two
Republicans currently holding statewide office, is fighting charges
that he allowed half a dozen insurance companies to shortchange
earthquake victims, and that in return the companies financed
nonprofit foundations he set up to funnel himself political slush
money. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY-POLITICS (Orlando, Fla.) _ Eight years after the Clinton
campaign adopted ``It's the economy, stupid'' as its mantra, the
presidential race of 2000 has raised an intriguing question: Has
the new economy changed some of the old rules of politics? By
Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   JANITORS-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ What kind of movie premiere is
held in midafternoon, without a foot of red carpet in sight and
with most of the audience wearing the same outfit? A premiere that
knows its target audience, most of whom had to get to work by 5:30.

   REPUBS-NOMINATION-PROCESS (Washington) _ Most politicians do not
go out of their way to say the public does not know what it is
talking about. But Jim Nicholson cheerfully takes on the
three-fourths of the American people who say they want a national
primary to pick their presidential nominees. Nicholson, the
chairman of the Republican National Committee, responded to that
finding, in a New York Times/CBS News Poll in May, by saying the
public was ``wrong, wrong, wrong.'' By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   VA-SENATE-RACE (Alexandria, Va.) _ The last Democrat standing
between Virginia Republicans and a sweep of statewide power this
year is Sen. Charles Robb, a politician unceremoniously rated
``toast'' a year ago by political handicappers. The senator trailed
12 points behind a formidable Republican challenger, former Gov.
George F. Allen, prompting widespread speculation that Robb might
wisely retreat and call it a decent career after 12 years in the
Senate. But to the surprise of Democrats as much as Republicans,
that gap has now closed to a 1-point tossup in the face of an

   RE: Update on New Lines of Business
</P>
<P>
   As you would of heard by now, the recent LCN 2000 initiative to
increase annual revenue by hustling stocks to greedy investors met
with a setback last week due to unforeseen federal indictments. We
see this as another misguided attempt by headline-hunting
prosecutors to discourage innovation and limit competition in the
growing global organized-crime business. Be that as it may, I am
pleased to give you this update on various other LCN 2000 strategic
business initiatives, all firmly anchored to our well-established
brand names:
</P>
<P>
   HELLO? OMERTA CALLING! _ Keyed off our trademarked Code of
Silence, we offer a service to clients who are irritated by those
rude people using their cell phones at theaters, in restaurants and
elsewhere. Just dial 1-800-SILENCE, provide a (legit only!)
credit-card number, and presto: An Omerta agent, like our New York
rapid-response rep Santore ``Crunchie'' Multimalo, arrives on the
scene, forcibly removes the cell phone from the offending party and
_ here's the beautiful part _ eats it.
</P>
<P>
   MAFIONYMS _ Ever since Joe Valachi started squealing in the
1960s, Americans have been fascinated by mob nicknames. Until now,
these monikers have been strictly reserved for our own associates.

a personal consultation at a convenient Mafionym(R) kiosk at your
local shopping mall. Badda-bing, badda-bang, badda-boom, you walk
away with your very own mob nickname _ just like the real ones.
Testimonials from happy customers are pouring in:

   AQUA PERSUASION _ You might of read in the paper last week that
some fancy restaurants are pressuring customers to order expensive
bottled water to pad those dinner and lunch checks. Overworked
small-restaurant owners without pushy staff can now hustle the H20
just like the big joints. Simply call in our Aqua Persuasion(R)
sales team! Our surly bruisers will arrive tableside wearing
T-shirts that say, ``Excuse me, you  &UR; are &LR;  having the bottled
water.'' Watch those bottles of Evian and Pellegrino move!
</P>

partnership with one of our Brooklyn dessert-foods subsidiaries: I
SCREAM, YOU SCREAM, YOU BETTER STOCK THIS ICE CREAM(R).)

passive-aggressives at your HMO who refuse to approve treatment for
that pesky heart attack or broken leg? Just call Cover Me or Talk
to Them(R) and our specially trained HMO negotiators will get right
on the case! Within hours, those HMO chumps will display a new
understanding of terms like necessary procedure and
hospitalization. Know what I mean? No paperwork!
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, we here at LCN 2000 are neither resting on our
laurels nor going to the mattresses as we look at the exciting
challenges facing the commission in this high-tech, entrepreneurial
world. Look for lots of exciting news in coming months, including

initial public offering, I-GOT-YOUR-VIRUS-RIGHT-HERE.COM. And
development is well underway for two new network game shows, ``Who

reality-based show in which some of the boys make a surprise visit
each week to various old friends currently in the federal witness
protection program.
</P>
<P>
   So what if we took a hit in the stock market! Our future is
bright, gentlemen, because we're organized, we're flexible, we're
LCN 2000, the family brand.

   MOSCOW _ By any standard measure of democracy, Russia now more
than ever desperately needs a credible political opposition. But
until last week, President Vladimir Putin didn't really have any _
not in the Parliament, not in the regions, not among top business
leaders, and certainly not among a population that, more than
anything, wants someone to put its unruly society in order.
</P>
<P>
   After ten years of democratic bedlam, many Russians seem to have
rediscovered an ancient yearning to obey that makes them a perfect
match for Putin, a KGB veteran who prefers loyal servants to
political partners in this vast and cumbersome country.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the jailing last Tuesday of Vladimir Gusinsky,
Putin may have actually stirred up some real opposition. Gusinsky
was charged with embezzlement and released Friday. And as the
Gusinsky affair moves to its next, more political, phase, the
spotlight will be on Putin's ability to handle a challenge that has
now spread far beyond the boundaries of Gusinsky's media empire.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, during Boris Yeltsin's tenure as president,
when Gusinsky _ himself no slouch at the rough and cynical game of
Russian power politics _ enjoyed the Kremlin's favor. But by the
time of his arrest, his media empire had become a rare, if not the
last, center of resistance to the Putin political machine.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky made his dramatic break more than a year ago, when he
and his media outlets took aim at Yeltsin's cozy cabal of insiders
and intriguers, henceforth labeled the Family. As the Family's
fortunes kept rising, together with Putin's popularity and eventual
election, Gusinsky fell ever further from favor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin set about bringing his other political
opponents to heel. Some, like the governor of St. Petersburg,
Vladimir Yakovlev, jumped into his lap; others like Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov in Moscow needed first to be shown their place before they
were allowed back into the inner circle. The rest of Russia's
rambunctious governors will be reined in by new laws that tighten
the Kremlin's control of the regions through the installation of
seven superloyal ``supergovernors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gusinsky _ whose television station has not only criticized
the president and his war in Chechnya, but also regularly mocked
him on a popular Sunday-night puppet show _ never even got a chance
to make amends. According to Kremlin insiders, Putin has frequently
wondered aloud why Gazprom, Russia's half-state-owned natural gas
company and a shareholder in Gusinsky's Media-MOST, should help
subsidize flagrant ``anti-state'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even this sliver of an opposition seems to irk Putin, who,
unlike Yeltsin, shuns confrontation and bristles at criticism.
Yeltsin's eight years in power were marked by his running fight
with a Communist opposition, and by his laissez-faire approach to
other power centers _ in the regions, in the press or among
Russia's rapacious capitalists, known as the oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin rose to power, riding a wave of nationalism let loose
by the Chechen war, these alternate power centers offered no
resistance. The Communists, who have long posed as Russian
patriots, were hard-pressed to challenge Putin's bellicosity in
Chechnya. The liberal intelligentsia (including some of the press)
was alarmed by Putin's background and his sometimes dim
understanding of democratic norms, but they no longer carry much
weight in a society which, after the disappointments of the last
ten years, views liberal Western values with suspicion. Businesses
are hoping Putin will abide by his promise to restore the rule of
law and treat them equally (though others point out that his words
were ``dictatorship of the law'').
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Tuesday, while Putin was in Madrid dining with the
Spanish royal family, Gusinsky was thrown into one of Russia's
toughest and most antiquated jails. Whether the charges are
eventually proved or not, they are widely considered here to be a
pretext to finish off the last of the anti-Kremlin opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But if that was indeed the plan, events don't seem to be
cooperating. Politicians, journalists and businessmen have rushed
for the microphones to denounce the move against Gusinsky, a media
magnate who also happens to be a leader of Russia's Jewish
community. Suddenly Putin's hold on Russia's slippery political
scene looks less firm than it did just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and journalists condemned the arrest, but perhaps
the most significant voices were those of 17 representatives of big
business _ oligarchs _ who signed an open letter of protest to
Putin. ``They are looking at Gusinsky's story as if in a mirror,''
said Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal-democratic Yabloko
party.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Putin himself ordered the arrest, or whether he was set
up by schemers inside the Family, he stands a good chance of coming
out a loser. If he distances himself from the arrest, many Russians
say, he could look weak, even foolish. If he supports it, he will
confirm every Russian democrat's worst fears about the dangers of
putting a former KGB officer in charge. Some commentators have
noted that the arrest of Gusinsky may actually be popular: Most
Russians hate rich businessmen, particularly if they are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But opinion polls are not what drives politics in Russia:
politics here are a zero-sum game, which is all about getting
power, not sharing it. In a front page editorial, Vitaly Tretyakov,
editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, summed up the stakes: ``Either
Gusinsky is right, and the Kremlin is wrong, or the Kremlin is
right and Gusinsky is wrong. The one who will win this juridical,
political and propaganda war will be right. The winner will take
all.''

last, center of resistance to the Putin political machine.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky made his dramatic break more than a year ago, when he
and his media outlets took aim at Yeltsin's cozy cabal of insiders
and intriguers, henceforth labeled the Family. As the Family's
fortunes kept rising, together with Putin's popularity and eventual
election, Gusinsky fell ever further from favor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Putin set about bringing his other political
opponents to heel. Some, like the governor of St. Petersburg,
Vladimir Yakovlev, jumped into his lap; others like Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov in Moscow needed first to be shown their place before they
were allowed back into the inner circle. The rest of Russia's
rambunctious governors will be reined in by new laws that tighten
the Kremlin's control of the regions through the installation of
seven superloyal ``supergovernors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gusinsky _ whose television station has not only criticized
the president and his war in Chechnya, but also regularly mocked
him on a popular Sunday-night puppet show _ never even got a chance
to make amends. According to Kremlin insiders, Putin has frequently
wondered aloud why Gazprom, Russia's half-state-owned natural gas
company and a shareholder in Gusinsky's Media-MOST, should help
subsidize flagrant ``anti-state'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even this sliver of an opposition seems to irk Putin, who,
unlike Yeltsin, shuns confrontation and bristles at criticism.
Yeltsin's eight years in power were marked by his running fight
with a Communist opposition, and by his laissez-faire approach to
other power centers _ in the regions, in the press or among
Russia's rapacious capitalists, known as the oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin rose to power, riding a wave of nationalism let loose
by the Chechen war, these alternate power centers offered no
resistance. The Communists, who have long posed as Russian
patriots, were hard-pressed to challenge Putin's bellicosity in
Chechnya. The liberal intelligentsia (including some of the press)
was alarmed by Putin's background and his sometimes dim
understanding of democratic norms, but they no longer carry much
weight in a society which, after the disappointments of the last
ten years, views liberal Western values with suspicion. Businesses
are hoping Putin will abide by his promise to restore the rule of
law and treat them equally (though others point out that his words
were ``dictatorship of the law'').
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Tuesday, while Putin was in Madrid dining with the
Spanish royal family, Gusinsky was thrown into one of Russia's
toughest and most antiquated jails. Whether the charges are
eventually proved or not, they are widely considered here to be a
pretext to finish off the last of the anti-Kremlin opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But if that was indeed the plan, events don't seem to be
cooperating. Politicians, journalists and businessmen have rushed
for the microphones to denounce the move against Gusinsky, a media
magnate who also happens to be a leader of Russia's Jewish
community. Suddenly Putin's hold on Russia's slippery political
scene looks less firm than it did just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and journalists condemned the arrest, but perhaps
the most significant voices were those of 17 representatives of big
business _ oligarchs _ who signed an open letter of protest to
Putin. ``They are looking at Gusinsky's story as if in a mirror,''
said Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal-democratic Yabloko
party.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Putin himself ordered the arrest, or whether he was set
up by schemers inside the Family, he stands a good chance of coming
out a loser. If he distances himself from the arrest, many Russians
say, he could look weak, even foolish. If he supports it, he will
confirm every Russian democrat's worst fears about the dangers of
putting a former KGB officer in charge. Some commentators have
noted that the arrest of Gusinsky may actually be popular: Most
Russians hate rich businessmen, particularly if they are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But opinion polls are not what drives politics in Russia:
politics here are a zero-sum game, which is all about getting
power, not sharing it. In a front page editorial, Vitaly Tretyakov,
editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, summed up the stakes: ``Either
Gusinsky is right, and the Kremlin is wrong, or the Kremlin is
right and Gusinsky is wrong. The one who will win this juridical,
political and propaganda war will be right. The winner will take
all.''

   WASHINGTON _ The images sent imaginations soaring.
</P>
<P>
   On the airport tarmac in Pyongyang last Tuesday, the reclusive,
elusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, reached forward and
greeted his guest, President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, with an
honor guard and a gripping, two-handed handshake. Behind the grins,
it was tempting to see a melting of a half-century of hostility
across the Korean peninsula, one of the world's most dangerous
flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, Bashar Assad, a 34-year-old British-educated
eye doctor who is the new ruler of Syria, stood stoically near the
flag-draped coffin of his father, President Hafez Assad, receiving
condolences from a parade of visiting foreign princes and
dignitaries. One of those visitors was Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, expressing hope _ ever so tentatively _ that the new
Syrian leader might cool off the most enduringly hostile corner of
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, pure coincidence that the two events took
place the same day. But beneath the surface, there are profound
similarities in what was happening last week.
</P>
<P>
   Both North Korea and Syria are relics of another age _
dictatorships based on internal terror and hostility to external
neighbors, threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. And
now Syria, like North Korea six years ago, has embarked on a
dynastic transition that may _ or may not _ give reason to hope for
an easing of those tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In each place, power has passed from a dictator to his son, and
the son shows signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to
solving his country's deep problems. Perhaps that can make the
world more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the disquieting feeling that it won't be easy;
terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the systems in which these
two sons rule, and whether they can _ or even want to _ tame parts
of those systems may be the most important factors in determining
whether a real transformation is under way. Change, for both sons,
will be risky: moving from a terror-based society to a more open
one always is.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of North Korea, Kim Jong Il appears to have made a
strategic, possibly desperate, decision to reach out to the rest of
the world. Even before he pledged during the summit that he would
visit South Korea, he established diplomatic relations with Italy
and secretly visited China. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has
said he will visit North Korea next month, and Japan is negotiating
a possible resumption of relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Syria, the younger Assad, an English- and
French-speaking Internet enthusiast in a country where free speech
is a fantasy and the Internet has been branded a threat to
security, made clear even before he assumed the reins of power that
he was different from his father. ``I am not one of those who keeps
power for himself,'' he told the Egyptian weekly Al Ousboua in an
interview before his father's death. ``I believe in the need to
open up to all opinions and listen to all viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   But for both men, success is not at all guaranteed, and for
remarkably similar reasons. Neither Kim Jong Il nor Bashar Assad
got his job the way his father did _ as a military leader who
grabbed and consolidated power. Even though both countries are
called ``republics,'' the sons did not get their jobs because of
the will of the people. They did not even get their jobs in the
most traditional dynastic way _ through the legitimacy implicit in
royal blood lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the two sons came into power only because of the
political manipulations of their fathers while they were alive,
abetted after their deaths by military and terror apparatuses
bequeathed to the sons as pillars of their respective systems. That
means that their claim to legitimacy is dangerously thin, and any
bold move either at home or abroad is fraught with risks. Both
men's fathers left them societies in bad economic shape, North
Korea's disastrously so. Westerners sometimes see that as a force
dictating an opening to the outside world. But both sons must be
aware that a wrong move in that direction could bring down the
wrath of the military or the ruling party. At the same time,
isolating potential rivals and suddenly placing new power in the
hands of foreign businessmen, or the press, or the people
themselves, could bring down the entire structure of power.

</P>
<P>
   In North Korea's case, for example, Kim inherited the most
isolated regime in the world, one whose people have been fed an
extraordinary stream of propaganda and one where any sudden influx
of real information about how much better the outside world lives
could be enormously destabilizing and dangerous to the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the history of efforts to remove terror from a
political system without bringing it down.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried and failed outright;
his system was too brittle to withstand the sweeping societal,
economic and political changes he envisioned. It simply collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   China, wary of Gorbachev's mistakes, is experimenting with
retaining its Communist Party structure and autocratic government
while opening up its economy to capitalism and foreign investment;
the ultimate outcome of this juggling act is not at all certain
either.
</P>
<P>
   And in Syria's ally Iran, yet another kind of risky transitional
experiment is under way. There clerical leaders are mixing two
volatile chemicals _ Islam and democracy _ in a struggle to
reconcile representative government and the rule of law with
theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, despite Kim Jong Il's opening to the world,
there is no evidence that he intends to open up the political
system for his starving population at home. North Korea is so
closed, its people apparently so quiescent, that when he postponed
the summit for a day, he felt no need to explain why. He could quip
that he knew all about South Korea from watching its television for
years, a right that is denied to his citizens, whose sole radio
station blares government propaganda that good citizens are
expected to leave on all day long. In fact, most of the images of
the two leaders meeting that were beamed to South Korea were not
shown in the North. Virtually no foreigners were allowed to attend
the summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the decision to engage as a decision to open up
North Korean society,'' said Stephen Linton, a Korea expert and
chairman of the nonprofit Eugene Bell Foundation, created to fight
tuberculosis in North Korea. ``These folks are not frustrated
democrats. They have never been educated to question authority. On
the contrary, they have been educated to be loyal to their leader.
Unanimity is a public virtue here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to Linton, who has spent considerable time in North Korea
over the years, the country is a black hole. ``Thirty to 40 years
into Korean studies, I have no idea where this is going,'' he said.
``It's humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, a Mediterranean country with a long mercantile
tradition, the people are much less isolated and more politically
sophisticated. Despite the closed nature of Syrian society and the
authoritarian system of decision-making today, many Syrians
remember the 1950s, when they enjoyed democratic rights under a
multiparty system. But they also remember that the period of
democracy ended in a series of coups; it is the kind of denouement
that sours repressive societies on the soft side of democracy, and
surely there is no nostalgia for that kind of instability, even in
the Syria of the Assads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the stakes for peace in general, it is to be
expected that the outside world is lining up to nudge both North
Korea and, to a lesser extent, Syria, to achieve reasonable
relationships with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea's case, China in particular has reason to act: it
has cultivated relationships with both North and South Korea and
has endured an illegal influx of hundreds of thousands of North
Koreans fleeing the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States is puzzling over what last week's
showmanship means. Clinton administration officials aren't revising
intelligence assessments about the need for a national missile
defense that would define North Korea as the pre-eminent threat. In
fact, one theory at the Pentagon is that Kim Jong Il's outreach
could all be a plot orchestrated by Russia to derail an American
limited missile defense initiative. ``Nothing North Korea does
short of merging with the South and democratizing would change our
calculation about the threat,'' one senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Syria, the signs are more subtle. Both before and since
Hafez Assad's death, the United States has said that it sees little
chance in the short term for progress toward an Israeli-Syrian
peace. Israeli officials are also pessimistic, although some have
painted the new Syrian leader in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that both societies are controlled at
the top, leaving outsiders little leverage to affect change except
through formal state-to-state relations. There are no parliaments
or newspapers or independent groups to bond with.
</P>
<P>
   ``These highly autocratic regimes can use their international
connections to enhance their domestic positions and extract
concessions from the outside world,'' said Stephen Krasner, a
political science professor at Stanford University. ``But the
nature of these regimes also limits the ability of external actors
to alter policies.'' In other words, even those intriguing images
last week of outsiders invited in can be used to keep these
societies closed.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An almost surreal sense of good fortune suffuses
the carnival that is the American economy these days. And that,
paradoxically, is proving to be a challenge to politicians, who are
having trouble finding their footing in a climate where prosperity
seems a given and the biggest issue is not too little money but too
much of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the government can afford tax cuts, spending increases and
the elimination of the national debt, do the terms liberal and
conservative mean anything anymore? When it has been nearly two
decades since the last sustained period of economic trouble, can
anyone claim to be responsible for the good times, or to have the
recipe to keep them rolling?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has the sense of the economy outrunning ideology and
political strategy been more pronounced than in the breathtaking
improvement in the federal government's finances. Analysts in both
parties said last week that budget surplus projections for the next
decade could be revised upward again in the next month by as much
as $1 trillion, an amount roughly equivalent to the entire economic
output of China this year.
</P>
<P>
   That would drive total projected 10-year budget surpluses,
including Social Security and general revenue, to more than $4
trillion, even by conservative estimates. And although the precise
numbers are little more than guesswork _ and could drop sharply if
the economy or the stock market goes into a protracted swoon _
economists are in broad agreement that there will be large and
growing surpluses for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that good news presented a problem for Vice
President Al Gore by undermining one of the central messages of his
campaign, that Gov. George W. Bush was fiscally irresponsible.
Faced with the likelihood of a much larger surplus, Gore scrambled
to turn the news to his advantage, doubling the size of his tax
cut, proposing his own version of retirement savings accounts and
making the case for additional spending on education, health care
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   With his expensive platform of tax cuts, Social Security
overhaul and a national missile defense program suddenly looking
more affordable, Bush could have been forgiven a smirk. The Texan
even gained room to claim that he would be committed to debt
reduction, just like his opponent. Yet Bush's insistence that
Washington is profligate and would have to tighten its belt in most
areas other than the military began to ring hollow.
</P>
<P>
   We've got peace and prosperity and a surplus,'' said James
Thurber, a professor of government at American University in
Washington. ``That creates a new kind of politics. They no longer
have to make tough decisions to balance the budget. They no longer
have to cut popular programs to get tax cuts, or to increase taxes,
God forbid, in order to pay for things.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the degree that they no longer define themselves through
the fight over how to allocate scarce resources, the two parties
may have to retool their ideologies or risk losing their
identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old left-right guideposts are no longer reliable,'' said
Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, the
research group for centrist Democrats. ``They hark back to the
conflicts of an industrial society that is being eclipsed by the
new economy. Ideologues in Washington and activists at the grass
roots level have an investment in maintaining the old polarities,
but the electorate is less and less interested in them.''
</P>
<P>
   David Brooks, the author of ``Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper
Class and How They Got There,'' a look at how affluence has made a
hash of traditional value systems and cultural identities, said
prosperity is creating ``a style of politician who goes off in both
directions at once.'' In trying to merge opposing views of the
world, he said, politicians are combining elements of left and
right under rubrics that are given fancy names like the Third Way
but could equally be viewed as ``ideological mush.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that traditional politics and ideology do not matter
at all. It may only have been divided government that has kept
Republicans from using the surplus to slash taxes in a way that
would starve the government of revenues and power in the long run,
and the Democrats from pushing through expensive social programs.
This year's presidential race is in many ways about whether one
party should have a mandate to use the bounty of the long
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But the partisan lines are blurring. Republicans in Congress
have grown more willing to spend money and tolerate, if not
embrace, big and powerful government _ a sea change from 1995, when
the Gingrich revolution promised the elimination of entire cabinet
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I only half-jokingly call the curse of the surplus:
You can't get anyone interested in cutting anything,'' said Stephen
Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political
action committee. ``Politicians are in the game of being able to
give away rather than take away.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the same on the other side of the aisle. Earlier this
month, 65 Democrats in the House voted in favor of repealing the
federal estate tax, and nearly all Democrats voted to slash the
estate tax substantially _ a move the party had long held up as the
epitome of a giveaway to the very richest people at the expense of
the poorest. Class warfare, many Democrats seemed to be saying,
does not make as much sense when most voters are solidly middle
class or above.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fluid situation, the rules of the political game are
uncertain. Gore began a push last week to wrap himself in the
strong economy, assuming that voters, as they always have, will
tend to favor the incumbent party when times are good. But polls do
not show much evidence that Gore is seen as prosperity's steward.
What if voters see the economy as a the creation of rapid
technological change, and no longer connect it with Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins, the next president will have a long list
of immediate and looming issues to address, and fewer fiscal
constraints in doing so than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson.
Or maybe the carnival will pull out of town and leave behind
another mess.

   WASHINGTON _ An almost surreal sense of good fortune suffuses
the carnival that is the American economy these days. And that,
paradoxically, is proving to be a challenge to politicians, who are
having trouble finding their footing in a climate where prosperity
seems a given and the biggest issue is not too little money but too
much of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the government can afford tax cuts, spending increases and
the elimination of the national debt, do the terms liberal and
conservative mean anything anymore? When it has been nearly two
decades since the last sustained period of economic trouble, can
anyone claim to be responsible for the good times, or to have the
recipe to keep them rolling?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has the sense of the economy outrunning ideology and
political strategy been more pronounced than in the breathtaking
improvement in the federal government's finances. Analysts in both
parties said last week that budget surplus projections for the next
decade could be revised upward again in the next month by as much
as $1 trillion, an amount roughly equivalent to the entire economic
output of China this year.
</P>
<P>
   That would drive total projected 10-year budget surpluses,
including Social Security and general revenue, to more than $4
trillion, even by conservative estimates. And although the precise
numbers are little more than guesswork _ and could drop sharply if
the economy or the stock market goes into a protracted swoon _
economists are in broad agreement that there will be large and
growing surpluses for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that good news presented a problem for Vice
President Al Gore by undermining one of the central messages of his
campaign, that Gov. George W. Bush was fiscally irresponsible.
Faced with the likelihood of a much larger surplus, Gore scrambled
to turn the news to his advantage, doubling the size of his tax
cut, proposing his own version of retirement savings accounts and
making the case for additional spending on education, health care
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   With his expensive platform of tax cuts, Social Security
overhaul and a national missile defense program suddenly looking
more affordable, Bush could have been forgiven a smirk. The Texan
even gained room to claim that he would be committed to debt
reduction, just like his opponent. Yet Bush's insistence that

once-popular crossing points, hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants began flooding the Douglas area two years ago, risking
inhospitable desert conditions. But lately, they have encountered
another threat: angry ranchers on the outskirts of Douglas who have
grown so weary of border crossers tramping across their land in
groups of 50 and more that some ranchers, taking matters into their
own hands, have detained them at gunpoint until Border Patrol
agents arrived. By Michael Janofsky.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six years of perilous effort by thousands of
workers have come down to this: The last leg of the $1.3 billion
Red Line subway finally is about to open, offering suburban San
Fernando Valley residents an easy, congestion-free way downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But finishing Los Angeles' subway system has come at a great
cost: $4.5 billion, budget overruns, a street cave-in, business
disruptions, and political wrangling and scandal that rocked the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the MTA throws open the doors to its new Red Line
subway extension to North Hollywood, hoping the prospect of zipping
under the Santa Monica Mountains at 70 mph will attract enough
riders to make the massive investment worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, the subway either is a waste of
sorely needed transportation money, or it transcends the geographic
divide that has split Los Angeles in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way for the huge population in the Valley to come
through into the (Los Angeles) basin, and it is equally important
that people in the basin can get to the Valley on one line without
having to figure out how to get over or around that mountain,''
said MTA General Manager Julian Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really breaks into an entirely different set of people,
simply because it is on the other side of the mountains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Red Line extension consists of stations at North
Hollywood, Universal City and Hollywood Boulevard/Highland Avenue.
It follows the Hollywood Freeway through the Santa Monica
Mountains, diving as deep as 900 feet at some points.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership on the entire MTA subway system is now about 145,000
boardings a day. With the new extension, plus new, faster bus lines
in the Valley that link to the stations, ridership is expected to
climb to 200,000 daily boardings by next year.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if MTA estimates are right.
</P>
<P>
   Valley residents who have previewed the new stations at North
Hollywood, Universal City and Hollywood/Highland say they are
impressed and expect many of their neighbors to start using public
transit.
</P>
<P>
   But ask them if they plan to use it themselves and they hedge.
</P>
<P>
   It depends, they say, on where they need to go and whether the
subway cars remain clean and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Allen, a Studio City Realtor who sat in traffic on the
Hollywood Freeway for more than an hour returning from a recent
trip to City Hall, said he might consider taking the subway. But
he's worried about safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the New York subway in the movies and I see the
crime on it,'' Allen said. ``If nice people are riding on it, I'm
going to ride on it.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials say they have a host of safety features and have
managed to keep crime low on the existing lines. Among their
efforts are regular patrols by transit officers, security cameras
and stations with open-air designs that keep everything in public
view.
</P>
<P>
   The three stations were built on time and under budget for $1.3
billion, unlike the rest of the Red Line, which went over budget by
about 12 percent. Overall, the Red Line subway cost $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood segment of the line, in particular, was beset by
problems. In 1995, a 70-foot sinkhole opened up on Hollywood
Boulevard during construction. A short time later, the MTA fired
the contractor, who promptly responded with a lawsuit. Several
workers died and many more were injured during construction.
Federal occupational safety officials issued multiple fines to
contractors involved in Red Line construction.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood segment had its own problems. Congress,
losing confidence in the MTA, had considered withholding money for
the line. At one point, Congress held up funding until the MTA put
together a plan that reduced rail projects in other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate subcommittee cited the subway's history of cost
overruns, redesigns, corruption, mismanagement, accidents and
political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants along Lankershim Boulevard complained that they lost
millions in dollars in lost business, while the street itself
suffered more than $1 million worth of damage during the
subterranean work.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stark, the MTA's top construction official, said the
agency kept costs under control in this last segment by learning
from past mistakes, keeping a tight rein on the contractors and by
removing certain nonessential elements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a massive ventilation shaft in the middle of the
Santa Monica Mountains was not built. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will not be needed until the system is running at a higher
capacity several decades from now, Stark said, so room was left for
it to be added in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous achievement of any agency and especially the
MTA, given the fact that our history hasn't been that good,'' Stark
said. ``For us to have brought in a project, which had very
difficult tunneling conditions both in North Hollywood and under
the Santa Monica Mountains, without any of the incidents that we
had suffered in the past and still bring the project in under
budget, makes us tremendously proud.''

<P>
   Scientists talk for a living. If this comes as a surprise,
consider that all the experiments and deep thinking of scientific
research take place in what amounts to a global sandbox overrun by
extremely bright toddlers. Incessant communication is how they get
their work done, and passing the secret of how to build the tallest
sand castle to half a dozen of them _ say, those on one side of a
line in the sand marked United States of America _ guarantees that
the entire sandbox will look like downtown Manhattan in about five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As secrets on nuclear terrorism and miniaturized warheads
apparently slip out of Los Alamos National Laboratory and other
federal labs, the message here would seem to be obvious: Do not
give dangerous secrets to scientists. There is, of course, a flaw
in this solution. Governments need the scientists and their culture
of openness to produce weapons that are worth keeping secret in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is why science and secrecy have clashed,
from the Renaissance to the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   That clash, said Dr. Gerald Holton, a professor of physics and
history of science at Harvard University, arises from an inherent
contradiction between the ethos of science and what he called the
obligation and absolute need for the preservation of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Science has served the powerful for centuries. When he was not
changing the world with his painting and scientific investigations,
Leonardo da Vinci moonlighted as a military engineer for Cesare
Borgia, the ruthless model for Machiavelli's Prince. But the sting
of secrecy apparently did not touch scientists until later in the
Renaissance when Niccolo Tartaglia, the Italian mathematician who
computed the first tables for firing cannons to specified
distances, tried to impress a well-connected colleague in hopes of
becoming artillery adviser to the Spanish army.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1540, under a promise of strict secrecy, Tartaglia
revealed how he had solved a famous problem called the cubic
equation. Not only did he not get the job, but his colleague later
published the solution. Tartaglia died an embittered pauper in
Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, Francis Bacon, the British philosopher of
science, wrote that knowledge is power. He was right, but it was
not until the 20th century and research on the atom that
scientists, at any rate, were in a position to realize the full
significance of his words.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy, or at least a severe lack of communication, hampered
the growth of science in Soviet times on both sides of the
superpower conflict. In some cases, the problem was aesthetic.
Speaking of top-flight Russian physics journals, Holton said,
``Whenever they arrived, you opened the first page and you saw this
picture of Stalin on it. And you immediately closed the book.''
Partly as a result, the West vastly underestimated Soviet science
until Sputnik was launched in October 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet science suffered far more severely behind the Iron
Curtain. Apparently hoping for quick improvements in crop yields,
Stalin backed an agronomist named Trofim Denisovich Lysenko, who
favored a Lamarckian version of genetics. Lysenko thought that
altering the surroundings in which plants grew could almost
immediately create new species. His theories would have been
laughed out of any open, international biology conference, but they
managed to keep a stranglehold on Soviet science right through
Khrushchev's regime, which ended in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the defining science-versus-secrecy encounter was the
battle between Gen. Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan
project, which built the atomic bomb during World War II, and the
scientists who actually designed the bomb and showed that it could
work. That conflict, said Dr. Robert Norris, a historian at the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group,
who is working on biography of Groves, was the template for all
those that came after.
</P>
<P>
   Groves' bright idea of giving the scientists uniforms and
military rank was stopped by a revolt led by I.I. Rabi, the
street-smart New Yorker who soon received the Nobel Prize in
physics. Groves also ordered scientists who were involved with
different aspects of the bomb in Los Alamos, N.M., not to talk to
each other about their work. Robert Oppenheimer (or Oppie, as his
Manhattan project colleagues called him), the scientific director
of the project, opposed Groves and won. The scientists kept
talking.
</P>
<P>
   Groves was a difficult boss who disliked scientists in general
and Oppie in particular, wrote two veterans of the project, Dr.
Hans Bethe of Cornell University and Dr. Robert Christy of Caltech,
in a remembrance in the current issue of Physics Today. In the
creation of the bomb, wrote Bethe (another Nobel laureate) and
Christy, Oppenheimer's greatest contribution was his insistence on
this freedom of communication inside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between scientific openness and the governmental
vision of secrecy has continued in this same basic form up to the
present, a case in point being the outrage among some scientists at
the federal labs over polygraph testing and restrictive new
security rules put in place after the recent investigation of Wen
Ho Lee, a Los Alamos scientist suspected of spying for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   There have been lulls in the battle, as in the early 1990s when
Hazel O'Leary, then secretary of energy, who declassified millions
of previously secret documents and allowed some scientists at the
federal labs to publish their most important research results for
the first time. But some analysts later charged that this
outpouring of information helped China to improve its nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Sidney Drell, an emeritus professor at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and a member of a federal
investigative panel that last year looked into security lapses at
the labs, many scientists feel fully capable of drawing and
maintaining the line between classified and unclassified
information in their minds. He blamed managerial ``casualness of
habit'' rather than scientific volubility for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the clash between the sandbox and the bunker is unlikely to
go away. Witness the footers added to e-mail messages sent out by
Dr. Paul Ginsparg, a physicist who does non-weapons research at Los
Alamos and who founded xxx.lanl.gov/, a thriving Web site where
scientists from all over the world post their new work:
</P>
<P>
   ``DISCLAIMER: No sensitive or classified information has been
compromised by the creation of this document, and no foreign
nationals from sensitive countries consulted during its composition
have failed polygraph tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Oppie is smiling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Still, like any other massive government project, the subway
has its share of critics.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's Association, for
example, calls it a ``monumental waste of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a single mass transit system in the country that
doesn't have to be heavily subsidized by taxpayers,'' said
association President Jon Coupal. ``These things do not pay for
themselves. For the most part, mass transit systems provide very
little bang for the buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupal would have preferred spending the money on freeways and
surface streets, as well as incentives to produce more
environmentally friendly cars.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Poole, director of transportation studies at the
Reason Public Policy Institute in West Los Angeles, said the money
would have been better spent building a dedicated bus and
high-occupancy vehicle road along the freeway _ or even a bus
tunnel through the mountains or an elevated deck above the
freeways. Buses, he said, attract more riders because they are more
flexible and reach more destinations throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, I think we will see it will not relieve traffic
congestion in the Cahuenga Pass,'' Poole said. ``That's still going
to be a stop-and-go parking lot 10 years from now. We will
eventually have to look at something like an elevated deck in that
corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the three major types of public transit _ subway,
light rail and buses _ subway is the most expensive to operate,
according to the MTA. The subway costs 79 cents per passenger-mile
to operate currently, although that figure is expected to drop as
ridership increases.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, buses cost 50 cents per passenger-mile and light
rail costs 32 cents per passenger-mile.
</P>
<P>
   While the North Hollywood extension is considered the end of the
line for the subway, Burke foresees a day _ far in the future _
when it may have to be extended farther into the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me after I'm gone that sometime in the
future, Los Angeles County will in fact recognize the absolute need
for further subways,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a successful mass transit system, especially in the
vast sprawl of Los Angeles County, Burke said, is to not rely on
any one system, but to pursue a ``multimodal approach.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the MTA is also starting a new Metro Rapid bus system
along Ventura Boulevard that will connect the Universal City subway
station to Warner Center by bus. The buses will have transponders
that will extend green lights, cutting travel time by about 25
percent. Also, in his latest transportation plan, Gov. Gray Davis
has recommended funds to build a dedicated east-west busway in the
Valley from the North Hollywood station to Warner Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just offering better service overall in our transit
system will attract an increasing number of people out of their
cars,'' Burke said. ``It is becoming more and more difficult to
drive your car, because of the crowding of the freeways. That
crowding of the freeways and roadways is not going to get better
easily. It's going to get worse, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said the subway is expected to give a major
economic boost to the Valley by improving tourists' access to
Universal City and workers' ability to reach Valley employment
centers.

   Scientists talk for a living. If this comes as a surprise,
consider that all the experiments and deep thinking of scientific
research take place in what amounts to a global sandbox overrun by
extremely bright toddlers. Incessant communication is how they get
their work done, and passing the secret of how to build the tallest
sand castle to half a dozen of them _ say, those on one side of a
line in the sand marked United States of America _ guarantees that
the entire sandbox will look like downtown Manhattan in about five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As secrets on nuclear terrorism and miniaturized warheads
apparently slip out of Los Alamos National Laboratory and other
federal labs, the message here would seem to be obvious: Do not
give dangerous secrets to scientists. There is, of course, a flaw
in this solution. Governments need the scientists and their culture
of openness to produce weapons that are worth keeping secret in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is why science and secrecy have clashed,
from the Renaissance to the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   That clash, said Dr. Gerald Holton, a professor of physics and
history of science at Harvard University, arises from an inherent
contradiction between the ethos of science and what he called the
obligation and absolute need for the preservation of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Science has served the powerful for centuries. When he was not
changing the world with his painting and scientific investigations,
Leonardo da Vinci moonlighted as a military engineer for Cesare
Borgia, the ruthless model for Machiavelli's Prince. But the sting
of secrecy apparently did not touch scientists until later in the
Renaissance when Niccolo Tartaglia, the Italian mathematician who
computed the first tables for firing cannons to specified
distances, tried to impress a well-connected colleague in hopes of
becoming artillery adviser to the Spanish army.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the CIA helped overthrow Mohammed Mossadegh as Iran's prime
minister in 1953, ensuring another 25 years of rule for Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, the CIA was already figuring that its first
effort to topple a foreign government would not be its last.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, then just six years old and deeply committed to winning
the Cold War, viewed its covert action in Iran as a blueprint for
coup plots elsewhere around the world, and so commissioned a secret
history to detail for future generations of CIA operatives how it
had been done. The history, which remains classified, was recently
obtained by The New York Times; excerpts were published this spring
and a more complete version is now available on the New York Times
Web site (www.nytimes.com).
</P>
<P>
   Written in the heady aftermath of Tpajax, the code name for the
plot, the CIA history enthusiastically recounted the
accomplishments of the agency's officers. In fact, the coup would
turn out to be the high point in the spy career of its director,
Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore Roosevelt who died 10 days
ago at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   But in a section on what could be learned from the experience,
the history also drew lessons for future conspirators, and today
reads as a prescient warning of the political and strategic risks
that similar covert operations would pose for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, amid the sometimes curious argot of the spy world _
``safebases'' and ``assets'' and the like _ the CIA warns of the
possibilities of ``blowback.'' The word must have been unfamiliar
to the public in 1953 but it has since come into use as a shorthand
for the unintended consequences of covert operations. The CIA's
covert action in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which led to the
empowerment of anti-Western Islamic fundamentalists there in the
1990s, saw to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibilities of blowback against the United States should
always be in the back of the minds of all CIA officers involved in
this type of operation,'' the history cautions.
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of the lessons drawn _ not all of which seem
to have been heeded. Here is a sample.
</P>
<P>
   _ JAMES RISEN
</P>
<P>
   The history warns that the CIA should always count on things
getting very messy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of civil war must be accepted by our military
planners and measures taken within the plan for that eventuality.
Such an eventuality might possibly include the necessity for
establishing a safebase for the new friendly government.
Possibilities and eventualities stemming from civil war can only be
seen upon the analysis of each local situation, but they are not
difficult to foresee and should certainly be planned for ... The
possibility of action against mobs must be considered, including
action against Communist paramilitary forces from factories, etc.
Where this contingency exists it may be necessary to dispose
friendly forces in such a way as to neutralize entire cities
through the use of roadblocks, strong points, traffic control,
curfews, new documentation, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iran operation very nearly failed, and the CIA was on the
verge of abandoning it when the tide turned in its favor. The chief
planner of the coup, Dr. Donald Wilber, who wrote the history, thus
came away from Iran with a fatalistic view of covert action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military planning should include the possibilities of complete
failure and, therefore, should include an evacuation scheme for CIA
and indigenous personnel who might be exposed. Aircraft of American
military attaches, evasion and escape nets, and other operations
assets might have to be employed.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these assets exists then hiding places should be
created in advance of the operation which are kept sterile
throughout ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Military planning should be based upon the principle that some
elements without our friendly forces will be exposed, and that our
operation must not collapse on that account. Therefore, danger
signals should be included which automatically call for movement
from one phase to the other depending upon who or what units have
been exposed to the hostile government. In Iran there was good
reason to believe that danger signals so noted prior to the change
of government were instrumental in keeping alive an operation
which, to an outsider, appeared to have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to topple the Iranian government was made quickly
in Washington in early 1953 by the new Eisenhower administration,
and it represented an abrupt policy change. So the CIA had not done
its homework when called on by President Eisenhower. The CIA's
history discusses its frustrating efforts to get up to speed,
including fruitless contacts with Army intelligence (G-2 in
military shorthand) and draws a cautionary lesson for planners of
future CIA plots: Know a little about a country you may be called
upon to transform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the summer (of 1953) cables were exchanged with the
Tehran Station in an effort to procure the latest information on
the order of battle of Iranian armed forces. The Iranian desk, G-2,
Pentagon, was queried in an effort to obtain whatever information
they could get which might help accomplish the above tasks.
Information available in G-2 was almost nonexistent. Biographical
information on leading Army figures was extremely scanty. G-2 did
not possess a tactical map showing the military situation in the
city of Tehran. It must also be admitted that CIA too was
unprepared for this type of operational plan and a heavy burden had
to be laid upon the field at a time when the Tehran station was
already occupied with the opening phases of Tpajax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary difficulty in staff planning at this time was the
fact that neither the field nor Headquarters possessed detailed
information on military figures in Iran. CIA had heretofore never
placed particular emphasis on that type of operational reporting,
and we learned as the days went by how extremely important, indeed
vital, that type of reporting is.''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the CIA helped overthrow Mohammed Mossadegh as Iran's prime
minister in 1953, ensuring another 25 years of rule for Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, the CIA was already figuring that its first
effort to topple a foreign government would not be its last.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, then just six years old and deeply committed to winning
the Cold War, viewed its covert action in Iran as a blueprint for
coup plots elsewhere around the world, and so commissioned a secret
history to detail for future generations of CIA operatives how it
had been done. The history, which remains classified, was recently
obtained by The New York Times; excerpts were published this spring
and a more complete version is now available on the New York Times
Web site (www.nytimes.com).
</P>
<P>
   Written in the heady aftermath of Tpajax, the code name for the
plot, the CIA history enthusiastically recounted the
accomplishments of the agency's officers. In fact, the coup would
turn out to be the high point in the spy career of its director,
Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore Roosevelt who died 10 days
ago at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   But in a section on what could be learned from the experience,
the history also drew lessons for future conspirators, and today
reads as a prescient warning of the political and strategic risks
that similar covert operations would pose for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, amid the sometimes curious argot of the spy world _
``safebases'' and ``assets'' and the like _ the CIA warns of the
possibilities of ``blowback.'' The word must have been unfamiliar
to the public in 1953 but it has since come into use as a shorthand
for the unintended consequences of covert operations. The CIA's
covert action in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which led to the
empowerment of anti-Western Islamic fundamentalists there in the
1990s, saw to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibilities of blowback against the United States should
always be in the back of the minds of all CIA officers involved in
this type of operation,'' the history cautions.
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of the lessons drawn _ not all of which seem
to have been heeded. Here is a sample.
</P>
<P>
   _ JAMES RISEN
</P>
<P>
   The history warns that the CIA should always count on things
getting very messy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of civil war must be accepted by our military
planners and measures taken within the plan for that eventuality.
Such an eventuality might possibly include the necessity for
establishing a safebase for the new friendly government.
Possibilities and eventualities stemming from civil war can only be
seen upon the analysis of each local situation, but they are not
difficult to foresee and should certainly be planned for ... The
possibility of action against mobs must be considered, including
action against Communist paramilitary forces from factories, etc.
Where this contingency exists it may be necessary to dispose
friendly forces in such a way as to neutralize entire cities
through the use of roadblocks, strong points, traffic control,
curfews, new documentation, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iran operation very nearly failed, and the CIA was on the
verge of abandoning it when the tide turned in its favor. The chief
planner of the coup, Dr. Donald Wilber, who wrote the history, thus
came away from Iran with a fatalistic view of covert action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military planning should include the possibilities of complete
failure and, therefore, should include an evacuation scheme for CIA
and indigenous personnel who might be exposed. Aircraft of American
military attaches, evasion and escape nets, and other operations
assets might have to be employed.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these assets exists then hiding places should be
created in advance of the operation which are kept sterile
throughout ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Military planning should be based upon the principle that some
elements without our friendly forces will be exposed, and that our
operation must not collapse on that account. Therefore, danger
signals should be included which automatically call for movement
from one phase to the other depending upon who or what units have
been exposed to the hostile government. In Iran there was good
reason to believe that danger signals so noted prior to the change
of government were instrumental in keeping alive an operation
which, to an outsider, appeared to have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to topple the Iranian government was made quickly
in Washington in early 1953 by the new Eisenhower administration,
and it represented an abrupt policy change. So the CIA had not done
its homework when called on by President Eisenhower. The CIA's
history discusses its frustrating efforts to get up to speed,
including fruitless contacts with Army intelligence (G-2 in
military shorthand) and draws a cautionary lesson for planners of
future CIA plots: Know a little about a country you may be called
upon to transform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the summer (of 1953) cables were exchanged with the
Tehran Station in an effort to procure the latest information on
the order of battle of Iranian armed forces. The Iranian desk, G-2,
Pentagon, was queried in an effort to obtain whatever information
they could get which might help accomplish the above tasks.
Information available in G-2 was almost nonexistent. Biographical
information on leading Army figures was extremely scanty. G-2 did
not possess a tactical map showing the military situation in the
city of Tehran. It must also be admitted that CIA too was
unprepared for this type of operational plan and a heavy burden had
to be laid upon the field at a time when the Tehran station was
already occupied with the opening phases of Tpajax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary difficulty in staff planning at this time was the
fact that neither the field nor Headquarters possessed detailed
information on military figures in Iran. CIA had heretofore never
placed particular emphasis on that type of operational reporting,
and we learned as the days went by how extremely important, indeed
vital, that type of reporting is.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the coup nearly failed was that the Mossadegh
government found out about the coup plot just before it was begun.
Iranian officers working for the CIA were arrested as they tried to
take control of the government. Although the coup succeeded on a
second attempt, the history warned that if the CIA hoped to keep
trying to overthrow governments, it had to keep its plans secret.

<P>
   Just a few years ago, lawmakers were in full cry about the
supposed dangers of immigration _ from crime to welfare cheats to
lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now Congress is poised to pass a bill that would grant visas
to tens of thousands more temporary high-tech workers from abroad.
And an unlikely coalition of business and immigrants rights groups
is pushing to fling the door open wider: to unskilled workers who
could fill shortages in hotels and on farms , and even to roll back
an array of restrictive measures passed with great fanfare in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the national conversation about immigrants and
immigration has changed dramatically. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,
described the political momentum generated by the temporary workers
bill this way: ``There's a train going through. Can I get on it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later this summer, Congress is expected to pass H1B,
which would nearly double, to 200,000, the number of such visas
issued every year or the next three years.The measure has
bipartisan support, including the blessings of both presumptive
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, H1B will be the largest guest worker measure since
the bracero program, which imported millions of Mexicans
farmworkers into virtual servitude beginning in in 1942, was
dismantled in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A broad new service industry coalition, representing everything
from hospitals to hotels, is seeking its own temporary workers from
abroad. And agribusiness, which has unsuccessfully lobbied for
temporary field workers in the past, has renewed its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional immigrants rights groups are urging
lawmakers to lift the 1996 measures that bar immigrants from some
government benefits, tighten political asylum rules and requir the
automatic deportation of non-citizens who had been convicted of
certain felony crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition calling itself ``Fix 96,'' is urging lawmakers to
repeal the mandatory deportation law and restore social security
benefits and food stamps to immigrants who arrived after 1996;
benefits to pre-1996 immigrants have already been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Another coalition of business and civil rights groups is calling
on Congress to grant legal status to some 300,000 immigrants who
fled political violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and
Honduras but were denied refugee status in this country. The same
group wants Congress to raise the cap on family reunification
visas, while religious leaders and a left-right coalition led by
Henry Cisneros and Jack Kemp have called for amnesty for others who
have lived here illegally for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In what Rick Swartz, a leading immigration lobbyist, calls it
the ``H1B- plus'' strategy, activists are trying to bundle both the
family reunification and amnesty proposals with the high-tech
worker bill, turning it into a kind of omnibus immigration measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is very strong right now and who knows what it's
going to look like a year from now,'' Swarz said. ``A strong
economy enables you to do more. Secondly, an election year in which
the politics of immigration may be more positive than negative.
Third, you have both major presidential candidates being
pro-immigrant at least in their rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, good times have usually meant open doors, and these
are, economically, the best times ever. Still, none of the other
immigration bills enjoy anything like the consensus surrounding
H1B. The farm lobby's guest worker bill, which the House
immigration subcommittee debated Thursday , is likely to face
strong opposition from labor and Latino groups, who don't accept
the industry's claims of a labor shortage. They want a provision to
legalize the immigration status of farm workers, a majority of whom
are undocumented Hispanic immigrants, while the industry bill would
allow some farm workers to gain permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   John Young, executive director of the New England Apple Council
who heads the immigration committee of the National Council of
Agricultural Employers, remains optimistic. ``I think the
opportunity is very good for passage, better than it has been in
the past few years,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   A service industry umbrella group called the Essential Worker
Coalition also cites labor shortages in tourism and other trades,
and has just begun what it likes to call an H1B program tailored
for groundskeepers, housekeepers and other low-skilled workers,
many of them seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech industry has done a very good job in making
their case,'' argued John Gay, a lobbyist for the American Hotel
and Motel association and a spokesman for EWC. ``We need to do the
same making our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Many service industry workers are illegal immigrants from
Central America and Haiti, and Gay's group has thrown its support
behind the National Council of La Raza, a leading Latino rights
group, which proposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants who have
lived and worked here since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which there has been little movement has been the
restoration of government benefits that were cut in 1996. A number
of bills have been introduced to repeal the mandatory deportation
law, but none have made it out of the immigration subcommittees.
Efforts to restore the due process rights of asylum-seekers have
had a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   To Swartz, the reason is clear. ``It's harder to get the
business community to support a bill on the legal rights of people
getting deported,'' he pointed out, ``than to get a legalization
program for Central Americans who are working in their
restaurants.''

<P>
   As every child knows, school these days is spelled t-e-s-t:
preparing for them, taking them, passing them _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1990s, American educators, lusting after the
academic successes of European and Japanese schoolchildren,
imported the idea of a rigorous system of tests, which those
countries use to cull the elite from the merely literate. But
educators here insisted that America would instead use testing to
snap schools to attention, forcing them to raise standards for
everyone. They would lift up, not weed out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the evidence so far suggests that schools here
are doing the very sort of gardening they promised to avoid,
employing tests to sort children, often by the time they are in
grade school.
</P>
<P>
   In several other countries, it is illegal to track students
before they are teen-agers, said Marc Tucker, president of the
National Center on Education and the Economy in Washington. But in
the United States, teachers have decided by the early grades who is
bright and who isn't, giving some students the message that they
will never rise out of the lower track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the country that has the most vicious tracking system
in the world because we start to do it so young,'' Tucker said.
``The results are far more irrevocable than we will admit to
ourselves. If you've assigned kids in fourth and fifth grade to the
lower rungs of the English ladder, there's no way in the world for
them to become accomplished readers and writers. It creates an
utter disaster in terms of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder there has been a well-publicized outbreak of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who think about testing didn't think through the
implications,'' says Philip Altbach, professor of education at
Boston College. ``They just thought, the Europeans are doing this
and they have a good outcome. But what comes along with their
system is an entire baggage of selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, of course, have always tested their students. But the
tests used in decades past _ apart from the SAT, which was never
intended to drive how schools teach _ tested samples or groups of
students. The European or Japanese notion was to test individual
students.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chicago schools use test scores to hold children back a
grade, an example President Clinton would like to replicate
nationwide. In New York City, tests are used much like SAT cutoff
scores by some competitive middle schools; in other communities,
the scores determine who enters the ``gifted'' track.
</P>
<P>
   The result is what Merry White, a scholar of Japan and a
professor of anthropology at Boston University, calls ``a great
American mixed message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to say that at any point in life you can make
yourself over, that's part of our ideology,'' she said. ``We're
supposed to believe that getting off track is okay. We had this
idea of equality. But we don't know how to implement it in a
meritocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the tests argue that American schools have always
sorted students, and the new tests sort more fairly and more
openly, so that the bald test scores force teachers and parents to
pay attention and demand more from all students.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that tests may spur
children to perform at higher levels. Scores are up across New York
state in the second year of the fourth-grade reading tests. Texas
offers perhaps the best example. There, scores have gone up
dramatically in the 10 years since the state began publicly
reporting school-by-school scores. With a large state and local
campaign to do better on tests, Texas has begun to shrink the
stubborn test score gap between blacks and whites.

   It is difficult to know, however, what the scores mean. New York

<P>
   William Schmidt, the director of the U.S. branch of the Third

about three dozen nations, has examined dozens of the new state
tests, as well as more traditional tests.

<P>
   ``The idea of reform may be to say do more algebra, but the
tests are pushing basics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when the United States imported tests, it
did not import the rigorous curriculum that shapes other countries'
schools. Teachers in most states still don't have a clear sense of
what the tests are supposed to be testing, or what constitutes high
achievement. Instead, everyone becomes obsessed with the scores.

<P>
   Most important, they also have well-defined sets of standards
about what students need to learn, which dictate a curriculum that
is narrower, but deeper. That curriculum is tightly tied to the
test, and students are not sorted until the upper grades, by which

<P>
   In the United States, ``the whole notion has been deformed in
some ways,'' said Sue Bastian, head of Teaching Matters, a group of

should have guided us have bowdlerized into standardized tests,''
she said, which are then used to punish low-scoring schools, rather
than improve the curricula or teachers' skills.
</P>
<P>
   The result is essentially the same system as before, only with
more tests squeezing teachers' time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people making state policy who think
that teachers have known all along how to raise performance,
they've just been lazy, that all you have to do is raise the bar
and they will do it,'' said Tucker. ``I don't think that's true at
all. All the tests will do is measure kids' performance. But you're
not going to improve performance unless teachers do something
different in the classroom.''

<P>
   As every child knows, school these days is spelled t-e-s-t:
preparing for them, taking them, passing them _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1990s, American educators, lusting after the
academic successes of European and Japanese schoolchildren,
imported the idea of a rigorous system of tests, which those
countries use to cull the elite from the merely literate. But
educators here insisted that America would instead use testing to
snap schools to attention, forcing them to raise standards for
everyone. They would lift up, not weed out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the evidence so far suggests that schools here
are doing the very sort of gardening they promised to avoid,
employing tests to sort children, often by the time they are in
grade school.
</P>
<P>
   In several other countries, it is illegal to track students
before they are teen-agers, said Marc Tucker, president of the
National Center on Education and the Economy in Washington. But in
the United States, teachers have decided by the early grades who is
bright and who isn't, giving some students the message that they
will never rise out of the lower track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the country that has the most vicious tracking system
in the world because we start to do it so young,'' Tucker said.
``The results are far more irrevocable than we will admit to
ourselves. If you've assigned kids in fourth and fifth grade to the
lower rungs of the English ladder, there's no way in the world for
them to become accomplished readers and writers. It creates an
utter disaster in terms of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder there has been a well-publicized outbreak of cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who think about testing didn't think through the
implications,'' says Philip Altbach, professor of education at
Boston College. ``They just thought, the Europeans are doing this
and they have a good outcome. But what comes along with their
system is an entire baggage of selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans, of course, have always tested their students. But the
tests used in decades past _ apart from the SAT, which was never
intended to drive how schools teach _ tested samples or groups of
students. The European or Japanese notion was to test individual
students.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chicago schools use test scores to hold children back a
grade, an example President Clinton would like to replicate
nationwide. In New York City, tests are used much like SAT cutoff
scores by some competitive middle schools; in other communities,
the scores determine who enters the ``gifted'' track.
</P>
<P>
   The result is what Merry White, a scholar of Japan and a
professor of anthropology at Boston University, calls ``a great
American mixed message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to say that at any point in life you can make
yourself over, that's part of our ideology,'' she said. ``We're
supposed to believe that getting off track is okay. We had this
idea of equality. But we don't know how to implement it in a
meritocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the tests argue that American schools have always
sorted students, and the new tests sort more fairly and more
openly, so that the bald test scores force teachers and parents to
pay attention and demand more from all students.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting that tests may spur
children to perform at higher levels. Scores are up across New York
state in the second year of the fourth-grade reading tests. Texas
offers perhaps the best example. There, scores have gone up
dramatically in the 10 years since the state began publicly
reporting school-by-school scores. With a large state and local
campaign to do better on tests, Texas has begun to shrink the
stubborn test score gap between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know, however, what the scores mean. New York
City schools chancellor Harold Levy cautions that the improvement
in his students' scores may simply reflect more familiarity with
the new tests. And even those who applaud the Texas example
question whether those students are really learning at high levels.
</P>
<P>
   William Schmidt, the director of the U.S. branch of the Third
International Math and Science Study, a widely respected survey of
about three dozen nations, has examined dozens of the new state
tests, as well as more traditional tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of reform may be to say do more algebra, but the
tests are pushing basics,'' he said.
</P>

   The problem is that when the United States imported tests, it
did not import the rigorous curriculum that shapes other countries'

   WASHINGTON _ Conventional wisdom holds that party platforms are
only slightly less archaic than torchlight parades on election eve
_ a grab bag of dogma for true believers at a time when nearly
every candidate wants to run as a centrist, wooing the swing voters
of the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, many experts say, national party platforms can be
exceedingly revealing _ not only of what an administration will try
to do once in office, but also of the power of various constituency
groups and the extent to which a nominee is willing to take them
on. In an era when everything else is so stage-managed and
poll-driven in politics, platforms are where the activists _ like
social conservatives in the Republican Party and organized labor,
feminists and teachers in the Democratic _ often have their say.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, can be troublesome for nominees, ever hopeful
of a harmonious, triumphant convention for a middle-of-the-road
audience. That may help explain why Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the presumed Republican nominee, and his fellow party leaders are
not exactly throwing a spotlight on the platform process, which
begins in earnest this week with two ``policy forums'' in Dayton,
Ohio, and Billings, Mont. ``The less said about the platform the
better, is their message,'' said Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of
the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, one of many groups trying to
influence the document.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly intent on avoiding the platform nightmares of Bob
Dole, the 1996 Republican nominee, Bush signaled early on that he
would not seek to contest the most contentious plank in the
document: the call for an end to legalized abortion, with no
exceptions for rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.
(Bush says he personally supports such exceptions.)
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in recent days have also indicated that there
will be no public hearings on the abortion issue before the
convention. At the same time, the Bush campaign is also distancing
itself _ ever so respectfully and gingerly _ from the platform
itself. ``The platform is a grass-roots document that percolates up
from below and that reflects the views of the grass-roots activists
of the party,'' said Ralph Reed, an adviser to the Bush campaign,
adding that he believed this was true of both parties. ``And while
that sets an overarching philosophical tone for the party, the
nominees of the party at every level reserve the right to differ on
particulars.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks platforms are unimportant should consider
their rough history. Sometimes, activists use them to ``constrain
their candidate'' from breaking with party orthodoxy, as Paul Allen
Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University, put
it. Most recently, social conservatives stopped Bob Dole from
adding a tolerance provision to the abortion plank in 1996; he
ended up metaphorically throwing up his hands, declaring that he
had not even read the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the platform becomes another staging ground to
continue a brutal primary struggle, a specialty of the Democrats
for many years. In 1980, when Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
challenged President Carter for the nomination, the two camps
struggled over the platform for 17 hours of floor debate and
numerous roll call votes; the Kennedy camp won so many liberal
concessions _ like a demand for a $12 billion jobs program _ that
Carter could not, in the end, fully endorse his own platform. In
1968, the battle between hawks and doves in the Democratic Party
raged anew over the platform plank on Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the '70s and '80s, the Democratic Party fought so
hard over platforms, while losing so many elections, that its
activists ultimately embraced a kind of realpolitik. By 1992, after
12 years out of power, Democrats approved a platform that was a
model of centrist, New Democratic philosophy, organized around the
unobjectionable themes of ``responsibility,'' ``opportunity'' and
``community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we wanted to deliver to the American people was,
this wasn't the kind of Democratic Party you've been voting against
for a quarter century,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic
Leadership Council, which was instrumental in the new platform.
``And the platform was a key element in that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, the party that in its 1972 platform railed
against the evils of ``forced work requirements'' for welfare
recipients was declaring in 1996 that welfare should be ``a second
chance, not a way of life.'' Vice President Al Gore seems likely to
follow suit thematically: The former editor of the leadership
council's policy journal will be the main draftsman of the new
Democratic platform.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University who views the
post-1992 Democratic platforms as ``bland to the point of
invisibility,'' added, ``Even the most left-leaning members of the
party have conceded they have to go with the game plan for
everybody to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that mentality, of course, that the Bush campaign would
like to foment in its party, after eight years out of power.
Because another important truth about platforms, some analysts say,
is that the only way average voters learn of a platform is when the
opposition uses it against you. ``It is a document that can get you
into trouble and can do you no good,'' said Peter Hart, a
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, for
example, intends to highlight the Republican platform's abortion
position _ including its demand for the appointment of judges who
respect ``the sanctity of innocent human life.'' Bush has declined
to embrace such a litmus test. But his critics argue that if a
candidate cannot override his party's constituent groups on the
platform, he is unlikely to do so in office.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, for all the attempts to tamp down controversy in the
platform, and for all the control modern nominees exert on the
process, there is still room for the passion of activists. Beck,
the political science professor, argues that in some ways,
``principles have become even more important'' for activists these
days, because the old incentives for engagement _ like patronage _
have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   All of which explains why, even though abortion is nowhere on
the agenda of this week's platform meetings, representatives of
both the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition and local affiliates of
the National Right to Life Committee are expected to head to Dayton
and Billings.

COMMENTARY: DARK VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Women like to toddle off to the powder room in
twos. So why not vote in tandem?
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind a new ad campaign to persuade women to
vote, called ``Take a Friend to Vote,'' produced by the League of
Women Voters, Oldsmobile and Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   Cara Deoul Perl of Conde Nast told The New York Times' Allison
Fass that the idea was to make voting ``very personal and fun,''
suggesting that by bringing a friend to the ballot box, women can
``go vote and then go shopping ... It can be boring waiting on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will be inserted into some Conde Nast magazines,
will feature pairs of women, including ``West Wing'' actress
Allison Janney and Deborah Thalberg, a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd that women would make such condescending ads about
women.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody talks about planting voting booths on the ninth hole to
woo foursomes of male voters.
</P>
<P>
   We can take our politics straight up, thank you _ without the
artificial sweetener of girl talk and Saks.
</P>
<P>
   Women, after all, were instrumental in putting Bill Clinton in
the White House _ and saving his job after the Monica muddle. Women
not only understand the issues; they have made the candidates come
around to the issues they care about.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush are knocking themselves out to court
women, even adopting more feminine metaphors and schmoozing on
networks for women.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, picking a president is the ultimate shopping trip. Why
splurge on brand-name shoes you don't need when you can splurge on
brand-name candidates you don't love?
</P>
<P>
   Politics does not need to be more personal. It needs to be less
personal.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the conventions, I'm filled with dread. Both
candidates are planning to play nice. But what if they replace
slashing with sharing?
</P>
<P>
   I have nightmarish visions of Android Al desperately trying to
show he's soulful by sniffling at the podium, dredging up more Gore
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   If Karenna's life is not as golden as it seems, I don't want to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind a tax pledge. How about a ``Dark Victory'' pledge?
(As in the three-hanky Bette Davis weepy.) I would like both
candidates to promise not to exploit any intimate moments of family
despair.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with trauma influencing policy. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's brush with cancer has led him to offer a bold
and compassionate proposal to insure the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   But it grates when the harrowing stories are used simply to buff
an image.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, W. has to prove he is strong enough to be
president. On ``60 Minutes'' in 1987, Bush senior defended himself
against the wimp label by citing the strength needed to deal with
the death of his 3-year-old daughter, Robin, from leukemia. Let's
hope the younger Bush doesn't revisit that awful time.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even want W. to recap his dark victory over Jack
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is more of a threat on this score. In L.A., the man who has
been satirized as having a romantic relationship with his Palm
Pilot will have to prove he is human enough to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he wants to suggest warm blood runs through his veins,
he plumbs family travails.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his confessional cue from Bill Clinton at the '92
convention, Gore told in gruesome detail about his 6-year-old son
being struck by a car in 1989: ``When you've seen your reflection
in the empty stare of a boy waiting for his second breath of life,
you realize that we were not put here on earth to look out for our
needs alone ... ''
</P>
<P>
   At the '96 convention, the vice president, near tears, shared
the story of his sister's death from lung cancer, saying it
inspired his zeal in fighting the tobacco industry. He was
excoriated when it was revealed that he had boasted about his
experiences in the tobacco fields of Tennessee four years after
Nancy's death and had taken money from tobacco interests.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest push to humanize himself, he accompanied Tipper
onstage to talk about her problems with depression. She told an
audience in Maryland that her husband understood mental illness in
a concrete way: ``He has lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   Male politicians should quit acting like sob sisters. They must
remember: Their personal isn't always our political.

   WASHINGTON _ To hear some in NATO talk, Montenegro is the
unsinkable aircraft carrier in the West's unfinished war against
Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic. But last week, the
carrier took a few shells from Montenegro's voters, a sizable
minority of whom want to remain inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is the last republic of Tito's Yugoslavia that
remains alongside Serbia in Milosevic's incredible shrinking state.
But Montenegro has barely more than 600,000 people _ a third of
Belgrade's population _ and represents only 5 percent of
Yugoslavia's people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milo Djukanovic, its young president, broke away from
Milosevic and barely defeated a Milosevic ally in 1997. He has also
moved sharply toward the West on a platform of virtual and then
eventual independence from an undemocratic Belgrade. He opposed
Milosevic's policies toward Kosovo and then defied him during the
war there a year ago, raising fears that Montenegro could be the
next flashpoint in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, an ambiguous election result has reduced the pressure
for Montenegrin independence just when few in NATO have much taste
for another confrontation with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In local elections last week in the capital, Podgorica, and in
the seaside town of Herceg Novi, Montenegrins split over competing
notions of the republic's future. A coalition called ``For
Yugoslavia,'' which supported Milosevic, won a handy victory in
Herceg Novi, while losing in Podgorica, where Djukanovic is strong.
</P>
<P>
   It's always easy to make too much of local elections, but the
message to American policy-makers was clear: Milosevic has won a
round in fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Djukanovic clearly thought he'd get a better result, and he
didn't,'' one senior American official said. ``It's not a disaster,
but it's a signal.''
</P>
<P>
   For Djukanovic and his coalition, it is a clear warning that any
referendum on independence for Montenegro would not win by the kind
of thumping majority that could prevent civil strife. In fact, it
could produce civil war and partition.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, these deep splits could allow Milosevic and
Belgrade to foment civil strife in Montenegro with a high degree of
deniability, even without a direct use of the Yugoslav military
units that are based there. While the NATO alliance has not
promised to come to Montenegro's aid if Belgrade moves forcibly
against it, NATO leaders have warned Milosevic against doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials insist that any effort to move against
Djukanovic with force could have consequences in Belgrade, with new
bombing attacks. But few in NATO want another bombing war after
Kosovo. One senior NATO official said acerbically, ``Kosovo was
such a resounding success that no one in the alliance wants to
repeat it ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   So Djukanovic's awkward limbo continues, with him caught among
competing pressures _ from some supporters to move more briskly
toward independence, from Washington and NATO not to precipitate a
crisis, and from Belgrade aimed at undermining him.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's pressure is not just political and psychological,
Western and Montenegrin officials insist, but also physical, with
the skillful assassination, 10 days before the vote, of one of
Djukanovic's closest bodyguards. American officials say they have
no evidence of Belgrade's involvement. Still, the assassination
seemed like a message to the Serbian political opposition, too _
one that was underscored by what appeared to be an assassination
attempt on the Serbian opposition figure Vuk Draskovic late
Thursday night in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote just puts Djukanovic further into the maze, trying to
chart a middle course, but to where?'' said John Fox, a former
State Department official who specializes in the Balkans. ``This
limbo in which Montenegro is supposed to remain becomes more
difficult and more costly for Djukanovic in political terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious loser in the election was the Liberal Alliance,
which favors rapid independence and precipitated these elections by
pulling out of a coalition with Djukanovic. But Djukanovic has also
lost, because some significant part of the pro-Yugoslavia vote was
an anti-Djukanovic protest against corruption and arrogance in this
small state where, as in Belgrade, a few people live extremely well
on their political and criminal connections. In small Herceg Novi,
Djukanovic's brother, Aco, is a major figure, and he is widely
disliked for his shady business practices.
</P>
<P>
   But Djukanovic matters to the West. He has provided shelter to
Serbian opposition figures who were afraid for their lives, both
during the war and afterward, as well as to Serbian draft dodgers
during the war. And he has provided a platform for broadcasting
anti-Milosevic material into Serbia. In return, he has received
Western adulation and millions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of Yugoslavia, Montenegro can also have an impact on
the fate of the country's president, Milosevic. That is why
American officials _ and much of the Serbian opposition _ are
pressing Djukanovic to take part in federal elections Milosevic
must call by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has opposed the idea, rejecting the legitimacy of the
currently constituted federal government or Parliament. But the
Americans and the Serbian opposition are convinced that they can
win the elections if Montenegro participates, weakening Milosevic
before next year's crucial parliamentary elections in Serbia. A
Montenegrin boycott, on the other hand, could give Milosevic an
excuse not to have the elections at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox thinks the strategy is wrongheaded. Montenegro's
participation would legitimize Milosevic more than undermine him,
he says, and in any event the West should call the elections unfree
and unfair, given the restrictions on the media in Serbia. ``The
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is already illegitimate and
dysfunctional,'' Fox said. ``And here we are saying to Djukanovic
that we won't talk to the war criminal that heads it but that you
have to participate in his election.''

COMMENTARY: TURN OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new PBS miniseries ``1900 House,'' which started last week,
follows a modern British family that has agreed to spend three
months living in a London townhouse that has been carefully
de-modernized _ electric wiring stripped out and gas lighting put
back into service, plumbing degraded back to Victorian standards
and so on. I was worried about the concept: would it turn out to be
exploitation TV with a highbrow veneer, sort of ``Survivor'' meets
``Upstairs, Downstairs''? But the first episode, about the
preparation of the house and the selection of the family, was
terrific, prompting some serious thoughts about the nature and
measurement of economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the series makes extremely graphic a point much
emphasized by the Berkeley economist J. Bradford DeLong in his
already classic though not yet complete book ``Slouching Towards
Utopia'' (the Internet has definitely scrambled the old rules of
scholarship!): Economic statistics greatly understate the real
extent of material progress over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Some half-educated guesswork leads me to believe that the family
that occupied the 1900 house in 1900 probably had an annual income
that, corrected for changes in the consumer price index, would be
in the range of $20,000 to $30,000 in today's money. That is above
today's official poverty line, but hardly affluent; and of course a
family in that income range today would not be able to afford that
nice a house, and would certainly not be able to hire a maid to
help with the chores _ which a Victorian family in that class very
definitely would. But by any reasonable standard the modern family
is far more comfortable: it has electricity and hot running water,
television and radio, and is far less likely to lose one of its
members to infectious disease. On sheer material grounds one would
almost surely prefer to be poor today than upper middle class a
century ago. Social status is another matter _ but let's reserve
that topic for some other day.
</P>
<P>
   But in a perverse way watching ``1900 House,'' which reminded me
just how much progress we have achieved over the past century,
reinforced some of my doubts about how much progress we can expect
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   There is an ongoing debate among economists, engineers and
futurists about whether we are really living in a golden age of
technological progress. Nobody questions that digital technology
and its consequences _ including the Internet, cell phones, smart
appliances and all that _ have made and will continue to make
spectacular strides. But how much difference will those
technologies make to our overall standard of living?
</P>
<P>
   On one side of this debate are the enthusiasts who proclaim the
onset of the digital age more important than the Industrial
Revolution, the biggest thing since bread, never mind the slicing.
On the other side are economists and historians who compare our
current roster of new technologies with the transforming
technologies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and find
our latest gizmos relatively trivial by comparison. The economic
boom that has swept the United States during the second Clinton
administration has made the arguments of the enthusiasts more
plausible, but ``1900 House'' seems to me to be a reminder that the
technoskeptics still have the better case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading skeptics is Robert Gordon of Northwestern
University. In his new paper ``Does the `New Economy' Measure Up to
the Great Inventions of the Past?'' he argues that each of five
``clusters'' of innovation _ electricity, the internal combustion
engine, modern chemistry, mass media and plumbing _ was in itself a
bigger deal than the digital revolution as a whole. And if you
really think about what it was like to live in the 19th century _
an imaginative exercise that the show makes considerably easier _
this starts to sound persuasive. If I were deprived of the last
century's technical progress, I would miss my ability to read Brad
DeLong's economic history of the 20th century on the Web; but I
would be much harder pressed to do without electric lights, or
last-minute trips to the supermarket, or detergent, or hot showers.
And I would even miss TV.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that digital technology proves me wrong; but on the
evidence of ``1900 House,'' I'd say that the future is not what it
used to be.

   Police Response an Issue After Central Park Attacks
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a turbulent week, the New York City police had
arrested more than a dozen men in connection with the rampage of
sexual assaults in Central Park on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which came at the end of the Puerto Rican Day
Parade on Fifth Avenue, was another black eye for the New York
Police Department. More than 30 women came forward to complain of
being attacked by a mob of men who doused them with water and tore
at their clothes, and many of the victims said police officers had
ignored their pleas for help.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at first played down the complaints, but
after videotapes of the attacks emerged, he promised to investigate
the behavior of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Loophole in Arms Treaty
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have provided President Clinton with a
new legal interpretation of a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia
that could allow him to begin building the first phase of a
national missile defense without violating the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The new interpretation, drafted at the White House's request,
offers a way for Clinton to avoid breaching the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty, a prospect that has already threatened to undercut
relations with Russia and European allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss Stirs the Pot
</P>
<P>
   New York City police union leaders urged their members to
boycott concerts by Bruce Springsteen, who has begun performing a
new song about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed immigrant
from Guinea who died in a hail of police gunfire last year.
Ignoring the criticism, Springsteen performed the song, ``American
Skin,'' at Madison Square Garden, where he began by singing the
words ``41 shots'' nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment building. They said they thought he was reaching
for a gun; it turned out to be a wallet. The officers were
acquitted of murder charges earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oil Prices Soar
</P>
<P>
   It may be a rough summer for vacationers in their campers and
sport utility vehicles. Oil prices shot up to more than $32 a
barrel, amid growing fear that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries might decide not to lift production when
ministers meet this week in Vienna. OPEC has already discarded an
informal agreement to automatically raise production by 500,000
barrels a day if the 20-day average price climbed above $28.
American motorists are already paying the highest gasoline prices
in a decade; in the Midwest, some gas is selling for more than $2 a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Strikes Back
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in the first part of its appeal of an antitrust
ruling against the company, accused the judge who tried the case,
Thomas Penfield Jackson, of ``an array of serious substantive and
procedural errors that infected virtually every aspect of the
proceedings.'' In its brief, Microsoft asserted that the district
court ``largely suspended application of the federal rules of
evidence, admitting into evidence numerous newspaper and magazine
articles and other rank hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Runway Danger Is Seen
</P>
<P>
   In a study of runway safety, the National Transportation Safety
Board cited an increased risk of on-the-ground collisions, and an
increase in the number of times that planes or trucks blunder onto
active runways. The Federal Aviation Administration has plans for a
computer system to provide warnings, but it is 10 years behind
schedule and the board said it was insufficient anyway. The board
proposed procedural changes as a short-term fix, but said those
changes might worsen airport congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Victory for Nixon
</P>
<P>
   Six years after his death, former President Richard Nixon scored
a legal victory. The Justice Department agreed to pay Nixon's
estate $18 million for White House papers, tapes and photographs
seized by Congress after his resignation in 1974. Nixon's
contention that the documents were his personal property was backed
by an appeals court, but critics accused his heirs of profiting
from public papers that implicated the president in obstruction of
justice and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Fined $13 Million
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Martin Marietta Aerospace, now part of Lockheed Martin,
provided technical advice to a Hong Kong client that was trying to
solve a problem with China's commercial satellites. To settle civil
charges filed by the State Department, Lockheed Martin agreed to
pay $13 million for failing to get a United States license before
helping the Hong Kong company, which had strong ties to the
government in Beijing. No one knows if the technology helped the
Chinese with their military satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Putin Names Chechen Cleric
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to consolidate Russia's hold on Chechnya, President
Vladimir Putin appointed a Muslim cleric to govern the breakaway
republic. The new leader is Mufti Akhmed Kadyrov, a Chechen who
urged accommodation with Moscow after Russian troops intervened
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens, however, resent leaders who have sided with the
Russians, and it will be difficult for Mufti Kadyrov to establish
control. Aslan Maskhadov, the president of Chechnya before the
Russians intervened in 1994, has denounced the mufti as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Death Penalty Appeals
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois declared a moratorium on executions recently,
after 13 condemned men were found innocent, some death-penalty
supporters called the state an aberration. It isn't. A new study
found that nationwide, two-thirds of death-penalty convictions over
two decades were overturned on appeal, with 7 percent of the
condemned later found not guilty. And, typically, the appeals
process takes nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon for Papal Gunman
</P>
<P>
   Ceding to Vatican wishes, the Italian government pardoned Mehmet
Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in
1981. The pardon, which came during a Holy Year of the Roman
Catholic Church, did not set Agca free. Agca, who was forgiven long
ago by the pope, was extradited to Turkey, where he faces an
eight-year sentence for the 1979 murder of a Turkish journalist.

   Police Response an Issue After Central Park Attacks
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a turbulent week, the New York City police had
arrested more than a dozen men in connection with the rampage of
sexual assaults in Central Park on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which came at the end of the Puerto Rican Day
Parade on Fifth Avenue, was another black eye for the New York
Police Department. More than 30 women came forward to complain of
being attacked by a mob of men who doused them with water and tore
at their clothes, and many of the victims said police officers had
ignored their pleas for help.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at first played down the complaints, but
after videotapes of the attacks emerged, he promised to investigate
the behavior of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Loophole in Arms Treaty
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have provided President Clinton with a
new legal interpretation of a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia
that could allow him to begin building the first phase of a
national missile defense without violating the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The new interpretation, drafted at the White House's request,
offers a way for Clinton to avoid breaching the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty, a prospect that has already threatened to undercut
relations with Russia and European allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss Stirs the Pot
</P>
<P>
   New York City police union leaders urged their members to
boycott concerts by Bruce Springsteen, who has begun performing a
new song about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed immigrant
from Guinea who died in a hail of police gunfire last year.
Ignoring the criticism, Springsteen performed the song, ``American
Skin,'' at Madison Square Garden, where he began by singing the
words ``41 shots'' nine times.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the vestibule of his
Bronx apartment building. They said they thought he was reaching
for a gun; it turned out to be a wallet. The officers were
acquitted of murder charges earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oil Prices Soar
</P>
<P>
   It may be a rough summer for vacationers in their campers and
sport utility vehicles. Oil prices shot up to more than $32 a
barrel, amid growing fear that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries might decide not to lift production when
ministers meet this week in Vienna. OPEC has already discarded an
informal agreement to automatically raise production by 500,000
barrels a day if the 20-day average price climbed above $28.
American motorists are already paying the highest gasoline prices
in a decade; in the Midwest, some gas is selling for more than $2 a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Strikes Back
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in the first part of its appeal of an antitrust
ruling against the company, accused the judge who tried the case,
Thomas Penfield Jackson, of ``an array of serious substantive and
procedural errors that infected virtually every aspect of the
proceedings.'' In its brief, Microsoft asserted that the district
court ``largely suspended application of the federal rules of
evidence, admitting into evidence numerous newspaper and magazine
articles and other rank hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Runway Danger Is Seen
</P>
<P>
   In a study of runway safety, the National Transportation Safety
Board cited an increased risk of on-the-ground collisions, and an
increase in the number of times that planes or trucks blunder onto
active runways. The Federal Aviation Administration has plans for a
computer system to provide warnings, but it is 10 years behind
schedule and the board said it was insufficient anyway. The board
proposed procedural changes as a short-term fix, but said those
changes might worsen airport congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Victory for Nixon
</P>
<P>
   Six years after his death, former President Richard Nixon scored
a legal victory. The Justice Department agreed to pay Nixon's
estate $18 million for White House papers, tapes and photographs
seized by Congress after his resignation in 1974. Nixon's
contention that the documents were his personal property was backed
by an appeals court, but critics accused his heirs of profiting
from public papers that implicated the president in obstruction of
justice and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Fined $13 Million
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Martin Marietta Aerospace, now part of Lockheed Martin,
provided technical advice to a Hong Kong client that was trying to
solve a problem with China's commercial satellites. To settle civil
charges filed by the State Department, Lockheed Martin agreed to
pay $13 million for failing to get a United States license before
helping the Hong Kong company, which had strong ties to the
government in Beijing. No one knows if the technology helped the
Chinese with their military satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Putin Names Chechen Cleric
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to consolidate Russia's hold on Chechnya, President
Vladimir Putin appointed a Muslim cleric to govern the breakaway
republic. The new leader is Mufti Akhmed Kadyrov, a Chechen who
urged accommodation with Moscow after Russian troops intervened
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens, however, resent leaders who have sided with the
Russians, and it will be difficult for Mufti Kadyrov to establish
control. Aslan Maskhadov, the president of Chechnya before the
Russians intervened in 1994, has denounced the mufti as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Death Penalty Appeals
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois declared a moratorium on executions recently,
after 13 condemned men were found innocent, some death-penalty
supporters called the state an aberration. It isn't. A new study
found that nationwide, two-thirds of death-penalty convictions over
two decades were overturned on appeal, with 7 percent of the
condemned later found not guilty. And, typically, the appeals
process takes nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon for Papal Gunman
</P>
<P>
   Ceding to Vatican wishes, the Italian government pardoned Mehmet
Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in
1981. The pardon, which came during a Holy Year of the Roman
Catholic Church, did not set Agca free. Agca, who was forgiven long
ago by the pope, was extradited to Turkey, where he faces an
eight-year sentence for the 1979 murder of a Turkish journalist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Syria's Baath Party, the structural support
beneath the 30-year rule of the late Hafez Assad, gathered Saturday
to pledge allegiance to his 34-year-old son, Bashar, and to vest
him formally with the political authority he had quietly exercised
from the shadows in the last two years of his father's illness.
</P>
<P>
   Only the ceremonial start of the Baath congress was open to
outside observers. But in the first few effusive speeches lauding
him, party delegates indicated they were ready to install Assad, an
ophthalmologist by training, as a member of their national
governing board and to endorse him for the job of president.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the more than 1,500 delegates is scheduled to
last three days. Assad's nomination would then have to be ratified
by the Parliament, which is overwhelmingly dominated by the Baath
Party, and confirmed in a public referendum in which voters could
say yes or no to his ascension to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's father used to chalk up 99.9 percent of votes in his
re-elections over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The congress, the first in 15 years, was scheduled when the
elder Assad was alive and intended to change his son's status from
unofficial heir apparent to regent by giving him his first formal
party and government titles.
</P>
<P>
   When Hafez Assad died a week ago, apparently of a heart attack,
the party leadership moved quickly to convert the congress into a
vehicle to ratify his son as successor.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, towering over all those who gathered around him during a
break in the proceedings, was mobbed by party officials shoving
each other aside to shake his hand and whisper congratulations in
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not held any official position, Assad does not
enter the public spotlight unprepared. Diplomats, Syrian
businessmen and analysts said he had already exercised considerable
control over a number of foreign and domestic policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past two years, he's been acting like the chief of
staff at the White House,'' said a European diplomat who was
summoned several times to Dr. Assad's office for working meetings.
``He wasn't in the line of command, but he made things move.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's internship as Syria's chief executive officer began with
the forced retirement in July 1998 of his father's longtime aide,
Hikmat Shehabi, the Syrian army chief and first of many influential
old-guard figures to be toppled or ruined by corruption allegations
in the state-run press.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Assad has quietly built a power base by courting the
country's business elite, negotiating with foreign diplomats,
installing allies in the military and intelligence hierarchy,
changing two-thirds of the government ministers to his liking, and
cultivating a public image of openness and probity.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials have gone to great pains to insist that Assad
is the spontaneous choice of the public and the party. State-run
television has shown almost nothing but Assad since his father's
death and the party distributed thousands of posters with his
photograph on the eve of the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late President Assad was very, very sick in the last two
years, but not once did he say his son should be his successor,''
said Riyad Ghassan Agha, the chief of the presidential political
bureau, in an interview on the Al-Jezeera satellite television
channel. ``Now people have spoken,'' he added. ``Didn't you see all
this support at the funeral for Bashar?''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Damascus said the referendum on his presidency
could offer an early sign of whether Assad's style of leadership
will differ much from his father's secretive and authoritarian
rule, which relied on staged rallies, ubiquitous intelligence
agents and state-run propaganda to create a personality cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't spend the billions they usually do to promote
the single candidate, that will be a good sign,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``The next sign we will be looking for is if he renovates
the government. There are some ministers who have been there for 30
years. Then, will we know who are his advisers? Under his father
they were never named.''
</P>
<P>
   As president-in-waiting, Assad has already had more intimate
contact with the Syrian public than any previous modern leader by
virtue of the Muslim mourning traditions. For four days he stood
for hours in a receiving line in the village of Qardaha, where his
father was buried, and shook the hands of tens of thousands of
ordinary Syrians who came to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from those who have hovered close to his side and those
he has placed in positions in the military and intelligence
services, Assad may rely even more than his father on members of
his Alawite sect. The Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are
thought to represent about 10 percent of the Syrian population, but
a far higher percentage of army and security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has relied on Ali Aslan, the chief of staff who replaced
the ousted Shehabi; his brother-in-law Asef Showkat, who holds an
important post that deals with promotions in the military
intelligence branch; and Suleiman Bahgat, head of the domestic
intelligence services. Assad has also been surrounded by friends of
his own age from the politically privileged, including the sons of
high-ranking army and Baath Party officials.
</P>
<P>
   In carefully screened interviews over the last few months, Assad
has expressed interest in bringing Syria, where satellite
television dishes are still officially illegal, into the modern
information age. He has reassured frustrated entrepreneurs in the
country that he sympathizes with their complaints about bureaucrats
who demand bribes, the absence of a private banking system and
murky laws on investment.
</P>
<P>
   Assad would often summon people he wanted to consult to his
office in the hills above Damascus, sending a limousine from the
presidential protocol office to pick them up. One diplomat recalled
that he once complained about corrupt government officials who kept
delaying action on a foreign aid project. Assad, he said,
interrupted briskly to say: ``I understand. You have the same
problems I have.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But now that he is to assume public office, Assad may be limited
in his ability to impose modernization on a hidebound one-party
system that has run the nation's economy and social life for its
own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Assad will not make the dramatic changes that many Syrians may
expect, predicted Dr. Imad Fawzi Shuebi, a Damascus University
political scientist who said he is close to the Assad family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not in a hurry,'' Shuebi said, using a phrase often
applied to Assad's father, who moved deliberately. ``Doctor Bashar
will be like a fighter pilot,'' he added. ``A pilot goes out and
makes observations, then returns to go over his possible decisions,
then he collects the reactions, then he thinks, then he observes
again. Then he takes a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, Assad's options may be especially limited.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among diplomats and Syrian officials is that, as a
matter of principle and political survival, he cannot be more
flexible than his father on the substantive elements of peace
negotiations. He will insist, they said, that every inch of the
occupied Golan Heights must be returned by Israel to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   On the symbolic components of making peace, according to some of
Assad's acquaintances, he may be capable of bending.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials involved in the negotiating process have long
said that a few friendly gestures and a little warmth _ a
willingness, at least, on the part of Syrians to shake the hands of
their Israeli negotiating partners _ might reassure the Israeli
public that giving up the strategic Golan would bring real peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may see some gesture in a speech from Bashar soon,'' said
a Damascus businessman who grew up with Assad. ``His father was too
proud and too ideological for that, but Bashar is a more open
man.''

Division of the Texas National Guard.)

<P>
   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ When hunters came across the
wreckage of an aircraft on a remote mountainside in April, Capt.
David B. Webb of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National
Guard volunteered to join an Air Force team sent to figure out
whose plane it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, an operations officer at the U.S. headquarters here, had
no particular experience in recovery operations, but he had
expertise that even the airmen did not: When not on active duty, he
works in Fort Worth, Texas, for Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   And as it turned out, the wreckage he helped identify was the
F-16 belonging to Capt. Scott O'Grady, the American pilot shot down
on June 2, 1995, during NATO's air raids in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see F-16s every day on the floor,'' said Webb, a 34-year-old
property manager for Lockheed, who has served in the National Guard
for 14 years. ``To see one in pieces when I got to Bosnia was,
well, strange.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the National Guard and Reserves have had to endure
lingering doubts within the regular Army that their part-time
soldiers have what it takes to carry out important military
operations. But as the Army relies more heavily on Guard and
Reserve units, Guard and Reserve commanders argue that the United
States' citizen-soldiers bring something else that their
active-duty counterparts cannot: experience and skills honed in the
civilian world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when it comes to peacekeeping operations like the one in
Bosnia, which does not involve direct combat, there are many who
argue that the Guard and Reserve are in fact better prepared for
the subtle tasks of rebuilding a nation devastated by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a personal opinion, but in the National Guard, we
deal with civilians a little better,'' said Lt. John K. Bahrami, a
computer consultant for IBM and a member of the 49th Armored
Division, who serves in the unit overseeing security at Eagle Base,
the U.S. headquarters near the town of Tuzla. ``We're business
people. We work with people. You don't have that sense they do in
the regular Army that everyone is either a friend or an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the nearly 650 men and women of the 49th deployed here in
March, its officers have commanded the U.S. peacekeeping mission,
trying to advance a peace that, more than four years after the
fighting stopped, is still struggling to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since the Korean War that the Army has
deployed a Guard headquarters overseas and the first time ever that
it has put one in charge of regular Army troops _ in this case,
2,500 soldiers from one of the service's elite cadres, the 3rd
Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Carson, Colo., as well as 40
reservists, and nearly 1,000 guardsmen from a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Until they mobilized in February, the men and women of the 49th
were computer programmers, teachers, lawyers and laborers _ and
their skills have already paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, civilian skills are incidental to the military
mission, as happened with Webb. When the Air Force team arrived at
the wreckage on the remote hillside near the Croatian border, it
was Webb who knew that a stamp on a bulkhead identified it as an
F-16 and a contract number on another part showed that it was a
U.S. Air Force jet.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the usefulness is by design. Since the Vietnam
era, the Army has deliberately transferred soldiers with specific
skills to the Reserve, especially doctors and nurses, press
officers and civil affairs specialists who serve as liaisons to
local communities. These reservists are among the busiest in the
Army today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me where the Army has an investment banker or someone who
runs an electrical grid,'' said Brig. Gen. Bruce B. Bingham, a
reservist who is commander of the Army's Civil Affairs and
Psychological Operations Command and partner in the accounting firm
BDO Seidman in New York. ``We bring civilian skills that the Army
doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   By the measures that matter most to the Army and the Pentagon _
avoiding casualties and keeping a lid on sporadic eruptions of
violence _ the 49th's mission has so far been a success. But the
49th is also winning praise from unexpected quarters, including
critics of the U.S. operation who credit the National Guard with
bringing a civilian sensibility to what has been a solely military
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The 49th's commander, Maj. Gen. Robert L. Halverson, who served
as deputy commissioner of insurance for Texas before retiring when
the deployment order came, has made his highest priority the return
of Bosnia's refugees to their homes. One of the most difficult
areas is the village of Srebrenica, where Serbian soldiers drove
out the Muslim population and killed as many as 8,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to help clear the way for Srebrenica's former residents
to return, Halverson sent the division's chief engineer, Col. Larry
N. Patterson, to inspect the city's damaged water system. It was no
coincidence that Patterson, when not on active duty, is the
assistant director of the Water Utilities Department of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of cooperation from Serbian workers, he
inspected the plant and was able to determine the purification
process that the plant once used, when he spotted a discarded
chemical control panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me who else could walk beside that water treatment plant
and look at a piece of metal trash lying in the weeds and recognize
it as a chemical control panel,'' Halverson said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has served in the Texas National Guard ever since he
graduated from the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at Texas
A&AMP;M University in 1972, rising through the ranks as an officer and
as an engineer in the water utility industry. He had little idea
his experience in providing water for nearly 2 million people in
Dallas would come in handy in a place like Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of his visit to the plant, however, Patterson
outlined what the plant would need to produce minimally potable
water and what it would cost _ $266,701, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is for Patterson to try to coordinate the
necessary repairs by meeting with officials in charge of the
civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords, as well as with other
military engineers and representatives of aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like going to a city council meeting back home,''
Patterson said, reaching back to his civilian life for the right
explanation. ``You have 15 different districts, and they all have
competing interests. Hopefully, we can get something done.
Everybody wants to do something for Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, the success or failure of the 49th's mission
will shape overseas operations for years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the National Guard was held in reserve.
Its units _ serving under the command of the governors of 50
states, the District of Colombia and three territories _ evolved
into a distinct force, separate and unequal. Guardsmen were
activated more often for natural disasters than for military
operations, leading to derision from full-time soldiers and
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the pace of military operations has increased, from the
Balkans to the Persian Gulf, the Army plans to turn more and more
to its 564,000 reservists and guardsmen to relieve the strain on
its nearly 480,000 regular troops.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, as in other operations, the Army is planning to
increase the participation of Guard units. Today, the Guard and
Reserve constitute nearly a quarter of the U.S. troops in Bosnia;
by 2003, nearly two-thirds of the troops here will be part-time
citizen-soldiers, called up for nine months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   While the 49th largely provides the headquarters staff at the
main U.S. base, the next rotations will include operation units,
which officials say will become a greater test of the Guard's
contribution. Those units include the 48th Infantry Brigade from
Georgia, a unit that was activated during the Persian Gulf War but
was then deemed by Army commanders to be unprepared for combat in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the General Accounting Office noted significant
improvements in training of brigades like the 48th, but said that
many of them still faced shortfalls in combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   For the 49th, the assignment here has been a chance to prove the
Guard's abilities after it sat on the sidelines for decades. And
they point to achievements like Webb's and Patterson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just any mission for us,'' said Col. Garry D.
Patterson, the division's chief of staff and Larry Patterson's twin
brother. ``We felt like we had to make a mark on the wall for the
ones that are going to follow us.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the 49th appears to have impressed not just
Army commanders but also critics of the U.S. presence in Bosnia
since NATO troops arrived in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Lyon, the Bosnia director of the International Crisis
Group, a private foundation that has sharply criticized
developments since the Dayton accord, credits the National Guard
for changing the tenor of the U.S. operations. With the war over,
he said, the biggest challenge in Bosnia is not separating armies
but working more actively with the local governments and
international organizations that in effect make Bosnia tick.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 49th arrived, Lyon said he had seen a greater
coordination with international organizations and local
governments, as well as increased foot patrols in tense villages,
despite an overall reduction in U.S. troops from 6,900 two years
ago to today's level of 4,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the National Guard had come in 1996,'' he said.

   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ When hunters came across the
wreckage of an aircraft on a remote mountainside in April, Capt.
David B. Webb of the 49th Armored Division of the Texas National
Guard volunteered to join an Air Force team sent to figure out
whose plane it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, an operations officer at the U.S. headquarters here, had
no particular experience in recovery operations, but he had
expertise that even the airmen did not: When not on active duty, he
works in Fort Worth, Texas, for Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   And as it turned out, the wreckage he helped identify was the
F-16 belonging to Capt. Scott O'Grady, the American pilot shot down
on June 2, 1995, during NATO's air raids in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the National Guard and Reserves have had to endure
lingering doubts within the regular Army that their part-time
soldiers have what it takes to carry out important military
operations. But as the Army relies more heavily on Guard and
Reserve units, Guard and Reserve commanders argue that the United
States' citizen-soldiers bring something else that their
active-duty counterparts cannot: experience and skills honed in the
civilian world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when it comes to peacekeeping operations like the one in
Bosnia, which does not involve direct combat, there are many who
argue that the Guard and Reserve are in fact better prepared for
the subtle tasks of rebuilding a nation devastated by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a personal opinion, but in the National Guard, we
deal with civilians a little better,'' said Lt. John K. Bahrami, a
computer consultant for IBM and a member of the 49th Armored
Division, who serves in the unit overseeing security at Eagle Base,
the U.S. headquarters near the town of Tuzla. ``We're business
people. We work with people. You don't have that sense they do in
the regular Army that everyone is either a friend or an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the nearly 650 men and women of the 49th deployed here in
March, its officers have commanded the U.S. peacekeeping mission,
trying to advance a peace that, more than four years after the
fighting stopped, is still struggling to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since the Korean War that the Army has
deployed a Guard headquarters overseas and the first time ever that
it has put one in charge of regular Army troops _ in this case,
2,500 soldiers from one of the service's elite cadres, the 3rd
Armored Cavalry Regiment from Fort Carson, Colo., as well as 40
reservists, and nearly 1,000 guardsmen from a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Until they mobilized in February, the men and women of the 49th
were computer programmers, teachers, lawyers and laborers _ and
their skills have already paid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, civilian skills are incidental to the military
mission, as happened with Webb. In other cases, the usefulness is
by design. Since the Vietnam era, the Army has deliberately
transferred soldiers with specific skills to the Reserve,
especially doctors and nurses, press officers and civil affairs
specialists who serve as liaisons to local communities. These
reservists are among the busiest in the Army today.
</P>
<P>
   By the measures that matter most to the Army and the Pentagon _
avoiding casualties and keeping a lid on sporadic eruptions of
violence _ the 49th's mission has been a success. But the 49th is
also winning praise from unexpected quarters, including critics of
the U.S. operation who credit the National Guard with bringing a
civilian sensibility to what has been a solely military mission.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, the success or failure of the 49th's mission
will shape overseas operations for years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the National Guard was held in reserve.
Its units _ serving under the command of the governors of 50
states, the District of Colombia and three territories _ evolved
into a distinct force, separate and unequal. Guardsmen were
activated more often for natural disasters than for military
operations, leading to derision from full-time soldiers and
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the pace of military operations has increased, from the
Balkans to the Persian Gulf, the Army plans to turn more and more
to its 564,000 reservists and guardsmen to relieve the strain on
its nearly 480,000 regular troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, as in other operations, the Army is planning to
increase the participation of Guard units. Today, the Guard and
Reserve constitute nearly a quarter of the U.S. troops in Bosnia;
by 2003, nearly two-thirds of the troops here will be part-time
citizen-soldiers, called up for nine months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the 49th appears to have impressed not just
Army commanders but also critics of the U.S. presence in Bosnia
since NATO troops arrived in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Lyon, the Bosnia director of the International Crisis
Group, a private foundation that has sharply criticized
developments since the Dayton accord, credits the National Guard
for changing the tenor of the U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 49th arrived, Lyon said he had seen a greater
coordination with international organizations and local
governments, as well as increased foot patrols in tense villages,
despite an overall reduction in U.S. troops from 6,900 two years
ago to today's level of 4,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the National Guard had come in 1996,'' he said.

THE SUMMER JOB LOSES ITS STATUS AS A RITE OF YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Brooks may look a middle-aged stockbroker on the surface,
but beneath the starched shirt and tie beats the heart of a
hometown hero, forged more than a quarter-century ago on his first
summer job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifeguarding was my induction into life,'' said Brooks, who at
16 joined the Beach Patrol in Ocean City, N.J., and today is an
associate vice president for investments at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``I drank my first beer as a lifeguard. I had my first
romantic encounter as a lifeguard. It was much more than a summer
job. It was more than I ever dreamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, much of teen-age America would have agreed:
lifeguarding was the pluperfect summer billet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, lifeguard jobs go begging, to the point where
Ocean City has dipped deep into its personnel files and asked
old-timers to come back and fill the empty stations. Brooks will
return this summer on weekends, as will moonlighting lawyers,
doctors, engineers and casino floorwalkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to depend on teen-aged kids, we'd be hurting,'' said
Bud McKinley, Ocean City's assistant captain for operations.
</P>
<P>
   As go the beaches of the Jersey Shore, so go the workplaces of
the nation. For the last 10 years, fewer teen-agers and young
adults have been venturing into the summer work force. Last year,
even with desperate managers dangling finders' fees, tuition plans
and other lures, just 62 percent of America's 16 million people
between 16 and 19 years old were in the labor force, compared with
a high of 71.8 percent in 1978. It is the lowest percentage since
July 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is most pronounced among young men, whose summer
employment rate of 65 percent is down from 73.5 percent in 1989 and
the lowest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping
track in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The decline indicates that the lengthy economic expansion has
given growing numbers of families the means to support their
children as they learn new languages, travel and undertake other
adventures, and many parents are proud to be able to offer their
offspring opportunities they never had.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift away from summer jobs also suggests that tens of
thousands of teen-agers are missing out on what some consider a
hallowed American coming-of-age experience and, arguably, a social
leveler that gives the college-bound a fleeting taste of
working-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Droves of teen-agers and young adults have been signing up for
summer school, from remedial reading and math to advanced-placement
courses and exotic enrichment programs. In July 1994, 19.5 percent
of Americans aged 16 to 19 were in school. By July 1999, 26.8
percent were.
</P>
<P>
   A decade of unparalleled affluence may be prompting some parents
to give youngsters money, reducing their need to work. For other
teen-agers, the boom still means working, but in jobs that put them
on career tracks more quickly, not in the sweaty, low-paid and
mind-numbing slots that have long been the lot of many.
</P>
<P>
   A summer's earnings will no longer make much of a dent in
today's rapidly rising college expenses. The current intense
competition for university admissions also appears to be a factor,
with teen-agers using summers to add sizzle to their applications.
It is assumed that music camp or a hands-on biology lab will
impress more than a stint stocking shelves in a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the result of the high-stakes testing that's been
instituted in a lot of the states,'' said William Rodgers, chief
economist at the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   For adolescent-development specialists, the waning of the summer
job comes as a surprise. Teachers, psychologists and
occupational-health experts have been arguing for years that young
Americans are working far too much for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   But with a tide of teen-agers turning away from summer jobs,
some are raising a new concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could mean that the social divide that's happening gets
worse,'' suggested Jeffrey A. Joerres, president and chief
executive of Manpower Inc., the big temporary-employment company.
Joerres worked as a house painter on his summer vacations, he
recalled, and bonded with a crew of tattooed and ponytailed men who
were not going to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody asked me, `What did you learn?' I'd probably say,
`Well, I learned to put up scaffolding,''' Joerres said. ``But in
fact, I was learning other lessons. There are some life experiences
that go unlearned if you take the professional track all your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's tight labor market, though, college students who seek
summer work through Manpower expect to get serious white-collar
positions, Joerres said, and they are not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really shot themselves in the foot,'' said Brooks, who
traces much of who he is today to his time under the sun as a
lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks revered his first boss, ``a big, barrel-chested guy who
was in the Navy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a soft side, but you always knew who was boss. I think,
in a lot of ways, the management style I've adopted in my life is a
lot like that old captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Brooks said, but it was a partner from that first
summer job who got him into financial services, and former
lifeguards still round out his client list today.
</P>
<P>
   But others see few such benefits in putting teen-agers to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have your kids working as soon as they're 13, 14
years old, the spring just goes out of their step,'' said Theresa
Miller, a mother and writer in Tatamy, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's father had to work throughout high school to buy
clothes, she said, and felt robbed of an adolescence. So when she
was in high school, he let her try a paper route, but stopped her
when she started looking tired. He promised she would not have to
work again until she was out of college. Now she wants to do the
same for her son, who went to science camp last summer and will
study music this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've counseled him to be a kid as long as he can, and as long
as we can afford it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a large and contentious body of scholarship on whether
teen-agers should or should not be working.
</P>
<P>
   Some research shows that working adolescents get worse grades,
sleep less and are more prone to dropping out of school. But other
studies show that working teen-agers stay in school longer,
flounder less, do just as much homework and enjoy better mental
health.
</P>
<P>
   The effects seem to depend on the nature of the workplace. There
is some evidence that young people thrive in well-ordered
workplaces, where their assignments are clear and mature
supervision is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But high stress and a lack of job supervision have been found to
cause depression in teen-agers, and the effects can linger for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Schneider, a University of Chicago sociologist,
conducted a survey of 7,000 teen-agers and concluded, among other
things, that the healthy, teen-ager-friendly workplace is getting
harder and harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the car-loving youth who, 25 years ago, might have
sought satisfyingly greasy summer work in a filling station,
changing oil and tuning engines under the tutelage of an
experienced mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that youth probably cannot get such a job, Schneider
said. Cars come with modular components, and repair garages want
mechanics with junior college certificates.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of avuncular mentors like Brooks' captain, today's
teen-agers are apt to have supervisors not that much older than
themselves, Schneider said. They get little training, make
mistakes, and are yelled at by customers. Then they quit in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really problematic,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Randstad North America, an Atlanta-based company that provides
temporary staff members, recently studied generational attitudes
and found that today's teen-agers, unlike their parents, want jobs
where they are taught something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical,'' said Daryl Evans, a Randstad marketing
manager. ``They grew up in an environment of technology changing
every 12 minutes. There's this incredible motivation to keep up, or
a fear of falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Stevens, a junior at Georgetown University, is a good
example. ``I know it sounds arrogant, but my time is worth more
than $8 or $10 an hour,'' he said. ``I've got a whole lot of other
things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who already speaks fluent Korean and Russian as well as
good Japanese, Spanish and German, is leaving this weekend for a
summer at a university in South Korea. He even managed to shoehorn
in an internship at the World Bank in the four weeks between spring
finals and his trans-Pacific flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to make themselves look good on resumes,'' Stevens
said. Just having a degree and a few summers waiting tables is no
longer enough, he said. ``You have to have a selling point,
something to distinguish you from everybody else. You want to stand
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But such sentiments do not always go down well with adults for
whom low-skilled summer jobs were enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To just spend more time reading American history and playing
soccer is not the same as getting out into the world and having
experiences,'' said Dr. David Davenport, the departing president of
Pepperdine University in California, who admits he irritates
faculty by asserting that he learned more frying doughnuts in his
father's bakery than in any university. ``We're crowding out the
well-rounded development of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in keeping with his convictions, Davenport decided
his daughter, Kate, should get a job as a chambermaid, even though
Kate wanted to go to soccer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think the world had come to an end,'' Davenport said.
But he persisted and Kate ended up stripping beds and cleaning
rooms at the conference center Pepperdine operates each summer on
its Malibu campus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kate does not even remember the fight about attending
soccer camp. A summer of hard work and low prestige have left her
sounding like a convert to her father's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Malibu High School, most of the students were doing marine
biology camps and SAT prep classes,'' she said dismissively. ``I
don't miss that environment at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her summer job gave her any thoughts about a career,
the 17-year-old Davenport drew a blank. But as for what she plans
to do this summer, she did not miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the money in construction is good, $10 an hour to
start,'' she said. ``I think it's important to know how to build
things.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wavering front in the Middle Atlantic states will bring bouts
of showers and thunderstorms Sunday as low pressure moves east
along the front. Some places will receive numerous showers, with
daily totals exceeding one inch in spots. Farther south, showers
and thunderstorms will once again develop in the Southeastern
states, although the heaviest concentration will be in the
Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As moist air begins to flow to the north across the Texas
panhandle and eastern New Mexico, isolated strong thunderstorms
will develop during the afternoon and early evening. Meanwhile,
showers will develop near coastal Texas as thunderstorms form where
a sea breeze front undercuts and lifts warm, humid air.
</P>
<P>
   An area of low pressure moving into the Rockies will yield
showers, especially on the high peaks. Much of the West will turn
slightly cooler, though the deserts will remain hot.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ROCHESTER'S RAIN
</P>
<P>
   The rain this month in Rochester, Minn., is reaching historic
proportions. The month began with a deluge of 4.81 inches.
Recurrent rain since then has brought the total rainfall to 10.05
inches making this month the second wettest June on record in
Rochester. Jet stream winds have remained unusually strong over the
northern tier of states. On several occasions, disturbances in the
vigorous jet stream have combined with plumes of moist air from the
south, to produce clusters of thunderstorms with copious rain. &QL;

ZIMBABWE'S LEADER TRIES TO BOLSTER ELECTION SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ A week before fiercely contested
parliamentary elections, President Robert Mugabe on Saturday urged
thousands of flag-waving, cheering supporters to keep the peace as
they rally behind the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe blamed opposition party members for provoking the
violence that in recent months has claimed at least 26 lives and
left more than 150 people wounded, most of them black supporters of
the new party, the Movement for Democratic Change. ``We don't want
to break the law,'' he said. ``We want the people to go and vote in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded his supporters that the ruling party had led the
country to political independence and he promised that it would
continue to fight for the people by redistributing white-owned
commercial farms to blacks and by reinstituting price controls on
basic food stuffs.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the battle ahead would not be easy,
particularly here in the capital, where residents have grown weary
of promises of a better future amid chronic fuel shortages,
skyrocketing inflation and official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a survey of 6,000 voters conducted by the Public
Opinion Institute here suggested that the opposition would win 70
of the 120 parliamentary seats up for grabs. Officials from the
ruling party, which currently controls all but three seats in
Parliament, quickly dismissed the survey as biased.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mugabe stood behind the microphone in his charcoal suit
overlooking the crowd in the sports field here, it was clear that
his support had waned. Despite the availability of free transport
and the heavy publicity surrounding the rally, which is expected to
be the president's last major address in the capital before the
vote, the field stood nearly half empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should remain united,'' he urged. ``The revolution
continues to the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections, to be held over two days next weekend, represent
the toughest challenge that the ruling party, ZANU-PF, has ever
faced. In February, the party suffered its first major defeat since
independence 20 years ago when voters rejected a draft constitution
that would have expanded the president's powers and enabled him to
seize land from white farmers without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Zimbabwe's history, opposition candidates
are contesting all of the 120 parliamentary seats up for grabs and
some ruling party officials have conceded that they will probably
lose their near-total grip on power after a heated and often
violent campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, the human rights group, and other foreign
observers say the government has either instigated or condoned the
political violence in an effort to hold power, dismissing the
claims of Mugabe and other ruling party officials, who blame the
opposition for most attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent days, the ruling party has seemingly responded to
the barrage of criticism. On television and in the state-controlled
press, government officials have repeatedly denounced violence. The
state-controlled media has offered air-time to the new opposition
movement, which is routinely derided as puppets of whites on
television and radio. And officials have also vowed to accept the
result of the vote, whatever the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very unlikely event that ZANU-PF is defeated, we will
accept the result in the same way as we accepted the result over
the draft constitution,'' said John Nkomo, the campaign manager for
the ruling party.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House about to begin two weeks of intense
debate over competing proposals to add prescription drug benefits
to Medicare, the differences between President Clinton and
Republicans in Congress are widening by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare drug benefits have emerged as one of the more potent
political issues in this year's elections, as lawmakers and
candidates continually hear voters complain about high drug costs.
Both parties say their goal is to make drug coverage available and
affordable to Medicare beneficiaries in every corner of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans want more choices and options for beneficiaries,
a larger role for private insurance companies, a smaller role and
lower costs for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, by contrast, want more uniformity in premiums and
benefits. They say the Republicans' free-market approach will
confuse beneficiaries and encourage insurers to seek out healthy
customers with relatively low drug costs, a practice known as
cherry-picking.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas of California, the architect of the House
Republican bill, said Republicans would push it through the Ways
and Means Committee this week, with a view to securing passage by
the full House by the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are planning a major assault on the legislation.
Indeed, they rehearsed their arguments at congressional hearings
last week, before details of the legislation were disclosed. Their
strongest argument is simply that the Republican bill will not
work, will not draw many private insurers into the market and
therefore will not provide reliable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal assumes that insurers can be induced to
offer drug coverage subsidized by the government, just as health
maintenance organizations have been induced to sign contracts with
the government to care for 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if insurers would be interested in offering drug
coverage under Thomas' bill, Charles N. Kahn III, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America, said: ``No, I don't think
so. They would not sell insurance exclusively for drug costs. The
government may find some private entities to administer drug
benefits, but the government would have to accept all or nearly all
of the financial risk.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton would offer the same drug benefits to all 39
million people on Medicare. House Republicans, by contrast, would
describe a model insurance policy, known as ``standard coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers could offer alternative policies, with different
premiums and benefits, provided the value was equivalent to that of
the standard coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans oppose a ``one size fits all'' drug plan.
Beneficiaries, they say, should be able to choose a plan tailored
to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said elderly people
could be confused if they had a large number of choices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for seniors to navigate among plans,'' DeParle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, DeParle asked: ``Do seniors want and need all these
choices? If you let plans design all sorts of benefit packages,
that promotes choice, but it also promotes cherry-picking of the
healthiest seniors. That's why we need defined benefits. Seniors
want to know what's covered. It must be predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said DeParle had apparently not read their bill.
Under the legislation, premiums and benefits would be subject to
approval by Medicare officials. And the government could terminate
its contract with any insurer that ``engaged in activities intended
to result in favorable selection'' of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear that the market for drug insurance would be
filled with turmoil as insurers went in and out from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, dozens of HMOs have pulled out of
Medicare or curtailed their participation, disrupting insurance
arrangements for more than 700,000 elderly people, and more health
plans are expected to withdraw this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans refer to their bill as a bipartisan proposal
because two Democrats, Reps. Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota and
Ralph M. Hall of Texas, signed up as co-sponsors when Thomas
introduced the bill on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure, a Republican initiative, is strenuously opposed
by many Democrats, who say drug benefits should be fully integrated
into Medicare, like coverage of hospital care and doctors'
services.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says Medicare officials must ensure that every
beneficiary has a choice of at least two plans providing
prescription drug coverage. One could be an HMO; at least one must
be a traditional insurer.
</P>
<P>
   But, Democrats say, even if beneficiaries have two options, both
may be high-price plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican proposal, Medicare officials could
offer financial incentives to get insurers to enter markets in
which no drug plans were available. The purpose of such incentives,
as described in the bill, is to guarantee access to coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said the availability of these incentives would encourage
insurers to hold out for more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would encourage insurers to hold Medicare hostage,''
Jennings said. ``The policy says that if insurers don't participate
in the marketplace, we'll give them more money. Now, if you're an
insurer, when do you decide to participate in the market? Is it at
the beginning, when you get less money? If you hold out a little
longer, you might get more. This is the most inefficient,
ridiculous incentive mechanism one can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not cover drugs for people outside the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Drug spending for the elderly, from all sources including
private insurance and the patients themselves, is unevenly
distributed, and that complicates efforts to create new drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office says that 13 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries have no drug costs, while 57 percent have costs of
less than $1,000 a year. Only 5 percent of beneficiaries have costs
exceeding $5,000 a year, but they account for 29 percent of total
spending on drugs for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republicans agree that drug coverage should be
voluntary. Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, said he worried that ``only
sick seniors will sign up,'' while those with low drug costs would
not see insurance as a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``standard coverage'' envisioned in the House
Republican plan, the beneficiary would pay an annual $250
deductible and 50 percent of the next $2,100 in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients would then become responsible for their drug
expenses, but the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs would be
limited to $6,000 a year. The government would pay costs above that
level, with a small contribution by private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders hope to pick up support from some moderate
Democrats, but they may also lose some conservative Republicans,
who oppose the expansion of federal programs. Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., said he would vote against Thomas' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are adding new benefits to a program that is bankrupt from
an actuarial point of view,'' said Coburn, a family physician.
``Maybe the American people want us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans would create a new agency in the Department of
Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug plans and HMOs.
Republicans say the existing Medicare agency is a heavy-handed
regulator that stifles competition by setting prices for thousands
of medical goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said the Republicans were simply
``manufacturing a new bureaucracy.''

FILM CHRONICLES STRUGGLE BY JANITORS FOR BETTER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds. No Byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What kind of movie premiere is held in
midafternoon, without a foot of red carpet in sight and with most
of the audience wearing the same outfit? A premiere that knows its
target audience, most of whom had to get to work by 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread and Roses,'' a film portraying the local janitors'
struggle for better pay and benefits, was screened on Thursday for
nearly 250 of the people who had inspired it. Dressed in bright red
T-shirts emblazoned with ``Justice for Janitors,'' the workers
arrived in busloads, carrying mops and brooms and shouting their
slogan, ``Si se puede!'' (``Yes, it can be done.'')
</P>
<P>
   Entering the theater, they passed within yards of the high rises
of Century City, the complex of office towers and shops where a
strike resulted in a riot between the police and janitors 10 years
ago. It was also here, in April, that a strike brought many of the
janitors above-poverty wages and health care benefits for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so important that this is happening today in Century
City,'' said Rocio Saenz, an organizer for the Service Employees
International Union, which represents 8,500 janitors. For the
organizers, June 15 has become Justice for Janitors Day, in
recognition of the organizing efforts that grew out of the clash in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread and Roses,'' directed by the British filmmaker Ken
Loach, features a fictional group of downtown janitors. Many of the
janitors at the screening worked as extras in the film, or inspired
the screenplay by Paul Laverty, a Scottish-born writer who spent
six years following their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The script switches constantly between English and Spanish, and
many members of the audience used hand-held translators to help
them catch every word. At several points, people in the crowd
shouted and laughed when they recognized themselves on the screen,
or when the janitors got the better of the building owners.
</P>
<P>
   But other moments struck a less celebratory chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene when the supervisor fired some of the workers for
organizing, that really hit home for me,'' said Rosa Ayala, who has
worked in a building in downtown Los Angeles for 11 years. Ayala,
who was in the background of several scenes, shook a large plastic
baby bottle filled with coins instead of clapping her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottle is a symbol of justice for me because it shows how
our money can go to feed our children,'' Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   This preview audience also had no shortage of critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie left out big chunks of a lot of the hard work that
goes on,'' said Aida Cardenas, who led picket lines in Century City
during the recent strike.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the reception was enthusiastic.
Estela Aldana, who has attended strikes ``all over L.A., and in
Oakland and San Jose,'' left with a big smile on her face. ``I was
in many, many scenes,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The janitors' emotional response echoed that of an audience at
the Cannes Film Festival last month. There the screening came only
weeks after the Los Angeles strike, a coincidence not lost on Tom
Ortenberg, co-president of Lions Gate Films, the U.S. distributor
of the film, and a one-time political organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking my entire career for a picture like this,''
Ortenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortenberg, whose company sponsored the screening along with the
Service Employees Union, said that ``Bread and Roses'' was
scheduled for nationwide release in February, and added that the
janitors and other community groups would share in box office
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other way. We have to give some of the proceeds
back to the community,'' Ortenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the film's message of ``it can be done,'' the producers
and filmmakers said they hope to spread the word to an audience
much broader than labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important that people should believe the film and
know the success of your campaign,'' Loach told the janitors after
the lights came up. ``And there's no better way to do that than to
have the real people on the screen.''

RANCHERS IRATE AT MIGRANT FLOW ACROSS BORDER 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. _ As his anger rose against the waves of illegal
immigrants crossing the border onto his cattle ranch, Joe Harris
decided not to carry his gun anymore. He feared losing control and
shooting someone, causing an international incident. Even so, he
wonders now how much more he can stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are getting very tense down here,'' Harris said,
pointing to hideouts on his ranch that illegal immigrants had used
to elude the U.S. Border Patrol. ``The ranchers here are tired of
nothing being done about it. We're tired of the garbage they leave.
We're tired of them tearing down our fences. We're tired of losing
cattle. We're tired of losing our way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   With new law-enforcement resources making other crossing points
along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico harder to penetrate, the
rugged area around Douglas, a town of 15,000 people just north of
Agua Prieta, Mexico, has come under siege by desperate migrants
seeking illegal entry into the United States in hopes of finding
jobs in cities as far away as Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   After federal agencies bolstered security at once-popular
crossing points, like those at El Paso, Texas, and San Diego,
hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, many of them with
children, began flooding the Douglas area two years ago, risking
inhospitable deserts with poisonous snakes and daytime temperatures
of well above 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But lately they have encountered another threat: angry ranchers
on the outskirts of Douglas who have grown so weary of border
crossers tramping across their land in groups of 50 and more that
some ranchers, taking matters into their own hands, have detained
them at gunpoint until Border Patrol agents arrived.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of these ranchers is small, perhaps fewer than
a half-dozen, and only one migrant has been injured by gunfire
since Douglas became so popular as a crossing point, the ranchers'
actions have drawn complaints by the Mexican government and
organizations in Arizona that say the ranchers are violating the
border crossers' human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rancher who the authorities say has been the most
aggressive in confronting the migrants, Roger Barnett, concedes
that a serious incident is inevitable if the government does not do
more to stem the northward flow of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen, with me or somebody else,'' said
Barnett, who has used weapons to detain several thousand illegal
immigrants on his 22,000-acre ranch in the last two years. ``I'm
just sick and tired of all this. I don't want them crossing my
place. If the government was serious, they'd bring in the U.S.
Army. We're getting invaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, however, say the Border Patrol is making
giant strides in the border battle. With more money each year from
Congress, the agency has been able to use its expanding force and
new technology, like night-vision cameras, to help catch border
crossers and discourage others. Those caught _ an estimated one of
every three who cross _ are interviewed and fingerprinted and then
sent back to Mexico, a process that takes only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   But historical patterns show that the successful cutoff of
illegal immigration in one region pushes border crossers into areas
of less resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of illegal immigrants caught by the Border Patrol
in the San Diego area, for example, fell to 182,267 from 524,231
over five years through last year, border crossers discovered that
the Douglas area was an easier entry point. The 12-foot walls
adjacent to the customs checkpoint at Agua Pietra extend only a
short distance, and the Border Patrol had only a handful of agents
and little equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Agua Pietra, a city of more than 100,000, is large
enough to accommodate migrants arriving from all over Mexico and
beyond, including some from Europe and Asia, as they wait for the
elusive ``guides'' that the U.S. authorities regard as criminal
smugglers to lead them into the United States. Guides are known to
charge $1,000 and more per person to lead border crossings, and
they risk arrest and prosecution if caught.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 fiscal year, the 280-mile stretch of Arizona border
known as the Tucson Sector, which includes Douglas, overtook San
Diego as the busiest sector of illegal entry on the southern
border, with 387,406 apprehensions. The total grew to 470,449 in
the 1999 fiscal year _ more than twice the number of five years
before.
</P>
<P>
   In each year, over 40 percent of the apprehensions occurred
along the 28 miles of border flanking Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible down here,'' said Carlos X. Carrillo,
assistant chief patrol agent for the Douglas station. ``Every
night, local residents would be awakened at 1, 2, 3 o'clock in the
morning by people jumping their fences, using their lawn hoses to
wash, hiding on their roofs, knocking on their doors to ask for
food and water. They were all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was not the only town affected by the shift from San
Diego and El Paso. Agua Pietra itself took on a new vibrancy as the
border city adjusted to the arrival of an increasing number of
travelers intent on breaching the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   Busy streets near the customs checkpoint suddenly filled with
pay telephones that Miguel Escobar Valdez, the Mexican consul in
Douglas, said crossers used to ask relatives for money while they
waited to make connections for entry into the United States. Also,
small ``guest houses'' began opening to accommodate migrants,
charging them the equivalent of a few dollars a night.
</P>
<P>
   A receptionist at the Hotel Villa del Rey, a tiny building
several blocks from the border that opened four months ago, said
``the vast majority'' of the six rooms were filled with people
waiting to cross into the United States. Escobar said as many as
400 such places are now operating in Agua Pietra.
</P>
<P>
   Many crossers cannot even afford the guest houses. Juan Marquez
Garcia, a 28-year-old mechanic from Chihuahua, a city 300 miles
away by bus, said he had been living in parks for nearly a month,
trying to enter the United States to find work, only to get caught
six times by U.S. border agents. Now broke, except for a bag of
empty soda cans to be cashed in for a few pesos, he said he planned
to return to Chihuahua when he could raise $11 for bus fare.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States say people like Marquez prove
that their security strategies in the Douglas area are beginning to
work, as statistics for recent months show. Apprehensions in the
Douglas area are beginning to fall. By adding resources and
extending the border walls several miles on each side of town,
Border Patrol officials say they are taking back control of the
region, especially in the town.
</P>
<P>
   But just as increased security efforts elsewhere shifted
patterns of illegal migration to Douglas, these patterns have more
recently shifted again to desert regions beyond the extended walls,
where flimsy barbed-wire fencing separates the two countries. As
the Border Patrol waits for additional resources that arrive each
month, crossers have plotted courses increasingly distant from
Douglas and the highways they use for traveling north.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In these areas are the private ranches where crossers hide until
they make connections arranged by their guides for transportation
to northern cities, or get caught.
</P>
<P>
   Often the immigrants hide for days at a time, and ranchers
complain that they destroy water tanks, pipelines and fences.
``Fixing them has become part of our way of life,'' Harris said.
``Ranching is hard enough without doing all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the immigrants grow so weary, scared or hungry that
they initiate contact with the ranchers. Harris, who keeps a rifle
by his front door, recalled a Mexican couple reaching his house one
morning three months ago, asking for water and use of a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guide had stranded them, telling them a ride would be
along in a few minutes to take them to Phoenix,'' he said. ``Since
then, they had been living for two days in a culvert down the road
with no food. When they showed up here, all they had was a Mexican
can of Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris insisted that he felt compassion for people who wanted
nothing more than a better life. But he and other ranchers said
they believed the U.S. government encouraged illegal immigration by
failing to take more decisive action against companies that hire
them.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Raymond A. Borane of Douglas, who favors a new ``guest
worker program'' that would allow illegal immigrants to work
legally in the United States, said the current economic boom in
some measure stems from the immigrants taking jobs that Americans
did not want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are helping drive our economy,'' Harris said. ``And the
money they send home helps the Mexican economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Escobar, the consul, said illegal immigrants to the
United States from Mexico had been sending back $6 billion a year,
an amount that represents the third-leading source of foreign
revenue in Mexico, behind tourism and oil.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not in the interest of either government to clamp down,
Borane said, expressing an opinion shared by ranchers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, disagreed, citing the North American Free
Trade Agreement as an example of efforts to bring Mexico's economy
and living standards closer to those of the United States. She also
said government agencies did what they could to pursue employers
who hired illegal workers, using criminal and administrative
remedies where possible.
</P>
<P>
   Describing efforts along the border as ``a work in progress,''
Meissner said the trade agreement ``should and will help both
countries, but in a 10-, 20-, 30-year time frame, not one, two or
three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By regulating the border,'' she added, ``we're buying time.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, that does little to appease people like Harris,
who said he feared that ranchers bearing arms and angry attitudes
could do nothing more than drive the problem somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying a sea of old clothes, used water jugs and emptied cans
of refried beans, he shrugged. ``I don't wish this on anybody,'' he
said. ``But I'd rather see the government solve the problem right
here, right now. Otherwise, it only goes to another Joe Harris down
the road.''

FAA WAITED TO TELL AIRLINES ABOUT FLAWED CABLE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In January 1999, a former employee of an upstate New
York company that makes steel cable for the control systems of
passenger jetliners and military aircraft approached federal
prosecutors with a startling story.
</P>
<P>
   The company, she said, had sold the cable for years without
performing the tests required by its most demanding customer, the
U.S. military, and did not even own the equipment needed to detect
flaws in its product.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations were potentially serious. Models of many widely
used airplanes, including the Boeing 737, use steel cable to
connect cockpit controls to the engines, landing gear, rudder and
wing surfaces. The company's customers included the U.S. Air Force
and more than a dozen U.S. and foreign airlines, and the company
had been selling cable for years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal criminal investigators quickly verified the outlines of
the former employee's account. They immediately notified the
Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation Administration
learned of the possible danger soon after.
</P>
<P>
   But the responses were starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials immediately tested samples of the cable,
found that they began to break at barely half the load they were
supposed to support, and started inspections of all aircraft
equipped with it. In August 1999, Air Force mechanics replaced
cable linked to the engine controls of a backup plane to Air Force
Two, which is used by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, by contrast, did no tests and did not inform the
airlines about the possible problems for nearly a year, during
which several carriers continued to use cable sold by Strandflex,
the upstate company.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency finally published a notice about the issue
on May 18, a day after a New York Times reporter first raised
questions about the case. The agency said the timing had been
coincidental. The notification was merely a warning, and it did not
require airlines to act. But soon after, American carriers,
including Southwest and Trans World Airlines, began a special
inspection of all Strandflex cable they had. Southwest has begun
removing it from 47 aircraft, roughly 15 percent of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Strandflex has not been charged with wrongdoing. In documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it has
acknowledged it is the target of a criminal investigation and has
said it intends to fight a civil lawsuit brought by the former
employee, who stands to receive a percentage of any damages the
government might recover.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not comment further about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have reviewed records of accidents and say
there is no evidence of any major accidents caused by cable
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Reports at the National Transportation Safety Board, though,
include incidents in recent years in which broken or frayed cables
forced pilots to take action to land planes safely. The board has
attributed the failures to poor maintenance, and has not
investigated who made the cable involved in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports appear to support what several aviation experts
said in interviews: that a well-trained pilot should, by using
other controls, be able to compensate for the failure of a single
control system tied to the cables.
</P>
<P>
   The experts noted that planes typically have backups, so that a
pilot can steer even if a cable snaps. Still, experts said, they
could imagine situations in which snapped cables could seriously
challenge a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the past month, the FAA offered conflicting
explanations why it had taken nearly a year to tell the airlines
about the cable. First, officials insisted there was no evidence
that the cable had been sold to airlines. Then they acknowledged
that it had been sold to at least several major carriers, but they
said it was not a critical component. Its failure, the officials
asserted, could not cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's views startled several aviation experts, including
Michael Peat, a safety specialist at the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, who said control cables were
among the most critical parts of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Peat said maintenance workers paid particular attention to the
condition of the cables. If one breaks, he said, ``it is
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are what are considered the primary flight controls of
the airplane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critical components like control cables, Peat noted, are subject
to special inspection requirements. The mechanic who installs or
services the cable cannot review the work; another mechanic or an
inspector must do it.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines regularly inspect the cables, Peat said, and when
they are installed workers check them thoroughly. But he said they
did not typically perform the tests required to certify that the
cables were correctly made. That is the manufacturer's
responsibility, he said.

<P>
   Steel aircraft control cable, which is produced by several
companies including Strandflex, is made of twisted strands of metal
wire. According to engineers at Boeing, steel cable is common in
many different aircraft, including the Boeing 737, where it
connects the pilot's controls with a number of systems. Boeing says
it has never bought Strandflex cable or recommended it to its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of the systems are the panels on the
wings known as ailerons. Moving the ailerons tilts the plane, a
maneuver frequently performed during takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
aviation accidents, has examined several incidents in which aileron
cables frayed, stretched or broke during flight and found that
pilots had to fight to maintain control of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   One case the NTSB examined was a March 1993 incident in which a
737 operated by Continental Airlines lost control of its left
aileron shortly after takeoff from Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain stated that the airplane rolled to the left as
soon as it became airborne,'' investigators wrote. ``Considerable
difficulty was experienced controlling the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot safely landed the aircraft, which had a broken aileron
cable.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB did not investigate who made the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Cox, vice chairman of the Airline Pilot Association's
safety committee, said pilots were trained to react when ailerons
fail and typically would be able to maintain control of the
aircraft using other steering systems. He said losing a single
system, like an aileron, would not be life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox, who flew 737s for 15 years, said it would be a mistake
to say a failed aileron cable was not a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flight controls are something you take very seriously,'' he
said.

   Patricia A. Keehle went to work for Strandflex on Jan. 1, 1998.
As a quality assurance manager, she made sure that Strandflex
performed tests on the aviation cable it sold to the military and
other customers. Keehle left Strandflex that August. It is unclear
why she left, and her lawyers said she did not want to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22, 1999, Keehle sued Strandflex in U.S. District Court
in Syracuse, claiming that the company had defrauded the government
by certifying that it had performed the inspections and by using
improper material to make the cable.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company was supposed to use an approved lubricant
to coat the cable, but substituted an untested brand. Keehle said
the lubricant was ``critical to the quality of the cable,'' and was
supposed to function at extreme temperatures. But she said that
when the company tested the cable with the new lubricant at room
temperature, it failed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Dixon, senior vice president and general counsel for
Strandflex's parent company, Handy &AMP; Harman, would not comment on
the case, although he said the company was talking with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission said
that the company was cooperating with the government investigation
and that ``there are no known incidents of any Strandflex wire
failing and causing personal or property damages in any
application.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Keehle filed her lawsuit under the Federal False Claims Act,
which allows whistle-blowers to sue their own companies and collect
part of the damages. After a preliminary investigation, federal
prosecutors in Syracuse notified both the Department of Defense and
the FAA's parent agency, the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, the Department of Defense issued a warning about
Strandflex cable that it sent to other federal agencies. Federal
prosecutors said the FAA was one of the agencies notified.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Air Force received the notice, it began to inspect its
planes, according to Major Chet Curtis, an Air Force spokesman. He
said that in August 1999, workers removed Strandflex engine control
cable from a backup plane to Air Force 2.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's account of how it handled the case raises as many
questions as it answers. Margaret Gilligan, the FAA deputy
administrator for regulation and certification, said agency
officials did not learn of the problem until August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said that in September 1999, the agency sent an
investigator to Syracuse to evaluate the importance of the cable
and make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA initially concluded that the cable was a critical part,
assigning the case its highest level of urgency. But Gilligan said
in a recent interview that the conclusion changed after the
investigator learned more about the cable and its function.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said the investigator recommended that airlines be
notified. But she said that he did not recommend that the agency
issue its most urgent warning, an Airworthiness Directive, which
would have required airlines to fix any problems. ``That is an
indication it was not a safety-of-flight issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said there were several reasons for the lack of
urgency. The FAA, she said, reviewed its records and could find no
reports of problems with Strandflex cable. In addition, she said,
the department's experts believed that because pilots could
continue flying the plane if a cable broke, it was not a crucial
part.
</P>
<P>
   During the next several months, Gilligan said, the agency tried
to determine whether Strandflex cable was ever used by airlines and
found no such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, a day after a New York Times reporter called about
the issue and two months after Keehle's lawsuit was unsealed in a
Syracuse courtroom, the FAA posted a notice about Strandflex on its
Internet site. The posting disclosed the Department of Defense
tests on the cable's strength and said investigators had also found
kinks in samples of the cable. Gilligan said the reason the FAA
took several months to post the notice was that the agency wanted
to make sure it had all the information, including the Department
of Defense test results, before acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In October when the investigator recommended going this route,
we did not have these details,'' she said. ``In May, when we were
able to include that information, it was timely to send out one of
these unapproved parts notifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it learned only recently that Strandflex cable had
been bought by airlines. On June 7, Gilligan said her agency had
learned that ``at least two'' airlines had bought the material. She
said all airlines had received copies of the May 18 parts notice,
and had been notified about the cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Gilligan said, ``we have not been able to
determine there was any risk, but it was prudent to make the
notification.''

 &HT;    Walker tells the story of his gypsy songwriting life
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Singer/Songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker was born and
spent his early years in a small upstate New York town. While still
in his teens, he traveled across country many items, stopping along
the way in such diverse places as Key West, Florida, New Orleans
and Greenwich Village, Manhattan. At each stopover, he learned new
songs, new ways to sing them and new guitar licks to stir into his
developing style as a ``songman.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs he wrote as he traveled tell the story of his life and
way of living and making music. Now, he's written this book that
fills in the details. It's a fascinating tale, whether or not you
are a Jerry Jeff fan.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently you had to look real close to catch a hint of why
young Ronald Clyde Crosby, which was his name in those days, turned
into Jerry Jeff Walker the gypsy songman. But that's what he did,
starting in his late teens when he might have been in college. You
would have had to look very close and be very insightful to see
that kind of future for young Ronald Clyde because, as Jerry Jeff
puts it: ``it was an Ozzie and Harriet life for me. Tuna sandwiches
and Oreo cookies after school. Crewcut boys riding thick tired
bicycles with old playing cards chattering in the spokes. Shooting
hoops in the backyard until dark. I had free run of the
neighborhood. No fences between the neighbor's back yards. so it
was one big playground.''
</P>
<P>
   He started borrowing a neighbor's guitar and that Christmas his
grandmother bought it for him.
</P>
<P>
   And so he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was lucky. 'Cause I used her gift
</P>
<P>
   To get in touch with how to live
</P>
<P>
   And looking back I realize
</P>
<P>
   Music changed my life
</P>
<P>
   Yes, music filled a void in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He began hanging around a pizza joint downtown where
neighborhood kids too young for bars and night life would talk and
sing with the jukebox. A man named Jim Mosca owned the place. he
was a big lumbering man, who played guitar and ``sang
beautifully,'' as Jerry Jeff recalls him.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to young Jerry's early attempts at playing the
guitar Mosca gave him a ukulele, much easier to play, and taught
him a few chords.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't acquire the name Jerry Jeff Walker until
some time later, after he wound up in New Orleans' French Quarter
as a street singer, picking and singing on street corners for tips.
He hung out there with other street singers, learning new guitar
licks and songs and beginning to write more of his own songs. He
liked the name Jeff and had become known in New Orleans as Jerry
Ferris. The name Walker was partly as a tribute to Kirby Walker, a
colorful black jazz pianist who had befriended him many times by
calling him up from the crowd to sing with him.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his best stories, episodes, are set in new Orleans,
where he met many legendary street singers, some who went on to
become nationally known and some who didn't. It was there that he
wrote ``Little Bird'' and ``Drifting Way of Life,'' and started
singing them and others he had written along with the folk songs
that had made up his program exclusively for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   He spent time in Dallas, performing mostly at the old Rubiate,
where he often played with harmonica virtuoso Donny Brooks and
added a neck-mounted harmonica to his own act.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in Austin because, as he once told a radio audience,
``the roads going out of Austin go everywhere and the roads from
everywhere come to Austin,'' or something like that. Pure Jerry
Jeff reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   He formed his own band in Austin, the Lost Gonzo band, bought a
house, met an Austin girl named Susan Streit, got married and more
or less settled down, after a fairly brief adjustment period. To
quote from Bud Shrake's foreword: ``The beautiful Susan turned out
to have a hard head for numbers and a powerful personality. She
gets what she wants, and one thing she wants is for her husband to
thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rest is, if not history, then widely known in the crazy
world of country/pop/folk/cow jazz music. To quote again from
Shrake's foreword, ``Jerry Jeff does his own music as he desires
it. And when a fan buys an album through the catalog or over the
internet, it is bought from Jerry Jeff and Susan, not from a mogul
in Los Angeles or Nashville. Jerry Jeff is now a troubadour with a
big database.''
</P>
<P>
   I've known Jerry Jeff for years and many people have asked me
where in this world he came from, for gosh sakes. Now I know and
you can too, by reading his new book, aptly titled ``Gypsy
Songman.''

 &HT;    Dads teach kids to take their place
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was something about my husband bending over the
rain gauge after a recent sprinkle _ not enough rain to call it a
shower _ that reminded me of his dad. The only difference in their
anxious reactions during a drought is John yells back at the
Weather Channel, while W.T. Ezzard surely would have blamed the
Farmer's Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   If John were growing vegetables on the North Georgia farm as his
dad used to do, he could anticipate an even worse summer than with
the vineyard he's cultivating on the same land. Grapes like dry
weather, although not to the extreme the Southeast is experiencing
just now.
</P>
<P>
   The farm boy in my husband has been the subject of family humor
for years _ years when he and I were raising three children in the
city. Even then, he insisted that Shelly, Lisa and John Jr. learn
how to make squash mounds, tend tomato plants and hoe a few rows of
corn in a backyard garden. They complained at times, but as they
grew up, they came to appreciate the joy of growing things. It was
only lately, though, that the children and I really understood how
strong the link was between farm work and the lessons John's dad
passed on to him.
</P>
<P>
   My father-in-law died three years ago, but recently we stumbled
upon some faded military postcards in the back of an old family
scrapbook. They were written when John's father was in North Africa
during World War II. Aimed at encouraging a young boy to be good
and do his chores without a dad to oversee him, the postcards speak
powerful messages in simple words. They were sent in 1943 when
John, the oldest son, was 6 years old:
</P>
<P>
   Dear John,
</P>
<P>
   Your daddy is having a good time living in a tent with three
other fellows. It has been mighty cold here though. How is your
garden doing? Fine I am sure. You will have to take Daddy's place
around the place for a while so you want to learn managing things.
Be a good boy and say your prayers every night. _ Love, Daddy
</P>
<P>
   Dearest John,
</P>
<P>
   How is daddy's fine boy by now? I am anxious to receive a letter
from you. You should be a regular farmer by the time Daddy gets
home! How is your red calf? She should be a big cow by now. Also
your garden is doing well, I hope. It won't be long until you are
old enough to be a 4H Club member. Take good care of Lucy, Henry
and Joanne (John's siblings) and give them my love. _ Your Daddy
</P>
<P>
   There were a few special cards before Christmas and birthdays.
No matter the occasion, though, there were always the lines about
tending the garden, learning to be a real farmer, taking daddy's
place. Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Dear John,
</P>
<P>
   Wish I could be there with you for your birthday, but I guess
that is impossible this year. Anyway, it makes me feel good to know
that my big boy is growing up to be a young man who is capable of
taking a place in the world. Hope you will always be as good a man
as you are a boy. . . . That was a good picture of you hoeing in
the garden. I wish I had some more like it. All the gardens over
here are dried up now. _ Love, Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was wounded in the war, John's dad made it home to
the family and the farm he loved. But the letters he wrote might
have been written today by any caring dad to a son, although in the
context of a much different lifestyle. Whether driving a tractor or
surfing the Internet, playing baseball or studying the stock
market, dads are still at it _ passing on the ``how-tos'' to their
sons.
</P>
<P>
   The timeless message lives on for the Ezzard sons, as it does
for a lot of others: You will have to take Daddy's place around the
place.

   HEARTLAND-MAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When national Republicans gather
Monday in Dayton to talk about improving Social Security and the
nation's schools, they'll be trying to get the attention of voters
like Dayton elementary school principal Gwen Jarvis. Jarvis is
among thousands of undecided voters across Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Illinois whose support both Republican Gov. George W.
Bush and Democrat Al Gore need to win the presidency. Those four
states from the industrial heartland are the biggest prizes among a
handful of states that both parties consider competitive
battlegrounds in their efforts to gather the 270 electoral votes
necessary to get to the White House. Together the four states
account for 84 electoral votes. The states are known for farms that
grow corn and soybeans and for factories that turn out steel and
automobiles, but they also regularly determine the winners in close
presidential elections. ``The South and Mountain West have
basically been conceded to Bush, and California and New York have
basically been conceded to Gore, so the heartland states like Ohio
are it for these two guys,'' said Allan Lichtman, history
department chairman at American University in Washington, D.C.

toward irrelevancy, is surging with new energy under the leadership
of AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. No where is labor's new potency
and political clout more on display than in Los Angeles, where
union membership swelled by 91,000 people last year, the most of
anywhere in the country. New immigrants account for much of labor's
increase and their numbers have helped the Democrats reclaim all
three branches of California's government. This year, the AFL-CIO
is poised to reverse a long-standing policy opposing amnesty for
immigrants in a move that reflects how important immigrant workers
have become to labor's economic and political future. (Foskett,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 60.

age 62 _ my age _ my father suffered his first serious illness. It
happened on an early-spring morning in 1954, the day we were to
take the mules and the turning plows and begin to plow the fields
for planting. Tedious work, yet, in my memory, good work. The
slicing of the ground, rolled over to the right of the plow-blade,
leaving ripples. At day's end it was pleasing to lean against the
crossbar of the plow handles and see the evenness of the ripples,
and to breathe in the winter dampness of the dirt _ a scent like
rain closing in over distant pine stands. We did not make it to the

TV'S IMPIOUS PUPPETS: ON KREMLIN'S HIT LIST? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In what looks to many here like a twilight struggle
over the future of free speech, the Kremlin has handed one
journalist over to Chechen guerrillas, demanded that newspapers
obtain federal licenses and, on Tuesday, put Russia's leading press
baron in a notoriously louse-ridden prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the litmus test of the Kremlin's intentions may be whether
it tries to crack down on a bunch of grotesque, legless latex
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The dolls _ a jug-eared, sheep-eyed President Vladimir Putin;
his Rasputin-esque staff chief, Alexander Voloshin; dead-on
renditions of balding communists, woolly-headed right-wingers and
other famous rogues _ are the cast of ``Kukly,'' which wrapped up
its weekly filming late Thursday on a ramshackle sound stage near
the Moscow River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kukly'' is political satire. But that is like calling a beaver
a rodent. By turns vicious, obscene, hilarious and knowing, it has
long been the most popular television show in Russia. At 10 p.m. on
any given Sunday, more than half the nation's sets are riveted on
the program.
</P>
<P>
   No one would be surprised to see that share jump even higher
this Sunday. Because the press baron whom the Kremlin jailed last
week, Vladimir A. Gusinsky, owns the NTV television network that
produces ``Kukly.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a growing sense _ not least among the program's
staff _ that the rubbery stars are on a collision course with
whoever actually holds power inside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find the limits of freedom of expression here, and
show those limits to others,'' Grigory Petrovich Lyubomirov, a
writer and director of the program, said between breaks in filming.
``Because we have something to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived 10 years under conditions of freedom here. And I
don't want to turn back to what was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kukly'' regularly tests those limits. American television may
be saturated with sex and violence, but it is doubtful that New
York's corporate suits would swallow hard enough to broadcast some
of the program's most memorable political jabs.
</P>
<P>
   One, broadcast last winter, was built around a drive by Putin's
puppet down Moscow's glitziest avenue, Tverskaya Street, where he
rated major politicians. Tame enough _ except that the drive began
at Russia's Parliament, shown as a high-class bawdy house, and the
street politicians that Putin's puppet was rating were cast as
cheap prostitutes bidding to join the orgy that was his
presidential bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kukly's'' account of the politicians' charms, from
sadomasochism to virginity, cannot be fully described, at least not
in this space. But any Russian who saw the program knew precisely
what was meant.
</P>
<P>
   A famous ``Kukly'' from 1995 skewered the government's new
$10-a-month minimum wage by casting former President Boris Yeltsin
and his prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, as drunken street
bums, sifting through trash to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Other episodes have cast top political figures as criminals on a
Siberian prison train and tell-all guests in a Russian version of a
Ruth Westheimer sex show. Putin was cast early as a surgeon on the
Russian body politic, armed with hatchet and blowtorch. He was
reportedly infuriated when the program adapted a German fairy tale
to depict him as a self-indulgent, tantrum-throwing infant.
</P>
<P>
   Such slights might be more easily borne if the effect were not
enhanced, sometimes outlandishly, by the puppets, which are made in
France from sculpted caricatures. The amazingly lifelike dolls are
usually operated by two actors, each of whom contributes an arm,
while dividing mouth movements, blinking and other tasks between
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that ``Kukly'' has been in hot water before.
</P>
<P>
   Lyubomirov, a ponytailed, 46-year-old philosopher who attended
the same St. Petersburg university as Putin, said producers used to
get calls from Yeltsin's wife and daughters _ asking not for gentle
political treatment but instead that the president not be depicted
as so feeble.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is less generous to Yeltsin: His chief prosecutor
began a criminal inquiry into ``Kukly'' in 1995 after the
street-bum episode, citing a law that barred insulting portrayals
of senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lyubomirov said, little from the Yeltsin era
has approached the pressure that ``Kukly'' has experienced since
Putin came to high office, as prime minister, last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things changed dramatically,'' he said. ``There were no
requests for physical changes. But we've received threats from his
political family _ not threats to close the program but that the
program may have some `difficulties.' And this Russian phrase `to
have difficulties' can mean many things.''
</P>
<P>
   The threats peaked in March in a private conversation between a
senior Kremlin official and a top executive at NTV. Yevgeny
Kiselyev, the network's general director, said the official
proffered a list of tasks the network would have to meet to escape
the government's wrath, including less skeptical political coverage
and toned-down reporting on the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those demands was to get Putin's look-alike _ his
rubber look-alike, that is _ off the `Kukly' show,'' Kiselyev said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kukly'' responded last month in classic fashion. The program
told the biblical story of the Israelites' trek through the
wilderness and their salvation by Moses, who led them to the holy
land on God's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Israelites were an assortment of Kremlin
politicians, and Moses _ once more Putin's right-hand aide Voloshin
_ returned from the mountain with a series of curious commandments.
</P>
<P>
   One, ``Thou shalt not kill,'' was amended to exclude killings in
outhouses _ an allusion to Putin's crude threat last year to wipe
out Chechen militants, even in the toilet. ``Thou shalt not steal''
was altered to permit petty theft after the Israelite politicians
complained bitterly about the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   As for the deity himself, he was so terrible that no one could
look upon him or even speak his name. However, Voloshin said, ``You
can call him `Lord God' or, for short, the Russian initials for the
term: GB.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody missed the fact that ``GB'' can also be short for
``KGB,'' Putin's old employer as well as the specter of
totalitarian control that critics now accuse him of resurrecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to respond in a way that was easy _ to show that
we're not working with rubber puppets but with public stereotypes
and misconceptions,'' Lyubomirov said. ``If we want, we can not
show people. But we can set up everything so that everyone
understands what we are talking about.''

<P>
   It is a talent honed by decades of practice under Soviet rule,
where even the tamest observation had to be made obliquely. As the
episode filmed on Thursday showed, this is not the show's customary
style.
</P>
<P>
   The program to be broadcast Sunday night was conceived on Monday
as a satire on Russia's desire to present a modern face to the
world. After President Clinton leaves this month's Moscow summit
meeting covered with rotten tomato pulp _ `Drop dead, you limb of
Satan!' one legislator cries after him _ Putin decides that Russia
needs a new, modern image.
</P>
<P>
   He summons the state painter _ his aide, Voloshin _ to produce a
portrait of civility: a reproduction of a famous
turn-of-the-century painting, ``Meeting of the State Council,''
which depicts the czar and his advisers in greatcoated splendor.
Much of the humor turns on the efforts of politicians, from the
former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Yeltsin's discredited
liberal aides, to position themselves in the updated portrait
around Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Voloshin, widely regarded as an architect of the Kremlin's
crackdown on dissent, plays the heavy as an artist with grand
designs for Kremlin power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that everybody see the true and wonderful face
of our statehood, that we do not abjure new ideas,'' Putin says at
one point in the skit. ``We are not Zulus of some sort. We have
opposition, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Voloshin replies: ``Of course, your majesty! Even two
oppositions: the left and the right. Just say how many of them you
want, and you'll have them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the story, anyway, until the NTV chairman, Gusinsky,
was jailed on Tuesday evening. Now the episode ends with a twist:
The characters find themselves wearing not greatcoats but prison
uniforms reminiscent of Stalin's purges.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, an iron curtain descends across the stage _ an
unsubtle allusion not just to the fact that state repression falls
on both great and small but that it also cuts Russia off from the
civilized world that the Putin puppet professes to admire.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact that ``Kukly'' can broadcast such heresy on
national television, of course, is evidence that freedom of speech
lives here, something Lyubomirov freely allows.
</P>
<P>
   The question, he says, is not whether, but for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we don't have freedom of speech. I'm saying
that the field of that freedom is being narrowed. There are fewer
and fewer who can speak the truth. And maybe ours is one of the
last.''

   NEW YORK _ A show opened on 14th Street last week and will close
next week. Most people will never even know it happened. Those who
stumble upon it may be disappointed by the lack of scenery, props
and costumes or by the fact that cast members read their lines from
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   They may also be bothered by having to follow paper signs up to
the second floor and around a corridor to find the 99-seat
auditorium in the Sol Goldman YMHA on East 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But once they pay $15 for a ticket, settle into chipped metal
chairs and open photocopied paper programs, audience members may
well be pleasantly surprised by what happens on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The production of the 1958 Jean and Walter Kerr musical,
``Goldilocks,'' features the fresh _ and in some cases, slightly
weathered _ faces of 14 actors and actresses who can belt a song,
hoof a dance number and pull off a slapstick sequence or a love
scene.
</P>
<P>
   All this, even though their only pay is $3 a day for subway fare
and they had only two weeks to rehearse for the production, which
ends June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The show _ produced by a two-year-old organization called
Musicals Tonite, which presents plain pipe-rack concert versions of
neglected musicals _ is emblematic of a certain level of theater
happening every night in New York City. It's performed below the
radar of reviews. It is unknown to even the most stalwart of
theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   There are four tiers of production laid out by the Actors Equity
Association, the actors' union, defined by a series of economic
yardsticks. Musicals Tonite is in Tier 1, the lowest, under which _
with the union's approval _ a producer can pay Equity actors
nothing for their work, with the exception of car fare, when
needed. On any given night in the city, there are 20 to 30 such
shows in various, often out-of-the-way, stages around town.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Miller, the 57-year-old former computer salesman behind
Musicals Tonite, said he created his company precisely because he
realized that the city was full of talented people, forgotten
material, willing audiences and not enough work. So he left his
most recent career, moderating focus groups, to create a four-show
season of musicals, each with a budget of $15,000. In the last two
years, the company's shows have included ``King of Hearts,'' ``Look
Ma, I'm Dancing'' and ``Dearest Enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the company's entire administrative office: he hauls
the few pieces of scenery (like the potted trees in
``Goldilocks''), takes the tickets, arranges for the cookies and
crudites for the cast party. And, aside from a few small donations
so far, Miller has been footing the bill from his savings. As a
result, every costume rental is a calculation.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Goldilocks,'' Miller sprang for a bear suit, ``a function
of what I can afford, or how much I feel I can afford to lose,'' he
said. ``What's a laugh worth every night of a 16-night run? Ten
dollars? Twenty dollars? If the director thinks he can get a laugh
from a costume that cost $16, that's a dollar a laugh a night. I'm
going to spend that. That's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   And what's in it for the actors? The opportunity to be seen by
casting directors or agents who are invited to the performances,
though they don't usually come; a chance to polish their singing,
acting and dancing; and to play a lead role when they would
otherwise be cast in the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   They do it because they figure it's better to be working than
not working, even if they are working for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a corporate ladder _ the next step up, the next
step up,'' said Michael McKenzie, who has the lead role in
``Goldilocks.'' ``You can be on Broadway and then suddenly you're
back in the basement of a church in a corner dressing room with
water dripping on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   While one might expect just a handful of actors to trickle in
for auditions for a show that does not pay any money, there was a
steady stream of men and women going into the audition room at
Actors Equity studios earlier this month _ six people every 20
minutes _ day after day for five days. They proferred their glossy
head shots, lengthy resumes and sang their hearts out. Most casting
calls let people get through only a few bars; Musicals Tonite's
musical director, Mark Hartman, who receives the same car fare
wages, as does the director, lets actors sing the whole song.
</P>
<P>
   The resumes were revealing. Among the venues the actors listed
were the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, the Copa Room at the Sands
Hotel, the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Broadway and the Disney Cruise
Line. Among the ``special skills'' listed at the bottom of the
resumes were ``burp on cue,'' ``giving manicures,'' ``lamp repair''
and ``screaming and playing piano with toes.'' Some of the actors
were merely between projects; some were desperate for work. Thomas
Mills, who directed ``Goldilocks,'' said the difference was
immediately clear. ``You see it when people walk into an audition
if they haven't worked in a while,'' Mills said. ``They carry an
apology with them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 38, who himself has managed to make a living in the
theater by directing cabaret acts and industrials (live
presentations for companies) including a recent show celebrating
Sony Walkman's 20th anniversary, said there were also those who
came in with palpable confidence. ``They walk into a room with the
energy of, `You should watch me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people he sees in auditions should be thinking about new
careers, he acknowledged, but, he said, he has been struck by the
general quality of talent and the numbers of actors eager to sign
on for something with no pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my main competitors is the Census Bureau, which is
paying $18.50 an hour,'' Miller said. Musicals Tonite may have a
leg up on the census by offering actors a forum, he said. But, he
added, actors ``also want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those chosen for ``Goldilocks'' support themselves with
other work. McKenzie was recently the maitre d'hotel at a
restaurant on the Upper West Side. James Patterson, who plays
George, the leading lady's foppish fiance, has worked the front
desk and gift shop at a hotel. Erin Malloy, a member of the
ensemble, is a hostess and waitress at a restaurant on Columbus
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Musicals Tonite rehearses only during the evenings, so that
actors can get to their day jobs or go to auditions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Malloy, who comes from Pennsylvania, stood out in the
ensemble on opening night, she said the last six months had been
her longest acting dry spell. ``I'm just not exactly what people
are looking for right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doing a show like ``Goldilocks,'' actors say, helps to get
through the droughts, along with taking dance, acting and singing
classes. (``Sometimes just going out and eating a big old banana
split will do it, too,'' said Jen Celene Little, who plays Lois,
who aspires to be a star.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though some of the cast members have been on Broadway or
toured in big-budget musicals, several said they did not consider a
production like ``Goldilocks'' beneath them. At least they were
working, they said, and not having to leave town to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who say, I'm going to be a star,'' Mills
said. ``Most of the actors I've met want to be employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Creighton, who plays Bessie, a wise-cracking matron, in
``Goldilocks,'' said that she usually did commercials, but that
because of the strike by commercial and television actors, she
couldn't take those jobs. ``This was a shot in the arm,'' Creighton
said. ``It was activity. And it was activity that I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the road from tryout to opening night lasted little
more than two weeks, there were bumps along the way, as there
always are with Musicals Tonite _ one actor dropped out because he
got a paying part. But no one complained about the cramped studios
or the creaky floors at Shetler Studios on Eighth Avenue where
signs warn, ``Absolutely no rehearsing in the halls.'' Nor did
anyone complain about rehearsing on weekends. The principals never
balked at being able to run through songs and scenes only once.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, who grew up in Nebraska and Massachusetts and moved to
New York City in 1979, has been in an episode of ``Law and Order.''
He replaced an original cast member in this season's ``Waiting in
the Wings'' on Broadway and will be understudying a role in the
upcoming production of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' with Nathan
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay at it because the rewards, when they come, are so
great,'' McKenzie said. ``It carries you through, gets you through
the quieter times or the truly frustrating or horrible times.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the actors say they try to control their
expectations of who might show up at performances, it is difficult.
Who might be out there? An agent or producer offering a big break?
Most of the time, no.
</P>
<P>
   People who come to Musicals Tonite performances find out about
the shows through listings in The Village Voice, word of mouth, or
industry talk. Miller also sends out 15,000 postcard announcements
through a mailing list provided by the Theater Development Fund, a
nonprofit group that runs the TKTS booth and sponsors theater
support programs. (Musicals Tonite is not listed as a business:
people who want information and reservations can call Miller at
(212) 362-5620.)
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he had about 120 subscribers who pay $60 for the
season, not all of whom come to every production. Usually, the
auditorium is half full. Once, during a tremendous storm, the
audience at an earlier production was seven.
</P>
<P>
   The first performance of ``Goldilocks'' had the excitement of
any opening night. A few casting directors, like Warren Pincus of
The Goodspeed Opera House, a regional theater in East Haddam,
Conn., had reserved tickets for the coming performances. A critic
from Backstage, the trade newspaper, also reserved a ticket.There
was even a celebrity in the audience _ Elaine Stritch, who starred
in the leading role of Maggie in the original production of
``Goldilocks'' on Broadway, came for the first act and went
backstage at intermission to offer congratulations. ``You remind me
of me,'' she told Cathy Trien, who plays Maggie: ``Granted, there
are 30,000 years between us.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few more ups and downs. One performance had to
be canceled because Trien had a conflict: a part in a Chris Rock
film.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Mealia, an ensemble member, was also offered a paying
role, but stayed, whichMiller said brought tears to his eyes.
Often, optimism fills the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I feel one of these shows is going to be more than
a two-week staged concert,'' said Hartman, 29, musical director for
``Goldilocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller and his compatriots hunker down and keep their
hopes up, as if trying to heed the flip but trenchant admonition
Stritch left them with opening night: ``OK, kids. Have fun.''

   WASHINGTON _ The images sent imaginations soaring.
</P>
<P>
   On the airport tarmac in Pyongyang last Tuesday, the reclusive,
elusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, reached forward and
greeted his guest, President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, with an
honor guard and a gripping, two-handed handshake. Behind the grins,
it was tempting to see a melting of a half-century of hostility
across the Korean peninsula, one of the world's most dangerous
flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, Bashar Assad, a 34-year-old British-educated
eye doctor who is the new ruler of Syria, stood stoically near the
flag-draped coffin of his father, President Hafez Assad, receiving
condolences from a parade of visiting foreign princes and
dignitaries. One of those visitors was Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, expressing hope _ ever so tentatively _ that the new
Syrian leader might cool off the most enduringly hostile corner of
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, pure coincidence that the two events took
place the same day. But beneath the surface, there are profound
similarities in what was happening last week.
</P>
<P>
   Both North Korea and Syria are relics of another age _
dictatorships based on internal terror and hostility to external
neighbors, threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. And
now Syria, like North Korea six years ago, has embarked on a
dynastic transition that may _ or may not _ give reason to hope for
an easing of those tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In each place, power has passed from a dictator to his son, and
the son shows signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to
solving his country's deep problems. Perhaps that can make the
world more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the disquieting feeling that it won't be easy;
terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the systems in which these
two sons rule, and whether they can _ or even want to _ tame parts
of those systems may be the most important factors in determining
whether a real transformation is under way. Change, for both sons,
will be risky: moving from a terror-based society to a more open
one always is.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of North Korea, Kim Jong Il appears to have made a
strategic, possibly desperate, decision to reach out to the rest of
the world. Even before he pledged during the summit that he would
visit South Korea, he established diplomatic relations with Italy
and secretly visited China. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has
said he will visit North Korea next month, and Japan is negotiating
a possible resumption of relations.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Syria, the younger Assad, an English- and
French-speaking Internet enthusiast in a country where free speech
is a fantasy and the Internet has been branded a threat to
security, made clear even before he assumed the reins of power that
he was different from his father. ``I am not one of those who keeps
power for himself,'' he told the Egyptian weekly Al Ousboua in an
interview before his father's death. ``I believe in the need to
open up to all opinions and listen to all viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   But for both men, success is not at all guaranteed, and for
remarkably similar reasons. Neither Kim Jong Il nor Bashar Assad
got his job the way his father did _ as a military leader who
grabbed and consolidated power. Even though both countries are
called ``republics,'' the sons did not get their jobs because of
the will of the people. They did not even get their jobs in the
most traditional dynastic way _ through the legitimacy implicit in
royal blood lines.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the two sons came into power only because of the
political manipulations of their fathers while they were alive,
abetted after their deaths by military and terror apparatuses
bequeathed to the sons as pillars of their respective systems. That
means that their claim to legitimacy is dangerously thin, and any
bold move either at home or abroad is fraught with risks. Both
men's fathers left them societies in bad economic shape, North
Korea's disastrously so. Westerners sometimes see that as a force
dictating an opening to the outside world. But both sons must be
aware that a wrong move in that direction could bring down the
wrath of the military or the ruling party. At the same time,
isolating potential rivals and suddenly placing new power in the
hands of foreign businessmen, or the press, or the people
themselves, could bring down the entire structure of power.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea's case, for example, Kim inherited the most
isolated regime in the world, one whose people have been fed an
extraordinary stream of propaganda and one where any sudden influx
of real information about how much better the outside world lives
could be enormously destabilizing and dangerous to the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the history of efforts to remove terror from a
political system without bringing it down.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried and failed outright;
his system was too brittle to withstand the sweeping societal,
economic and political changes he envisioned. It simply collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   China, wary of Gorbachev's mistakes, is experimenting with
retaining its Communist Party structure and autocratic government
while opening up its economy to capitalism and foreign investment;
the ultimate outcome of this juggling act is not at all certain
either.
</P>
<P>
   And in Syria's ally Iran, yet another kind of risky transitional
experiment is under way. There clerical leaders are mixing two
volatile chemicals _ Islam and democracy _ in a struggle to
reconcile representative government and the rule of law with
theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, despite Kim Jong Il's opening to the world,
there is no evidence that he intends to open up the political
system for his starving population at home. North Korea is so
closed, its people apparently so quiescent, that when he postponed
the summit for a day, he felt no need to explain why. He could quip
that he knew all about South Korea from watching its television for
years, a right that is denied to his citizens, whose sole radio
station blares government propaganda that good citizens are
expected to leave on all day long. In fact, most of the images of
the two leaders meeting that were beamed to South Korea were not
shown in the North. Virtually no foreigners were allowed to attend
the summit in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the decision to engage as a decision to open up
North Korean society,'' said Stephen Linton, a Korea expert and
chairman of the nonprofit Eugene Bell Foundation, created to fight
tuberculosis in North Korea. ``These folks are not frustrated
democrats. They have never been educated to question authority. On
the contrary, they have been educated to be loyal to their leader.
Unanimity is a public virtue here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to Linton, who has spent considerable time in North Korea
over the years, the country is a black hole. ``Thirty to 40 years
into Korean studies, I have no idea where this is going,'' he said.
``It's humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, a Mediterranean country with a long mercantile
tradition, the people are much less isolated and more politically
sophisticated. Despite the closed nature of Syrian society and the
authoritarian system of decision-making today, many Syrians
remember the 1950s, when they enjoyed democratic rights under a
multiparty system. But they also remember that the period of
democracy ended in a series of coups; it is the kind of denouement
that sours repressive societies on the soft side of democracy, and
surely there is no nostalgia for that kind of instability, even in
the Syria of the Assads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the stakes for peace in general, it is to be
expected that the outside world is lining up to nudge both North
Korea and, to a lesser extent, Syria, to achieve reasonable
relationships with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea's case, China in particular has reason to act: it
has cultivated relationships with both North and South Korea and
has endured an illegal influx of hundreds of thousands of North
Koreans fleeing the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States is puzzling over what last week's
showmanship means. Clinton administration officials aren't revising
intelligence assessments about the need for a national missile
defense that would define North Korea as the pre-eminent threat. In
fact, one theory at the Pentagon is that Kim Jong Il's outreach
could all be a plot orchestrated by Russia to derail an American
limited missile defense initiative. ``Nothing North Korea does
short of merging with the South and democratizing would change our
calculation about the threat,'' one senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Syria, the signs are more subtle. Both before and since
Hafez Assad's death, the United States has said that it sees little
chance in the short term for progress toward an Israeli-Syrian
peace. Israeli officials are also pessimistic, although some have
painted the new Syrian leader in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that both societies are controlled at
the top, leaving outsiders little leverage to affect change except
through formal state-to-state relations. There are no parliaments
or newspapers or independent groups to bond with.
</P>
<P>
   ``These highly autocratic regimes can use their international
connections to enhance their domestic positions and extract
concessions from the outside world,'' said Stephen Krasner, a
political science professor at Stanford University. ``But the
nature of these regimes also limits the ability of external actors
to alter policies.'' In other words, even those intriguing images
last week of outsiders invited in can be used to keep these
societies closed.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The remarkable summit meeting between the Korean
leaders this week has left the Clinton administration widely
divided over North Korea's intentions, but has not so far
diminished its resolve to move ahead with a missile defense,
administration and defense officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent diplomatic forays that culminated in a general
agreement between the Korean leaders to work for peace and unity on
their divided peninsula, North Korea has not stopped work on the
long-range missile program that has helped provoke proposals for
the United States to build a defensive shield, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a highly classified intelligence report being prepared
for President Clinton will conclude that, if the current pace of
development remains unchanged, North Korea could still build a
missile capable of striking the United States by 2005, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Without more concrete agreements and changes in North Korea's
behavior, the officials said, it would not be prudent to back away
from plans to build the missile defense now, despite the fact that
the proposal has roiled relations with Russia, China and even
America's European allies. Three days of smiles and toasts, they
emphasized, do not erase years of effort by North Korea to build
nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not from the summit and not from any of the other things have
we seen any signs that they are changing their program to develop
missiles,'' Walter Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for
policy, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials acknowledge that they will face
even greater diplomatic pressure after this week's summit meeting
to forswear the shield.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the striking scenes of the Korean leaders
warmly embracing, holding hands and clinking Champagne glasses have
underscored divisions within the administration over how _ and how
quickly _ to proceed with a defensive shield and what the North's
true intentions might be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, officials acknowledge that the summit meeting has
helped fuel some doubts over much of the rationale for a missile
defense, which is that the North Korean government was so
irrational and unpredictable that it would not respond to normal
threats of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we argue that we face the same threat if we have a North
Korea trying to integrate into the international community?'' a
former senior defense official said, referring obliquely to the
administration's characterization of North Korea as a rogue state.
Noting that North Korea's diplomatic steps have seemed well
calculated in recent months, the official added: ``How can we at
the same time argue that it is an irrational state?''
</P>
<P>
   The North's diplomatic opening has already prompted the White
House to indicate that it will lift a broad set of economic
sanctions that have been in place since North Korea invaded South
Korea 50 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, by
telephone on Thursday and met on Friday in New York with South
Korea's national security adviser, Wong Won Tak, to discuss the
summit meeting. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
that she would go to South Korea next week for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But officials repeatedly emphasized that it is too soon to
evaluate promises of cooperation from North Korea, and that they
were looking for more concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see something more than handshakes and speeches,''
a four-star military officer said. For starters, he suggested that
the North could withdraw some of its formidable artillery dug in
near the border within easy range of Seoul, the South's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting this week has left various parts of the
administration with widely divergent interpretations as to its
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The most wary assessment, held by some senior military
officials, is that it remains impossible to decipher the true
motives of the North Korean leader, Kim Il Jong, who before this
week had been described by U.S. officials as reclusive and
paranoid. They darkly suggest that he is in league with China and
Russia to undercut support for an U.s. missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pentagon and State Department officials, on the other hand,
are cautiously optimistic that the North is indeed beginning to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some senior intelligence officials say they believe
that reconciliation between the North and South, driven by the
determination of the 75-year-old South Korean president, will
happen faster than anyone can predict.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that the summit meeting together with
North Korea's other recent diplomatic overtures might yet force a
reconsideration of U.S. assumptions about North Korea's intentions,
but they said their assessment of the North missile abilities has
remained unchanged. The most recent intelligence finding that is to
be presented to Clinton reaches the same conclusion as last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea reached an agreement with the United States
last fall to suspend testing of missiles like the one fired over
Japan in 1998, the North Korean military has not suspended
development of a new generation of missiles, known as the Taepo
Dong 2, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has honored its pledge not to test-fire its missiles
and even renewed that pledge early this year, but intelligence
analysts say they still detect work at that site, as well as other
types of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to test motors, missile engines and things like
that,'' said a senior military officer who closely monitors North
Korea. ``There's nothing on their launch pads, but they're
continuing to make improvements'' at the test site.

</P>
<P>
   Since this week's summit meeting, officials in Washington have
tried to tamp down expectations that one of the last fronts of the
Cold War may soon disappear, fundamentally altering U.S. security
interests in Asia, including the presence of some 37,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea and its assessment of North Korea's missile
threat. The day after the summit meeting, the Pentagon's spokesman,
Kenneth Bacon, called for ``warier, controlled exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon, in particular, were adamant that
whatever diplomatic progress was made, the United States was still
justified in moving ahead with a limited national missile defense,
the first phase of which is explicitly intended to counter a threat
from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The latest assessment of North Korea's missile threat is
critical to the Pentagon's plans to develop a limited defense,
beginning with 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The current timetable for building the $60-billion system is
based entirely on last year's estimate that North Korea could have
the ability to hit the United States with nuclear- or
chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a system in place by then, the Pentagon's
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization needs to begin construction
of its first sophisticated radar site in Alaska by next spring, and
a decision must be made by Clinton before then.
</P>
<P>
   The new intelligence report on potential missile threats _ known
as a National Intelligence Estimate _ was ordered by the White
House to update last year's assessment as Clinton nears a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's intelligence report concluded that North Korea's
long-range missile program had advanced much further than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, North Korea tested a three-stage missile, known
as a Taepo Dong 1, by firing it over Japan. The third stage of that
missile, which carried a small satellite, failed to reach orbit,
but intelligence officials concluded that other aspects of the test
had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's report concluded that the Taepo Dong 1 was not
sophisticated enough to carry a nuclear warhead and that North
Korea was more likely to put weapons on a more advanced missile,
the Taepo Dong 2.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the new intelligence report had concluded that
North Korea would still be able to field an intercontinental
ballistic missile by 2005. ``Certainly there is no evidence they
have stopped their development program for the Taepo Dong 2,'' a
senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean threat is not the only factor Clinton must
consider before moving ahead, but the intelligence findings will
support arguments made by supporters of a missile defense that the
United States needs a defensive shield. Opponents are sure to seize
on the diplomatic developments to argue for postponing a decision
on deploying a shield.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even before the summit meeting, the administration was
struck by North Korea's relative opening after years of wary
seclusion. In recent months, Kim has begun a flurry of diplomatic
initiatives, including establishing relations with Italy, Brunei
and Australia and applying for membership in forums of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have also revived their on-again-off-again
discussions with the United States. At the end of May, North Korean
negotiators surprised their U.S. counterparts during a meeting in
Rome by asking to discuss their missile program, and a new round of
talks is expected soon. Only June 9, the North Korean Army agreed
to resume cooperating with searches for the remains of U.S.
soldiers killed in the Korean War, and the first team is scheduled
to arrive later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear by looking at North Korea's behavior that
something has changed in the last year, year and a half,'' the
assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, Stanley Roth, told
defense writers before the summit meeting. ``The hermit kingdom has
become the hyperactive kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans applauded this week's
summit meeting as a welcome first step in defusing one of the
world's most dangerous hot spots, but warned against dropping
America's guard against the North's still formidable conventional
and nuclear military threat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who is on the Intelligence Committee,
spoke for many of his colleagues: ``I would hope no serious person
would assume we could change our policy on a dime just because of
what happened in the last couple of days.''

GOP AND VOTERS RETHINK PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most politicians do not go out of their way to say
the public does not know what it is talking about. But Jim
Nicholson cheerfully takes on the three-fourths of the American
people who say they want a national primary to pick their
presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National Committee,
responded to that finding, in a New York Times/CBS News Poll in
May, by saying the public was ``wrong, wrong, wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't thought about it enough,'' he said. ``I don't
think there has been a rational public dialogue for them to have
made a rational decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, interviewed last week, is no supporter of the current
nominating process, which he finds excessively dependent on money,
and feels gives too much influence to states with early primaries.
``It is not totally broken down yet, but it is breaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he advocates a plan adopted last month by the Rules
Committee of the Republican National Committee. It would have the
smallest states hold primaries first, in February, followed by
small and medium-size states in March and April, with the big
states voting in May.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, Nicholson argues, would maintain public interest
until May, unlike this year's contests, which were over in March.
He said it would encourage more face-to-face campaigning and less
reliance on campaign commercials and airport stops to get on the
local television news. And that in turn would make it possible for
unknown, underfinanced candidates to build on early success and
make a race of it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to Republicans' adopting this plan is the
opposition of several big states, which fear that whatever the
mathematics of delegate selection (about half would be chosen in
May), the nominations would be effectively settled before they got
to vote. He conceded, ``We don't see any movement on that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We plan to have more discussions with the big
states between now and when we go to Philadelphia'' for the
convention at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Under Republican rules, only the convention can change party
procedures, although the proposal would also give the Republican
National Committee power to adjust things between conventions. The
Democratic National Committee already has that authority.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative, one many big states prefer, would be
rotating regional primaries, with a different bloc of states going
first every four years. Such a system, Nicholson said, ``has a lot
of advantages over the current system, but you would have to change
the statutes of the states every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst alternative, he said, would be a national primary. The
public might think that would get the process over more quickly,
but in fact ``the buildup to it would be a lot longer and more
intense than it is now,'' he said. ``All the marbles would be
riding on that one day.''
</P>
<P>
   A national primary, he said, would require ``an enormous amount
of money, even more reliance on advertising and less on retail
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would also lead to a lot more negative campaigning for
`knockout' day, with candidates doing a lot more to trip up their
opponents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It ``would greatly favor people who were either very famous or
very rich,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a matter of choosing whether to keep the present
system or a national primary. Because states want to rush to the
earliest permissible date, he said, ``we are on an inexorable path
to a national primary day,'' which would intensify ``all the things
that are wrong with the present system.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has tried before to change the system. In 1996 he led
a commission that proposed giving states bonus delegates if they
held late primaries. ``That was market-based, a real good
Republican approach, not to be prescriptive but to incentivize.''
It did not work at all, as states rushed to get to the head of the
line, and last year Nicholson asked Bill Brock, a former party
chairman, to lead a group considering new alternatives. That
produced the big-states-last plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said he was disappointed that Democrats had poured
cold water on the idea this spring, but said he hoped that if the
Republicans could pass it, Democrats would consider it afresh after
the election. ``That is the responsibility of the parties,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Los Alamos' idyllic image tarnished by blaze, missing `X files'
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ First came the spy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wildfire that almost swallowed them whole.
</P>
<P>
   And now the saga of the lost _ then found _ secret nuclear ``X''
files.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, events have rained like bombs on America's
Atomic City, shaking up the isolated, orderly existence this
northern New Mexico town and its nuclear weapons laboratory have
enjoyed for more than a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   This town of the elite, which once beamed with national pride
for its role in making world and scientific history, now finds
itself the butt of national jokes and the object of scrutiny. A
member of Congress jabbed last week that security at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory wasn't any better than that at any Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Is it any wonder the strain is showing the faces of
employees and town residents?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty worn out, you can imagine,'' said Elva Clinard, a
retired labs biochemist who's lived in Los Alamos since 1965. ``Let
alone the fires, people are still roiling over the treatment of Wen
Ho Lee, and now this (X files) news. It makes you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinard's reference is to laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee, who
was fired in March 1999 after an investigation into suspicions he
supplied China with nuclear weapons information. He is in solitary
confinement in a Santa Fe jail awaiting trial on 59 counts of
mishandling classified material. News of Lee's alleged secrets
sharing rocked the lab and the town.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Los Alamos has taken a series of other hits that
have kept it in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, congressional leaders criticized lab scientists after
two computer files, containing information on how to deploy nuclear
weapons, turned up missing. Two investigations have been launched
by the FBI and Congress; six employees have been suspended. Late
Friday, officials announced the computer hard drives had been
located within the confines of the lab's secure area and are being
evaluated. But questions about the handling of those files remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale was already at rock bottom at the labs,'' said Robyn
Peterson, who works in waste management as a contracted employee.
She said that budget cuts and security crackdowns have created an
atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia. And if the Lee affair _ and
X-files fiasco _ weren't bad enough, the town also had to contend
with a major fire. The Cerro Grande Fire swept through in early
May, leaving 400 families homeless, causing more than $1 billion in
property damage and wiping out 47,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even recovered from the fires, and now this comes
out,'' said Peterson of the X-files developments, while hanging out
at the American Legion. ``I suspect people will be leaving the
labs. It's probably making some think about (whether) this is all
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, most families stopped picking through the piles of
ash where their homes once stood and turned to filing for disaster
relief and insurance claims. Tom Stewart, a high school counselor
who is part of an outreach team with the federally funded Project
Recovery of Northern New Mexico, spoke of the emotional scars the
town has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never get done with this civic massacre,'' he said.
``All of us, and all our kids, huddled around the TV and watched
our town burn. We were obsessed with watching it. We couldn't take
our eyes off of it. ``
</P>
<P>
   Over a free burrito lunch served to fire victims daily at the
First United Methodist Church, Stewart advised Sandi and Steve
Paglieri when and how to show their 3-year-old daughter the
blackened remains of their apartment on Arizona Avenue, where 45
houses and apartments burned.
</P>
<P>
   The young couple lost everything, including all the work Steve
Paglieri had gathered for a post-doctoral paper. ``It was a review
article with 800 references, and they all burned up. The computer,
the disc, the papers, everything,'' said Paglieri, who is a
chemical engineer at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE NO OTHER PLACE
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos locals dub the town ``Lost Almost'' because it is a
mountain town that's difficult to reach. Thirty-five miles
northwest of Santa Fe, the town is accessible on via a winding
two-lane highway that passes through two Indian reservations and
jutting, jangled sandstone bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos is like no other place in New Mexico, or perhaps the
world. It is rich, smart and overwhelmingly white in a state that
is poor and ethnically diverse.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Alamos County, the average median household income is
$66,492, more than twice that of the rest of New Mexico. And you're
considered ``slow'' if you just have a bachelor's degree in a town
awash with the nation's top physicists, chemists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a town full of geeks,'' offers Joy Miller at the Los
Alamos Visitors Center. ``We have the highest rate of Ph.D.'s in
the country. Consequently, we have the best schools in the state
because a lot of Ph.D. people accept nothing less than outstanding
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents also point out the eclectic mix of people that think
like academics yet live and work in military-like settings.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Kortegaard, a retired engineer who specializes in
accelerated physics, compares the mix to that of Paris or Berlin.
``It's the same kind of worldly cosmopolitan intelligentsia
crowd,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   But events of recent weeks have tarnished some of the town's
luster as the lab has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, the Cerro Grande Fire came dangerously close
to engulfing radioactive wastes stored underground at the labs. But
major research facilities and radioactive sites, scattered
throughout the lab's 43 square acres, were kept out of the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fire did cause at least $300 million in property
damage to the federally-owned institution before it was contained
June 6. Just as Los Alamos was recovering, the labs took another
hit when U.S. senators lashed out at director John Browne for its
second major breach of security _ the loss, however temporary, of
the nuclear ``X'' files. ``Wal-mart has greater security,''
commented Sen. Wayne Allard, (R-Colorado).
</P>
<P>
   Senators accused the lab of being encased in a culture of
indifference and arrogance, and being incapable of keeping track of
its own data, much of it considered classified and top-secret.
</P>
<P>
   Browne told Congress the labs have had a hard time keeping close
tabs on its files since the federal government declassified many of
the Department of Energy's sensitive records in 1990. Investigators
are questioning 26 scientists who had access to the sensitive
files.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Alamos's troubles may not be over. Even as ``Thank you
firefighters'' messages are posted around the town, locals and
federal agencies were sandbagging residential areas in anticipation
of flash-flooding from heavy summer rains.
</P>
<P>
   CITY OF SECRETS
</P>
<P>
   The political hits the town has taken strike many here as ironic
given that Los Alamos was created in a shroud of covert operations
and a veil of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised to see us in the paper so often,'' said Rebecca
Collinsworth, an archivist at the Los Alamos Historical Society,
who's been overwhelmed collecting all the regional and national
press clippings the past 18 months. ``In the 1950s, (the town
wasn't) even in the weather forecast because we were not supposed
to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos was established in 1943, and, under physicist J.
Robert Oppenheimer, developed the world's first atomic bomb. The
labs, which employ nearly 11,000 people, are owned by the
Department of Energy and operated by the University of California.
The central mission of the labs still revolves around national
security, but scientists also pursue DNA sequencing , global
warming studies and other research.
</P>
<P>
   During those top-secret WWII and Cold War days, babies,
officially, weren't even born here at the local hospital. Their
birth certificate address read: P.O. Box 1663, Santa Fe. It was the
address all the residents used. And none of the kids knew what
their fathers did when they left for work every day.
</P>
<P>
   The town remained a puzzle to the rest of the state until 1957
when the government opened it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Cloistered under a canopy of ponderosa pine, blue spruce and
cottonwood trees, the town sits in a valley of canyons at 7,355
feet and looks out at mountains that are the rolling foothills to
the Rockies. The state's largest city, Albuquerque, is 120 miles
away, and Santa Fe, the legislative capital and tourist magnet, is
a 40-minute drive down ``the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents take to the mountains on the weekends for some of
the state's finest fishing, camping and hiking. Or they check out
the myriad archaeological sites, cliff dwellings and rock drawings
left by ancient Native American cultures. And come winter, they ski
on their own mountain, Pajarito, that's run by the Los Alamos Ski
Club.
</P>
<P>
   All these pursuits used to be just a gaze away in the green
rolling shoulder of the Jemez Mountains. But now, many residents
can't even bear to look up at charred and limbless pine trees that
stick up like rows upon rows of blackened skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are outdoors people,'' said relief volunteer
Carole Watanabe, as she looked west toward the places where she
used to find recreation and solace. ``It's sad,'' she said softly,
``it's just really hard.''

SCANDAL HITS CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The office of California's insurance
commissioner has been hit by a scandal that threatens to cost him
his job, and to cost the tottering California Republican Party some
of its hopes for rejuvenation in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Charles Quackenbush, one of only two
Republicans who hold statewide office, is fighting accusations that
he allowed half a dozen insurance companies to shortchange
earthquake victims, and that in return the companies financed
nonprofit foundations that he set up to funnel political slush
money.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, who has talked of running for governor or U.S.
senator, denies the accusations, saying that at worst he is guilty
of only careless administrative oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a witch hunt,'' he said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies also deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But committees of both houses of the California Legislature are
investigating, as is the California attorney general, Bill Lockyer.
With each new revelation _ and each new demand for Quackenbush's
resignation, impeachment or trial on criminal charges _ Republican
officials wonder whether the 2000 election could turn out to be a
worse disaster than the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democrats took back the governor's office, gained
control of both houses of the state Legislature and left
Republicans holding only a pair of Cabinet-level offices, insurance
commissioner and secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We surely don't need a scandal at this point,'' said Sen.
James Brulte, the leader of the Senate Republican caucus and
perhaps the most powerful Republican in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Quackenbush is accused of striking a sweetheart
deal with insurance companies in which he agreed not to fine them
$3 billion for shortchanging claimants after the 1994 Los Angeles
earthquake, and they agreed in turn to make $12.8 million in
tax-deductible contributions to foundations that he set up to help
quake victims _ foundations, it is said, that he then used to
funnel money to friends and into schemes to advance his political
career.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the legislative committees have been told,
$263,000 in foundation money was given to a football camp attended
by the Quackenbush children and $500,000 was given to the Greater
Sacramento Urban League, whose board includes Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   According to other testimony, $400,000 in foundation money was
used to pay Quackenbush's longtime political advisory team for help
in establishing the foundations, and then, at the team's
recommendation, $100,000 in foundation money was used to pay for a
poll on Quackenbush's political popularity, followed by a $3
million payment for a television campaign on earthquake
preparedness that prominently featured Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush told one investigative committee that he was
``mortified'' by the ``perception'' of any wrongdoing by the
foundations. He faulted the officials to whom he said he had
delegated responsibility to run the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously going to have to try a different way,'' he
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Assemblyman Jack Scott, said, ``They
seem clearly out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the insurance companies _ among them Allstate,
Farmers, State Farm, and 20th Century _ insist they never underpaid
any of the 600,000 victims of the 1994 quake, one of the costliest
disasters to strike the United States and one that has cost the
companies $16 billion so far. Still, the companies say it was far
less painful to finance the Quackenbush foundations than to fight
off the commissioner's threat to take $3 billion more in fines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To make sure the companies did not balk at his offer, some
officials say, Quackenbush put up a display of the kinds of adverse
news articles they might face should they be fined.
</P>
<P>
   As for how foundation money was spent, the companies insist they
were as shocked as anyone to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tackling drills were not the kind of shaking we expected the
money to be spent on,'' Steve Patterson, a State Farm lawyer, told
one legislative committee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful and outspoken Democrats in the
Legislature, John Burton, the president pro tem of the Senate,
said: ``Don't be fooled. They were all in it together.''
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal broke several months ago, Republican leaders
kept quiet in hopes of keeping the party from being tied to it. But
over the last 10 days, as more and more details and accusations
have emerged _ especially charges that Quackenbush was closely
involved in running the foundations day to day, not just in
overseeing them generally _ party leaders have begun to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   A number have joined the rising chorus of Democrats demanding
that Quackenbush resign, and a few have even sided with the smaller
chorus of Democrats who are talking of an impeachment inquiry if
Quackenbush does not resign.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, after hearing testimony that forged checks
passed through one foundation and that officials of another created
minutes for meetings that never took place, Assemblyman Tom
McClintock, a Republican from the area hit by the 1994 quake, said,
``The committee is now in receipt of sufficient evidence to warrant
a formal impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on Thursday by the Field Institute, one of the
state's leading polling organizations, found Californians favoring
Quackenbush's resignation or impeachment by roughly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative hearings resume on June 26, with Quackenbush
scheduled to testify.

PROTESTERS INVADE CONSTRUCTION SITE OVER JEWISH CEMETERY IN
PRAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: No Byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ A dispute over remnants of the 13th
century Jewish cemetery discovered in downtown Prague during
construction three years ago is heating up again, despite a
compromise reached in March that was intended to end the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   International Orthodox Jewish organizations have renewed their
protests against the planned construction of an administrative
building, fearing it would disturb the medieval graves. In March,
leaders of Prague's Jewish community, the Czech government and
Ceska Pojistovna, the insurance company that owns the land, reached
an agreement that had appeared to resolve the argument.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, at least a dozen Orthodox Jews from the
United States, England and Belgium have illegally entered the
construction site, and were arrested and fined by the Czech police.
The rabbis insist they found destroyed graves and bone fragments on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found skulls, teeth and other things,'' said Rabbi Edgar
Gluck of the Committee for the Preservation of U.S. Heritage
Abroad. He accused the company of ``shocking desecration of the
graves.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of Ceska Pojistovna denied this and called
the rabbis' behavior ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not touching the graves, of course,'' said Michal
Urban, the company spokesman. ``On the contrary, we are preparing
the site to make sure that the renewed construction will not
disturb them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery, once the largest Jewish burial site in the Czech
kingdom, was desecrated in the 15th century. The discovery of its
remains when Ceska Pojistovna began construction of a new office
building came as a surprise to archaeologists who believed it had
been completely destroyed centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute lie about 200 boxes of skeletal
remains, now stored in a Jewish mausoleum in Prague. The company
has postponed reburial until September, upsetting some Jewish
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day that these bones are unburied defiles them,'' said
Rabbi Lazer Stern of the U.S.-based Society for the Preservation of
Jewish Holy Sites. ``It was only because of our desperation to bury
them at once that we and other Jewish groups agreed to construction
in the excavated area.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the March agreement, Ceska Pojistovna agreed to fortify
the land containing the graves with concrete, incorporate it into
its office building and build an atrium with a memorial plaque
above it. But the Orthodox rabbis, some of whom approved the plan
in March, said they had been deceived, and now oppose the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company broke the agreement,'' said Gluck. ``Our
understanding was that there would be no building under or above
the site.'' He was among the foreign rabbis who agreed to the
compromise in March. He said a large demonstration is planned on
Monday outside the Czech consulate in New York, and after protests
by hundreds of Jews in some European cities, including London and
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has opened a rift between the leaders of Prague's
small Jewish community and foreign rabbis who, the Prague leaders
say, come to the Czech capital and hold protests without even
contacting the Jews who live here. The protesters counter that the
Prague Jewish leaders are not competent to decide what to do with
the discovered remains.

   ``All this is very damaging to the Czech Jewish community and to
the image of Jews here in general,'' said Tomas Jelinek, vice
chairman of the Prague Jewish Community. The community, which has
about 2,000 members, is still struggling to gain recognition in
Czech society, which after decades of communism is strongly
secular. Of the foreign rabbis, he said, ``they are concerned about
the bones of our predecessors, but people today, living people,
don't interest them.''

<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ The last Democrat standing between Virginia
Republicans and a historic sweep of statewide power this year is
Sen. Charles Robb, once his state party's savior but
unceremoniously rated ``toast'' and ``dead meat'' a year ago by
political handicappers. The general Beltway prognosis was that Robb
was the most vulnerable Democrat in the Senate in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the senator trailed 12 points behind a formidable
Republican challenger, former Gov. George F. Allen, prompting
widespread speculation that Robb, laconic and moody as politicians
go, might wisely retreat and call it a decent career after 12 years
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But to the surprise of Democrats as much as Republicans, that
gap has now closed to a 1-point tossup in the face of an
unexpectedly galvanized Robb. As a result, this commonwealth of
Jeffersonian principles and tooth-and-claw politics is looking
forward to a classic matchup: two former governors who led surges
of state party dominance in the '80s and '90s will finally have it
out before the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to go out and shoot up all your ammunition when
you first hit the beach,'' explained Robb, a Vietnam combat veteran
with an unhurried air and a competitive gleam as he celebrates his
recent political resurrection. ``I know there are a lot of folks
who are very disappointed that I didn't roll over and play dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the least of them is Allen, a very popular, ebulliently
combative politician with a substantial record as governor who has
been campaigning across the state since 1998, strutting in his
signature cowboy boots, reminding voters of his down-home style.
Allen has been the campaign's nonstop leading fund-raiser, rallying
Republicans to complete their state dominance by winning a second
Senate seat to complement their sweep of a legislative majority and
all three top executive positions last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck, it's time to quit hiding behind parliamentary chicanery
and paid attack dogs,'' boomed Allen, his love of political
battling palpable, as he ignited the state party convention this
month. ``Heck, I'll bet Hillary doesn't support Bill 87 percent of
the time, but Virginia's junior senator surely does,'' Allen
declared, burnishing his favorite sound-bite denunciation of the
``Clinton-Gore-Robb crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Robb relishes the choice voters will face between two
such familiar, experienced politicians. ``This will be like
Government 101, Civics 101,'' he said in an interview. He is hardly
flinching at the contest, and his comeback in the polls is being
attributed to nothing more complicated than his own striking
display of re-election hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robb refused to engage in the race until he sensed it was
time, and then he showed himself to be quite a counterpuncher,''
said Charlie Cook, National Journal's political handicapper, who
had dubbed the senator ``dead meat'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cook has happily amended that in view of what is developing into
the most interesting Senate contest outside New York. ``It's going
to be a great race,'' said Cook, who still sees Allen as a slight
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very appropriate that these two candidates face off at
the beginning of the 21st century,'' said Robert D. Holsworth,
director of Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public
Policy. ``As governors, they each helped define and solidify their
parties at different times at the close of the 20th century as two
sort of moderate conservatives.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After months of Democratic doubts about Robb, he served notice
at party rallies in March that he still had some fire. ``Let me
assure you that no warrior I ever met at Quantico was frightened by
big talk, big-heeled boots or a big chew of tobacco,'' said Robb, a
former marine, targeting Allen's good-old-boy trappings. ``And
neither am I.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice for voters begins with two distinct styles on the
hustings. The 60-year-old Robb is reserved; the 48-year-old Allen
is a buoyant campaigner, cherished by Republicans for his feisty
one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's enjoy knocking their soft teeth down their whiny
throats!'' was Allen's memorable call to battle five years ago.
This year, he is scoring Robb for ``sipping wine and nibbling
cheese'' inside the Beltway, accusing him of being aloof from
constituent responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Allen's a very able campaigner, able to project himself as
very self-confident,'' the senator said. ``That can either be a
plus or a minus.'' His campaign aides more bluntly portray Allen as
a polarizer _ in the words of one aide, ``Virginia's Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a very gentle Allen who is being seen these nights in
an early blitz of television commercials blanketing the northern
Virginia suburbs, a key battleground that Robb carried six years
ago when he narrowly defeated Oliver North in a three-man race. The
simple biographical ads, devoid of a Republican label in this
bastion of moderates and independents, have made Allen as
ubiquitous as Bill Gates on the nighttime screen as he reintroduces
himself to the booming Fairfax County area, where tens of thousands
of newcomers have moved in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is campaigning on his state record of cutting taxes and
reducing crime, trimming state agencies and attracting new
business. He promises federal measures in these areas and more,
including a proposed $1,000 tax credit for parents to use for
school computers and tutoring but not for private tuition. He
criticizes Robb as excessive in his proposals for stronger gun
controls and his views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is emphasizing his Senate reputation as an expert on
national security and a bipartisan conciliator, as well as his
carefully blended record of fiscal conservatism and liberalism on
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign still in the feeling-out stage, Allen's early
initiatives include repeated attacks on the senator's opposition to
a constitutional ban on flag desecration and his defense of federal
gasoline taxes. But Robb cheered Democrats with his
counterpuncher's instinct. On the flag, he delivered an impassioned
floor speech, speaking firsthand of battlefield death and
patriotism for ``sacred intangibles'' more than ``a piece of cloth,
however sacred.'' On the gasoline tax, he is focusing on the
suburbs' main problem, commuter gridlock, emphasizing that fuel
taxes pay for new roads.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also seized the initiative in a recent uproar over a
state proclamation of Confederate History Month, a proclamation
originated by Allen as governor. In an obvious attempt to rally
their crucial African-American base, Democrats stress that Allen's
version, unlike the one eventually adopted, did not include the
current condemnation of slavery _ a low-blow tactic, in the
Republican's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's negative politics to try to divide people on race,''
said Allen, the son of a famous football coach who uses gridiron
metaphors the way Robb uses military terms. ``You have to research
your opposition and realize what kind of game plans they run. What
kind of crack-back blocks they run, how they hit out of bounds, how
they'll twist your ankles after a tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook and other political observers question whether Robb can
effectively demonize the Allen style, considering Allen's
well-demonstrated popularity. Allen, delighted with the party unity
that was absent six years ago, is attacking Robb's laid-back style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what motivates him to be in the Senate,'' Allen
said, ``because he really doesn't do much, although every six years
he becomes active, and it's the first people see him outside the
Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb says his motivation is strong and increasingly clear to
voters. ``Part of it is simply maturing in terms of how you look at
the world,'' he said. ``Sometimes it takes a while to really figure
out what you believe in to your core.''

LONE VOICE NO LONGER, JAPANESE GADFLY CATCHES ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story, sent June 11 and then held, is now released.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Crowds build ever so slowly around Zensaku Sakurai, a
sidewalk crusader who berates Japan's leaders for what he calls
their arrogance, corruption and failure to serve the needs of real
people.
</P>
<P>
   Political apathy has long been the norm in this country. But
with Sakurai's followers brandishing political banners and charts
that purport to track the failings of members of Parliament, people
stop one by one to listen these days.
</P>
<P>
   Many nod in approval or even volunteer to join the movement. But
in a country where direct criticism of others _ even public figures
_ strikes an uncomfortable chord, there are always one or two
people who jeer him and denounce what he is doing as
``un-Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers are not the only people jarred by Sakurai's
movement, known as the Rakusen Undo, or blacklist campaign, the
most successful of several grass-roots movements that are catching
fire here.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the governing party and its coalition partners, who
are already on the defensive as hotly contested national elections
draw near, have shown their anxiety by crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movements like these are not democratic,'' Muneo Suzuki,
campaign director of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has
governed Japan for over 43 of the last 45 years, told the daily
Asahi Shimbun. ``There is a fear that opposition candidates may
take advantage of this campaign. Their criteria are not clear, and
it is not appropriate for the media to report about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its aim is to encourage people to vote against politicians who
receive low ratings from the movement. The unlikely figure at the
center of the campaign, Sakurai, is a lifelong _ but until now
mostly solitary _ activist who operates from the kitchen in his
modest suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a people, the Japanese are deeply reluctant to criticize
others, and always mindful of harmony; we never want to stick
out,'' said the salt-and-pepper-haired 65-year-old former
insurance-company employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general that means that people don't express their
thoughts,'' he said, ``especially in politics. The result is a
perpetuation of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough, over the years the government has
created rules that seem intended to stifle insurgencies by
reformists.
</P>
<P>
   Independent candidates, for example, are sharply limited in the
number of campaign posters they are allowed to put up. Recently the
government outlawed partisan campaigning on the Internet. And there
is already talk about sharply limiting, or even barring, movements
like the blacklist campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sakurai cut his teeth in dissent in the loneliest of ways,
taking the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party to task for
corrupt schemes like the Lockheed scandal, a defense-contract
kickback scheme in the early 1980s. He has also long railed against
what he sees as the party's gradual encroachment on the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   How his movement has gained steam, finally, is an illustration
of the unpredictable nature of political cross-fertilization
brought about by technology, particularly the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's far more vibrant civil society successfully
introduced the theme of fighting corruption in politics into the
most recent legislative elections with a similar blacklist
movement. More than 50 politicians who were targets of the campaign
were defeated at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Sakurai is unabashed in acknowledging that he is imitating the
South Korean effort. He says he more or less copied wholesale the
South Korean model of using the Internet to generate voter
complaints about politicians in the interest of barring the worst
of them from re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be as successful as the Koreans,'' Sakurai said.
``But they showed us how to trigger something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He seems to be attracting interest. There have been well over
100,000 hits on the blacklist campaign's Web site, a very high
number for Japan. And the group has been inundated with complaints
about politicians. There are so many volunteers these days that
Sakurai said he no longer recognizes all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The change comes after Japan's years of economic drift and a
string of blunders by the new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   ``For such a long time the Japanese people have been prohibited
from thinking for themselves,'' Sakurai said. ``This is the legacy
of the prewar imperial system in which people were trained merely
to accept and not to ask questions. I feared that we were going
back to that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our campaign is to make the voters realize that
they possess our sovereignty.''

 &HT;    Dandy choices for read-aloud, doodlebug dads
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``One berry, two berry, pick me a blueberry. Hat
berry, shoe berry, in my canoe berry. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Degen's 1983 ``Jamberry'' is one of those books I'll be
able to recite forever. That's because when my daughter Elly was
about 2, she'd drag the worn little book around, begging us to read
it to her a dozen times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Degen's new title, for ages 3-6, arrives for Father's Day:
``Daddy Is a Doodlebug'' (HarperCollins, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   Few authors have such frisky, frivolous fun with words. Degen's
inventive rhymes keep you snickering as you read. His latest romp
affectionately celebrates the ways dads (doodlebugs) enjoy spending
time with their kids (also doodlebugs): ``We doodle things together
that doodlebugs like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair padoodle a canoe, walk their poodlebug, snack on
patoodle chips. After fairytoodles, little doodlebug is tucked into
bed: ``Don't let the bedboodles bite! Sweet bug dreams and
goodlebug night.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like his words, Degen's art is terrifically bright, clever
and filled with zany surprises. In the bugs' miniature world, the
swing set is made out of pencils, and a firefly (or firefloodle)
clad in firefighter's garb dutifully blinks a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't own ``Jamberry,'' or your copy is as tattered
as ours, HarperCollins has just reissued it in an enlarged
(9-by-12-inch) format for $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   Also new in stores:
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-8: ``What Dads Can't Do'' by Douglas Wood, illustrated by
Doug Cushman (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14). What should be a
tongue-in-cheek narrative about how dads operate comes off as a
tiresome, at times nauseating, ditty involving a dopey-looking dino
dad and his goofy dino kid. Examples of the clunky phrasing and
uninspired humor: ``When dads play hide-and-seek they always get
found, but they have a hard time finding you.''
</P>
<P>
   AGES 4-8: ``Animal Dads'' by Sneed B. Collard III, illustrated
by Steve Jenkins (Houghton Mifflin, $5.95 paperback). Learn how
males of 19 species care for their young. A gorilla dad helps groom
his offspring. Dwarf mongoose dads teach their youngsters how to
hunt. When the time comes for a stickleback fish mom to lay her
eggs, the stickleback dad builds the nest out of plants and then
guards it from enemies. Jenkins' illustrations nicely incorporate
torn paper and paint. Adults will enjoy this enlightening book as
much as children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 4-9: ``John Henry'' by Brad Kessler, illustrated by Barry
Jackson, with cassette featuring narration by Denzel Washington and
music by B.B. King (Rabbit Ears Books, $10.95). Washington puts his
heart and high talents into reading Kessler's retelling of the
legend of that ``darn crackest steel-drivin' '' hero. The writing
bursts with folksy flavor and humor. Then there's the rousing music
by another legend, B.B. King. Great entertainment for the whole
family.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 5 AND UP: ``Daddy Poems'' selected by John Micklos Jr.,
illustrated by Robert Casilla (Wordsong/Boyds Mills Press, $15.95).
A collection of poems meant to be read aloud by Dad. Some works, by
notables such as X.J. Kennedy and Nikki Grimes, are light and
bouncy, or meaningful in some way, but as a whole this is an uneven
collection. Many poems are painfully trite, stilted or sophomoric,
such as Micklos' ``Bedtime Ritual,'' which begins:
</P>
<P>
   I need another cookie, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   I need another drink.
</P>
<P>
   I need another visit
</P>
<P>
   To the bathroom, I think.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned illustrations are serviceable at best.

COMMERCE EVOLVING IN ITALY, BUT HAIRCUT DURING FULL MOON STILL
ILLEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Under a full moon, shortly before midnight, Vittorio
Giunta, a Roman hairdresser, trimmed the hair of Isabella Morandi,
30, a client who is convinced that this phase of the lunar cycle
will make her locks grow back faster, and thicker.
</P>
<P>
   The haircut, however, also broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   No police officer raced in to arrest Giunta, but his small act
of civil disobedience is not likely to go unnoticed. Giunta, 48, an
elegant man whose white hair and goatee are set off by sleek black
shirts and trousers, is a rebel with an unlikely cause. He is
fighting city government, two hairdressers' unions and dozens of
small trade associations for the right to keep his shop open when
the moon is full.
</P>
<P>
   He and some of his clients believe that the best time to cut
hair is under a full moon, an ancient superstition that has not
entirely died out in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   That belief, however, clashes with a more widespread
superstition about free market ``chaos,'' a fear that has kept
rigid and jealously guarded regulations on hundreds of thousands of
small family businesses in place.
</P>
<P>
   Giunta's desire to set his own working hours has introduced a
frisson of American-style capitalism to a society that is slowly
and painfully adjusting its ``dolce vita'' to the free market
demands of a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to express myself artistically during the full-moon
hours,'' said Giunta, who owns Capellimania, a small salon in a
middle-class residential neighborhood in Rome. ``Besides, if you
move to a free market, then you can't stop individual initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Italy has changed dramatically since the days when
all shop shutters would rumble shut at 1 p.m. for lunch and naps,
opening again at 4 p.m., and no store was open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations that forbid a salami store from selling sandwiches
or a shoe store from selling shirts were removed last year. The red
tape needed to open a new store was cut back. And, in its most
revolutionary step, the same law liberalized store hours for
commercial enterprises, allowing shopkeepers to set their own hours
in a 13-hour maximum working day. In the center of Rome, some shops
now stay open even at lunchtime. A few are open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, which was only grudgingly accepted by Italy's
600,000 businesses, did not apply to a million other small
businesses that fall into the category of artisanry, which includes
bakers, auto mechanics, furniture makers and hairdressers, who
still operate under old rules, many of them 30 years old.
Hairdressers, for example, must open at 9 a.m. and shut at 7 p.m.
and have to close on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Giunta's daring experiment has not won the support of many
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full moon thing is folklore _ it is quite idiotic,'' said
Danilo Garone, national secretary of Federacconciatori, one of
Italy's main hairdressing trade associations. ``What woman wants to
go out and get her hair done at midnight?''
</P>
<P>
   Italy has more than 100,000 hair salons. Garone said the vast
majority of hairdressers were adamantly opposed to liberalizing
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I close at 7 p.m. and a rival across the street stays open
until 11 p.m. I'll be forced to stay open, too,'' he said. ``I have
heard that in New York hair salons stay open all hours and even
serve food, but we are a traditional country. We don't need these
changes at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, Italy's economists and elected officials
feel obliged to conform with changes already sweeping not just the
United States but other parts of Europe. Chains, supermarkets and
shopping malls are competing with small family-owned shops in
Italy, though not as fast as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian manual of commercial law is 500 pages long _ it is
absurdly complicated,'' said Luca Pellegrini, vice president of the
Center of Commercial Studies at Bocconi University in Milan. ``In
Italy, competition is seen as harmful, and it makes you work too
hard. We have a humane and pleasant way of life, and we have a hard
time adapting to inevitable change.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ninci, president of the Commerce and Productive
Activities Commission for the city of Rome, does want change, and
has enthusiastically embraced liberalization of store hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ninci, who has long, thick hair, pointed out that in ancient
times lunar cycles were closely followed and said she thought the
full-moon argument might have some validity. She described Giunta's
idea as ``cute'' and said she would try to raise his request at a
meeting next week, though she said she preferred group or
neighborhood initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration cannot impose liberalization,'' she said.
``The idea has to be embraced by the businesses themselves. Many
don't see the potential economic advantages of liberalization, they
remain tied to the habits of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she dreamed of a day when Rome would have 24-hour
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   But even she balked at the idea that stores could someday decide
for themselves when to hold sales. The new law imposes restrictions
on when sales can occur: In Rome sales can now occur only in
February and mid-July to mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are depreciating the art of commerce, reducing the
transaction to just the price,'' she said, appalled at the notion
of wildcat sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ninci, who used to run a clothing store, said there was an
immense difference between liberalizing store hours and permitting
price wars. ``It's unfair competition and Roman retail would be
ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Haircuts were free on Friday night at Capellimania, and the shop
was crammed with clients eager to benefit from a full-moon trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Babylonian times, farmers planted when the moon was
full,'' Morandi explained earnestly. ``But it also makes sense to
allow salons and shops to stay open late. If a city like Rome wants
to be in the same league as Paris, or New York or London, then it
has to offer people the same choices.''

HOMICIDE RATES IN CITIES SPURS CONCERN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the number of homicides in some of the nation's big cities
rising in 1999 and the first five months of 2000, after eight years
of sharp drops, concern is spreading among law enforcement
officials and criminologists about whether the decline in violent
crime has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is too fragmentary, and contradictory, the experts
caution, to draw a firm conclusion. Virtually all of the elements
that contributed to the drop in homicide from 1991 through 1998 are
still in place: more criminals in prisons, innovative police
strategies, intense community efforts to work with troubled youths,
a waning of the crack cocaine epidemic and a strong economy
providing more jobs in impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, five of the 17 cities that have more than 100
homicides a year had an increase in killings, the first time since
the early 1990s that slayings have increased in so many cities.
Through the end of May this year, seven of these cities showed an
increase from the same period last year. Together, these 17 cities
accounted for more than a quarter of the nation's 15,600 homicides
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the only city in the group to experience a rise in
homicides in 1999 and the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about crime have been heightened recently by shocking
attacks in several cities. New York, for instance, has seen the
killing of 10 cab drivers, the fatal shooting of five employees in
a Wendy's restaurant in Queens in May and a rampage in Central Park
last weekend in which at least 27 women reported being groped or
assaulted by young men.
</P>
<P>
   But some police officials say that the increases in homicide in
1999 and 2000 are simply a normal statistical variation after so
many good years, which had brought homicide rates to their lowest
point nationally since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And some criminal justice experts agree with them _ to an
extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the increase in murder rates is simply that, at a
certain point, you can't go any lower,'' said James Alan Fox, the
Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
``The rates have come down so far, they simply can't be maintained
at such a low level.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore this, Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at
Carnegie Mellon University, said he had calculated that if the
decline in homicide in the 1990s continued at the same rate, the
United States would have no killings in 2007, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Police Commissioner Howard Safir contends the
police may be victims of their own success in reducing the number
of killings to 671 in 1999 from 2,245 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the goal should be zero, but in a city of 8 million,
the reality is you can only go so low,'' Safir said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the other categories of serious crimes, including
robbery, assault, rape, burglary, theft and automobile theft, are
down by 8 percent this year in New York. ``So I don't think we've
bottomed out on crime, but we may have bottomed out on murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after years in which New York officials have used the
homicide rate as a measure of their success in making the city
safer, Safir suggested it might be more accurate to look at the
broader range of all serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, New York had a 6 percent increase in homicides, and
through the end of May this year there have been 269 homicides,
compared with 248 in the same period in 1999, an increase of 8.5
percent. But Safir said that with the recent adoption of Operation
Condor, which lets police officers in high crime areas work more
overtime, there had been a small drop in homicides in May and so
far in June, and he predicted that the total for 2000 would be
about where it was in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty in drawing conclusions from the national
homicide figures for 1999 and so far this year is that there are no
obvious patterns to account for the increases in homicide in the
cities that have had them.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, which had a 15 percent increase in killings in 1999,
Sgt. Jeff Halstead, a spokesman for the city's police department,
said the rise could be largely attributed to the city's rapid
population growth and its position near the Mexican border, with a
large influx of drugs and illegal immigrants. ``What we have seen
is an increase in homicides related to narcotics and undocumented
Mexican nationals making their way into the metro Phoenix area,''
Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Phoenix police put together a special homicide
task force this year, with many of its members Spanish speakers,
and the city has had a drop in homicides through the end of May,
down to 63 this year from 91 in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in Los Angeles, which had 181 homicides in the first five
months of this year, compared with 159 in the same months in 1999,
Jason Lee, a spokesman for the police department, said he did not
know why the figures were up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Safir said there were no discernible patterns
for the increase in killings during the last year and a half. There
had been some small rise in drug-related homicides, he said, but a
decrease in gang-related and domestic killings.
</P>
<P>
   One theory advanced by some criminologists to explain the surge
is that a new generation of teen-agers, too young to have
experienced the terrifying consequences of the crack epidemic of
the late 1980s _ the shootings, gang fights and waves of
imprisonment _ may now be looking for a new form of excitement.
That might explain, Blumstein said, an incident in Providence,
R.I., on June 8 in which five young men forced two college students
at gunpoint to get into their car outside a nightclub, then drove
them to a golf course, tortured them and shot them in the head.
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Center for
Children and Families in Harlem who works with troubled juveniles,
said he had not observed any trend of a return to the gun, drug and
gang culture among teen-agers in New York. ``I've seen an increase
in kids who are cut, with box cutters and razors, but not the
return of lethality and guns,'' Canada said. ``We haven't lost a
kid in several years.''

<P>
   CAMILLA, Ga. _ Ah, American ingenuity. See a need? Find a way to
fill it. Got a problem? Find a way to fix it. And if you can make a
buck in the process, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Glass had a problem. A product of the Atlanta suburbs
and a graduate of Georgia Tech, he moved in 1993 to his wife's
hometown in southwestern Georgia, bought a farm and decided to
raise chickens. It was a business he knew little about, but he had
drive and ambition and an entrepreneurial streak.
</P>
<P>
   What Glass had not realized, though, was that about 5 percent of
his 500,000 birds would succumb to heat, injury or disease before
they could be processed into Chicken McNuggets at a nearby plant.
And the dead chickens, sometimes enough to fill the bed of his
pickup four times over, had to be disposed of each day. Many
farmers simply buried their dead in pits. Some tried composting,
and then spread the chicken mulch over their fields. Glass chose to
incinerate his chickens in a metal furnace, but soon found he was
spending $5,000 to $10,000 a year on propane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of dead birds was overwhelming,'' said the
32-year-old Glass, blowing a swarm of gnats out of his face. ``It
just took an incredible amount of money to burn them.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass discussed his problem with a University of Georgia
extension agent, and the agent suggested an unusual disposal method
being pioneered by Gene Frazier, a poultry farmer in nearby
Americus. Glass did some research and decided to give it a try. And
that is why Mark Glass is up to his shins in alligators.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he says, the purest form of recycling. Each day, his
farmhands collect the dead from his 20 chicken houses. They toss
the birds _ feathers, beaks and all _ into a tractor-powered
grinder that quickly reduces the chicken into a white, pasty slop.
It is gathered in buckets and taken to the three low-lying
buildings where Glass now raises 6,500 alligators.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing shorts and rubber boots, Glass and his workers then
climb through wooden hatches into the 20 gator pens in each of the
buildings. As they open the doors and sunlight floods into the
darkened rooms, the gators, startled by the intrusion, slap the
foot-deep water with their tails and scramble into far corners. The
reptiles, some of them as much as 5 feet long, largely avoid the
workers as they pour the gruel onto platforms suspended just above
the surface of the water. And then it is dinner time, as the
alligators slide atop the platforms, grab a mouthful of mush and
retreat politely to enjoy their meals.
</P>
<P>
   After five years, Glass is now one of the largest alligator
farmers in Georgia, and one of 10 in the state who are exploring
the synergies of raising chickens beside gators. Officials with
various poultry associations said that there might be a few such
operations in other states but that Georgia, which calls itself the
largest chicken-producing state, seemed to be the epicenter of
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   When the alligators reach a length of 4 or 5 feet, usually after
about two years, Glass harvests them. He and his workers wade into
the pens, catching gators with their bare hands. Once they remove
the alligators from the pens, they tape their jaws shut with a
strip of black electrical tape, kill the animals swiftly by
hammering a steel blade into their spinal cords, slice off the
hides and carve off the meat.
</P>
<P>
   If the hide has not been marred by scratches or bite marks, it
may bring $75 in Italy or some other overseas market where
alligator is used for belts, purses and shoes. The meat may bring
an additional $20 regionally. The heads are sold to a taxidermist
for $1 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Glass said, he ``figured that if I could break even
and get rid of my chickens, I'd be ahead of the game.'' But in fact
he has had to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
construction and maintenance of his alligator pens, and he has
struggled to break even. He expects to turn a profit in the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said he had made plenty of costly mistakes before finding
the right method. At first he tried raising the alligators in a
pond. But he soon discovered they were susceptible to scratches and
bite marks, which devalued their hides. He also learned that they
hibernated when air and water temperatures dropped, and showed
little interest in helping him dispose of his chickens. In his
indoor pens, the air and water are artificially heated. ``Trial and
error,'' Glass observed, ``is a very expensive way to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also occupational hazards, of course. ``If you catch
enough alligators, you're going to get bit,'' said Glass, who has
been nipped and has watched two workers suffer more serious
injuries. ``It kind of goes with the territory. And what's worse
than the bite is the infection that comes afterward, because their
teeth are so nasty. We peel open the wound and just pour the Clorox
in.''
</P>
<P>
   His own alligator bite did not break his skin, but it scared him
nonetheless. ``I had one by the tail and his head was underwater
and he just bent in half and grabbed my finger,'' Glass said. ``He
let go, but if he had locked his jaws he'd have had me. Basically,
you've just got to be faster than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the working conditions tend to make hiring
difficult. ``It makes it harder to find employees,'' Glass
explained, ``when you have to ask, `Are you afraid of alligators?'
in the interview process.''

STRATEGISTS SEE THE NEW ECONOMY IN A NEW LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Eight years after the Clinton campaign adopted
``It's the economy, stupid,'' as its mantra, the presidential race
of 2000 has raised an intriguing question: has the new economy
changed some of the old rules of politics?
</P>
<P>
   It has long been a maxim that the economic health of the nation
goes a long way toward determining who wins the White House. Voters
reward the party in power for good times and punish it for bad. By
rights, this should bode well for Vice President Al Gore as the
Clinton administration presides over a 112-month economic
expansion, the longest in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore set off on his ``prosperity and progress'' tour last
week, staking his most forceful claim yet to the administration's
economic legacy, polls showed him lagging behind Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas when Americans were asked which candidate they
trusted more to handle the nation's economy. And Bush, for his
part, simply shrugs off those who say that the nation's prosperity
will ultimately derail him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want four more years of Clinton-Gore,'' Bush told an
audience in Connecticut earlier this month, and ``all that matters
is the stock market, I'll be the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Bush, like Republicans throughout the Clinton years, is
calculating that concerns about the president's character and
unease with the moral tone of society will prove more powerful than
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans also say they are seeing something else
this election year. Like the economists who wonder whether the
expansion has repealed some of the fundamental principles of the
business cycle, these strategists suggest that the boom has changed
politics. The country has now been so prosperous for so long, they
assert, that voters simply take good times for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clinton got elected in 1992, people thought the economy
was in the toilet and good times would not come back again,'' said
Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has been doing research for
MSNBC. ``Today everyone thinks that they are going to make money.
Young people are more entrepreneurial than ever before. More people
are in the stock market. It's so much of a given that the economy
is good that no one is saying thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides make a slightly different argument: that in this
economic boom driven by high technology, people view the titans of
e-commerce and the computer age as the job creators, not the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people instinctively know a lot of
today's economy and a lot of today's prosperity was created by the
young entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley,'' said Karen P. Hughes,
Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush adviser pointed to a Fox News poll taken last month
showing that Americans overwhelmingly give more credit to Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, for creating jobs than they do to
Clinton. ``One of Gore's fundamental problems is he's not getting
any credit for the good economy,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways the Bush campaign is as vested in this faith in
the new economy as Gore is, though for different reasons. In making
his proposal to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax into
private investment accounts, Bush is gambling that with half of
American households now holding stock, voters will not see the
stock market as more risky than having a guaranteed Social Security
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that prosperity will still sway voters come
Election Day and note that Clinton has consistently won
extraordinarily high approval ratings for his stewardship of the
economy. A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in February found
that an unprecedented 73 percent of all Americans said they
approved of the way Clinton was handling the economy. Indeed, 88
percent of Americans said the national economy was in good shape, a
far cry from the 23 percent who said that about the economy in
1992, when Clinton defeated President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Gore, his supporters say, is to convince
voters that when it comes to the economy, it matters who is
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger to Gore is not that people don't give Clinton
credit for the economy but that people think the economy is so good
Bush couldn't possibly screw it up,'' Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic
pollster, said. ``He needs to make the case why Bush represents an
economic risk for middle-class Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took up that challenge last week when he went beyond his
previous warnings that Bush's proposals were risky, a strategy that
had left him looking like the candidate of the status quo. Last
week, he made the argument that the administration had given
Americans the tools to succeed and that he would continue to do so.
He then set out alternatives to Bush's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of diverting some Social Security payroll tax to
individual investment accounts as Bush would, Gore proposed to
create similar savings accounts on top of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Bush's 10-year, $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax
cut, Gore would offer $500 billion in tax cuts aimed at particular
social purposes like college education. And Gore's aides hope to
contrast his advocacy of education and environmental programs with
Bush's support for a robust missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say that these choices will work to their benefit
in the fall with the moderate middle. ``We think the dynamics are
going to be very different probably come convention time or Labor
Day,'' Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said. ``The election is
not about who gets credit for the economy so much as who will make
the right choices for the future,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   A key question is how voters will respond to Gore himself. Bush
has spent the months since the primary season trying to erase
doubts about his intellect and to raise questions about whether
Gore is enough of a leader to take advantage of the good economy.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's spring blitz of policy speeches showed him
setting the campaign's agenda. And he used the speeches to charge
that Clinton and Gore were squandering the good times instead of
dealing with longer-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time for leadership _ for long-term thinking _ my
opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach,'' Bush said of Gore in his
speech proposing Social Security investment accounts to deal with
the strain on Social Security's finances when the baby boom
generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Ohio on Friday, he sought to undercut Gore once
again, portraying the Democrats' new tax cut proposals as products
of polling. ``Surely America doesn't want a focus-group driven
presidency,'' he said, and added later, ``I'm not one of those
people who likes to chase after public opinion.''

DECADES LATER, RONETTES MAY GET GOLD FOR OLDIES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ronettes have a reason to whu-oh-oh again.
</P>
<P>
   In a golden oldie of a lawsuit, a Manhattan judge ruled on
Friday that the Ronettes, the first of the great bad-girl groups,
whose ``Be My Baby'' became an anthem of the 1960s, were entitled
to $2.6 million in royalties and interest for recordings made for
their producer, Phil Spector.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes _ Ronnie Spector Greenfield, who was married to
Spector for six years; her sister, Estelle Bennett Dong; and their
cousin Nedra Talley Ross _ sued Spector 13 years ago, contending
they were cheated by a producer who exploited their talent, took
advantage of their naivete and left them with little to show for
their stardom but memories.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Paula Omansky of state Supreme Court in Manhattan found
that Phil Spector, who kept the rights to all Ronettes recordings,
had made millions of dollars in ways not authorized by his 1963
contract. (``Be My Baby,'' just one of the 28 songs they recorded,
sold more than 2 million copies in 1963.) The Ronettes received one
payment of $14,482.30 _ as a group _ for their work, Omansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the contract covered only royalties on sales of
phonograph records, but that Spector had sold the recordings for
use as background music in movies and advertising, and had licensed
without authority the group's master recordings to third parties _
for ``oldies'' compilations and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's lawyer, Andrew Bart, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield said she was glad that the suit was finally over. ``I
worked very hard making those records in the '60s,'' she said in a
statement. ``I didn't know I'd have to wait 37 years to get paid.''

CRITICS ON BOTH FLANKS: A NO-WIN FOR GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A strange thing happened to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
last week. A caller to his weekly radio show asked the
tough-on-crime mayor why he had suddenly gone soft _ specifically,
why a Central Park mob had been allowed to sexually assault dozens
of women last Sunday while the police, the caller said, did
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Things on the show rapidly deteriorated, at least from the
mayor's perspective, as the caller, ``Keith from Washington
Heights,'' who described himself as a big ``Rudy supporter,''
finished off with the ultimate insult. He compared Sunday's Central
Park attacks with the 1991 Crown Heights disturbance, when a black
mob killed a Jewish scholar and the Dinkins administration allowed
the violence to continue for three days.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who reviles former Mayor David Dinkins, did not take
well to the analogy. ``Maybe the picture you get is not the
absolutely accurate picture,'' he responded testily, his ``New
Rudy'' demeanor forgotten. ``Did you ever consider that?''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Giuliani was hit from the other side: A
248-page report from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission released on
Friday urged the appointment of independent prosecutors to
investigate any serious future accusations of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that the New York City Police Department engaged in
extensive racial profiling in stop-and-frisk tactics against blacks
and Hispanics. Giuliani's response, in a written statement, was
swift: ``Once again the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has
embarrassed itself by releasing a politicized report that bears no
relation to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a siege mentality in the Giuliani-era City
Hall, an ``us against the world'' leitmotif that a Republican mayor
in a Democratic city has used as inspiration as he pushes forward
with unpopular programs. But last week was the first time Giuliani
was attacked simultaneously on both flanks, for a Police Department
said to be both too aggressive and not aggressive enough. ``Maybe
we're in a period of time in which the police can't win,'' Giuliani
said on the radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Those at City Hall said the same of themselves, particularly
during a week when the lines in a predictable world of enemies and
friends became blurred. The New York Post, the mayor's longtime
supporter, compared Giuliani's reaction to the Central Park attacks
(``tepid _ indeed, downright defensive'') with the reaction of
Dinkins to the fatal stabbing of a tourist from Utah during a
robbery attempt in the subway in 1990 (``lethargic, befuddled'').
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win! You can't win!'' groused one of the mayor's
most senior advisers. But he also took on a war-weary tone. ``It's
no different now,'' he said, ``than it was six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a longtime
friend of the mayor's, expressed similar sentiments of victimhood.
``You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't,'' he
said. ``If you have an incident where the police go over the line,
everybody attacks the mayor. And if you have an incident like
Central Park, everybody attacks the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Harding, the chairman of the Liberal Party and another
old friend of Giuliani's, also reflected this view from City Hall:
``The main focus out of the Central Park melee following the Puerto
Rican Day parade has been the police reaction. The first issue is
that this kind of a melee occurred. I have not heard sufficient
condemnation of that. I hear condemnation of the police. I find
myself in a topsy-turvy world.''
</P>
<P>
   So topsy-turvy, in fact, that the mayor did something very rare
for him this week: He criticized the police. After his initial mild
response to the attacks on Monday morning _ a time when many of the
victims had not yet come forward _ Giuliani roared back with damage
control for the rest of the week, denouncing what many of the women
described as police brush-offs and promising punishment of the
officers if the claims were found to be true. He also called the
women's experiences ``horrendous'' after he met with several
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``One described to me a situation in which the police did not
respond properly, which I thought was quite credible, and totally
inexcusable,'' the mayor said at a news conference. ``And she is
prepared to identify the two police officers that did not respond,
and I believe she can, because she was able to give me physical
descriptions of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a lame-duck mayor who has said he wants to spend his
last 18 months in office redefining his legacy with the poor and
minorities found the centerpiece of his legacy _ crime control _
under attack. Videotapes of the assaults opened the ``Today'' show
on Wednesday morning, playing in kitchens and living rooms all over
the country, followed by Giuliani assuring Matt Lauer that New York
City was still safe.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the kind of crisis the mayor had always feared when
he was running for the U.S. Senate. What if it had happened when he
was upstate? How would it have played with his political
contributors in the heartland, who often cited the city's
renaissance as a reason for their support?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy Giuliani is the man who tamed New York,'' said George
Arzt, the Democratic political consultant. ``And suddenly you have
an out-of-control group. People are thinking, `Are we going back to
wilding and whirlpooling and all of those things that have left our
vocabulary?' This is part of his legacy that at least momentarily
seems to be growing a wart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Giuliani was outraged by the Crown Heights analogy, and
berated ``Keith from Washington Heights'' in vintage mayoral style.
``This did not take place all day,'' he said in a response so long
that at the end his words were drowned out by the show's closing
music. ``It didn't take place overnight. It didn't go on forever
and ever and ever. It did go on longer than it should. Maybe a
half-hour, maybe 45 minutes, maybe an hour. But to make a
comparison to something that went on for hours and hours and for
four days is a totally, you know, exaggerated reaction.''

NYC POLICE SAY THEY ARE AS DILIGENT AS EVER, AND THE NUMBERS
AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The murder rate is up 6 percent. The Wendy's killings
and a spate of livery driver murders have revived a long-dormant
image of a dangerous New York. And here and there, when New Yorkers
talk about crime and remember the bad old days, many have come to
assume that a police force tired of pay disparity, relentless
pressure to produce and public second-guessing has grown sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   The impression of arms-folded indifference by the police was
reinforced last weekend when, in a city where the tiniest crimes
have long been vigorously pursued, dozens of women were sexually
assaulted in the environs of an event, the National Puerto Rican
Day Parade, that was being patrolled by 4,000 officers.
</P>
<P>
   But by several statistical measures, indications are that
whatever the slump in morale, many officers remain actively
involved in the aggressive law enforcement efforts that have become
a hallmark of the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests are up 12 percent this year, after falling by nearly 9
percent last year. Gun arrests, which declined by nearly 15 percent
last year, have increased by 1.4 percent this year, and criminal
summonses for lesser offenses like trespassing and public urination
have increased by 16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, arrests can be an imprecise measure of enforcement
efforts, especially when they are being underwritten by a huge
infusion of overtime money, as they are this year. Arrests also
will often be sent soaring by a surge in crime.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, crime is down by 7.5 percent across the city, and
police supervisors say the reduction itself is a sign that there
has been no lapse in energy on the part of their officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, when there is a lot of criticism, it wears on morale,''
said Assistant Chief Joseph Fox, the police commander for southern
Brooklyn, where 10 percent more summonses have been issued this
year. But, he said, ``there is still that focus on crime reduction
and making arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   To many citizens accustomed to the Giuliani administration's
zero tolerance approach to crime, an approach that saw the arrest
several years ago of a man for riding a bicycle without a bell,
there was little evidence of that crime-fighting focus as the
Puerto Rican Day Parade broke up last weekend. Several women have
complained that officers did nothing when they complained of sexual
assaults inside Central Park. Several other people have said that
officers seemed to tolerate the rampant use of marijuana and
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, who deny drug use or criminal activity were
routinely overlooked, spent several days last week compiling
statistics to show that enforcement at this year's parade was as
diligent as in the past. For example, they said, police issued 686
summonses that day for a variety of offenses like public drinking,
nearly double the prior year's total.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an enforcement issue, several officers said, it is
that police historically use more discretion at the Puerto Rican
Day Parade because many officers believe their superiors are not
interested in seeing any confrontations between a largely white
police force and Hispanic paradegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that statistics from other parades clearly
demonstrate that officers are as aggressive at the Puerto Rican
event as at any other. For example, they said there were only 200
bottles or cans of beer and liquor confiscated at the St. Patrick's
Day Parade this year, while police took away 2,601 bottles and cans
from revelers last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To some who spent last Sunday in Central Park, however, the
numerical data seem like a lot of statistical legerdemain. Peter N.
Duhamel, who jogs in the park each week, said that during his
afternoon run through the park that day, officers seemed to have
turned a blind eye to misbehavior like public drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a stand-down posture,'' said Duhamel, a former
assistant United States attorney. ``From South Drive to 110th
Street, it was the same posture, depending on your perspective,
either cavalier or casual.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said that no one was given
orders to look the other way on any illegal activity at the parade.
Asked if it were possible that some officers did not act because
they were concerned about being accused of racial insensitivity,
Safir said, ``That is always a possibility. With all of the
hyperbole that has gone on over the years, certainly that could be
in the police officer's mind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many officers, including those who acknowledged lapses in police
tactics last weekend, said they felt stung by the speed with which,
in the eyes of their critics, they have gone from overaggressive to
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we go to a parade and the criticism is that they did not
enforce the law strictly enough,'' a senior police supervisor said.
``I think they would like to know what the plan is.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressiveness of police enforcement efforts has been a
source of debate for several years, in large part because city
officials have credited their focus on quality-of-life offenses and
their use of proactive patrol strategies as having been central to
the city's dramatic reduction in crime. More recently, however,
experts like former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton have
questioned whether the city's approach, which he helped fashion at
a time of high crime, is outdated, even counterproductive at a time
when the murder rate has declined by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The debate grew particularly heated after the police shooting
last year of Amadou Diallo, when many critics questioned whether
the seeds of the tragedy had been planted in an enforcement
strategy they characterized as overzealous. In the weeks following
that shooting, as the public outcry grew, police officials said
many officers demoralized by the withering criticism were no longer
patrolling as aggressively and cited this as a leading factor in
the rising murder rate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But several months later, officials said that morale had
improved and that enforcement efforts, particularly seizures of
illegal guns, were returning to prior levels. Earlier this year,
the scrutiny of police enforcement tactics returned with a
vengeance when an undercover narcotics officer, pushing to make
drug arrests in midtown Manhattan, ended up in a dispute with
Patrick Dorismond, a man who had objected to being solicited for
drugs. Dorismond was fatally shot in an incident that is still
being investigated by a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of that shooting, many public officials
questioned whether patrol strategies had become too confrontational
and their targets too trivial. But the furor had died down in
recent weeks, especially after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani bowed out of
the race for the U.S. Senate. Some people inside and outside Police
Headquarters say the pressure that officers felt to produce
ever-declining crime rates has waned in tandem with Giuliani's
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The department denies there has been any change in policy or any
relaxation in enforcement. A police union official, Sgt. Bernard
Pound, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said
he agreed. ``I get no sense that cops are doing anything other than
what comes naturally to them,'' he said. ``If they see something
wrong, they are righting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, several commanders said they had overheard the talk
in the locker rooms and muster rooms of the city's station houses
about whether a Police Department that has been under great
pressure to produce for several years may now get a chance to catch
its breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard this ever since Rudy stopped running,'' said one
investigative supervisor from Brooklyn. ``People on the job will
say, `Now maybe things will calm down a bit.' But that is just the
lazy people who are looking for an excuse. It goes back to being a
professional.''

EDITORIAL: LOSING GROUND AGAINST MICROBES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   Among the many things people in industrialized countries today
take for granted is that we will not die of a sore throat or
infected scratch from a rosebush. Effective protection provided by
antibiotics, anti-malarials and other microbe-killers was not
available 50 years ago, and a new report from the World Health
Organization warns that if we continue current practices, such
protection will not be available 50 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major infectious disease is becoming resistant to
available medicine, and scientists are not developing new medicines
fast enough to keep up. The WHO warns that we cannot count on new
drugs being developed, and so must preserve the currently available
anti-microbials by ending our misuse of them.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs lose effectiveness because the microbes they fight become
resistant. This natural process has been greatly accelerated by
human misuse of medicine. In poor countries, according to the WHO,
the biggest problem is that people underuse drugs. They cannot
afford a complete course of treatment, or take weaker and cheaper
counterfeit drugs. This kills off only the susceptible forms of the
microbes, allowing the more resistant versions to remain and
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   In wealthy countries, the problem is the opposite. Drug
resistance has soared because antibiotics are overprescribed, used
even when they are no good at all _ for example, to fight colds,
which are not bacterial but viral infections, against which
antibiotics are useless. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimates that a third of the antibiotics Americans take
on an outpatient basis are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, half of all antibiotics are produced for animal
use, mainly to increase the growth of livestock and poultry. The
resistant microbes they create can spread to humans. Even the
effectiveness of vancomycin, the last line of defense in American
hospitals against staph infections, could be imperiled because a
vancomycin derivative is fed to animals in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, doctors are finding that diseases that were
once easily cured are now stronger than their medicines. Thailand
can no longer use the three most common anti-malarial drugs.
Gonorrhea is once again life-threatening in Southeast Asia. In
Russia, one in 10 tuberculosis patients cannot take standard TB
drugs. When resistant TB spread to New York City in the early
1990s, it cost $1 billion to contain it. In the United States,
14,000 people die each year from drug-resistant infections picked
up in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent need is more research into new anti-microbial
drugs, which flagged until the mid-1990s because they were not
considered as profitable as medicines that must be taken for long
periods of time. While variations on existing drugs continue to
emerge, American scientists believe that no new classes of drugs or
vaccines will be ready for five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-microbials all over the world need more controls. In the
vast majority of nations, antibiotics are available without a
doctor's prescription, and poor people tend to buy only one or two
pills _ all they can afford. Doctors and pharmacists must instruct
patients about when to use antibiotics, and about the importance of
finishing a course of treatment. In addition, all children must be
vaccinated against infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Developed nations must also improve their vaccination rates and
drastically reduce antibiotic usage. The easiest place to start is
to greatly reduce the use of antibiotics to fatten animals. The
Food and Drug Administration is tightening the use of some
antibiotics in animals, but it needs to go further.
</P>
<P>
   Patient education is also critical. Doctors, who should know
better, need to resist demands for antibiotics from patients with
colds. The new anti-microbial soaps and cleaners made for household
use also contribute to drug resistance by killing only weak
bacteria. They should be used sparingly, as when tending to a sick
person with a weak immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Most people alive today do not remember a world without
anti-microbial agents, when the possibility of death lurked in
every cough or upset stomach. If we do not reform our use of
medicines, this is the world we might bequeath to our children.

EDITORIAL: THE CHALLENGES OF ABUNDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   A deadly familiarity has crept into the debate between Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Last week, as Gore
embarked on a new series of ``prosperity and progress'' speeches,
Bush immediately derided his efforts as ``Al Gore's `I Invented
Prosperity' Tour.'' Underneath the surface of such exchanges,
however, the political terrain may be undergoing some redefinition.
For the first time in decades, a presidential race is occurring at
a time of economic abundance and budget surpluses. These unusual
circumstances are testing the creativity of both major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, hemmed in by massive budget deficits inherited
from the Reagan years, President Clinton could not deliver on his
promises to stimulate the economy with major investments in
infrastructure and other programs. But suddenly the candidates are
now arguing over what to do with surpluses that no candidates in
recent history have enjoyed. This has allowed Gore, who has been
stumbling for months, to present the public with a detailed policy
agenda of spending proposals. It has also allowed Bush to warn _
echoing the traditional anti-government rhetoric of Republican
candidates _ that the money must not be commandeered by federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Their sparring is driven by new but as yet unannounced budget
projections for the next 10 years. A 10-year surplus that in April
was projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be nearly $900
billion if spending remained at realistic levels could now turn out
to be between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion. The surplus is based
on prudent economic assumptions, but it could of course shrink if
there was an economic downturn, or if Republicans managed to ram
through a lot of their proposed tax cuts for the rich this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to use the extra money for an accelerated program
to retire the national debt and to set up three ``trust funds'' for
health care, the environment and education. He argues that his
approach is more fiscally prudent than Bush's, especially because
it aims to make America debt-free for the first time since the
1830s. For its part, the Bush campaign will argue that its tax cut
of more than $1 trillion over 10 years is now more affordable than
before, and that spending the surplus is a decision best left to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns seem aware of surveys showing that Americans are
not nearly as angry about the government as they were in the early
or even the mid-1990s. The Gore campaign is tapping into an
emerging American recognition that economic change has made it more
urgent for government to train workers, invest in health and
research, and protect families left behind or hurt by new rules in
the workplace and marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential contest has not caught fire with the voters
quite yet. Two men of privilege approaching the White House with a
sense of entitlement does little to fire the imagination. But if
they can make this campaign a genuine discussion of the
opportunities posed by abundance, it could mark a turning point.
The first glimmerings of such a debate should be encouraged rather
than dismissed.

SPORTS COLUMN: NATIONS UNITED BY A LARGE ROUND BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the blown-up photograph, Hakeem Olajuwon is shooting with his
right hand while shoving the defender with his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is definitely an offensive foul,'' said Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, pointing at
the photo during a reception last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon chortled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are absolutely right,'' he told Holbrooke, not needing to
add that referees, even three of them, cannot possibly call
everything.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat and the center were speaking the lingua franca
known as hoops, shared by a New York man who once dreamed of
becoming the next Vince Boryla or Carl Braun with the Knicks, and a
man who grew up dreaming of becoming a soccer goalkeeper for
Nigeria, until:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people from my country who went to school in the
U.S.,'' Olajuwon said. ``They were not sports fans but they
understood that American basketball was great. They came back and
told me about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Dr. J and Magic. Those
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon was recruited to the University of Houston as a
17-year-old who barely knew the fundamentals of basketball. He was
a work in progress, albeit a 7-foot work, and as a redshirted
freshman, he caught his first glimpse of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Moses Malone,'' he recalled with awe. ``I saw these guys
shoot foul shots. I was amazed if they missed. I thought they could
shoot blindfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning professional, Olajuwon helped form the first true wave
of foreign-born pro players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league should be called the International Basketball
Association,'' Holbrooke suggested, as David Stern, master of
marketing, repressed a wince at the logo ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   National or international, these current finals have been
enriched by Kobe Bryant, who speaks Italian from his childhood
watching his American father play professionally in Milan, and by
Rik Smits, a center from the Netherlands who came to college in
America.
</P>
<P>
   To recognize this influx, Holbrooke designated five NBA players
_ Olajuwon, now an American citizen; Dikembe Mutombo of Congo;
Zydrunas Ilgauskas of Lithuania; Vitaly Potapenko of Ukraine and
Dirk Nowitzki of Germany _ as international ambassadors of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport is culture,'' Holbrooke said at the U.S. residence in
the Waldorf Towers, where Henry Cabot Lodge and Adlai Stevenson and
other representatives have lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in the '50s when the U.S. sent `Porgy and Bess'
overseas,'' Holbrooke added. ``Today the NBA represents the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The league is surely an American cultural phenomenon, but it is
also becoming more diversified. While no American team yet matches
Manchester United or AC Milan of soccer in fielding a majority of
foreigners, the NBA is catching up.
</P>
<P>
   The league had approximately 50 foreign-born players this
season, and Stu Jackson, who recently returned to the home office
after running the Vancouver club, suggests that as many as six
first-round draft choices this summer could be foreign born.
</P>
<P>
   And, the league is not for local consumption only. The NBA has
been beaming its finals, mostly live action, to 205 nations
including China, where fans still worship the Chicago Red Oxen from
the Michael Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-third of the visits to our web site _ we don't use the
word `hits' anymore _ are from outside the U.S.,'' noted Adam
Silver, the league's Internet maven.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than two decades ago that the NBA was truly
home-grown. Mutombo recalls growing up in Kinshasa, the capital of
what was then known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My school was next to the American embassy,'' he recalled.
``We would be invited to the cultural center to watch tapes about
America. A friend from the University of Kentucky showed me a tape
about Georgetown playing Kentucky in the semifinals. I became a fan
of Georgetown from that.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed Patrick Ewing _ born in Jamaica, now an American _
to Georgetown, and considers Olajuwon and Ewing as his role models.
</P>
<P>
   Change came quickly in Europe. Kremlinologists claimed to be
shocked, but the tipoff had come around 1988 when Arvydas Sabonis
refused to speak the same language as his Soviet Union coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Lithuanian,'' he once rumbled to an American news
conference. ``I no speak Russian anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis eventually got to play for a Lithuanian national team,
and now plays for Portland, and has been followed by many other
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my mother put new wallpaper in our apartment,''
said Potapenko, who grew up in Kiev. ``I put my posters of NBA
players over half the wall. I used clips so I didn't hurt the
wallpaper, but my mother was mad anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite player was Larry Johnson with Charlotte,''
Potapenko said. ``He was the best No. 4 position player, you know,
big forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched tapes and imitated the wide-open defensive stance
they use in the NBA,'' he added. ``My coach on the national
under-20 team was mad because my feet were so wide apart, but I
wanted to play like Larry Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   One seminal player from Europe was Drazen Petrovic, the great
shooter of the Nets from Yugoslavia and then Croatia, who died in
an auto accident on the German Autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   Petro was shameless in firing up his shots, and fearless against
the Jordans and Pippens, destroying some of the mystique that
European players had to be robotic second-line functionaries in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, European players can aspire to become Larry Johnson.
And kids in New York, like Richard Holbrooke a few decades ago,
could do worse than aspiring to be the next Drazen Petrovic. The
court seems to have shrunk. The world certainly has.

   SHELTER ISLAND, N.Y _ Bill Lenderking, a big old guy, 6 feet 4
inches tall, 66 years old, sits on his big old porch, stretching
out his knobby old legs, sipping a beer. Finally, he says: ``It's
not like it's some real adventure. I'm not risking my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll find out what he's risking along the way. The
plan-in-progress is for Lenderking and three younger old guys to
row their boats from the South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan to
Shelter Island, where he rowed as a kid. He has hardly rowed since.
This is about a 120-mile pull, four or five days through the
treacherous currents of Hell Gate, over the June millpond of Long
Island Sound along the North Shore, around the tip of Orient Point,
into the ferocious tides of Plum Gut and then the sheltered waters
between the Forks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be rowing with the tide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hardly `Deliverance,''' snorts his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to take a calculated risk,'' he says.
``What's the worst that could happen? That I can't handle it, that
I can't keep up? This isn't crazy, it's not Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was Annapurna, 23 years ago, when Lenderking wandered
away from the group and fell down the mountain. He walked five days
back from base camp with several broken ribs. He was then in the
Foreign Service, posted to Thailand. He also served in Cuba,
Bolivia and Vietnam, where he cheerfully admits, with his ruddy,
blue-eyed confidence, that he was one of the ``propagandists''
selling the pacification program. The government pensioned him off
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess age has something to do with all this,'' admits
Lenderking. ``After I retired at 61, I thought I'd have no trouble
getting work. I had a lot of experience. But I could see
interviewers' eyes just glaze over. Even if I had had technical
skills, which I don't, these Internet start-ups wouldn't be
interested in me.''

   He has struggled to chart a new course. He says he has made
wrong turns. He qualified to be a stockbroker, but didn't like it.
He finished a novel, which he describes as a psychological thriller
about a Foreign Service officer, but hasn't sold it. He has done
some consulting, and established an online business selling modern
first-edition books, which has accumulated more pleasure than
money.
</P>
<P>
   Lenderking is not quite sure when the rowing idea actually took
hold. The first person he called was David Stookey of Newport,
R.I., an international businessman and old friend who three years
ago began publishing a newsletter, ``Open-Water Rowing.'' He asked
Stookey if the idea was ``doable.'' It certainly was for Stookey,
57, an enthusiast fired by the image of ``unclubbable loners'' like
rowers as a group. He pulled in two of his readers, John Mullen of
Dallas and Louis Mackall of Branford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen, who is 58, started rowing at 40. He says that his height
_ 6-7 _ rather than his technique or conditioning helped him become
a masters sculling champion. He has never rowed this long or in a
group. He said, ``This is a stretch for me, and I'm at an age when
I'm looking for stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   His best friend and fellow Yale-trained architect, the
58-year-old Mackall, tries to start every day with a row. He began
rowing 12 years ago. ``My theory is that all the bending mashes the
internal organs in ways nothing else does,'' he said. ``So you've
got beauty and exercise, a killer sunrise, and you feel fabulous
all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has rowed more than 20 miles of a day, Mackall has
never taken an overnight trip. He calls it an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not meant to be a stunt,'' said Stookey, who had to be
reminded that it was Lenderking's idea, not his. ``It's just a row,
not a race. Call it cruising or touring; some guys out to see the
world. Of course, it would be good for open water rowing and the
newsletter. There's a Web site, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on Stookey's advice, Lenderking drove up to Ontario
to buy a 17-foot Loudon fiberglass boat for $2,200. On the drive
back, he will stop to practice with Stookey in Newport. The
schedule has the four boats going up the East River on Monday
morning, June 26. With luck, they will pull into Gardiner's Creek
on Shelter Island June 29 or June 30. Mullen and Mackall will row
to their Hamptons houses the next day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm taking requests on this one. Tell thelipsite(at)aol.com. If
you're interested, I will climb off my bike and cover this trip,
which seems to fall between the buoys of the zeitgeist. At one
marker is the explosion of extreme manufactured sports _ on my wall
is a photo, sent by her agent, of the 31-year-old ``adventure
athlete/action model'' Rebecca Rusch, climbing a rock wearing only
shoes. At the other, under a gold-plated AARP sunset, is the
implicit pressure of extreme prescription drugs _ to make us feel
mellower, to grow more hair and have better sex.
</P>
<P>
   It is not lost on people of a certain age that the first two
discards of the TV super hit, ``Survivors,'' were 62 and 60 years
old. Of our rowboat survivors, only Lenderking had heard of the
program; the other three are serious rowers with little time for
popular culture, much less TV.

   Instead of draft picks and free-agent signings, much of the news
of professional football this off-season has involved prosecutors,
indictments and trials. For the first time, two active NFL players
were accused of murder. Another was charged with sexually
assaulting a 17-year-old baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   With the new season looming _ training camps open next month _
The New York Times invited five members of the New York Giants to
participate in a roundtable discussion with Thomas George, a
reporter who covers pro football, and other sports reporters and
editors. Tiki Barber, Greg Comella, Howard Cross, Sam Garnes and
Amani Toomer spoke last week for more than an hour about many
issues, both off the field and on. Here are excerpts of their
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you think of the coverage in the news media of the
murder charge against Rae Carruth, the murder trial of Ray Lewis
and the charges of sexual assault filed against Mark Chmura?
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD CROSS: I think, first of all, that back in the old days
when players were doing something, they would be famous and it
didn't matter what they did. Now that we have such high standards _
quote, unquote _ that if we do anything wrong, it's in the news.
Now, these guys got caught in bad situations or did whatever they
did wrong and the media covered it. But it doesn't make us any
different than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Because if I get stopped in a DUI (driving under the influence),
it's on ESPN. If I go to a bar and some guy has too much to drink
and wants to fight me and I defend myself, not only am I on ESPN,
but I'm also in jail, probably. I'm getting sued by the guy. If the
guy beats me up, I get sued and beat up. So I got a lot going on
there. We do live normal lives like everybody else and we do live
our lives to a higher standard, or most of us try to. There's a lot
fewer of us making mistakes than the others. And as for the
coverage, if it was the IRS and they had the chance between getting
you and getting me, they're going to get me. That's just the way it
works.
</P>
<P>
   GREG COMELLA: I think we as athletes do have a responsibility
first of all to ourselves and to our families, and along with that,
to our teammates, to our coaches, to the organizations we
represent, to society, because whether we like it or not, you know,
people do look up to us. But at the same time, I think professional
athletes probably get into trouble no more or no less than the
average person working at Microsoft or working at The New York
Times, for that matter. The difference is when I make a mistake,
it's going to be in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   TIKI BARBER: People don't look to find the truth. They just look
to put the story out there and whatever spin they feel is going to
be more attractive. The prosecutor in the Ray Lewis case, he
charged Ray Lewis because he felt like it was going to be something
that was going to be big. He didn't get the facts. He wasn't
looking for the truth. He was just looking to charge Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Most media outlets, when they first ran this story, it was Ray
Lewis is charged with murder. It wasn't that Ray Lewis may not have
been involved at all. Later down the road, that comes out. But
initially it's always the thing that's going to get the most
impact. It's always going to be the thing that sells papers. It's
always going to be the thing that draws attention to the
prosecutor. And it's not necessarily the truth. That's unfortunate,
but that's just the way society is. I mean, you'd much rather hear
bad news than good news.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: And the funny thing is that Ray Lewis went through this
whole trial and they got him in jail and got him on TV and he even
pleads, says that he did some misdemeanor. Then the guys that were
accused of murder got off. Now Ray has to do community service. He
testifies, his friends get off and he's doing community service.
It's not right. But that's the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: Probably the first thing that comes to all our heads,
or at least it should, is, you know, it's obviously sad events for
the victims in this one, and sometimes that gets overlooked.
Sometimes we become numb to it, because you see it so much on
television, you see it in the newspapers, but when something hits
home, if you see a family member or a friend that's been through
something like that, certainly your heart goes out to the family
that has something tragic like that happen in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you respond when a teammate gets involved in a
situation at a bar or in a domestic problem that becomes public?
</P>
<P>
   AMANI TOOMER: When I see a story about one of the NFL players
getting involved, I may be skeptical, but I always think that the
media blows it up somehow. A month later you'll see the headlines,
the guy doesn't have anything to do with it. So I usually try to
wait and hold my judgment till after I get more facts.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: For our team, we're here talking to a person every day.
It's like, everything OK? Yeah, everything's all right, man, thanks
for asking. We go on with our lives. We've got to. The only
distraction maybe is for the player after practice when there's a
thousand cameras there and when people have their mikes up there
and they're like, well, did you do it or didn't you do it? And
that's bad for the player, we feel bad for him, but you have to
keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you concerned that people may perceive you differently
because of the notorious cases over the last seven or eight months
involving NFL players?
</P>
<P>
   SAM GARNES: I'm from the Bronx. I hang out with some of my
friends, just the typical guys that you might think look like
troublemakers, but we're just regular guys and we're not going to
change just because I'm in the NFL. I've been a good person up to
now, and I'm not going to change the way I dress or what kind of
car I have just because I'm in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And you know, you don't see or hear about how he's got
foundations or we're giving up our tight-scheduled time to go talk
to kids. But as soon as we make a slight mistake, you know somebody
might go out to a bar, might be having dinner, have a couple of
drinks, been there a little longer than expected, have four, five
drinks. Made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   It's no good to drink and drive because a lot of things come
from it, but they made a mistake. And as soon as they get pulled
over, it's in the paper even though there wasn't any violation.
Notice they didn't get into trouble, get into accidents or anything
like that. It's in the paper and we're a bad guy. That's all you
remember, that one pullover by the police.
</P>
<P>
   I take up my time and I love the kids. Just because I make a
mistake doesn't mean I don't love doing the right thing. I just
made a mistake just like any human being. That bothers me a lot,
personally.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: We don't want any awards or anything.
</P>
<P>
   GARNES: No, we don't want any awards.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: But we're doing it because we're trying to give back to
the community and everything. And I don't need the press there.
</P>
<P>
   GARNES: Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: What amazed me is, when Derrick Thomas passed away last
winter, it took an event like that, a death, for all those
wonderful news reports about the type of person he was. It's just
sad that you don't see more reports about the type of individuals
some of these guys are, like a Derrick Thomas, that it has to take
such a tragic event like that for that stuff to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sam, you mentioned that you hang out with your friends.
Acquaintances, entourages, hangers-on, that's become part of the
problem now?
</P>
<P>
   GARNES: Not really. I don't think so. I mean, my friends aren't
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No, no. Not you, but in general. That's what people were
saying about Ray Lewis, that he was hanging out with the wrong
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   GARNES: Like I said, I'm from the Bronx, so you know there's a
lot of things going on in the Bronx, and I know I had to cut
certain people off. They're still my friends, but they respect the
fact that I can't be around that. I think you have to make choices
on your own, who you hang out with, because they could do something
_ I mean, they might not even want you involved in what they're
doing _ but if you go out with them and they get in some trouble,
they're going to say, well, Sam Garnes was there also. And that's
going to sell newspapers, like Tiki said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that now you have to be more careful?
</P>
<P>
   BARBER: I think guys take the responsibility that they have to
be careful as soon as they get into the professional ranks. You
know, people think they don't have to be role models all the time,
but we are role models, whether we like it or not. Kids are going
to look up to you. I believe it should be the parents' job to say _
OK, say I'm a good role model, a parent should say, OK, Tiki does
the right things. But say you have someone who gets in trouble all
the time, he should be able to say, well, this guy isn't doing the
right things. Compare and contrast, don't just let the kid decide,
because sometimes he'll think that the guy who's doing the bad is
the cool guy.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as hanging out with your friends, you don't want to
cut them off, because these are the guys, when you were nobody,
when you were growing up, these were your friends. They supported
you. That's when you build most of your friendships that you're
going to have for the rest of your life. And sometimes it's hard to
cut that off. But you have to when you're a professional athlete,
because things are different, times change. It's not the same. Even
though guys would like it to be, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think pro athletes are held to an unfair standard?
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   BARBER: Oh, without a doubt. I think athletes are held to the
standard of society is great, so they should be great. We're not
all great. We're not always doing the right things. Sometimes we do
falter and take bad steps.
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: I don't think that we are held to too high of a
standard. I think we've been given a lot of opportunities. I think
we've had chances to do things that 99 percent of this country
never even conceives, never thinks about. So is the standard that
we're held to different? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BARBER: Well, doesn't different mean higher?
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: Yeah, it may be higher, but what I think is, we're
given a lot.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: Blessed a lot so you're required to do a lot.
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: That's what I believe.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: See, the problem is not that we're held to a higher
standard, which we are. It's just that it is unfair. Because
everybody puts you, like, OK, you have made it. Blessed with
skills, whether it's speed or height or strength or whatever. I
didn't ask to be 6-6 and 270. I didn't ask for that. And thank God
for it. I didn't even want to be a football player. I thought I was
going to be in the NBA. It didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   And I get a higher standard. When I go out I'm really nice to
kids. I'm really nice to people that come up and speak to me, even
when they're rude. I've had guys step up and, ``Excuse me, miss,''
put their hand on my wife and move her out of the way just so they
can talk to me. And she's like, ``Are you kidding me?'' And I'm
like, ``Honey, don't hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: I think the standard is such because people look at us
and very much admire what it is we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   BARBER: You know what it is, it's a dream. When you're a little
kid you dream to be a professional athlete. And now that we're
professional athletes people think that our lives are a dream. How
would you dream the perfect life? I want to be a professional
basketball player, have a big Mercedes, a big house and live a
perfect life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you think it's the money?
</P>
<P>
   BARBER No, it has nothing to do with the money. It's just the
dream. Athletes aren't the only dreams now. Bill Gates is a dream
now for kids. Times have changed, society has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think that the kids see you as any less of an idol or
role model than kids did when Y.A. Tittle was playing?
</P>
<P>
   BARBER: I don't think so. They have more role models now, not
just athletes. It's transcended into other sectors of life, which I
think is a good thing. But I also think it's a bad thing. They get
caught up in not experiencing life fully.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: We've got a society of people that want to see gore,
right? Like movies with blood and gore, everybody runs to the
theater to see people get shot up. When there's an accident on the
highway, almost every car stops and looks over. We are held to a
higher standard, because our society decides we like to see blood
and gore. You guys better be good or else we're going to tell on
you.
</P>
<P>
   TOOMER: I think some of it has to do with the fact that they
want to set you up to be kind of a star and then they want to know
the dirt behind you. They want to know the faults of everybody.
They just don't want to see somebody up there who has no faults.
They kind of get bored with that. They want to know the person more
than just the good things they do. They want to know what are the
faults, what are his weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: They don't want you to be perfect. Like how many of you
guys, in all honesty, when you watched the U.S. Open last year and
John Daly took that 11 on that hole, how many of you were like, oh,
yeah, I could do that. He kept hitting the ball, hitting the ball.
He took an 11 on the hole, everybody's done it. But John Daly, now,
he's a pro, he shouldn't do that. But it was something you wanted
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people have said that some football players have a hard
time leaving the violence on the field. Is it difficult to be asked
to be violent on the field and then to be model citizens when you
walk off it?
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: You're Christmas shopping or whatever, you're going to
the mall. Somebody accidentally cuts you off. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm pretty meek about it usually.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: Ma'am, what about you?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I go nuts.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: Exactly. You're human. I've seen people in the car, like
ladies, will just give me the finger. What are you doing? But if an
athlete does it, we can't separate our two worlds. So I want to
know what's the difference between a lady having road rage, and a
man getting upset at another man and one of the men happens to be
an athlete?
</P>
<P>
   COMELLA: The thing is, that's who we are, we're football
players. And the bottom line is on the football field we are
positively reinforced the more we destroy. That's the nature of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: It's not close to that, Greg. You're making it sound like
that. When we're playing football, Greg has a play, the draw. The
fullback leads up on the linebacker. They're running at each other.
Linebacker's got to fill a hole; Greg's got to knock him out of the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   That's a violent play to you guys. To Greg, it's just doing his
job. That's not like a really violent thing, that's just Greg doing
his job. The linebacker's doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg gets in his car to go home that day, somebody cuts him
off and he yells at him, he's not taking his job off the field. He
didn't take his car and ram it into the guy. His insurance wouldn't
pay, he'd lose his insurance. Instead, he just keeps going.
</P>
<P>
   TOOMER: I don't know. I think what he's talking about is not
just those type of incidents. I'm talking about if you go to a club
and then somebody touches you or grabs you or something like that,
then I can understand his question.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: Physically, I'm a meek person, I wouldn't fight for
nothing. But if you put your hands on me, I've got to defend
myself. I'm not going to let you hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's talk a little about entitlement, which is the flip side
of being held to a higher standard. By the time you get to be an
all-American, there are people who ordinarily would not give you
the time of day who suddenly want to know you. The answers become
yes, instead of no.
</P>
<P>
   CROSS: You get a lot more of that than anything else. You get
that celebrity status and people do know you and people are
offering you meals and cutting you into the front of the line. For
every one of those that happens, there's another group of people
that are like, ``Oh, he doesn't deserve anything.'' There are some
places still in Alabama _ ``Hey, that's Howard Cross from the
Giants. He played for Alabama. That's a black guy, man.'' You're
still black. I didn't do anything special.
</P>
<P>
   GARNES: You get more good things from being an athlete, being a
professional football player. But it's just that when that one
thing happens that's negative, that's how everybody views you from
then on.

SHOWDOWN OVER TIGER COMPOUND NEARS; OWNER VOWS TO KEEP ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ To get to the thickly forested preserve
where Joan Byron-Marasek keeps 24 tigers, you have to go past the
Six Flags Outlet Mall just off Interstate 195, and through a busy
intersection with three gas stations and a Methodist church. If you
come across a new development of large, expensive homes, you've
gone a bit too far.
</P>
<P>
   When Byron-Marasek and her husband, Jan Marasek, moved to this
enclave in South Jersey 24 years ago and began acquiring tigers,
they were practically out in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But now the modern world is pressing in on the 15-acre domain of
Byron-Marasek, better known as the Tiger Lady. And with development
has come a host of other forces knocking on her 25-foot-high iron
gate: angry neighbors, who have filed lawsuits saying her preserve
is incompatible with their neighborhood; the town and the Ocean
County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who have filed
complaints in municipal court over the 35 dogs she keeps in the
compound; and the state Department of Environmental Protection,
which is nearing a showdown in its yearlong effort to close her
Tigers Only Preservation Society.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, citing poor conditions at the compound, have
given her until the end of the month to present a plan detailing
how she will remove the tigers from her property.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tiger Lady has dug in her heels. Not only has she
refused to plan for the tigers' removal, but the normally reclusive
couple have also begun a public relations effort to appeal to other
animal lovers or to anyone who agrees that she is the victim of
government intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `If they can do this to her, they'll do
this to all of us,''' she said of those who have come to her
support, including the owner of the fence company who donated the
chain-link barrier around a new part of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   She has even started a Web site to solicit donations and gather
names on a petition asking Gov. Christie Whitman to allow the
preserve to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is not an option,'' Byron-Marasek said, while showing
visitors through her compound. ``I have to stay positive. This is
my life. I'll fight to keep them. I mean fight legally, with
appeals, whatever it takes to legally fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek does not allow many people into her small world,
and she does not leave it very often, either. She and her husband
work full time tending to the tigers, who live in pens surrounded
by 18-foot-high chain-link fencing, connected to each other and to
40-foot trailers where the tigers can go to escape the heat or
cold.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are the only ones, save for occasional volunteers,
who care for the tigers. They spend much of their time inside the
cages with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of them,'' said Byron-Marasek, a small-boned
woman who, at 5 feet 2 inches tall, is dwarfed by the 400- to
600-pound tigers, which stand at the fence on their hind legs when
she approaches and rub their noses to hers. ``I understand them.
But I, too, can get tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek is stingy with details about her personal life.
She will not reveal her age or where she was born. She will say
that she worked as a circus trapeze artist as a teen-ager, and that
she grew close to some of the animal trainers. She was an actress
on Broadway, performing in Tom Stoppard's ``Jumpers,'' in which she
swung from a chandelier using her teeth and legs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, she left the theater, and she and her husband bought
the property in Jackson Township. She bought five 8-week-old tigers
after obtaining a state permit.
</P>
<P>
   Byron-Marasek ended up with as many tigers as she has in part
because she allows the animals to inbreed, which some animal rights
groups say can produce unhealthy animals. She says she keeps the
tigers to help preserve the species, and because she loves them.
The state says her permit allows her to keep such animals only if
she exhibits them, but she cannot present evidence that she does.
</P>
<P>
   Her troubles began in January 1999, when police killed a tiger
wandering in the area. State officials say the tiger was
Byron-Marasek's, but she denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, state inspectors have made more frequent unannounced
visits, and Byron-Marasek has made improvements to the compound,
like a concrete border to keep the tigers from digging their way
out. She and her lawyer, Valter Must, say the state keeps changing
the rules. But state officials say the rules are clear-cut and
intended to protect the tigers and the public.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the state wants her to provide up-to-date records
on how many animals she has, and their medical histories. In the
last two months, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Environmental Protection, two cubs died.
Byron-Marasek did not report the deaths until days later, she said,
and did not provide definitive records from her veterinarian on the
cause of death, which was believed to be salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Joan loves these tigers,'' Southard
said. ``But there are a couple of fundamental issues here, and one
is that you can't have all these animals. Period. It's against the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   As she sat under the pines, Byron-Marasek spread out a stack of
documents to make her case that the state is trying to take her
land because it has become valuable, and that the state's so-called
tiger experts do not know as much as she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat, sleep and breathe tigers,'' she said. ``I never take
vacations. This is my love, my passion. The thought of losing my
animals, I just can't bear it. I just want to believe that they
won't take them.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A MATTER OF PRISMS AND PERSPECTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also FBN-GIANTS-ROUNDTABLE)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than once, Howard Cross or one of his Giants
teammates looked across the table at editors and reporters and
prefaced a remark with ``No offense to you guys'' or ``Nothing
personal, but ...'' Then the players would offer a polite but
pointed critique of the sports news media.
</P>
<P>
   This was Thursday afternoon. Five members of the Giants
graciously agreed to march behind the lines and meet with the
enemy. Cross, Amani Toomer, Sam Garnes, Greg Comella and Tiki
Barber sat in a conference room with New York Times editors and
reporters, engaged in a two-pronged discussion. We talked about the
coming football season and then tackled issues surrounding the rash
of off-the-field incidents that have marred the image of the
contemporary professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for this meeting was a new season, and the serious
and troubling issues surrounding the trial of Ray Lewis, who was
charged with murder and subsequently pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor. What came through was the players' mistrust of,
frustration with and resentment of the news media. The notion that
athletes have targets on their backs, and the news media aim and
shoot, acting like a civilian review board.
</P>
<P>
   What athletes do and how the news media interpret what they do,
how reporters cover and uncover the actions, deeds and misdeeds and
disseminate information to the public, are sources of tension
between the athletes and the editors and reporters. ``What do
people want to hear?'' Barber said. ``I mean, your job is to sell
papers, right? And you don't want to put out news that nobody wants
to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber said what bothers him is that ``people don't look to find
the truth.'' He added: ``They just look to put the story out there
and whatever spin they feel like is going to be more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the players didn't agree on everything. Are pro
athletes held to unfair standards?
</P>
<P>
   Cross: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber: ``Oh, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Comella: ``I don't think that we are held to too high of a
standard. I think we've had chances to do things that 99 percent of
this country never even conceives.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the complaints about being targets, Cross conceded
that pro athletes were also objects of affection, that they were
given many things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that celebrity status, and people do know you and
people are offering you meals and cutting you into the front of the
line,'' he said. ``For every one of those that happens, there's
another group of people that are like, `Oh, he doesn't deserve
anything.' There are some places still in Alabama: `Hey, that's
Howard Cross from the Giants. He played for Alabama. That's a black
guy, man.' You're still black.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Garnes disagreed. ``You get more good things from being an
athlete, being a professional football player,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked the players why public sentiment seemed to be
turning against professional athletes, particularly basketball and
football players.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer said he felt that news media portrayals and the public's
penchant to know dirt were greater factors than any problem that
might exist in the league. ``In society, people want to set you up
to be kind of a star and then they want to know the dirt behind
you,'' he said. ``They want to know the person more than just by
the good things they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media oblige by dredging up the dirt and dishing it. Of
course, if there's no dirt to be dredged up, it can't be dished.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I think we love heroes more; we choose the fallen and
the wretched because they are in such abundance. We love the heroic
instinct, the heroic attempt. Outside of stadiums and arenas, there
is so little room for heroes; the individual has been reduced and
minimized by the onslaught of progress. Minimized by corporations
devouring corporations. The monster eventually begins feeding on
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Professional athletes _ Cross, Comella, Garnes, Barber, Toomer,
the star goalie, the swimmer _ rely on arms, legs and muscles. They
play on a level field, or as level as possible. They play by a set
of rules enforced by officials _ sometimes for better, sometimes
for worse _ who drop the flag or blow the whistle to keep the field
level.
</P>
<P>
   The games are so unlike the real world, where wealth and power
usually reign side by side with skulduggery in pursuit of wealth
and power. The athlete, in an odd way, offers salvation. Maybe this
is the underlying reason for fan anger when an athlete falls from
grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want you to be perfect,'' Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than an hour, the meeting broke up. Everyone shook
hands and headed back to his or her own world.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting raised more questions than answers. Some of us want
to see more introspection from athletes about problems in the
professional leagues. From the athletes' perspective, the problem
is we, with our pens and cameras. Taking it all in.

ROSE AND MILLER POSTPONE THE SHAQ AND KOBE CORONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The game was in the vault an hour before. Reggie
Miller had pulled the pin on his last 3-pointer, and Jalen Rose had
peeled and sliced a defense purported to be the league's most
stingy.
</P>
<P>
   So all the two emotional scorers for the Indiana Pacers had left
to do was not anger the gods any further, be happy with their
33-point knockout over Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and the Los
Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of the National Basketball Association
finals. Catch a flight to Los Angeles for Game 6. Maybe a humble
statement or two, and that's it. Move on.
</P>
<P>
   But they could not help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, a lot of the scuffles are coming from them, which is a
shock,'' Miller replied with biting sarcasm when asked about
growing tension between the teams. ``Everyone thinks they're so
nice and pretty and, you know, they're the glamour boys, it's Los
Angeles. Evian. Caffe latte, all that. They're doing all the
pushing, the holding. They look at the refs like they're not doing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Having carved up Glen Rice and anyone else Phil Jackson sicced
on him in the 120-87 blowout on Friday night, Rose wondered openly
who could stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you come out on me, contest a 3 and allow me to get my
dribble-drive game going, or do you double-team me in the post and
allow me to pass and get other guys involved?'' he inquired.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Shaq-and-Kobe coronation has been
temporarily postponed by two stick figures. Outweighed and
outmuscled, Miller and Rose are the annoying-gnat-type players you
shove aside to grab the rebound, the obnoxious, tagalong siblings
you cannot quite ditch.
</P>
<P>
   But you look further and you realize their edge _ that spiteful
guard-me-if-you-can demeanor _ is why the Pacers forced a return
trip to L.A. before their loud legions at the Conseco Fieldhouse
Friday night. They combined for 57 points and 8 three-pointers,
doing most of the damage in a barrage that hit the Lakers hard,
shook their foundation and again raised doubts about their ability
to close out an opponent ready to drop.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Miller was staring coldly at the Laker bench, Rose
was laughing at Rick Fox. Miller and Mark Jackson each were
assessed technical fouls with 11 minutes left in the fourth period
and the game already out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Larry Bird's kind of act.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosiers play by unspoken rules. You don't show up the opponent.
Once you move to Indiana, you're supposed to play how the coach
tells you to play. Give up your urban roots and give in to
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bird hates the taunting, the shimmying, the finger-pointing of
Jackson, Miller and Rose. But can the Pacers coach have it both
ways? As one of the game's all-time purveyors of verbal trash, Bird
is a bit of revisionist historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers thrive off their emotions. Rose does not care what
the score is or who is defending him. When Miller is ahead by 20,
he gets more greedy, yelling at his teammates to give him the ball
so he can plunge in another 3-point dagger.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is 35 years old. His lack of foot speed prevents him
from beating many retired players off the dribble. But there he
was, strutting down a corridor of the arena, humming an old rap
tune on Friday night _ an old-school player paying homage to an
old-school artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put it any better than LL Cool J, who said, `We're
going back to Cali,''' Jackson said. ``That was our theme song
before tonight's game. We went with that mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   When told Bird was upset by their outbursts, he replied, ``I'm
not going to get into, you know, the coach, his opinion. I think as
leaders of this basketball team, we have to spark something to make
a statement that we're not going to lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller became prickly when asked if Bird's last game at home
meant something to the team. ``It was the last game for a lot of
guys in there, not just Larry,'' he said. ``We're facing
elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Rose played the game as well as it can be played on
Friday night, finding open spaces and each other, turning the court
into a Woodenesque clinic, a hoop choreographer's dream where
everyone makes the right play.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half alone, the Rose and Miller detonated for 42
points. The defining play came with Miller racing down the court,
leading the break, dumping it off to Rose for a two-handed dunk on
the left side.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of Rose and Miller thriving in the same starting
lineup together is more impressive than Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell sharing the same floor space and complementing each other
games. Rose did not start last season. He took Chris Mullin's spot
and cut into Derrick McKey's playing time, adding a new dynamic to
the motion offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was so new, Miller's head spun early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some time for us to find a balance with one another,
you know,'' he said. ``I was so used to working with Derrick as
well as Chris Mullin the last two and three years. But it took time
for us to get our rhythm, especially our motion play, on which side
both of us liked. Now that we found a comfortable balance between
the two, it's starting to show just a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers still have a steep climb, but who believed they would
last this long? Two, irrepressible, rangy scorers _ one allegedly
past his prime and the other not yet an All-Star _ giving arguably
the team with the top two players in the NBA a genuine scrap for
the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still the team in control, but we're still the team
that has fight,'' Rose said. ``We know California is going to be
ready to celebrate. We heard about the parade that they have
planned. That won't be tomorrow, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``We absolutely, positively have nothing to lose
and everything in the world to gain. So we are going to play lose,
free, we don't care. There's no pressure on us. All the pressure is
on them. From the get-go, they were supposed to beat us. They were
supposed to sweep us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the coach, they were supposed to make a humble
statement or two. Catch a flight. Move on. But Miller and Rose
cannot help themselves. They're not Hoosiers at heart. They're
ballplayers, looking for one more decent run.

OUTDOORS: ALIENS IN THE RIVER, WELCOME TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETE BODO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEPOSIT , N.Y. _ The angler staggering up the steep bank to the
hardtop road where Richard Franklin and I were stringing up our fly
rods appeared dazed and contented, proving once again that people
who grouse about ``too much of a good thing'' probably never
experience it.
</P>
<P>
   This lean gent had caught so many trout that he regarded even
the dense poison ivy carpeting the bank with delight: oh, the waxy
sheen of those leaves! Oh, that subtle crimson tint on the
triple-leaf clusters!
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baetis were hatching heavy all morning,'' he said
breathlessly, referring to a small mayfly commonly called the
blue-winged olive. ``There were sulfur spinners, too, and some
caddis. Every fish in the river was up, feeding.'' He allowed the
requisite beat before the punch line: ``They turned off about an
hour ago. Must be this wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, my partner and I soon scrambled down the footpath to
the West Branch of the Delaware River. It was 3 p.m. on a sunny day
in early June, a time we frequently fish in this area just a few
miles below the Cannonsville Reservoir. The river is braided up
here, the islands dense with flowering briars, bleached-out
deadfalls and the detritus of the spring floods, which invariably
includes a pair of navy blue New York Giants sweat pants
grotesquely twisted around a willow root.
</P>
<P>
   I find the flotsam intriguing, in a morbid way, but these
islands are valuable as well as compelling. Inundated all spring,
they explode with life as soon as the floods recede and quickly
become so dense that bushwhacking across even the most slender of
them in waders is impossible. While it's inconvenient negotiating
around them, they provide quality habitat for nesting birds and
secure bedding areas for deer.
</P>
<P>
   Islands also multiply the amount of bank habitat for trout and
add to the available amount of food, provided the volume of water
is sufficient to push up against them. Thanks to a wet spring, the
West Branch was flowing at a robust 1,200 cubic feet a second,
almost double the norm.
</P>
<P>
   When a river is bank full, its foliated banks provide juvenile
trout with places to hide, adult trout with ideal feeding stations
and freshly hatched aquatic insects with good cover in which they
rapidly mature before mating and sowing their eggs back into the
river from which they sprang. Trout often take up bankside lies
along islands for the same reasons that dogs like to feign sleep
beneath dining room tables: just in case something falls off the
edge.
</P>
<P>
   It took some looking, but Richard and I found fish rising
sporadically in the broad back channel of the river. In a typical
June, this flat would be glassy and the trout hard to fool. But the
current was brisk and the surface simmered, tilting the odds our
way. Reflections of purple and white dame's rocket shimmered in the
late afternoon light, and then a fish rose within casting range,
completing the tableau.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as my size-16 parachute Adams alighted on the surface,
the trout grabbed it. It was a fat, footlong brown that burped at
me as I slipped the barbless hook from its jaw. Strictly speaking,
dame's rocket (a member of the mustard family, it closely resembles
phlox) and brown trout are both aliens in the local ecosystem, but
as far as I'm concerned they are more than welcome to stay. Just
minutes later, Richard hooked and landed a considerably larger
fish. Our reverie was interrupted by a thunderstorm. We scowled at
the sky, huddling in our flimsy rain jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing, the skies were clotted with orange. It was so still
that droplets fell audibly from the leaves. The broad channel
before me was the color of pewter, open and inviting. But I kept
casting glances over my shoulder at the island, expecting fish to
rise there as dusk approached. They would be tight to the bank, in
the dark band of water below the dank overhanging boughs that
tippled the surface here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfurs, tiny yellow mayflies, began emerging in the failing
light. Here and there, a snout poked through the surface. Trout in
bank lies, where the current is usually slow and even, rise
deliberately. Often, their dorsal fins wag in the surface film. If
you don't have a seizure at the sight, you can accurately judge the
size of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   None of the fish up against the island were giants. But in that
micro-environment, even the little dumb ones can be challenging.
Presenting a fly accurately, delicately and realistically to a bank
feeder is, to many anglers, the height of the art.
</P>
<P>
   I patiently worked on the largest of the fish for half an hour.
Just before dark, I finally hooked it on a size-18 sulfur emerger.
I don't know which of us was more surprised. By the time I released
the lovely 15-inch brown, it was dark. The chill air was heavy with
the scent of alluvial earth. I'd have to wade around the edge of
the entire island in the dark to get back to the car, and that was
just fine by me. &QL;

MEN SEARCHING FOR ROAD MAP ON EVER-EVOLVING ROLE OF FATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT PURDY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHASSET, N.Y. _ Children know their place, or ought to. And
mothers are mothers, those natural-born nurturers. But fathers,
after all these years, are still hunters, searching for their
perfect role.
</P>
<P>
   The search begins in places like the maternity ward at North
Shore University Hospital here, where the babies are cute, the
mothers maternal and the fathers a mixed bag. They all know that,
as one new father said, the days of ``Me Ug, you Woman'' are long
gone. But now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're expected to do more in terms of changing diapers and
formula and getting up in the middle of the night,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Klein, 31, a podiatrist whose first child was born last
week. But on Day 2 of Klein's grand adventure, with his wife
recovering in bed and far-off visions of tossing a ball to young
Eric Matthew just setting in, the babe was suddenly wailing. Klein
scrambled for support staff. ``I'm looking for the phone,'' he
said, ``to call her mother, my mother. Where the hell is
everyone?''
</P>
<P>
   He was never big on holding babies. But when his was born,
``they handed him to me,'' he said. ``I had no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he wanted a choice _ just a road map _ as he headed
happily and inexorably toward his first Father's Day. After all,
not all fathers are like that plumber down the hall who was
handling his day-old daughter as expertly as he would PVC pipe.
</P>
<P>
   You might expect a plumber for the New York City Fire Department
to be a hands-on guy. But this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there for the whole thing,'' said Pat Brazill, 30, of
his wife's 23 hours of labor with baby Kaitlyn. ``I didn't miss a
minute of it. I even told the doctor to give me some tools. I'll
help you out.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's fathers who need help. The playing field of
parental responsibility is leveling. But for all the magazines and
books advising fathers, they're still scrambling for footing. If
mothers teeter on the high wire stretched between home and work,
fathers are like Mr. Potato Heads, endlessly trying out
combinations of parts. (How about the head of a Guinness Stout, the
body of a Ferrari, the cool of Joe Torre and the portfolio of Anna
Kournikova?)
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jorge, 33, the manager of a locksmith company in Queens
and the father of a 21-month-old son, was rhapsodizing on
fatherhood in a labor room with his very expectant wife, Yenny. He
loves arriving home from work to the squeal of ``Daddy!'' or
reading Disney books or watching television with his son, Dylan.
``I'll be watching basketball or baseball, and I'll say `Look,
there's the ball,''' Jorge said, ``And he'll say, `Ball, ball,
ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's exhilarated. ``I'm still trying to get used to the fact
that I'm a father,'' he said. ``It still hasn't sunk in, 21 months
later.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife was exhausted, braving contractions. Over the sound of
the heart monitor, she said, ``It better sink in this time,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie Ennis, a health educator at the hospital, said she was
a bit taken aback when a man showed up alone at a breast-feeding
class. ``I looked at him, and he said `Why are you looking at me?
My wife's not feeling well,''' she said. Not surprisingly, ``he had
the most questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among the newly minted fathers, you can pick out those who
one day will be loudly working the cell phone on the soccer
sideline or struggling to take a teen-ager's tattoo in stride. Not
that fatherhood is predictable anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wendland grew up in a Long Island neighborhood with lots
of firefighters who worked second jobs when they weren't dousing
flames. Now a New York City firefighter, Wendland uses his unusual
work schedule to care for his 3-year-old son most days. ``I
actually hang out with another fireman who's a friend,'' he said,
as his wife Andrea, a physician's assistant, was in labor with
their second child. ``We'll go to places you can hang out with your
kids, Chuck E. Cheese or Fun Zone.'' Their first time at Fun Zone,
on a Wednesday, he said, ``I was with my friend and we were
standing around and suddenly there were five of us. We were all
firemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, Paul Epstein, an anesthesiologist at the
hospital and a father of three, turns to a soon-to-be-father as
he's easing the pain of an expectant mother, and asks, ``Do you
have any idea what you're getting into?''
</P>
<P>
   They never do.

AGAIN, LAKERS FAIL TO CLOSE OUT A SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ So much for the Los Angeles Lakers' new-found
ability to close out a series. With an opportunity to close out the
Indiana Pacers at Conseco Fieldhouse in Game 5 Friday night and
garner their first National Basketball Association title since
1988, the Lakers stumbled horribly. It wasn't the first time. In
close-out games against Sacramento, Phoenix and Portland, the
Lakers had bombed.
</P>
<P>
   But this time was supposed to be different. Entering Game 5 on
the Pacers' home court, the Lakers said they had learned to
maintain their focus. They claimed to understand the importance of
keeping their intensity, of squashing an opponent that is down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, these are apparently the same old Lakers, the ones who
overwhelm opponents in building commanding series leads, only to
start coasting and give life to the other team.
</P>
<P>
   After slumbering for almost all 48 minutes in Friday's
embarrassing 120-87 loss to the Pacers, the Lakers are 3-6 this
postseason in games in which they could have eliminated an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sense of urgency that you have to have that we
haven't developed yet as a team,'' said A.C. Green, who won NBA
titles with the Lakers in 1987 and 1988. ``We just don't execute
and do the things necessary to win games when we have a team in the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who will be back home Monday night for Game 6 at the
Staples Center, were quick to give the Pacers credit. But Friday's
stunning onslaught was about more than the Pacers' excellence.
</P>
<P>
   As it has done so many times this postseason, Los Angeles simply
did not come ready to play. After outrebounding the Pacers in three
of the first four games, the Lakers were beaten, 46-34, on the
boards. They made 4-of-19 3-pointers and shot 40 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense was even worse. The league's stingiest team during
the regular season was ravaged for a 1970s-era point total and 57.4
percent shooting. As if shooting alone at a morning practice, the
Pacers shot 75 percent in the first quarter and reached the
50-point mark 6 minutes 18 seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're upset with ourselves,'' Coach Phil Jackson said.
``There's no one to blame but us in this situation. We're not going
to be angry about it one way or the other. We're frustrated that we
didn't execute very well, didn't move the basketball very well, did
too many things off the dribble. The thing that bothers us the most
as a coaching staff is defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're sitting in the driver's seat, and we're not in
a situation where we have to get in a panic mode, but we have to
play with more energy and more control.''
</P>
<P>
   After going up by three games to one, the Lakers were queried by
reporters as if the series were over. They answered dozens of
questions about being a budding dynasty. They were asked to compare
themselves with the great teams of the past _ the Lakers and
Detroit Pistons of the 1980s, the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s. And
Kobe Bryant, coming off his spectacular 28-point performance in
Game 4, was being compared favorably to Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson even felt comfortable enough to speak about Bryant as
Jordan before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's probably a better player at 21 than Michael was at
21,'' Jackson said. ``He has a wonderful future, and we hope that
he can fill those mighty big shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant was hurled violently back to the planet on Friday
night. Jalen Rose and Reggie Miller took turns obliterating his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded by many as the best defensive shooting guard in the
league, Bryant was juked ridiculously a couple of times. On the
other end, his night was even longer, as he scored just eight
points on 4-of-20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kobe held himself,'' Miller said when asked about
stopping Bryant. ``He had a lot of good looks early. He probably
got fouled on a couple of shots. But hey, that's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much question as to whether the Lakers, who lost a
second-round close-out game to Phoenix by 19 points, will forget
about this nightmare and play well in Game 6. But the 33-point
deficit, their worst of the season, rankled Jackson enough for him
to question his team's greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've bounced back from games like this before,'' Jackson
said. ``I don't like to think of a team that has championship
quality in it that loses by 33 points. We have to prove something
to ourselves when we go back home in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers thrive on challenges, and Jackson just issued one.

ROCKIES ARE BETTER BUT NOT ON THE ROAD  
 (WITH BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service      
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of an executive with a competing club, ``They
changed everything from top to bottom and they wind up with the
same animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The animal that is the Colorado Rockies, though, is a more
attractive species this season. Many of the Rockies' ingredients
look similar to last year, but the team has made impressive
improvements in some key areas, and the difference is in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with the character of their 8-year-old franchise, the
Rockies have played as two different teams home and away. Before
Saturday night's game with the Arizona Diamondbacks in Denver, the
Rockies had a 35-27 record, 23-8 at home and 12-19 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But their major league-best home record was enough to place them
only two games behind the first-place Diamondbacks in the National
League West. After the same number of games last season, the
Rockies had a 30-32 record and were eight games behind the
first-place Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play better on the road,'' said Buddy Bell, who as
the first-year manager is one of many new members with the club.
``Only time will tell if we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan O'Dowd, another newcomer, became general manager last
September, he set out to change the personality of the team. The
slugging attack had not worked so he decided to put together a
collection of players who could get on base a greater percentage of
the time and score without relying on home runs. He also wanted
pitchers who could throw strikes.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd's efforts have given the Rockies 15 new players on their
25-man roster. Two of the departed, Vinny Castilla and Dante
Bichette, were two of the team's sluggers who produced a .472
slugging percentage last season. The slugging percentage this
season? It's .471.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Dowd's changes have produced the desired effect in putting
runners on base. The Rockies' on-base percentage last season was
.348. It's up to .471 this season. Last season Bichette had a .354
on-base percentage and Castilla .331. Among the newcomers this
season Jeffrey Hammonds is at .435, Tom Goodwin .422 and Jeff
Cirillo .404. As a team, the Rockies are drawing more walks,
averaging one more walk a game (4.15) than last year (3.14).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good chemistry,'' Bell said. ``Guys
understand what's needed at the time. They're not afraid to take a
walk. That's something Danny really felt was one of the most
important things for how our offense was. Our on-base percentage
last year wasn't very good so he was determined to make that
better. It's become more of a contagious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockies were to score runs without a ton of home runs,
they were going to have to go for more stolen bases, and they have
succeeded there, too. Last year the team had 70 stolen bases, tied
for the next-to-lowest total in the league. This season they have
62, second in the league. But the home/road disparity continues.
Hammonds is hitting 178 percentage points better at home, Todd
Helton 131 points, Cirillo 112, Goodwin 102 and Larry Walker 100.
Imagine how good the Rockies' league-leading batting average (.296)
could be if they could hit in other teams' parks.
</P>
<P>
   On the pitching side of the ledger, the Rockies have made
significant improvement. From a franchise-record 6.01 earned run
average last season, the Colorado staff has sliced half a run,
compiling a 5.46 ERA so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons is the pitchers' improved control. As O'Dowd
designed it, they are throwing fewer balls and walking fewer
batters. They have averaged one fewer walk this season (3.50) than
last (4.55), giving them a total of 217, the third-lowest total in
the NL Last year they walked a league-record 737.
</P>
<P>
   Bell credited his relief corps with doing a solid job. Leading
that corps is the closer, Jose Jimenez, who as a rookie starter
last season pitched a no-hitter for St. Louis. The 26-year-old
right-hander has made a seamless transition to relieving, earning
11 saves in 13 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimenez has helped solidify the roles everybody performs,''
O'Dowd said. ``We didn't say it, but that was the role we got him
for. We didn't know his durability or how he would handle things
mentally, but he's been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the team's defense. From the middle of the pack last
season the Rockies have rocketed to the top, committing the fewest
errors (35) in the league. Besides being more sure-handed, the
infielders have demonstrated greater range. The combination makes
the pitchers better.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all of the improvements, and look at the Rockies in
second place, challenging the Diamondbacks for first place this
weekend. And if there are players out there who could make the team
even better, Bell is betting that O'Dowd will find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one relentless man,'' the manager said. ``I'm sure if
somebody told us we'd be in this position now we'd have taken it.
But he's always going to try to make us better.''

INDIANS SINK TO PAST; STRIKING OUT AT SOSA; MORGAN'S DOZEN;
SELF-CONTROL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBN-ROCKIES)  
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time the Cleveland Indians were this far from first
place &QC; (6 1/2 games behind entering Saturday's games), Jeff Treadway
and Felix Fermin were their double-play combination, Junior Ortiz
was their catcher, Wayne Kirby their right fielder and Sam Horn
their designated hitter. Candy Maldonado and Randy Milligan were on
the team, and Manny Ramirez was there as a September callup. Dave
Mlicki and Bob Milacki were on the pitching staff, as was Jason
Grimsley, now with the Yankees. Jose Mesa was in his last season as
a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The season was 1993, and the Indians finished it a season-high
19 games from first place. The farthest the Indians have been from
first since that year was four games in 1994. In the past three
years their biggest deficits totaled five games.
</P>
<P>
   Striking Out at Sosa
</P>
<P>
   In what has become an orchestrated or an impromptu campaign to
denigrate Sammy Sosa _ in some instances to try to demonstrate why
the Yankees should not trade for him _ much has been made of the
frequency of his strikeouts and his weight. Sosa might have become
chubbier, but he is really not striking out at any greater rate
than he has in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game, Sosa had struck out 72 times in 255
times at bat, or once for every 3.54 times at bat. In his 66-homer
season in 1998, he struck out once for every 3.76 at-bats, and last
season his ratio was 1 or every 3.65. In each of those seasons he
struck out 171 times. In 1997, he struck out 174 times, or once for
every 3.69 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to bat this season the approximate number of times he
did in those seasons and continue striking out at this season's
ratio, he would finish the season with 179. That would be a
negligible increase in frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's SOS _ Same Old Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's Dozen
</P>
<P>
   It took Mike Morgan nearly two and a half months, but he finally
extended one of his major league records to 12 teams last week.
When he started for Arizona and lost to Los Angeles, it marked the
12th team with which he has lost games. Morgan, who is 40 years
old, has played for more teams than any other player in any major
sports league (12), and he has won games for more teams than any
other major league pitcher. The Diamondbacks became No. 11 when
Morgan gained a victory in relief in April.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman, a Morgan teammate last season with Texas, has
allowed 22 earned runs and 24 runs over all in 29 games and 28 2/3
innings. Last season he gave up 23 earned runs and 24 runs over all
in 65 games and 87 and two-thirds innings. Zimmerman, a rookie in
1999, gained a spot on the American League All-Star team and
pitched a hitless, scoreless inning. This year he has gained a
three-day vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Control Problems
</P>
<P>
   When the Atlanta Braves sent John Rocker to the minor leagues
two weeks ago, they said it was for his pitching control, not his
self-control. When he returned to the Braves last week following an
injury to another reliever, he demonstrated that he had not solved
his control problem. He threw six pitches in his first game back,
and all were balls. It remains to be seen if he will demonstrate an
improvement in his self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle, who has had his own problems with self-control,
was sent to the minors in 1991 after he failed to run out a
double-play grounder. That incident occurred a few weeks after he
threw a baseball at a fan in the stands. Did the three-week
demotion have a positive effect on him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it did,'' John Hart, the Indians' general manager,
said. ``Maturity comes at different times. At that point in his
career, I remember very clearly Albert was young and struggling at
the major league level. He had the incident with the fan and he
didn't run out two or three balls. He wasn't playing well. It was a
message to Albert. When he came back, he became a poster child.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove, a coach at Cleveland who became the manager 10
days after Belle returned to the Indians, said the outfielder was
different when he rejoined the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always intense batting,'' Hargrove said, ``but he
played the rest of his game with more intensity. He took his game
in the field more seriously. He was still a work in progress, but
we had something to work with in trying to get him to modify his
outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle was 24 going on 25 at the time. Rocker is 25.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: PEBBLE BEACH'S MOST PRECISE HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ From the tee down near the rocks of
Carmel Bay, you can't see the chasm. All you see is the grassy
horizon of the fairway with the dazzling expanse of Carmel's
crescent beach to the right. Beyond the fairway at the edge of the
chasm, out there about 260 yards, shaggy grass surrounds two small
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger,'' they warn in red. ``Steep cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so steep that, according to Pebble Beach lore, a woman once
tried to commit suicide there by jumping off that cliff. Somehow
she suffered only a broken leg. Another time, the driver of a
fairway mower, realizing he couldn't stop in time, jumped off the
mower just before it plunged into the chasm.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet down at the bottom of the chasm, surf slaps
against the rocks and slides up the sand. Across the chasm, five
yawning bunkers and thick rough surround the sloping green of this
418-yard eighth hole at Pebble Beach, where Tiger Woods is trying
to win his first U.S. Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the most photographed hole at Pebble Beach, but it's
the most precise hole, the most demanding, the most threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way the second shot sets up there,'' Jack Nicklaus
said before this Open started, ``it's my favorite shot in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the shots that the best golfer in history has assessed,
he calls this shot to the eighth green his favorite. Pebble Beach
ought to plant a plaque with that rave review on it somewhere on
the edge of the chasm with those two danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   But your tee shot must be as precise as that second shot over
the chasm. Hit your tee shot too far and you don't have a second
shot. If your ball is not down in the chasm, it is in the rough
near one of those danger signs with nowhere to stand.
</P>
<P>
   In what the 60-year-old Nicklaus, the four-time champion, later
announced was his last Open round after a record 44 Opens, his tee
shot there Friday went too far into that rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 3-wood off the tee and I cut it up in the wind a
little bit to kill it, but it went too long by about a foot,'' he
said after an 82. ``I took a drop, then I hit a 7-iron 20 feet
short of the hole and it looked like it landed on a highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus later agreed that his double-bogey 6 there just about
finished his hope of making the 36-hole cut. But no matter which
way the wind is blowing, that chasm creates a decision for every
golfer as to what club to use on the tee.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Kite, how he played the eighth hole in the final round
of the 1992 Open probably made the difference in his winning.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, in a duel for the lead with Jeff Sluman, arrived at the
eighth tee after a surprising birdie 2 on the 106-yard seventh hole
when his wedge from the rough scooted across the green and into the
cup. On the tee, pumped up by that birdie and with a wild wind at
his back, Kite was fingering the 3-iron in his bag until his
caddie, Mike Carrick, spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the 4,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the 3,'' Kite suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the 4,'' Carrick repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far is the cliff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-sixty,'' the caddie said.
</P>
<P>
   Kite paused, nodded, yanked the 4-iron and hit it. When he
walked up the hill to the fairway, he saw his ball perched about
five yards short of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice call,'' Kite told his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   Had Kite hit the 3-iron, his ball would probably have
disappeared into the chasm along with his opportunity to win what
turned out to be his only major title. But with a par at the
eighth, Kite went on to shoot 72 for a three-under-par 285, two
strokes ahead of Sluman.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Gil Morgan arrived at the eighth tee at 12 under
for the tournament, the first golfer in Open history to be in
double figures under par. After a good tee shot, Morgan's iron over
the chasm flew into the back bunker. He flubbed his explosion shot,
chipped long and two-putted for a double-bogey 6 on his way to a
77.
</P>
<P>
   With an 81 in the final round, Morgan skidded to a tie for 13th.
The eighth hole had wrecked him.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 Open, Nicklaus had a par at the eighth in the windy
final round and went on to win by three strokes. But in the 1982
Open, which Nicklaus lost by two strokes to Tom Watson, he had a
costly bogey there after a run of five consecutive birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second shot landed in what they called `the character,' the
rough that was this high,'' the Golden Bear recalled, pointing to
his knees. ``I was only about 12 feet from the hole and I swung as
hard as I could, but I barely got it out. Bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Watson saved par at the eighth with an 8-foot
putt. In the third round, Watson had birdied the eighth with a
4-wood and a 5-iron to about 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse, something always seems to happen in the
Open at Pebble Beach's eighth hole where that chasm demands a
precise tee shot. Far, but not too far. Not too close to those
either of those two danger signs and certainly not into the chasm. &QL;

 &HT;    Hurdler's path to mental health takes toll on speed
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a pleasant, late August night in 1996, in a hotel
room of the Ramada Cap`d'ail outside Monte Carlo, the face that
only weeks earlier at the Atlanta Olympics wore a gold-medal smile
was buried in a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Crying in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Adkins should have been having the time of his young
life, fending off admirers in a glamorous European hot spot as a
freshly minted Olympic 400-meter hurdles champion. Instead, he was
restless and sad.
</P>
<P>
   He could not muster the strength to abandon his tiny room and
join his training partners for dinner. Instead, he dialed room
service and ordered a bottle of white wine. He drank it fast.
Finally, he dozed off and found temporary escape from his
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was building up and building up,'' Adkins says. ``When I
got to the hotel that day, for some reason, everything just
crashed. It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungover and dehydrated, Adkins flew with other track athletes
to Berlin the next day. He was poised to split $250,000 with five
others if he took his specialty, the 400-meter hurdles, which he
had won earlier at three prestigious European stops.
</P>
<P>
   He came home a badly beaten third _ and lost what would have
been his biggest payday.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. Adkins knew he needed help.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF DEPRESSION EARLY ON
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on Long Island, Derrick graduated in the top 5
percent of his high school class. He was an accomplished drummer
and member of the all-county band. His father, Earl, a
physical-education teacher and once a hurdler at Morgan State,
introduced the lanky youngster to the 400-meter hurdles. By his
senior year, Derrick was the No. 1 schoolboy hurdler in America.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Carole, recalls seeing Derrick cry as a youngster
only twice. But Derrick remembers sad days, days when he wanted to
be alone. When he was 9 or 10, he would go off by himself and cry
for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Georgia Tech in the fall of 1988, he was
versed in warding off the valleys of depression. He occupied his
mind with a tiresome academic load, majoring in mechanical
engineering and making the dean's list, all while training as a
world-class athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he undertook became an obsession. When he wasn't
training, he buried himself in his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, that is what kept me going _ the work,'' he said.
``I was very driven, very motivated. It was almost like an
obsession. Actually, depression is related to obsession. So, a lot
of people who suffer depression become obsessants. My obsession was
training, running fast, getting good grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why, once I graduated, depression started to sink in.
The track was kind of like my escape from the depression.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Adkins was the best hurdler in the world , the Olympic
favorite _ but his life had become a private hell.
</P>
<P>
   He began experiencing paranoia and insomnia, often going two and
three nights with little or no sleep. He lost his appetite and shed
17 pounds, down to a frail 170.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins always had been a savage worker, one of the most intense
lifters in the weight room. But he began tearing himself down as he
trained, getting weaker and slower.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about commiting suicide, about buying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had never touched alcohol before, he tried drowning
his depression by drinking in his Midtown home, where his gold
medal now sits on a living room shelf amid trophies and a
photograph of him with former South African President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   He ventured to clubs and went through multiple relationships
with women. By the spring of 1996, with the Olympic Trials lurking,
his track workouts suffered, and the edge was coming off his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   UNWILLING TO REVEAL HIS DISPAIR
</P>
<P>
   Adkins didn't tell a soul what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought I was a such a happy person, that I had my
life together,'' he says. ``I didn't want them to think otherwise.
I would smile when I was in public, and I would put on an act.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was by myself, I would be extremely down. Sometimes I
would just sit in my house in the dark, just thinking about what
was wrong with me. I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know
what.''
</P>
<P>
   One sleepless night in April, thumbing through the telephone
yellow pages and praying that God would lead him, his eyes came
upon a small ad for Dr. Casandra Wanzo.
</P>
<P>
   He soon worked up the courage to visit her office. Dr. Wanzo
diagnosed his condition as clinical depression and prescribed the
antidepressant drug Luvox.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wanzo, a fair-skinned, African-American woman with long
thick braids, says she realized almost immediately that Adkins was
suffering from a major depressive disorder _ not the normal mood
swings or reactive depression brought on by an experience such as
divorce, but a biological phenomenon influenced by brain
biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was affecting his energy level,'' she said. ``His appetite
had decreased. He had a loss of motivation and desire to do things
_ loss of ability to get pleasure out of life. He had crying
spells. He even had some suicidal thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Adkins shared the secret with his coach, Grover
Hinsdale. The coach had been bewildered by Adkins' lagging
workouts, but didn't know the reason. He had sent him to a
nutritionist. He sent him for blood work. The tests came back fine.
</P>
<P>
   Then after one April practice, Hinsdale sat transfixed in his
office as Adkins offered a chilling account of his depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he drank a bottle of wine and locked himself out of
the apartment, broke a window to get back in,'' Hinsdale said.
``Derrick doesn't even drink. This is a totally top-shelf young
man. Clean-cut. Hard working. Takes care of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he told me the story, I couldn't have sunk any lower in
my chair. I knew then that this was more than just, `I don't feel
well.' But at least we knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   MOM'S INTUITION ON TARGET
</P>
<P>
   Hinsdale encouraged Adkins to tell his parents.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, a federal-court clerk in Brooklyn, already had an
inkling. After a weekend visit to Atlanta the previous fall, she
jotted down in her business diary: ``Derrick seems depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adkins came home the last weekend in April, he appeared wan
and weary coming down the escalator at LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skin was ashen, pale,'' she remembers. ``He has high
cheekbones, but his cheeks were sunken in. He looked terrible. I'm
saying to myself, `What is going on?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got in the car he told me he had been sick, but that
he was all right now. That he was suffering from depression.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adkins didn't tell anyone when he brazenly stopped taking
the medication just weeks later. He stayed off the drug all summer,
because it made him feel lackadaisical and inhibited his
performance slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins didn't want to let anything interfere with his
performance, not with a gold medal up for grabs in Atlanta. Not
after 1992, when a badly sprained ankle cost him a sure spot in the
Barcelona Olympics. Not after a late-race fall that cost him an
NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   He made it through the Atlanta Games on adrenaline and an
Olympic focus. Skipping his medication ``was a scary thing to do,''
he says, ``but I was so obsessed with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a gold medal was so important. I said, `I'm just going
to beat this without medication _ mind over matter or whatever.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel depression setting back in for a while. In May
and June, I was just so enthralled with the Olympics, plus it was
here in Atlanta. All the excitement surrounding the Olympics
drowned out pretty much everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics was like a surreal experience that came and went.
It definitely was a highlight of my life. And, of course, I wasn't
depressed after I won the gold medal, but, several weeks after, it
started to set in.''
</P>
<P>
   And that night in Monte Carlo, he learned he no longer could
withhold medicine from his disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't live like that,'' he says. ``I would win a race,
but that would only last for a few hours before my body would sink
into depression. Most of the time I just felt terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   DRASTIC DROPOFF ON THE TRACK
</P>
<P>
   Today, properly medicated, Adkins isn't the hurdler of old,
although he trains with the same passion and still dreams of
competing in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He is back in school, studying for his master's degree in
divinity at the Atlanta-based Christian Life School of Theology. He
has come forward to share his experience in hopes of helping others
afflicted with the disease. Next month, he will release a
self-published inspirational book, ``Let's All Get High.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the track, Adkins is a lagging shadow of the figure who
just a few years ago aspired to the longevity of hurdling icon
Edwin Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes have fallen so quickly. Adkins sank from world and
Olympic gold medalist to a No. 8 world ranking in 1997 to complete
absence from the rankings the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The year after the Olympics, he failed to make the finals in the
World Championships. Last summer, Adkins failed even to make the
U.S. team. His major shoe sponsor, Reebok, dumped him.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that his struggles have cost him ``hundreds of
thousands of dollars.'' On his 1999 tax return, he reported a
$26,000 loss _ after making more than $300,000 in the Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   His personal best time in the 400 hurdles is 47.54. He thinks
that he could have gotten down to 47-flat during the lost years _
and still might, if he gets his brain chemistry straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that there are athletes out there using drugs to
make themselves faster,'' he said. ``I have to run against those
same athletes, and my medication is making me slower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard when people say, `You're the Olympic
champion; how come you can't run well?' I didn't want to tell them
my problems. But I don't want people to think it was a fluke or
that I've taken it easy, because I train just as hard as I ever
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassment was its worst in 1998, when the Goodwill Games
were held on Long Island. Adkins grew up 4 miles from the Uniondale
track on a street the Lakeview townsfolk named for him after his
victory in Atlanta, Derrick Adkins Lane. His parents hired a
caterer to throw a barbecue for 300 or so friends at a local state
park. Later that night, they all had tickets to see Derrick run.
</P>
<P>
   And he did, coming home dead last.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends were there,'' Adkins said. ``It was really
hard. I decided to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't run again that season, but his sister Dianne pleaded
with him not to abandon the sport. She had been a New York high
school sprint champion and an inspiration. Her own running career
was halted while she battled ovarian cancer in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really took her words to heart, because of what she had been
through,'' he said. ``In some ways, she was living vicariously
through me, because she was such a great track athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   SIDE EFFECTS HURT PERFORMANCE
</P>
<P>
   But can the kid brother run fast again?
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by his mother, Adkins juggles the drugs like a chemist,
researching the Internet and medical journals for a way to balance
the side effects.
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of the drugs is a weakening and stiffening of
tendons, and Adkins thinks that it has caused his nagging hamstring
and Achilles' injuries. He can run with those injuries, but what he
can't overcome is the fatigue that settles in earlier during speed
workouts and races.
</P>
<P>
   The influence on performance might be only 5 percent. But a mere
second or two often is the difference between first and last over
the 10 hurdles of the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hold the speed, and I can't run as fast,'' he said.
``The first five hurdles, I used to run very fast. I was so fast
that I would be able to do that and last. Now, I can run the first
five hurdles just as fast, but it is a struggle to do so. I use up
so much energy that I have no energy for later in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't get fatigued until around the eighth hurdle.
On the medication, I might start to get fatigued around the third
hurdle. It's just very hard to hold on after that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's bad enough in a single race. It's a career-killer in top
competitions like the Olympic trials or the Olympic Games because
in qualifying rounds an athlete has three races in three days.
</P>
<P>
   But Adkins has learned that anti-depressants decrease blood
protein and cause dehydration. So he has become compulsive about
drinking fluids and has significantly upgraded his ``college diet''
to a low carbohydrate and high protein diet. He also consumes
liquid amino-acid supplements, which help offset protein deficiency
triggered by his anti-depressant drug.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL APPROACH SUFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Some days, Hinsdale accepts that the medication takes away
Adkins' edge. Other days, he can't help but wonder whether some of
the fatigue is in Adkins' head _ whether he cautiously holds
something back, a reflex from too many races when he really was
beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins concedes that it has become more mental than physical. He
acknowledges that his confidence never has been lower. What he
won't do is risk everything for another gold medal. Instead, he
works for some sort of harmonious balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My emotional well-being off the track is much more
important,'' he said. ``I would love to be able to run fast and
have emotional stability off the track as well. And I have never
had that. In '94 and '95, almost every time I stepped on the track,
I would win. The same was true the summer of '96, but during those
years I didn't have any emotional stability off the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then after those years, I have been very happy off the track,
but I haven't been able to run too well. It's been a tradeoff, and
I would like to have both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely believe I'll be able to do it,'' Adkins said. ``If
I didn't, I wouldn't be running anymore. I would just move on to
something else.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marion Jones' attempt to win five gold medals at the 2000 Summer
Olympics has received a potentially severe challenge. Jackie
Joyner-Kersee has entered the long jump at the Olympic trials next
month, apparently deciding to come out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, who is 38, twice won gold medals in the Olympic
heptathlon and once won the Olympic long jump competition. She owns
the U.S. record in the women's long jump at 24 feet 7 inches. Her
last jump before retiring in 1998 was 20-11}.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there's a 75 percent possibility that she'll
compete,'' Greg Foster, Joyner-Kersee's agent, said in remarks
released by organizers of the Olympic trials. ``She is training and
she's in shape. The important thing is that she wants to be
competitive in the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose longest jump is 23-11}, has struggled this season.
If Joyner-Kersee regains her form, it will put tremendous pressure
on Jones to gain one of the three spots on the U.S. Olympic team.

A MULTIPLE GOLD-MEDAL PROSPECT WAS BORN TO SWIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boy arrived in the United States at age 13, and English for
him seemed like an unsolvable puzzle. He knew some of the words,
but he could not put them together. It would be four years before
he felt confident enough around strangers to assemble it all into
any real conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming was different. The flint of a young boy's talent had
sparked the flame of a promising career back in Odessa, Ukraine.
Lenny Krayzelburg had flourished in the former Soviet system. He
entered an army-sponsored club at kindergarten age and, by 9, he
was put into a school with other swimmers and was given training
lessons twice a day. From 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week, he and
44 other swimmers remained together, taking lessons in the pool, in
the classroom, in the pool again.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Krayzelburg won age-group medals at the national army
championships. His coach, Vitaly Ovakimian, told his father: ``Your
son can be a great athlete. He was born to be a backstroker.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was right, but of course, he could not have known that
Krayzelburg's career would take a route far more circuitous than
the exhaustive, tedious back and forth of a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg did become a great athlete, setting world records in
the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke, establishing himself as a
multiple gold-medal favorite for the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia. But he would first have to find a new country
that was politically stable and hospitable to his Jewish faith, a
new language and a new resolve to succeed in Los Angeles, a place
famous for its beaches and water but one that offers few training
opportunities for an elite swimmer in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate enough to learn from my parents about hard
work and dedication and committing yourself to a certain thing and
following it all the way to the end,'' Krayzelburg said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at breakfast, fueling an athletic furnace that burns
5,000 calories a day. At 6 feet 2 inches and 180 pounds, the
24-year-old athlete is movie-star handsome. With slicked-back hair,
he is often compared to Pat Riley, the basketball coach and
clotheshorse.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a seriousness about the voice and face of
Krayzelburg, a gravity in the squint of his eyes, that more closely
resembles the visage of the newsman Eric Sevareid. He has a degree
in finance from the University of Southern California, and he
speaks in complex terms about his life in the former Soviet Union,
a life that is infused with tones of gray, not simply black and
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up a lot of good growing up in the Soviet system,
training so hard and intense at a young age,'' Krayzelburg said.
``When I got older, I realized they wanted us to train so hard, and
to commit to something and to dedicate our whole lives to it,
because that's what it took. There are no shortcuts if you want to
accomplish something. These are the things I carried on in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   The late 1980s were a time of opening under the former Soviet
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. According to Krayzelburg, his father,
Oleg, who managed a state-owned coffee shop, also had a small,
privatized food business. His mother, Yelena, was a bookkeeper at a
shoe factory. The army-sponsored school he attended gave him
vouchers for free meals. The family lived in a three-bedroom
apartment, and even though he had to share a bedroom with his
younger sister, Marsha, and relatives sometimes swelled the
occupancy to eight people, ``financially, we were above average,''
Lenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Other concerns, though, would convince the family to leave for
the United States. The Soviet Union had also been engaged in a
protracted war in Afghanistan, and Krayzelburg's parents worried
that Lenny would be called into some dangerous conflict when he
turned 18. His parents also worried about anti-Semitism that
carried well beyond name-calling in the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to leave; we wanted a better life for our kids,''
Yelena Krayzelburg said. ``We saw the discrimination around us. If
Russian kid wants to go to university, they cut the number of
Jewish kids getting higher education. When you fill out an
application for a job, and they ask for your nationality and they
find out you are Jewish, they try not to hire you.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was the army. At that time, it was the Afghanistan
war, something very scary. We were afraid about Lenny.''
</P>
<P>
   The family applied for immigration, and in 1988, on Christmas
Day, when Lenny was 13 and the Eastern bloc was a year from
collapse, the Krayzelburgs departed for the new world, first to
Vienna, then Rome, finally arriving in West Hollywood, Calif., on
March 14, 1989. The family lived briefly with friends who sponsored
them, then found their own place. English was elusive, money was
tight. Oleg Krayzelburg took a job as a cook in a Russian
restaurant, and Yelena found employment at a pharmacy. For Lenny,
life in the United States was exciting, jarring. His father
insisted that he continue his swimming career. But where?
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of pools in Pasadena, and out in the San
Fernando Valley, or down in Orange County, but few in urban Los
Angeles. There was not even a swim team at Fairfax High, which he
attended. For a year, Krayzelburg took a 50-minute bus ride each
way to train at Santa Monica City College. He could swim only once
a day, not twice as he had done in Odessa, and the ennui of
insufficient training and public transportation sapped his
conditioning, draining his desire to continue in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Bored, he wanted to quit. ``This would be a bad thing to do,''
his father told him. ``You put in so many years in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to train closer to his home, Krayzelburg settled on the
Westside Jewish Community Center, which had a 25-yard indoor pool,
half the size of an Olympic pool. On Fridays, Krayzelburg said, the
pool was dedicated to recreational swimmers, so the elite group
trained in what amounted to a glorified sauna, 10 to 15 yards long,
where the water was about 100 degrees and 3 feet deep and toddlers
were taught their first strokes. Still, the center offered him a
job working 15 to 20 hours a week as a lifeguard, and he continued
to train there through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rejuventated myself at Westside,'' Krayzelburg said. But he
could train only 90 minutes a day, four days a week. ``I saw no
potential,'' he said. ``I knew what I had done in Russia. It would
be impossible to accomplish something like that here.''
</P>
<P>
   During the spring of 1993, his senior year in high school,
Krayzelburg went to Santa Monica City College, where he had first
trained, to pre-enroll for classes the next fall. He stopped by the
office of the swim coach, Stu Blumkin, who offered to let him train
there in the morning, before his classes at Fairfax High. But,
Blumkin thought to himself: ``Fairfax doesn't even have a swim
team. How fast could this kid be?''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he would know.
</P>
<P>
   Despite working 30 hours a week at the West Hollywood Recreation
Department, Krayzelburg won the 1994 California state junior
college championship in the 100- and 200-yard backstroke, setting a
national junior college record in the 200. Several months earlier,
Blumkin said, he wrote a note to himself, sealed it in an envelope
and had a friend sign it for authentication. ``He'll be one of the
best swimmers in the world,'' Blumkin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Just before that 1994 junior college meet, Blumkin called Mark
Schubert, who coaches swimming at USC and will be the 2000 Olympic
men's coach. ``I have this backstroker who's going to win the state
championship next week,'' Blumkin said. ``I'd like to bring him in
and meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schubert got plenty of these calls. ``Yeah, yeah,'' he thought.
But Krayzelburg did win the state meet and, later that summer, he
shaved nine seconds off his personal best in the 200-meter
backstroke. Schubert offered him a scholarship to USC. ``You've got
the tools,'' Schubert told the swimmer. ``If you're willing to
work, you can be the best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is he believed me,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg and his family became U.S. citizens in 1995, and a
year later he finished fifth in the 200-meter backstroke at the
1996 Olympic trials. Now he owns six of the 10 fastest times in the
event, including the world record of 1 minute 55.87 seconds, as
well as the world mark at 100 meters in 53.60. He is a heavy
favorite to win both events in Sydney. Blumkin has since opened his
sealed forecast of Krayzelburg's greatness, which makes him the
Karnak the Magnificent of the swimming set.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the track, if you watch a horse walk, you won't see
anything special,'' Blumkin said. ``But the minute you see him
gallop, you know. Like the jockeys always say, `The horse has his
mind on business.' That's Lenny. First one in the pool, last one
out. Same thing in the weight room. He pushes everyone else up
another level.'' &QL;

NASCAR CRASH STUDY LEADS TO SAFETY TIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often they are able to walk away. Occasionally they cannot.
NASCAR officials last week had to review videotape of yet another
horrific accident. The latest involved Elliott Sadler, a
25-year-old in only his second full season in the Winston Cup
Series.
</P>
<P>
   In practice before last week's race in Brooklyn, Mich., Sadler's
No. 21 Ford incurred a cut right rear tire, apparently from debris.
That spun the car into a rear-first position and, with the
horsepower-stuffed engine still wildly churning out RPM, it soon
was airborne. Landing, the car rolled an estimated 12 times,
winding up on its roof in a crumpled heap.
</P>
<P>
   As the smoking remains of Sadler's car sat on Turn 2, and
workers rushed to pry him out, his chances of survival appeared in
question. Yet he emerged with only a puffy right knee, and some
contusions and scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   As the NASCAR world knows all too well, Adam Petty was not as
fortunate. The 19-year-old, fourth-generation driver was killed
during practice at New Hampshire International Speedway last month,
after his car hit a wall. His popularity _ combined with the
stature of his family in NASCAR _ virtually ensures that the
chilling effect of his death will hang over the racing association
for years.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is forever reviewing its safety rules, according to Gary
Nelson, the Winston Cup series director. But the reality is that
individual teams generally go beyond what is mandated, to give
their drivers an enhanced sense of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams pad the bar to the left of the driver's head. Others
use netting designed to keep the head stabilized. Most drivers
prefer a full face mask, which helps one's safety but severely
limits peripheral vision, requiring more help from spotters. Nelson
said that even engineers could not agree which one was best, so
NASCAR made it optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to do more, you've got to approach it like a
doctor,'' he said. ``You don't want to do harm with the cure.''
</P>
<P>
   At Daytona Beach, Fla., last February, Geoffrey Bodine's vehicle
in the truck series was hit multiple times and sheared off more
than 100 feet of catch fence before exploding. Nothing was left of
the vehicle but a mangled cage, yet Bodine survived.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed one of Bodine's arms flailing around as his truck
grotesquely kept rolling. He later said that arm restraints would
have prevented him from breaking a wrist and sustaining numerous
arm contusions, and he has since incorporated them.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine credited a full face mask with limiting his injuries.
Even so, you will not find Dale Earnhardt, the seven-time Winston
Cup champion, wearing one. He likes to utilize his peripheral
vision too much.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, it is clear now, benefited from new, unyielding safety
belts. Previous ones had been known to stretch in extreme
situations.
</P>
<P>
   As he was rolling over, Sadler said his first thought was
staying alive. ``I didn't know you could do so much praying in such
a short amount of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's action shifts to the flat, 2.5-mile triangle at
Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa., a comment by the rookie Dale
Earnhardt Jr. highlights how the Winston Cup Series has become more
populated with youthful drivers, which means less-experienced
drivers who are maybe more error-prone.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr., 25, had never driven a car at Pocono, which
requires significant acclimation because of three distinctively
different corners and a long stretch necessitating the shifting of
gears, until a lone practice two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He has won two races this year but admitted his learning curve
is steep at the Pennsylvania track. ``We're really going to be
rookies this week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd Without a Victory
</P>
<P>
   In a year of parity, Ricky Rudd is struggling to find his share
of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup series has had 12 different winners this season,
and the last time that happened was in 1994. With 20 races left,
Rudd is conspicuously among the non-winners.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the megabucks Robert Yates Racing this year appeared to
be a wonderful development for Rudd, competitive even as an
underfunded driver-owner trying to do things his way. Still, the
Virginian, ranked No. 8, is the only driver among the top 10 in
points who has yet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd had a chance in Michigan, but two atypical things happened
in the last half of the race: his right-rear window fell out during
a pit stop, and a later stop left him with a loose lug nut.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Joe Gibbs, the former NFL coach, appears on the way
to a dream season with his two teams. Bobby Labonte leads the
points race and is Pocono's defending champion, and second-year
driver Tony Stewart has moved to seventh in the standings on the
strength of consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Going Far to Improve
</P>
<P>
   The extremes to which teams will go to maximize their
performance seem unlimited. Struggling A.J. Foyt Racing took its
No. 14 car to Canada for important wind-tunnel testing after
Sunday's race in Michigan. Meanwhile, the team's transporter headed
to North Carolina to pick up the necessary engines and parts. Then
they were to rendezvous in a hotel parking lot to make final
adjustments for the team's Pocono qualifying effort. &QL;

 &HT;    Immigrants strengthening Big Labor's political clout
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Miguel Contreras was expecting a big crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the labor federation for the county's unions,
Contreras for weeks had been exhorting union leaders to turn out
their members for an AFL-CIO immigration forum June 10.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the forum, Contreras revised his attendance
estimate from 5,000 to 8,000. The day before the event, organizers
confidently predicted 10,000 union workers from across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time he took the stage at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena, even Contreras was overwhelmed by what he saw: 17,000 people
packed to the rafters. Another 3,000 to 4,000 stood outside, locked
out by fire marshals.
</P>
<P>
   They came, for the most part, from Los Angeles. But they
identified their countries of origin with black and white signs:
Mexico, El Salvador, Panama, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru. In their
hands, they held plastic American flags, placed on the seats before
they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raise up your flags to show this country that we belong!''
Contreras shouted to the crowd. For a few moments, the sea of faces
became a shimmering blur of red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the birth of a powerful new alliance,'' an
ecstatic Contreras declared afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of setbacks and decline, organized labor is riding
a wave of new growth and resurgent political clout. Last year,
under the leadership of AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, unions
posted their biggest membership gains since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Unions organized 600,000 workers in 1999 _ most of them in the
service industry and in government. Fifteen percent, or 91,000 new
members, were organized in Los Angeles County alone, including the
single biggest organizing campaign since 1938 _ the unionization of
74,000 home health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of labor's surge is coming from new immigrants,
particularly Latinos, who are settling in regions as diverse as
Gainesville, Ga., and Milwaukee, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's bid to organize new immigrants is most pronounced in Los
Angeles, where Latinos are 44 percent of the region's 9.3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Latino union membership increased 3.7 percent last
year _ the most of any ethnic group _ and more Latinos belong to
unions now than in any time in labor history.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the alliance between organized labor and Latinos
is poised to deliver the biggest payoff to Vice President Gore and
House minority leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   Gore already enjoys an advantage over Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas among California's expanding Latino population, and the
manpower that organized labor can deliver in Los Angeles, home to
800,000 union workers, will be a potent one-two punch in the fight
for California's 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the labor unions here have targeted 17 campaigns for
the city council, state legislature and Congress and won all but
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Labor-backed candidates to the California state assembly helped
Democrats reclaim the chamber in 1996. In 1998, a strong turnout
from labor, particularly in Los Angeles and among Latinos, helped
elect Gov. Gray Davis, the first Democrat elected to the post in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Cabrera, a 27-year-old janitor who came to Los Angeles
from El Salvador 16 years ago, was a foot soldier in the '98
campaign, working the streets of her neighborhood on Davis' behalf.
Not yet a U.S. citizen, she cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we can't participate,'' said Cabrera,
who earns $7.02 an hour cleaning office buildings. ``There is no
reason why we can't tell those who can vote to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the county federation plans to deploy thousands of
workers such as Cabrera to help defeat three House Republicans in
Los Angeles _ half the seats the Democrats need to regain the
House. Those targeted are Reps. James Rogan, Steve Horn and Steven
Kuykendall, who carried their districts in 1998 with no more than
53 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders here notched their first congressional victory of
the year in the March 7 California primary. Democratic state Sen.
Hilda Solis, a labor-backed candidate, defeated Rep. Matthew
Martinez (D-Calif.), an 18-year incumbent whom labor leaders viewed
as being soft on their issues, despite a strong labor voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also targeted Martinez to send a pointed political
message, Contreras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show all elected officials that we put them in
and we can take them out,'' said Contreras. ``We've shown over the
last four years that we can put them in. But we've never shown that
we can take you out, until this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty fingernail work.'' That's what David Sickler calls
political campaigns, union style. Sickler, southern regional
director of the California Building and Construction Trades
Council, was labor's point man in the Solis campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Over a six-week period before the election, he coordinated
nearly 1,000 union volunteers, who called every one of the 17,000
labor union households in Martinez's district.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, dozens of union members canvassed neighborhoods,
knocking on doors and talking to voters about Solis, who championed
a California ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, about 60 union volunteers were up before dawn
distributing ``door hangers,'' printed literature on Solis that
provided the address of the voters' local polling place. By day's
end, 600 volunteers _ half union members _ walked precincts for
Solis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our affiliates have a very good record of turning out
bodies and getting up early,'' said Sickler. ``They are used to
getting up at 5:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost 2-to-1, becoming the only Democratic incumbent to
lose this year.
</P>
<P>
   Solis' victory was the culmination of a four-year strategy by
Contreras to spend union money on mobilizing union members to vote
instead of contributing directly to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the elected officials that the L.A. County Federation
of Labor is not now going to be an ATM machine for political
parties,'' said Contreras. ``What we have is our rank and file.''
</P>
<P>
   The political and organizing victories have made Los Angeles the
poster child of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John Sweeney is really looking to California to lead
the American labor movement,'' said Kent Wong, a labor expert at
UCLA.ORGANIZATION REJUVENATED
</P>
<P>
   When John Sweeney assumed the reins of the 13 million member
AFL-CIO in late 1995, organized labor was in a tailspin. Union
workers in the work force, which peaked in the 1950s at 35 percent,
was plummeting toward single digits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republicans won control of the House for the first time
in four decades, and new House Speaker Newt Gingrich targeted Big
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Newt Gingrich did anything good for us, he scared the hell
out of us,'' said Sweeney, who built his campaign to succeed former
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland around labor's thumping in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sweeney, the AFL-CIO poured resources into helping the 68
member unions organize new workers. Sweeney also renewed the
AFL-CIO's emphasis on grass-roots activism and registering union
members to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed under Sweeney is a much more aggressive
effort in swing congressional districts with high levels of union
membership,'' said Richard Hurd, a labor expert at Cornell
University.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has also encouraged unions to raise more political money
from members. This month, the Service Employees International
Union, the AFL-CIO's largest, gave an eye-popping $1 million check
to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are just tired of not seeing any action on
prescription drugs, on the minimum wage, on expanding access to
health care,'' said Andrew Stern, SEIU's president.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of organized labor's sharpest critics give Sweeney
credit for helping to halve the Republican House majority in 1996,
and halving it again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeney is a tough competitor,'' said Bruce Josten, an
executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Anybody
who ignores him is a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney was also among the first within the AFL-CIO to recognize
the potential for union growth among immigrants. In February, the
AFL-CIO reversed long-standing policy and embraced a call for
amnesty for the nation's 5 million to 6 million undocumented aliens
and an end to the sanctions against employers who hire them.
</P>
<P>
   The new platform is a dramatic turnaround for organized labor,
which historically regarded immigrants as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real fear, I think, amongst a lot of workers
about losing jobs,'' said John Wilhelm, general president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union, who spearheaded the
policy change. ``On the other hand, if you look at our history, the
labor movement was built by immigrants. It's going to be rebuilt by
immigrants or not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, the 66-year-old son of Irish immigrants whose first
union job was in a New York City cemetery, found an instant ally
for his national vision in Contreras, one of six children born to
migrant farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, 47, cut his teeth in the labor movement as a grape
picker in California's San Joaquin Valley, falling under the
charismatic spell of the late Cesar Chavez, the founder of the
United Farm Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras said he mastered the nuances of political power from
Chavez, whose giant portrait hangs behind his desk. From Chavez,
Contreras learned that even the poorest of the poor can wield power
if they join ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In his four years at the Los Angeles federation, which covers
350 local unions, Contreras has beefed up union organizing,
particularly among Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   He has also reached out to officials in the Catholic church such
as Cardinal Roger Mahony, who wield tremendous moral authority
among Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras has also brought the militancy he learned with Chavez
to the federation's political work, seeking ``warriors for working
families,'' those candidates who pledge to fight for labor's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to hear in our endorsement hearings that somehow
we should support you because your grandfather belonged to a
union,'' he said. ``Don't come to us and tell me you are for
minimum wage because that's an insult. That for us is like saying
you are for the American flag. It's automatic. But what are you
going to do to assist our workers in organizing? Are you willing to
demonstrate, to visit owners, to help pass tough legislation giving
the workers the right to organize? That's what we are interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the November elections, Contreras is already looking
ahead to next year's Los Angeles city elections, when the mayor and
half the 15-member City Council stand for election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to determine the political direction of Los
Angeles for decades to come, so it will be our No. 1 task,''
Contreras said. ``We will move heaven and earth to make sure that
our candidates win that election.''

YACHT IS A WORK OF ART IN RACE TO BERMUDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Herb McCormick is the editor of Cruising World magazine.)  
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, in a stiff southwesterly breeze over Rhode Island
Sound, 175 yachts answered the starting guns to begin the 42nd
running of the Newport-Bermuda Race. Among the boats competing for
top prizes were such modern thoroughbreds as Larry Ellison's
Sayonara, Jim Dolan's Sagamore and George Coumantaros' Boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   With a forecast of high pressure and light winds in the waters
off Bermuda, the prospect of a relatively easy but slow contest _
particularly for the smaller yachts _ appeared likely. But one of
the boats competing in this year's classic division, though not a
threat to the large, light front-runners, had already tasted glory
in a heavy-air edition of the race more than six decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, in gusts of over 40 knots, the newly launched 53-foot
cutter Kirawan won the 635-mile biennial ocean race. Built in
Brooklyn for Robert P. Baruch, a member of the Manhasset Bay Yacht
Club, Kirawan launched the prestigious career of the yacht designer
Philip Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Kirawan eventually moved to California, and in 1993 the film
producer Sandy Horowitz purchased her and began an extensive refit
under the direction of Tom Adams, a sailor and woodworker. ``I gave
Tom carte blanche to do the work, and he took this on heart and
soul,'' Horowitz said. ``Some people see boats as inanimate objects
but this one has a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a rebuilt interior, hand-cut marble counters and even
a rolltop desk, Kirawan is a work of art. And with a seasoned
seven-man crew that includes John Rousmaniere, the yachting writer,
and John Jourdane, the former Whitbread racer, Kirawan may also
have some surprises for the upstarts. ``The nice thing is that she
really powers through a swell when those modern race boats are
pounding,'' Adams said. ``It's a pretty comfortable ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyon Sails in Record Time
</P>
<P>
   As they head south, some of the sailors in the Bermuda Race may
encounter the leading Open 60 monohulls en route to Newport to
complete the Europe 1 New Man trans-Atlantic race, which started
two weeks ago from Plymouth, England. The first finishers, in what
has been a wild affair, are due to arrive some time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing a 60-foot trimaran called Eure et Loir, the 44-year-old
Frenchman Francis Joyon last Wednesday won the multihull class in
record-setting style with a time of 9 days and 23 hours 21 minutes,
slicing nearly 10 hours off the mark set in 1988. The rugged Joyon
won with an old boat, small mast, tired sails and no sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The story in the monohull class is no less intriguing. At or
near the front of the pack is the 23-year-old English sailor Ellen
MacArthur aboard Kingfisher, who took over the lead a week ago and
has been holding off the challenges of her countryman Mike Golding
and the French sailors Roland Jourdain and Catherine Chabaud.
Italy's Giovanni Soldini was also within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen Open 60s started the race but, after three boats were
dismasted, it became an early war of attrition. MacArthur set a
frenetic pace and exhibited almost flawless tactics while weaving a
course through challenging weather systems.
</P>
<P>
   But she has not had an easy passage. Last week she fell through
a hatch and said, via e-mail: ``Terrible, terrible, terrible night.
Whacked my head and I think broke my finger.'' Later, her progress
came to a stunning halt when she collided with a whale. ``I'm not
sure what I'm more concerned about, the boat or the whale,'' she
reported, adding that the leviathan was probably killed in the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it will take more than a giant sea creature to stop
Ellen MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   A Record Atlantic Crossing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Bahamian island of San Salvador, New Zealand's Grant
Dalton and his crew aboard the 110-foot catamaran Club Med on
Sunday are also due to put the closing touches on a triumphant
trans-Atlantic crossing that started in Cadiz, Spain. The Club Med
team will almost certainly break the record for an east-to-west
Atlantic voyage. More importantly, with a 24-hour run of 625.7
miles last weekend _ an average speed of over 26 knots _ they also
smashed the record of 580 miles set by Steve Fossett's PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first couple of hours we had a confused sea and we
weren't really going that fast,'' Dalton said last week via
satellite phone. ``When we thought we had a chance at the record
our intention was just to get one mile more than Fossett had got.
But when we did that with two hours to spare, we just kept pushing
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton and Fossett are both using trans-Atlantic training runs
as a tune-up for The Race, the round-the-world event that begins
from Barcelona, Spain, on Dec. 31. ``We got a note from Fossett
saying he thought that 600 was possible but he was surprised to see
someone get through to 625,'' Dalton said. ``My feeling is that
he's pretty wily and he'll be itching to break our record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Dalton would like to race Fossett back across the
Atlantic, from New York to England, later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go on standby in the middle of July,'' Dalton said. ``If
we're able to make an arrangement with PlayStation that would be
fantastic. It would be a really good showdown.''

 &HT;    Stakes high for plaintiffs, government in Davidian wrongful
death trial
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A lot is at stake in the Branch Davidians'
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government that starts Monday in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about money, although the plaintiffs _ surviving
Davidians and the relatives of those who died at Mount Carmel _ are
asking for $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government stands to lose the most of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   A verdict in favor of the Davidians would mean a federal judge,
and not just critics, had found the government's actions at Mount
Carmel to be negligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular civil trial could have a much greater impact
on government conduct in the future than a criminal case would,''
said Houston attorney Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs. ``A jury verdict against the government would be a
dramatic reminder of whom they're supposed to work for. They had
more tanks at Mount Carmel than the Marines had in Somalia. It's
true. It doesn't matter what David Koresh did. The American people
don't expect innocent women and children to be assaulted and
tear-gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas and government co-counsel for the civil trial, did not return
phone calls requesting an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A government win could lend credence to its version of events
seven years ago. However, it won't end the speculation about what
happened at Mount Carmel, according to Mark Swett, a Portland,
Maine man whose extensive collection of Davidian siege documents
has made him a resource for researchers and programs such as
``Frontline.''
</P>
<P>
   Swett, who works for an insurance company, is writing a book,
``David Koresh and the Untold Story of the Branch Davidians,''
based largely on the FBI ``bug'' tapes from Mount Carmel. The
listening-device tapes changed Swett's mind on who's to blame for
the fire that led to the deaths of Koresh and 75 followers. Swett
thinks they show the Davidians purposely set the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the Davidians lose the civil trial, the controversy
will still go on,'' Swett said. ``The only thing that can stop the
endless speculation will be a complete investigation utilizing all
the evidence. We missed that opportunity with the 1995
congressional hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidian Sheila Martin sees the civil trial as a chance for
redemption _ for her family, not herself.
</P>
<P>
   Martin left Mount Carmel during the Davidian siege to care for
her handicapped son, James. Two other children, Daniel and
Kimberly, came with Martin. Her husband Wayne, a Waco attorney
educated at Harvard, and four other children stayed. They all died
on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say that we don't want our elderly and our children
taken care of,'' Martin said, ``but the names of our family who
died there, the truth about why they were there, those things are
important, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a courtroom is really the proper forum for the truth to
come out about an event like Mount Carmel is debatable. Attorney
Dick DeGuerin, who represented Koresh during the siege, doesn't
think it is. But he also doesn't see a better candidate stepping
forward either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see a public forum where the public had a right to
make a decision based on all the evidence without regard to
politics,'' DeGuerin said. ``But it looks like this is as close as
we're going to get to the truth. Clearly, decisions in Congress are
made along political lines and not along lines of what's just.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil trial will examine four areas of potential government
liability regarding 81 of the Davidians who died at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Did agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fire
indiscriminately at the Davidians on Feb. 28, 1993 when five group
members died?
</P>
<P>
   Did the FBI demolish Mount Carmel prematurely and not in
accordance with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's directive?
</P>
<P>
   Was the government negligent by not having a plan to fight a
fire?
</P>
<P>
   And did the government contribute to the cause and spread of the
fire?
</P>
<P>
   Whether the government fired shots at the Davidians and kept
some of them from escaping the fire will be decided by U.S.
District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs are suing the government under the Federal Claims
Tort Act. Theoretically, the government can be held to the same
standards as an individual when it comes to negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under general tort law, the way we determine if a defendant is
responsible is to ask if the defendant did what was reasonable and
prudent under the circumstances at the time,'' said Bill Trail, a
professor at the Baylor University Law School. ``The attorney for
the plaintiff will argue that the facts show there were two
reasonable ways to do this and the defendant picked a third. The
attorney for the defendant will argue there were three reasonable
ways to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference, however, between suing the
government and suing an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the doctrine of sovereign immunity,'' said Bill
Underwood, the Leon Jaworski professor of practice and procedure at
Baylor's law school. ``The government can't be sued unless it
consents to be sued. That's the most fundamental difference between
the government, individuals and corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   And government officials, under the law, are protected from
being sued for their discretionary decisions _ decisions left to an
official's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, though, will argue that FBI officials at Mount Carmel
changed the official plan to force the Davidians out of Mount
Carmel, starting to demolish it more than a day and a half ahead of
schedule. Changes were only permitted in the event of an emergency
according to the government plan, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jeffrey Jamar and Richard Rogers deviated from that plan
and people got hurt, the government is liable,'' Caddell said.
``It's not a complex case from that standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamar was the lead FBI agent at Mount Carmel, while Rogers
headed the Hostage Rescue Team.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys predict the Davidian civil trial could last a month or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McNulty, a producer of ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' also
made a prediction. He believes the Davidians will win a negligence
award _ albeit a minor one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prognosticate a wrist slap that won't get to the heart of
the matter,'' McNulty said. ``It won't have to do with any of the
allegations that would be seen as an overt act against the
Davidians. I don't think the judge nor the special prosecutor nor
Congress has the stomach for that kind of confrontation. ... It
will be like the sponge of vinegar given to Christ to slack his
thirst. That's what it will be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Swett, who began collecting records related to the siege while
it was happening, isn't predicting who will win.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it hard to lay fault more at one doorstep than the
other, seeing what happened at Mount Carmel as a clash between two
sides deaf to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davidians could not get beyond their Biblical convictions
even in the reality of serious charges including the deaths of
federal agents,'' Swett said. ``The FBI was not able to overcome
the theology of David Koresh. One side lived in the spiritual
realm, and the other in the real world. In the end, those worlds
collided with devastating effects.''

COLUMN: `AWFUL TRUTH' PRODUCER WON'T STOMACH HIS OWN MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Moore made a name for himself pointing cameras at cruel
corporate executives and other enemies of the people. He stalked
the chairman of General Motors, sent people in Puritan costumes to
Ken Starr's home and set up a Web site with a camera trained on a
window of Lucianne Goldberg's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore does not appreciate being bothered himself, as Alan
Edelstein discovered. After he was fired by Moore, Edelstein tried
borrowing the technique Moore had applied to GM's Roger Smith in
the film ``Roger &AMP; Me'': showing up uninvited with a camera and
trying to get an answer from a boss who has decided to downsize.
</P>
<P>
   Moore responded by filing a complaint with the New York police
accusing Edelstein of aggravated harassment, menacing and criminal
trespassing. As a result, Edelstein was arrested in March and spent
nine hours in a cell at the Midtown North police station. The
district attorney's office later dropped the case. Now Edelstein is
suing Moore, alleging malicious prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, who is 39 and lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was
hired in 1998 as a producer on ``The Awful Truth,'' Moore's show on
the Bravo network. He was fired by a subordinate of Moore's after
seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that there was a budget crunch,'' he said, ``but I
don't think that was true. I later learned there were questions
about my competence, which no one had ever raised when I was there.
So I was angry at the way I was dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   He had another reason for pursuing Moore with a camera.
Edelstein, who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1985 for a
documentary about a musician, was making a documentary
incorporating scenes from his own life. ``I thought footage with
Michael explaining why I'd been fired would be useful for my own
documentary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech by Moore at the University of Massachusetts in
Amherst, Edelstein stood up with a camera and a bullhorn, a tool
used by Moore outside the offices of executives. Edelstein demanded
to know why he had been fired but didn't get an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein twice showed up with his camera at the office of
Moore's production company on West 57th Street near 11th Avenue. He
filmed some employees but didn't manage to reach Moore. Later, he
took his camera for a few more unsuccessful attempts to engage
Moore at public events outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   Moore says he complained to the police because he thought
Edelstein had become a stalker who was a threat to Moore's family
as well as his employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all he was doing was making his little film about me, I
wouldn't have cared,'' Moore said. ``But other people were at risk.
This is a disgruntled employee who is a bit off his rocker.
Everyone in the office felt there was considerable risk. The women
in the office felt frightened for their own safety. Ask them.
They'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked several women, including one recommended by Moore, and
none sounded scared. They said they found Edelstein a bit
obsessive, but otherwise mild-mannered and harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was remotely in fear of Alan in any shape or form,''
said Kyra Vogt, who was the office manager at the time Edelstein
showed up with the camera. ``Most of us thought the situation was
comical. The only person who was paranoid was Michael. He couldn't
deal with having someone follow him around.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Moore why the district attorney hadn't prosecuted
someone who was supposedly so dangerous, Moore said he didn't know.
``I wanted to pursue the case,'' he said, and he urged me to find
out what had stopped justice from being done.
</P>
<P>
   I did, and again Moore's version of reality did not jibe with
the rest of the world's. A transcript from a hearing in Manhattan
Criminal Court on Nov. 1, 1999, shows that Judge Ellen M. Coin
dismissed the case after being informed by Assistant District
Attorney Erin Koen that ``the complaining witness does not want to
proceed with the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore dismissed as ``frivolous'' Edelstein's lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. Edelstein said he was looking forward
to his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Michael Moore to be accountable for his false
charges,'' Edelstein said. ``He always grandstands about the First
Amendment and artistic freedom, but when I attempted to do
essentially what he does, he had me arrested and put in a cell for
a day.''

A METHOD OF CUTTING ESTATE TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the House of Representatives voted this
month to kill the federal tax now imposed on estates that exceed
$675,000, the promise of a presidential veto has left tax planners
with ample incentive to continue advising clients about how to
reduce taxes on assets they will ultimately pass to their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   And with skyrocketing property values in the New York City
metropolitan area helping to propel more people into tax brackets
that could expose their estates to taxes _ at rates of up to 55
percent _ the planners say that one of the most talked-about
estate-planning strategies is the Family Limited Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``FLPs are one of the hottest financial planning tools around,''
said Martin Shenkman, a Manhattan tax lawyer. ``They've been
packaged and sold as the estate-planning wonder drug of the
decade.'' Shenkman added, however, that like any estate-planning
strategy, a Family Limited Partnership must be used as only part of
an ``integrated overall estate and financial plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Limited Partnership, Shenkman said, is a business
entity formed by members of a family to own and manage family
assets _ including real estate purchased as an investment. (Since
FLPs must have a business purpose to survive IRS scrutiny, they are
not used for primary residences or homes used solely for vacations.
Second homes that are rented out most of the year may be eligible.)
</P>
<P>
   As with any limited partnership, he said, the FLP has general
partners who run the business or manage the property _ usually the
parents _ and limited partners who have no say in management _
usually the children.
</P>
<P>
   And while the stated purpose of an FLP is to function as a
family business created to own and control one or more of the
family's assets, Shenkman said, one benefit of such an arrangement
is that the FLP can be used to transfer assets from the parents to
the children in a way that minimizes or even eliminates estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Engel, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in estate
planning, explained that the tax savings that can be obtained using
an FLP are the result of three factors: the way that assets are
contributed to the partnership, the way that ownership of the
partnership itself is apportioned, and the way that each partner's
share of the partnership is valued for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Engel said, assets like investment properties and
securities are transferred to the FLP by the general partners. And
while the general partners usually retain total control over
management of the partnership business, the documents used to
create an FLP typically give the general partners only a small
percentage of the actual ownership interest in the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general partners can have as little as 1 percent interest
in the partnership,'' Engel said, adding that the remaining
ownership interests would be allocated as limited-partnership
interests. Those interests would then be given as gifts to the
children. What that accomplishes, he said, is that it allows
parents to transfer assets like investment properties into a
partnership owned almost entirely by the children _ without
requiring the parents to relinquish day-to-day control.
</P>
<P>
   And while the value of the transferred partnership interests
would be considered a gift for federal gift and estate tax purposes
_ thereby using up all or part of the $675,000 gift and estate tax
credit available to each parent (an amount that gradually increases
to $1 million in 2006) _ a significant tax savings ultimately
results because of the way the partnership interests are valued.
</P>
<P>
   Engel explained that since property owned by a limited
partnership is under the total control of the general partner, the
value of each limited partner's ownership interest is less than
what it would be if they owned the property outright.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, if property with a current market value of
$1.5 million is put into an FLP consisting of a general partner who
owns 1 percent of the partnership and three limited partners who
own 33 percent each, it is unlikely that any individual limited
partner's share would be worth $495,000 (33 percent of $1.5
million). That is because the general partner still has total
control over the property and because each of the limited partners
has only a minority interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that putting the property in the FLP and
transferring limited-partnership interests to the children results
in a discount of its value for federal gift and estate tax
purposes,'' he said, adding that the amount of the discount _ which
must be determined by an appraiser _ can range anywhere from 25 to
60 percent of the market value of the property before the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it is possible for a husband and wife to
transfer $1.5 million worth of investment property into an FLP _
and, ultimately, into the names of their children _ while using up
as little as $600,000 of their combined gift and estate tax
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald A. Fatoullah, a Forest Hills, Queens, estate-planning
lawyer, said that with careful planning and sufficient time, it may
even be possible for a married couple to transfer investment
property to their children without exposing any of the value to
gift and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people do is they gift shares of the FLP to their
children or grandchildren in $10,000 yearly increments,'' he said,
explaining that under current tax law, a husband and wife can each
give each child and grandchild a tax-free gift of up to $10,000 a
year. Accordingly, Fatoullah said, instead of creating an FLP with
the children owning the majority of the limited-partnership
interests from the inception, some people will instead spread out
the transfer of those interests over a period of years to take
maximum advantage of the $10,000 annual gift exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, a husband and wife who have three children and $1.5
million worth of investment property can transfer $60,000 worth of
limited partnership interests each year to the children without
using up any of their gift and estate tax credits. And if the value
of the partnership interests were to be discounted by, say, 50
percent, that same couple would actually be transferring up to
$120,000 in real property value each year.
</P>
<P>
   The three lawyers interviewed for this article emphasized
several points. First, no one estate-planning strategy is right for
every situation. For example, while FLPs can produce significant
estate tax savings, the beneficiaries would in all likelihood have
to pay capital-gains taxes when they ultimately sell the property.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since the FLP is a partnership, the general partner is
personally liable for any claims against the partnership.
Accordingly, those who have serious concerns about liability might
want to opt for a limited liability company, a business structure
that provides benefits similar to those of an FLP while limiting
the liability of members to their actual investment.

SPORTS COLUMN: PEBBLE BEACH'S MOST PRECISE HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 5th graf with completion of 2nd round; EDITS 6th graf to
conform)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ From the tee down near the rocks of
Carmel Bay, you can't see the chasm. All you see is the grassy
horizon of the fairway with the dazzling expanse of Carmel's
crescent beach to the right. Beyond the fairway at the edge of the
chasm, out there about 260 yards, shaggy grass surrounds two small
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger,'' they warn in red. ``Steep cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so steep that, according to Pebble Beach lore, a woman once
tried to commit suicide there by jumping off that cliff. Somehow
she suffered only a broken leg. Another time, the driver of a
fairway mower, realizing he couldn't stop in time, jumped off the
mower just before it plunged into the chasm.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet down at the bottom of the chasm, surf slaps
against the rocks and slides up the sand. Across the chasm, five
yawning bunkers and thick rough surround the sloping green of this
418-yard eighth hole at Pebble Beach, where Tiger Woods is trying
to win his first U.S. Open championship.
</P>
<P>
   After completing a second-round 69 Saturday, Woods was at 134,
six shots ahead of Thomas Bjorn of Denmark and Miguel Angel Jimenez
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth is not the most photographed hole at Pebble Beach,
but it's the most precise hole, the most demanding, the most
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way the second shot sets up there,'' Jack Nicklaus
said before this Open started, ``it's my favorite shot in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the shots that the best golfer in history has assessed,
he calls this shot to the eighth green his favorite. Pebble Beach
ought to plant a plaque with that rave review on it somewhere on
the edge of the chasm with those two danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   But your tee shot must be as precise as that second shot over
the chasm. Hit your tee shot too far and you don't have a second
shot. If your ball is not down in the chasm, it is in the rough
near one of those danger signs with nowhere to stand.
</P>
<P>
   In what the 60-year-old Nicklaus, the four-time champion, later
announced was his last Open round after a record 44 Opens, his tee
shot there Friday went too far into that rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 3-wood off the tee and I cut it up in the wind a
little bit to kill it, but it went too long by about a foot,'' he
said after an 82. ``I took a drop, then I hit a 7-iron 20 feet
short of the hole and it looked like it landed on a highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus later agreed that his double-bogey 6 there just about
finished his hope of making the 36-hole cut. But no matter which
way the wind is blowing, that chasm creates a decision for every
golfer as to what club to use on the tee.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Kite, how he played the eighth hole in the final round
of the 1992 Open probably made the difference in his winning.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, in a duel for the lead with Jeff Sluman, arrived at the
eighth tee after a surprising birdie 2 on the 106-yard seventh hole
when his wedge from the rough scooted across the green and into the
cup. On the tee, pumped up by that birdie and with a wild wind at
his back, Kite was fingering the 3-iron in his bag until his
caddie, Mike Carrick, spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the 4,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the 3,'' Kite suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the 4,'' Carrick repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far is the cliff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-sixty,'' the caddie said.
</P>
<P>
   Kite paused, nodded, yanked the 4-iron and hit it. When he
walked up the hill to the fairway, he saw his ball perched about
five yards short of the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice call,'' Kite told his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   Had Kite hit the 3-iron, his ball would probably have
disappeared into the chasm along with his opportunity to win what
turned out to be his only major title. But with a par at the
eighth, Kite went on to shoot 72 for a three-under-par 285, two
strokes ahead of Sluman.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Gil Morgan arrived at the eighth tee at 12 under
for the tournament, the first golfer in Open history to be in
double figures under par. After a good tee shot, Morgan's iron over
the chasm flew into the back bunker. He flubbed his explosion shot,
chipped long and two-putted for a double-bogey 6 on his way to a
77.
</P>
<P>
   With an 81 in the final round, Morgan skidded to a tie for 13th.
The eighth hole had wrecked him.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1972 Open, Nicklaus had a par at the eighth in the windy
final round and went on to win by three strokes. But in the 1982
Open, which Nicklaus lost by two strokes to Tom Watson, he had a
costly bogey there after a run of five consecutive birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second shot landed in what they called `the character,' the
rough that was this high,'' the Golden Bear recalled, pointing to
his knees. ``I was only about 12 feet from the hole and I swung as
hard as I could, but I barely got it out. Bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Watson saved par at the eighth with an 8-foot
putt. In the third round, Watson had birdied the eighth with a
4-wood and a 5-iron to about 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse, something always seems to happen in the
Open at Pebble Beach's eighth hole where that chasm demands a
precise tee shot. Far, but not too far. Not too close to those
either of those two danger signs and certainly not into the chasm. &QL;

NEW REPUBLICAN TV SPOT  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic National Committees are on the air
this weekend with issue advertisements on behalf of Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore. The spots are running in
17 states, including crucial ones like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICAN SPOT
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Cold Harbor Films
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: In the opening scenes, greeting-card images of
America _ an orange sunrise, a windmill on a wheatfield _ melt into
one another. Cut to a quick succession of shots of Bush mixing with
voters and then to a series of portraits of average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT ANNOUNCER: ``With our nation at peace and more prosperous
than ever, now is the time to find real solutions to America's
problems. George Bush knows that to keep our commitment to seniors
we must strengthen and improve Social Security now, or the
retirement of the baby boom generation will push it near
bankruptcy. He's proposing a bipartisan plan to strengthen and
improve Social Security. The Bush plan guarantees everyone at or
near retirement every dollar of their benefits. No cuts in Social
Security. You paid into it, it's your money and it will be there
for you. And the Bush plan gives younger workers a choice to invest
a small part of their Social Security in sound investments they
control for higher returns. Learn more about George Bush's
voluntary plan for personal Social Security retirement accounts.
The Bush blueprint: Better for seniors today, better for all of us
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: With aging baby boomers inching ever closer to
eligibility for retirement benefits, shoring up Social Security has
become a signature issue of the presidential campaign. The party's
60-second commercial highlights Bush's plans for a partial
privatization of the system, allowing workers to invest part of
their payroll taxes as they see fit. Vice President Al Gore has
been a fierce critic of the idea, arguing that the less financially
savvy could fall prey to foolhardy investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: A direct appeal to Bush's own generation. While polls
show that older people are wary of privatization plans for their
retirement money, younger voters are more amenable to the idea. The
spot is also an emblem of the Bush marketing style: no scare
tactics, just lots of postcard panoramas and loving snaps of the
candidate wading into crowds. As such, it is indistinguishable from
Bush's own commercials.

REAL ESTATE: HIGH-END RENTALS IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET KING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Affluent workers willing to pay thousands of dollars
for monthly rent have created a brisk high-end apartment market
downtown, a turnaround from the mid-1990s, when few people wanted
to live in the business district, anchor retailers were leaving and
planners feared the city center was becoming blighted.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective renters began taking ``hard hat'' tours of 276
luxury apartments last month in the final two of four towers that
Harbor Properties is building a block from the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The $155.8 million Harbor Steps complex will have a total of 730
apartments, as well as 75,600 square feet of office and retail
space. A courtyard park slopes down the hillside site between First
and Western avenues. One of the new buildings will open in July,
the other in November. Both will have 17 stories.
</P>
<P>
   The 454 apartments occupied in the first two towers, each 25
stories, command top dollar for rent _ $955 to $5,000 a month.
Harbor Steps boasts 98 percent occupancy and is the only major
apartment complex in the central business district, although other
apartments have sprung up in Belltown to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are close to waterfront restaurants and they can buy
groceries at the historic Pike Place Market a block north or browse
in the new Seattle Art Museum across First Avenue from the Harbor
Steps concierge desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartments are ideal for people who work downtown and can
afford to buy homes or condominiums but who may have money invested
in other ways and don't need real estate as a tax write-off,'' said
Stephen Fina, Harbor Properties marketing director. ``Forty percent
of our renters are new to Seattle, often employed in high-tech
industries. They follow the job market and may be in Seattle today
and Silicon Valley next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age is 44, and the average stay 16 months. There are
few school-age children because of the lack of schools downtown. A
day-care center will be able to handle up to 60 preschool children
when the new towers are completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, when we marketed the first tower, we were nervous
about how long it would take to rent units,'' Fina said. ``We were
certain downtown living would be highly desirable, but had no idea
of the pent-up demand.'' Yet the apartments in the 25-story tower
leased completely within four months. The second 25-story tower
opened in July 1997, two years ahead of schedule and was fully
rented in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference on First Avenue is like black and white, due to
the number of people now living in this neighborhood,'' said Tim
Warner, director of corporate communications at Immunex Corp., a
biotech company across Western Avenue from Harbor Steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and a half years ago, I'd walk down the street at 9 p.m.
and the only other people out looked unsavory. But Harbor Steps is
making a dramatic impact. Now there are a lot of people out, some
in fancy clothes going to the art museum or the symphony at the new
Benaroya Hall on Second Avenue.'' Immunex houses new executives in
Harbor Steps until they get settled.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle's early years, First Avenue was called Front Street,
and businesses catered to workers on the docks and industrial
buildings and to sailors. In 1953, the elevated Alaskan Way Viaduct
was built along the harbor and it discouraged downtown waterfront
redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Stimson Bullitt, chairman of Harbor Properties, said he quietly
assembled the adjacent properties along First and Western avenues
in 1972 that would become Harbor Steps ``because they looked like
good bargains.'' He added: ``They were run-down and many were empty
ruins of taverns, pawnshops, tattoo parlors and flophouses. I
thought that since this is part of the center of town, the area had
a good future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullitt, who comes from a prominent founding family in Seattle
that had long invested in downtown real estate, said he wanted to
create an urban neighborhood with housing and parks to revitalize
the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downtown had a big concentration of office buildings and
more were going up in the 1980s and I thought there might be an
excess of office space,'' he recalled. ``But a great many jobs were
being created downtown and I thought it would be appealing to live
within walking distance from work.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose to build rental apartments rather than condominiums.
``With condos, if you hit the market right when your doors open,
you can make a lot of money,'' he said. ``But if the market is not
right, you end up with empty buildings and a big debt. With
apartments, if the market is not good, you can lower the rent and
cover financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullitt could not get construction loans at first. ``Bankers
just rolled their eyeballs toward the ceiling,'' he said. ``They'd
look at the $5 million cost of the staircase park and ask what
revenues I'd get from that and turned me down as a fool. But after
the first building did well, financing was easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Steps was coming to market during tough years for
Seattle's downtown. In 1992, a department store anchor, Frederick &AMP;
Nelson, closed at Fifth Avenue and Pine Street and other retailers
followed, leaving boarded buildings smeared with graffiti. The
business district became a ghost town at night as people avoided
the skyscraper canyons out of concerns about safety.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nordstrom moved its flagship store into the Frederick's
building in a $100 million renovation in August 1998, it triggered
a stampede of new mixed-use development. Prominent national
retailers including Nike, FAO Schwarz, Banana Republic, Urban
Outfitters and Anthropologie arrived and the downtown gained a new
vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment spark also caught on along First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Boutiques like Flora &AMP; Henri Children's Clothier have replaced
some of the seedier businesses. However, adjacent to Harbor Steps
to the north is the Lusty Lady Live Show with a marquee that
proclaims, ``Now Showing: Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbor Steps has become so popular that monthly rents are
soaring. In 1994, studios rented for $683 but jumped to $955 in
1998 and to $1,110 today. One-bedroom units leased for $944 in
1994, $1,372 in 1998 and $1,905 today, up 39 percent in two years.
Two-bedroom apartments leased for $1,437 originally and for $2,098
in 1998, and then rose 28 percent to $2,680 today. Penthouses cost
up to $5,000 today, more than double the $2,227 in 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Tenney, a certified public accountant who is the chief
financial officer for three companies, moved into Harbor Steps in
February. Only studios were available, but residents are allowed
first crack at the new apartments under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the hard-hat tour and fell in love with a fifth-floor
suite with a balcony overlooking the Harbor Steps plaza and park,''
he said. ``It was so charming I took out my checkbook immediately
and made a deposit.'' He will pay $2,400 a month for a one-bedroom
apartment and move in in July.
</P>
<P>
   Fina, the marketing director, wants to transform the outdoor
plaza into a spot where the anticipated 1,100 residents can mingle
and linger over carry-outs from coffee shops in the complex.
Indoors, residents can relax in three spas, work out in the fitness
center or basketball court or on the indoor climbing wall, and hold
Super Bowl parties in the big-screen theater room.
</P>
<P>
   Since many residents have been ordering groceries on the
Internet via HomeGrocer.com, Harbor Steps may set up a refrigerated
area where groceries can be delivered while residents work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, northeast of Nordstrom at the edge of the retail
district on Seventh Avenue, Continental-Bentall, a developer, is
building Westlake Tower, a 366-unit apartment building. ``It
appeals to downtown professionals wanting to give up their commute
and be closer to the city's plethora of shopping, dining and
entertainment,'' said Claudio Guincher, Continental-Bentall's chief
operating officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Westlake Tower are low-rise buildings ripe for
redevelopment. Gary Carpenter, chief operating officer of Bentall
U.S., says the downtown's future growth will spread here ``because
land is available _ we have plans for several other residential
properties and are bullish on that whole area.'' Both companies are
subsidiaries of Bentall Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scott a principal of Dupre &AMP; Scott Apartment Advisors,
which analyzes apartment pricing, said: ``Nobody downtown or in
Belltown has been in the same league as Harbor Steps with its
high-quality, high-end product, which is as good as rental housing
gets in Seattle. Westlake Tower will be its first competition.''

ARCHBISHOP'S INSTALLATION IS BOTH SERVICE AND PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-EGAN) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid the haze of incense, the choral chants of
``Hallelujah'' and the overall gravitas of ancient Catholic rites,
the most crucial moment over the next two days of worship and
celebration at St. Patrick's Cathedral actually comes down to a
small bit of papal paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, a letter from Pope John Paul II appointing
Edward M. Egan the archbishop of New York will be read aloud. Then,
Monsignor Edward D. O'Donnell, the chancellor of the archdiocese,
will notarize it, stamp it with the diocesan seal and order it
deposited in the archives.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the installation of New York's ninth archbishop
will be official under canon law. But the praying and the partying
will have just begun.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of a Catholic archbishop typically offers a
balance of solemnity and revelry, of spectacular pageantry and
pious introspection. It is a time for jestful greetings and for
serious talk about the future of the diocese. The program for
Sunday and Monday incorporates it all.
</P>
<P>
   The worship will take place during two services at St.
Patrick's. On Sunday, the archbishop's official appointment, called
a ceremony of canonical possession, will precede the regular late
afternoon service of solemn vespers. On Monday, hundreds of
dignitaries will attend a celebratory Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle will come from two processionals, one of them a
parade on Monday from the Catholic Center, on First Avenue and 56th
Street, to St. Patrick's, with at least eight cardinals, 18
archbishops, more than 100 bishops and many priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over much of the official ceremony will be Archbishop
Gabriel Montalvo, the apostolic nuncio who serves in Washington as
the Vatican's ambassador to the United States. He will welcome and
present the new archbishop to local prelates and read the pope's
letter of appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Egan will be the principal celebrant of Sunday's vespers service
and Monday's Mass. He will wear festive white vestments, which
Monsignor Ferdinando Berardi, the coordinating master of
ceremonies, said represent continuity in the church. He added that
the installation of the archbishop was a moment to reflect on
thousands of years of church traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ceremony will begin about 3:30 p.m. with a procession
of banners, led by one proclaiming ``Unus Dominus, Una Fides, Unum
Baptisma'' _ ``one Lord, one faith, one baptism.'' It shows a map
of the Archdiocese of New York with the waters of baptism flowing
through it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the processional from the Catholic Center will begin
about 1 p.m., with members of religious orders, students,
seminarians, deacons and priests in front and bishops, archbishops,
cardinals and finally Egan at the rear. The choir will be singing
``Hallelujah'' as he enters St. Patrick's.

 &HT;    Davidian wrongful death lawsuit consists of 4 parts
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The complex wrongful death lawsuit filed against
the government by Branch Davidian survivors will play out in the
courtroom like four mini-trials.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. ruled last week
that the trial, which is set to begin Monday, will not include
allegations that government agents fired into David Koresh's Mount
Carmel compound as the siege was coming to a deadly end, that left
four issues to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues will be presented one at a time to the jury,
instead of the often-haphazard and more random order in which
juries hear evidence in many civil cases. After the live testimony,
videotaped depositions and cross-examinations are complete on one
issue, the parties in the suit will move on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The judge approved the manner of trial presentation last week on
a proposal by lead plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an excellent way to present things,'' Smith
said during a pretrial conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is going to let us present the issues one at a
time,'' Caddell said. ``That lets us present deposition testimony
and live witnesses all on a single topic, and I think this will
present the evidence in a very clear and understandable and
organized fashion for the jury. The government hates it because
they want the jury not to understand what happened. They want to
talk about what a bad person David Koresh was and that's their case
in a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford of Beaumont, who is co-lead counsel
for the government, didn't object strenuously to Caddell's proposal
at last week's pretrial conference. He did, however, suggest that
the format would require more organization from government
attorneys in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think that it will be more difficult to present it
that way,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys will continue to wrangle over pretrial issues with the
judge Monday morning before a panel of about 50 prospective jurors
comes in after the lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has told attorneys that he will question the potential
jurors himself and likely not allow the lawyers to ask follow-up
questions during the jury-selection process known as voir dire. The
judge denied a request from Caddell for jurors to fill out a
two-page questionnaire about themselves and their feelings about
the case. Smith also said that he is considering allowing the
seven-member advisory jury to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he expects opening statements in the case to begin
Tuesday morning. The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will be asked to decide:
</P>
<P>
   whether Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents fired
indiscriminately and used other excessive force on Feb. 28, 1993,
when they stormed Mount Carmel in an attempt to arrest Koresh on
weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   whether the FBI's tear-gas assault deviated from Attorney
General Janet Reno's authorized plan and caused the premature
demolition of the building.
</P>
<P>
   whether the government was negligent by not having a plan to
fight the fire in which Koresh and 75 followers died.
</P>
<P>
   whether the government contributed to the cause and spread of
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, not the jury, will decide the amount of damages, if any,
the government will pay if the government is found to be liable in
any of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bradford, the government is represented by Marie Hagen,
an assistant U.S. Attorney from Washington, D.C., and a host of
other Justice Department attorneys. Bradford has said that no more
than four government attorneys will be seated at the counsel table
during the trial at any one time. He added that the attorneys will
alternate at the counsel table depending on what area of dispute is
being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell will be joined at the counsel table by his wife, Cynthia
Chapman, and attorneys for other plaintiffs, former U.S. Attorney
General Ramsey Clark of New York and James Brannon of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The first three rows on either side of the courtroom will be
reserved for members of the media. The remaining seats will be
available on a first-come, first-served basis. The courtroom holds
about 95 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he doesn't expect many of the Branch Davidian
survivors, many of whom live in foreign countries, to attend the
trial on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a few,'' Caddell said. ``Most of our people are
very private people and this was a major tragedy for them. They
don't want to be exposed to the press and they don't want to be
scrutinized by a bunch of people. I talked with a client from
England (Friday) morning about that very thing and she just didn't
want to be here to relive all that pain. She lost two children
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Security will be heavy at the federal courthouse. Officials are
preparing for an onslaught of media and, possibly, Davidian
sympathizers to be in Waco for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are limiting access to the building to the front door
on Franklin Avenue, and those entering the building will pass
through a metal detector, which is common in any federal
courthouse.

REAL ESTATE: A LONGTIME HOMEOWNER TURNS TO ASSISTED LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rose Strassburger was married for 60 years to Martin
Strassburger. They had met as teen-agers in Germany, leaving in the
late 1930s before the Nazis could send them to concentration camps.
They moved to New York City, married and lived in Manhattan in
Washington Heights, which was so thick with German Jews,
Strassburger said, ``we called it the Fourth Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, they moved to Elmhurst, Queens, and bought a two-family
house where they raised their two sons, renting one half and living
in the other. They commuted together every day to Manhattan, where
they ran a women's accessories business. He was the talker, meeting
with buyers; she did the office work. ``I was always a
businesswoman,'' she said, ``even as a young girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, her husband died, leaving her alone in a
way she had never been alone. She was inconsolable. Her sons
worried about her. ``The loneliness is something very bad,''
Strassburger said. She had her work with the sisterhood at the
synagogue, the Elmhurst Jewish Center, which she and her husband
had helped start. But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   And so, six months ago, exactly 50 years to the day she had
moved into her house, she left. ``My children begged me to go,''
she said. She left most of her furniture with the people who bought
the house, packed up her belongings, had the moving men take her
things, and locked the door behind her with absolutely no regrets.
``I don't feel sorry one bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has been living at Atria in Kew Gardens, a
retirement home that opened late last year. It is called an
assisted-living facility because it provides meals for its 85
residents (it has room for 143) and, if needed, help with
activities that might have become difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing like a nursing home. It's more like a boarding
school in an attractively decorated hotel, but most people are in
their 70s or 80s instead of their teens. Strassburger lives in a
large two-room apartment with a kitchenette. Although she could
have some meals there, she prefers to go to the dining room. In
fact, she goes downstairs early for meals, as do most of the
residents, for a little socializing before it's actually time to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The food is kosher, she said, and very good. ``Last night we had
a delicious pot roast,'' she said. ``I asked for more meat, and
that was no problem.'' There are always three choices of entree; if
she hadn't been in the mood for pot roast, she could have had
halibut, or barbecued chicken.
</P>
<P>
   She has her meals at Table 14 with the same group of people.
Some of the tables are made up of longtime Queens residents who
have known each other for years; one consists of four women
originally from Jamaica Estates.
</P>
<P>
   She likes the people she has met, and has not found it difficult
to make friends. ``I'm a very outgoing person,'' she said. ``I
greet people and I introduce myself.'' Occasionally, she goes to
lectures and parties, she said, but she skips many of the other
activities, which seem to be offered almost hourly. ``I'm not the
type to go into arts and crafts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't like being in their own apartments all day,
there's a library with a computer; an open kitchen with coffee,
tea, cookies and fruit always available; a wellness center where
residents can meet with nurses and doctors; a movie room; a place
to play bingo; a beauty parlor; a smoking lounge; and a private
dining room for entertaining family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, the nine-story brick building with its
underground parking garage fits in so well with the neighborhood
that it looks like it has been there forever. It was built by Jeff
Levine, president of Levine Builders, who lives in Queens, for
Atria Communities, a Louisville, Ky., company that owns 109
retirement communities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month there is a ``fireside chat'' with the woman in
charge, Larissa Kostal, whose own grandmother lives at Atria.
``Larissa is in the center like a queen,'' said Strassburger, who
is obviously fond of the young woman. At those talks, the residents
bring up issues that concern them. Some thought breakfast, at 8
a.m., was too early, and so they had a vote on whether to change
meal hours. ``Eighty-five percent voted to keep it the same,''
Kostal said. The democratic approach makes sense to her. ``This is
their home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the residents is 82, she said, and they pay
$3,550 a month for a two-room suite with daily housekeeping and a
thorough weekly apartment cleaning, plus all their meals, with
additional charges for nursing care if needed. Many residents, she
said, take anti-depressant medication, which doesn't surprise her
given what they must cope with at their age. ``It's all about
loss,'' she said. ``Some are outliving their children. They get
here and they're all in the same boat together.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strassburger moved in, she brought the mezuzah _ a piece of
parchment inscribed with a passage from Deuteronomy that is encased
and affixed to the door post of a house _ from her old home.
``That's the first thing you put in a home when you move in,'' she
said. A wall in her bedroom holds a plaque in appreciation from her
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still very active there,'' she said. ``That was my heart
and soul.'' The rabbi visits her once a week.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, she'll make phone calls after breakfast, to
her friends and family, which includes five grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren. After lunch, she tends to take a nap, and
watch her favorite soap opera, ``General Hospital.'' After dinner,
at about 7 p.m., she returns to her rooms for the night.
</P>
<P>
   She is particularly impressed by the skilled housekeeping at
Atria. ``The cleanliness in this house is something out of the
ordinary,'' she said. She no longer has to work in the yard, which
was tedious to her, or even clean up a kitchen. ``My fingernails
are so nice from not doing dishes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she says, ``there is nothing missing here.'' And how do
her sons feel about the move they encouraged her to make? ``They
are happy because I'm happy,'' she said. ``Now, they are calling me
only two times a day.''

EGAN BRINGS MANAGEMENT STRENGTHS TO N.Y. ARCHDIOCESE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral Sunday,
Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., will present a
parchment letter in Latin from Pope John Paul II that formally
appoints Egan the ninth archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is still, to many church observers, a surprise choice. Egan's
name was not among the three candidates recommended to the pope to
succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, and he has not been particularly
prominent among the nation's Catholic bishops.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a look at his record and his reputation suggests that
perhaps it is no surprise at all. New York is an archdiocese badly
in need of a corporate caretaker, and Egan is a consummate
corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   Egan has mixed with the wealthy and the prominent at
fund-raisers and dinner parties, bringing in millions to support
Catholic charities and schools. He has been an attentive boss to
his employees, the clergy, from their training as seminarians to
their care in retirement. He has been decisive at downsizing and
consolidating schools and parishes.
</P>
<P>
   And in the five weeks since he was named as O'Connor's
successor, Egan has proved attentive to public relations in New
York. His picture has already been posted on the archdiocese's Web
site. He bantered with reporters in two news conferences. And when
he is asked about accusations of pedophilia by clergy members in
Bridgeport, he already knows to respond with a terse ``No
comment,'' to avoid supplying any usable television sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   But no leader is good at everything, and the question raised by
many familiar with Egan's past performance is whether he will also
prove to be a spiritual shepherd to New York's Catholic laity, the
common Christian faithful who make up the church's soul and 98
percent of its membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinal O'Connor was a great pastor, and Ed Egan is a great
official,'' said Eugene Kennedy, a writer and former Maryknoll
priest who knows Egan. ``Ed Egan has always viewed the church from
behind a desk, while O'Connor saw men die and held them in his arms
in Vietnam. The great genius of the church is to be pastoral _ not
to be an efficient organization, or even a dominant organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a retired professor of psychology at Loyola University
in Chicago, said Egan was a model of the church leader the Vatican
now prefers as its bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain class of cleric to whom you apply the word
`churchman,' and that is what Ed Egan is, to his fingertips,''
Kennedy said. ``These men live and die for the institutional
church. They are therefore strong pillars, even if the rest of the
institution may be eroding in high winds or from internal problems,
such as priestly pedophilia, these pillars will stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Bridgeport diocese was sued by 31 plaintiffs
claiming abuse by eight priests over more than 30 years. Under
Egan, the diocese's lawyers have aggressively fought the
complaints, and he has been criticized for refusing to discuss the
accusations and for making no overtures to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Having now mounted one of the highest peaks in church
leadership, Egan will have an opportunity to make his mark on an
archdiocese that is badly in need of just the kind of
administrative experience that he brings.
</P>
<P>
   The New York archdiocese, which spends more than $527 million
annually, encompasses 413 parishes, 238 elementary schools, 55 high
schools, 17 hospitals, 13 day care centers and 11 mental health
residences. Many parishes can no longer support their neighboring
schools. Church finances are not public record, but some hospitals
are believed to face millions of dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to manage a complex entity, and he is very
capable of that,'' said Bill Baker, the president of WNET, who
belongs to a parish in Riverside, Conn., and who knows Egan.
</P>
<P>
   If Egan decides to consolidate or close parishes, schools or
hospitals, his abilities as a pastor and diplomat will be tested.
When he merged two congregations in Stamford, Conn., the Hispanic
parishioners at one said that he ignored their opposition to
joining with the Slovak congregation, and that he came across as an
autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, known as a man who does his homework, said he would spend
the summer traveling around the New York archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key project for me now will be to learn about the
archdiocese,'' Egan said at a farewell news conference in
Connecticut last week. ``I don't know what the situation is in the
schools, about Catholic charities, or with the priests and the
religious. The truth of the matter is that all I can do is spend
this summer listening to the people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Egan is also unlikely to celebrate Mass each week at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, and instead plans to spend Sundays visiting a
variety of parishes, his spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   To the people he will serve, the new archbishop is largely
unknown. In conversations at parishes on Friday, some did not
recognize his name, and others said they did not know anything
about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know in depth about him, but I hope he does good
because we need it,'' said Rhudy Correra, who is 15 and works at
the Church of the Incarnation in Washington Heights. ``I hope he
reaches out to the people that are less fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Correra's friend Franklin Rodriguez, voiced an observation
that illustrates just the sort of chasm facing Egan in an
archdiocese so divided by race and class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not really well known in the minority community,'' said
Rodriguez, who is 16, ``because the church only explained him to
the upper-class areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Egan courted the affluent, playing the piano at
benefit dinners and talking art history at parties. He persuaded
the executives and chairmen of such companies as General Electric,
Xerox, Pepsico, Merrill Lynch, Citi-Group and IBM to serve on the
board of a charity he founded, the Inner City Foundation for
Charity and Education, said Richard Stone, the foundation's
director. The foundation raises money for Catholic and nonsectarian
schools and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bishop is an eloquent speaker,'' Stone said, ``and he has
an excellent way of presenting a case and engaging individuals and
corporations to support his endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   As O'Connor came to understand, the archbishop of New York has a
large constituency outside the church to charm. He is constantly
being challenged to ideological duels by a variety of religious and
secular groups _ Jews, gays, feminists and others. The archbishop's
reputation will be partly defined by how he responds to these
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the political situation in New York, the Hispanics, the
blacks, the Jews, in many ways it is the fish bowl of the world,
and if you sneeze everyone knows,'' said Rabbi Jack Bemporad,
director of the Center for Interreligious Understanding, in
Englewood, N.J., who used to run a similar center at Sacred Heart
University in Fairfield, Conn., where Egan is chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archdiocese has a kind of exposure that I don't think
Bishop Egan is used to,'' Bemporad said. ``I think that Bishop Egan
can learn in the trenches, but I think he's got a way to go. This
is a very complicated position here.''

NATALIE SPINGARN DIES AT 78; ADVOCATE FOR CANCER SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natalie Davis Spingarn, a medical writer who endured multiple
bouts of cancer and became a prominent spokeswoman for cancer
survivors, died on June 6 in Washington, D.C. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, her son Jonathan, said.
</P>
<P>
   Spingarn's latest book, ``The New Cancer Survivors: Living with
Grace, Fighting with Spirit,'' was published this year. Her
personal story ``Hanging in There: Living Well on Borrowed Time,''
was published in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``She created the `Cancer Survivor's Bill of Rights' for the
75th anniversary of the American Cancer Society,'' said Joann
Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the society. The document, written
in 1988, was widely distributed among those with cancer, and
Spingarn became an important figure in the patient movement,
Schellenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Spingarn's paper demanded that patients have a say in their
medical treatment, that former cancer patients be freed of any
social stigma and that employers and insurance companies not
discriminate against them.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer pervaded Spingarn's life and the lives of many around
her. She had a mastectomy in 1974. But the cancer spread, first to
her spine, for which she had radiation therapy in 1977, then to her
hip, for which she had chemotherapy in 1979. She had a second
mastectomy in 1981. Spingarn's grandmother died of cancer. Her two
sisters had breast cancer, and one died of pancreatic cancer. One
of her two sons is a lymphoma survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Davis was born May 26, 1922, in New York City, and
reared in New Rochelle. She graduated with a bachelor of arts
degree from Vassar College in 1943, and became a journalist, then
wrote on health and social policy for the federal government. In
the early 1960s, she became a staff assistant to Abraham Ribicoff,
the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and became his
executive assistant when he was elected senator from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Spingarn is survived by her husband, Jerome Spingarn; two sons,
Jonathan of Atlanta and Jeremy of Norwood, Mass.; and two
grandchildren.

YONKER'S FIRES CONTENTIOUS SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yonkers school board fired its schools
superintendent Friday night after he opposed the city's acceptance
of a federal court's lifting of the longstanding court order for
the system to desegregate its schools.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden firing stunned city politicians and residents,
despite weeks of escalating friction between the superintendent,
Andre J. Hornsby, and Mayor John Spencer. The board voted to fire
Hornsby, the city's first black superintendent, just after he
announced improved test scores and the narrowing of a gap in
achievement between black and white students _ precisely the
challenge he was brought in to address in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby was pressuring the mayor to provide more city money to
cover a school system deficit he estimated at $34 million. But the
dispute over money was inextricably tied to the contention over
diversity in schools in a city that has long been a battleground
for desegregation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court recently ruled that Yonkers, the state's
fourth-largest school district, was free of the vestiges of
segregation that had prompted the 1986 desegregation order, which
brought the system more money from city and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the school board were eager to escape the stigma
of desegregation, and voted not to appeal the decision. Hornsby
though, argued that there were still remnants of racism in the
system and that the decision should be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters applauded Hornsby as a champion of minority children
_ who now make up about 75 percent of the school district, compared
with 35 percent when the court ordered it to desegregate in 1988 _
and expressed concern that Hornsby's firing would allow the city to
walk away from its commitment to raising minority achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But school board members insisted they were not abandoning the
goals of desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools are desegregated,'' said Thomas Weibrecht, a board
member. ``Eventually every court order must come to an end, and
when your schools are desegregated and you're providing a quality
education for every child, it is time for the federal courts to
leave. Federal oversight takes away local control and allows some
judge in Manhattan to dictates to the people of this city, and
worse to the children of this city, how they should be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby, a former college football player who spoke in the hard
charging metaphors of the game _ he once said he came at people
``head on'' _ increasingly angered the mayor with his public
declarations in support of continuing the desegregation order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He alienated forces he should have been working with,''
Weibrecht said. ``We're going to move forward, collaboratively and
cooperatively with the teachers union and the mayor, and all the
people that should have been working on this to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby left the meeting Friday without comment, and could not
be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a passion for academic excellence, that came from his
competitive spirit,'' said Joseph Pastore, a professor at Pace
University and the court-appointed monitor in the city's
desegregation case. ``The guy is used to competing in so many ways,
he was challenged by the opportunity to help children to ratchet up
their performance, and I think he would have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute was at heart about race, Pastore said, in many
ways it was similar to ones in New York City, and in Yonkers, over
money and control.

GARRETT ECKBO, 89, CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garrett Eckbo, a pioneer of modern landscape design and a
leading practitioner of California landscape architecture, died on
May 15 at his home in Oakland. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Through a broad scope of design work, from camps for migrant
farm workers to estate gardens for Hollywood grandees, Eckbo helped
establish modernist landscapes as a norm in gardening. His
extensive writings, full of passionate belief in the public role of
the landscape architect, are now considered important documents on
the formative years of modern landscape architecture, with its
emphasis on asymmetrical paved forms, native plantings and abstract
sculptural elements.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo was determined to educate students and the public about
the significance of landscape design, ``beyond the confines of the
private garden to the level of the housing complex, the waterfront
and the city scale,'' in the words of George Hargreaves, chairman
of the landscape architecture department at Harvard University's
Graduate School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo was born on Nov. 28, 1910, in Cooperstown, N.Y. The family
soon moved West so that his father could pursue new business
opportunities. Eckbo enrolled in Marin Junior College in Kentfield,
Calif., transferring to the University of California at Berkeley in
1932. His decision to enroll in the landscape program, he said in
later years, was almost random. ``I always liked to play with
plants in the garden, and my mother told me I was artistic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1936, he was on a scholarship at Harvard, chafing under the
elaborately codified tradition of the Beaux-Arts approach to
landscapes while students of architecture were pursuing modern
concepts of dynamic flow and material innovation under the auspices
of Walter Gropius and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. Eckbo, with his
classmates James Rose and Dan Kiley, started exploring ways to
adapt modern principles borrowed from architecture, abstract
painting and science to landscapes. He took architecture courses
with Gropius and wrote a thesis called ``Contempoville: An
Examination of the Planned American Suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Eckbo married Arline Williams, who survives him, with
two daughters, Marilyn Kweskin and Alison Peper, both of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo's first jobs upon graduation _ working with Norman Bel
Geddes on the General Motors Pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair and
for the U.S. Housing Authority on courtyards for public housing _
inspired a lifelong commitment to the public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, Eckbo worked for the Farm Security
Administration in the 1940s on developing more humane housing for
migrant farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar housing boom allowed Eckbo plenty of opportunity to
develop his ideas. He formed a partnership with his brother-in-law,
Edward Williams, that evolved into EDAW, one of the leading
landscape design practices in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo's signature garden was typically asymmetrical, with
hedges, pavings and plantings used to delineate diagonals, arcs and
circles. He also experimented with introducing materials, plastic
or aluminum, to be seen as artificial abstractions within the
natural realm.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo turned often to writing to express his opinions and
promote the tenets of modernism both to professionals and backyard
gardeners. He published his first book, ``Landscape for Living,''
in 1950. Around that time, he started teaching, first at the
University of Southern California and later at Berkeley, where he
was chairman of the landscape department from 1963 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Among Eckbo's projects were the Berkeley waterfront, the Alcoa
Forecast Garden in Los Angeles and the 256-acre Ladera planned
residential community near Palo Alto, which many scholars consider
the postwar period's finest subdivision plan, although it was never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo's work for private clients included gardens for Gary
Cooper and Louis Mayer. In 1975, he received the American Society
of Landscape Architects Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Eckbo focused on environmental design, serving
as an urban landscape consultant in Brazil, Kuwait and Japan, while
continuing to write books and articles. In 1997, Berkeley's
University Art Museum presented an exhibition called ``Garrett
Eckbo: Modern Landscapes for Living.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckbo published his last book in 1998. Called ``People in a
Landscape,'' it continues his basic theme that landscapes can link
society and nature.

 &HT;    Texas mom to head seminary
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Texas minister who describes being a wife and mother
as her ``highest calling'' will become president of Columbia
Theological Seminary in Decatur later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The board of trustees of the mainline Presbyterian school
elected the Rev. Laura S. Mendenhall, 53, pastor of Westminster
Presbyterian Church in Austin., Tex., on Saturday. She takes office
Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall is ``one of the top five female pastors in the
country in terms of her stature in the denomination,'' said Jerry
Van Marter, who heads news services for the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia has a tradition of calling pastor-theologians. She is
certainly that,'' said Erskine Clarke, a faculty representative to
the search committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in her a person of deep faith who possesses great
personal integrity, charisma and gifts of leadership to take the
seminary to new levels of service to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall will be the eighth president of the 172-year-old
seminary, and the first woman to hold that office. In a typical
Columbia graduating class, women make up 40 to 50 percent of
students receiving the Master of Divinity degree, the usual
preparation for pastors, said Clarke, interim dean of the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Although she hates to leave her role as senior pastor,
Mendenhall said in a telephone interview, ``The idea of getting to
invite and encourage and prepare other people to do something that
has been so personally fulfilling to me is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall has two grown children. Her husband, who is president
of Presbyterian Children's Homes in Austin, Texas, will move to
Decatur and look for a job in metro Atlanta, she said.
</P>
<P>
   My passion is being a pastor. I love it with every cell in my
body.
</P>
<P>
   To be with a person who's dying, to be with folks whose family
is breaking up and help them heal, to baptize a person, to get to
bury the saints _ I think it's the greatest privilege there is.
It's not to be taken lightly. It's to be jumped into with both
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mendenhall was a student at Austin College in Sherman,
Texas, the minister of the church she attended suggested that she
consider the pastorate, she said. ``I had no model for a woman as a
pastor. It looked to me if I pursued that, I would have to give up
the notion of being a wife and mom.''
</P>
<P>
   She intended to become an English teacher instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have been good at teaching grammar, probably, but
I would have been good at helping people write and appreciate the
writing of others,'' she said. ``Often you're dealing with the same
questions we take to scripture. What is life? What is meaningful?
Where is God? Who am I? How can I find peace in life?''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Texas mom to head seminary
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Texas minister who describes being a wife and mother
as her ``highest calling'' will become president of Columbia
Theological Seminary in Decatur later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The board of trustees of the mainline Presbyterian school
elected the Rev. Laura S. Mendenhall, 53, pastor of Westminster
Presbyterian Church in Austin., Tex., on Saturday. She takes office
Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall is ``one of the top five female pastors in the
country in terms of her stature in the denomination,'' said Jerry
Van Marter, who heads news services for the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia has a tradition of calling pastor-theologians. She is
certainly that,'' said Erskine Clarke, a faculty representative to
the search committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found in her a person of deep faith who possesses great
personal integrity, charisma and gifts of leadership to take the
seminary to new levels of service to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall will be the eighth president of the 172-year-old
seminary, and the first woman to hold that office. In a typical
Columbia graduating class, women make up 40 to 50 percent of
students receiving the Master of Divinity degree, the usual
preparation for pastors, said Clarke, interim dean of the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Although she hates to leave her role as senior pastor,
Mendenhall said in a telephone interview, ``The idea of getting to
invite and encourage and prepare other people to do something that
has been so personally fulfilling to me is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall has two grown children. Her husband, who is president
of Presbyterian Children's Homes in Austin, Texas, will move to
Decatur and look for a job in metro Atlanta, she said.
</P>
<P>
   My passion is being a pastor. I love it with every cell in my
body.
</P>
<P>
   To be with a person who's dying, to be with folks whose family
is breaking up and help them heal, to baptize a person, to get to
bury the saints _ I think it's the greatest privilege there is.
It's not to be taken lightly. It's to be jumped into with both
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mendenhall was a student at Austin College in Sherman,
Texas, the minister of the church she attended suggested that she
consider the pastorate, she said. ``I had no model for a woman as a
pastor. It looked to me if I pursued that, I would have to give up
the notion of being a wife and mom.''
</P>
<P>
   She intended to become an English teacher instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have been good at teaching grammar, probably, but
I would have been good at helping people write and appreciate the
writing of others,'' she said. ``Often you're dealing with the same
questions we take to scripture. What is life? What is meaningful?
Where is God? Who am I? How can I find peace in life?''
</P>
<P>
   To further prepare to teach, she enrolled in Presbyterian School
of Christian Education in Richmond, Va. As a student there, she met
her husband, Charles ``Chuck'' Mendenhall, a student at Union
Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   She also became convinced that she could be wife and mother and
also pastor a church.
</P>
<P>
   Mendenhall served on the mission field in Zaire, taught Bible,
and served as associate or co-pastor of churches in Florida and
Texas before becoming senior pastor of the 850-member Westminster
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia had an enrollment last school year of 550 students.
Another 600 people took classes through the seminary's Lay
Institute of Theology.

wisely retreat and call it a decent career after 12 years in the

   DAYTON HEARTLAND POLITICAL PROJECT
</P>
<P>
   HEARTLAND-MAIN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When national Republicans gather
Monday in Dayton to talk about improving Social Security and the
nation's schools, they'll be trying to get the attention of voters
like Dayton elementary school principal Gwen Jarvis. Jarvis is
among thousands of undecided voters across Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Illinois whose support both Republican Gov. George W.
Bush and Democrat Al Gore need to win the presidency. Those four
states from the industrial heartland are the biggest prizes among a
handful of states that both parties consider competitive
battlegrounds in their efforts to gather the 270 electoral votes
necessary to get to the White House. Together the four states
account for 84 electoral votes. The states are known for farms that
grow corn and soybeans and for factories that turn out steel and
automobiles, but they also regularly determine the winners in close
presidential elections. ``The South and Mountain West have
basically been conceded to Bush, and California and New York have
basically been conceded to Gore, so the heartland states like Ohio
are it for these two guys,'' said Allan Lichtman, history
department chairman at American University in Washington, D.C.
(Hershey/Wagner, Dayton Daily News). 80. MOVED Friday in (a)

   HEARTLAND-SWING _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The battle in the heartland is
really a battle for ``swing voters.'' These are people who haven't
enthusiastically backed one candidate or the other. To get an idea
of who these voters are, here are four mini-profiles of the kinds
of voters who will likely tip the balance in November: Demonica
Sikes, a 22 year-old community college student from Michigan, voted
for McCain; in November she says she'll probably vote for Gore but
will plug her nose. (Hershey, Dayton Daily News). 6-8. WITH PHOTO.

Assad to compromise in the Middle East peace process. At the mosque
where the elder Assad's funeral was held last week, the imam _ or
priest _ has a short answer for what people here would think of any
leader who settles for anything less than the entire Golan Heights:
``He would be a traitor.'' Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   Renee Scharf skitters across the polished clubhouse floor at
Gleneagles Country Club and, like so many residents here, stops to
get the latest from Rigaud Moise. Moise is a club ``houseman,'' a
better such employee is not to be found anywhere. For in this land
of card parties and club tournaments and Italian Night dinners,
Rigaud Moise is a worker bee, a 5-foot-4 whirlwind who walks with
his elbows pumping, to get there more quickly. And getting there,
he has discovered, is the easy part. In America, for Moise and
others like him, it's staying that's so hard. (Evans, Palm Beach

   LOS-ALAMOS-SCENE _ SANTA FE, N.M. _ First came the spy scandal.
Then the wildfire that almost swallowed them whole. Now, secret
nuclear files from Division ``X'' are missing. Over the past year,
event after event has dropped like bombs over America's Atomic
City, shaking up the isolated, orderly existence this northern New
Mexico town and its nuclear weapons laboratory have enjoyed for
more than half a century. Once the very center of the world's
scientific research, Los Alamos has become an embarrassment - and
once-proud town residents are taking it on the chin. (Guthrie,

leader status to the person of his choice. It's a delicate exercise

   LABOR-SWEENEY _ The American labor movement, once drifting
toward irrelevancy, is surging with new energy under the leadership
of AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. No where is labor's new potency
and political clout more on display than in Los Angeles, where
union membership swelled by 91,000 people last year, the most of
anywhere in the country. New immigrants account for much of labor's
increase and their numbers have helped the Democrats reclaim all
three branches of California's government. This year, the AFL-CIO
is poised to reverse a long-standing policy opposing amnesty for
immigrants in a move that reflects how important immigrant workers
have become to labor's economic and political future. (Foskett,

rain to call it a shower _ that reminded me of his dad. The only

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ It seems that in every U.S. election

President Clinton was widely seen as winning out with so-called
``soccer moms'' _ shorthand for married middle-class women with
young children seeking to juggle competing demands. This time
around, so-called ``wired workers'' have taken an early lead in the
media contest to see who will emerge as the key group of ``swing
voters.'' (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.

   FATHERS-DAY _ I have done the math and the math does not lie. At
age 62 _ my age _ my father suffered his first serious illness. It
happened on an early-spring morning in 1954, the day we were to
take the mules and the turning plows and begin to plow the fields
for planting. Tedious work, yet, in my memory, good work. The
slicing of the ground, rolled over to the right of the plow-blade,
leaving ripples. At day's end it was pleasing to lean against the
crossbar of the plow handles and see the evenness of the ripples,
and to breathe in the winter dampness of the dirt _ a scent like
rain closing in over distant pine stands. We did not make it to the
fields that morning. (Kay, Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer;

West, Florida, New Orleans and Greenwich Village, Manhattan. At
each stopover, he learned new songs, new ways to sing them and new
guitar licks to stir into his developing style as a ``songman.''
The songs he wrote as he traveled tell the story of his life and

For Hollywood studios, ``there's an element of panic,'' says

another aspect of filmmaking challenging conventional Hollywood _
digital technology. ``There's a real nervousness because they
regard the technology and the people who come with it like the
rabble at the door of the castle.'' Many see a mad scramble for

DONALD KALISH, 80, A PROFESSOR WHO LED VIETNAM-ERA PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald Kalish, a former chairman of the department of philosophy
at the University of California at Los Angeles, but best known as
an effective organizer of demonstrations against United States
involvement in Vietnam, died June 8 in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
in Los Angeles. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish lived in Los Angeles and died after a long illness, said
Harlan Lebo, a spokesman for the University.
</P>
<P>
   As vice chairman of the Peace Action Council, Kalish helped
organize a tremendous demonstration in front of the Century Plaza
Hotel in Los Angeles on June 23, 1967. About 80 anti-war groups
mustered almost 10,000 protesters to gather outside the hotel while
President Lyndon B. Johnson was speaking there.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish also publicized the idea of reducing one's income tax
payment by 25 percent _ the share he calculated that was being used
to support the military effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years, I was an ivory-towered academic,'' he told the
Christian Science Monitor in 1969. ``Sure, I was a liberal
Democrat. I backed Stevenson and even Johnson against Goldwater.
But in 1965, my intense feelings about the Vietnam War pushed me
toward issue politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago, Kalish earned his bachelor's and master's
degrees in psychology as well as his doctorate in philosophy at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching briefly at Swarthmore College and at Berkeley, he
joined the University of California at Los Angeles faculty in 1949.
He retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish is survived by his wife, the former Ann Graham of Los
Angeles.

HOMICIDE RATES IN CITIES SPURS CONCERN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs 3rd graf `But in 1999' to clarify; Subs 5th graf
`Concernce about crime' updates number of victims in 5TH graf) By
FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the number of homicides in some of the nation's big cities
rising in 1999 and the first five months of 2000, after eight years
of sharp drops, concern is spreading among law enforcement
officials and criminologists about whether the decline in violent
crime has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is too fragmentary, and contradictory, the experts
caution, to draw a firm conclusion. Virtually all of the elements
that contributed to the drop in homicide from 1991 through 1998 are
still in place: more criminals in prisons, innovative police
strategies, intense community efforts to work with troubled youths,
a waning of the crack cocaine epidemic and a strong economy
providing more jobs in impoverished neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1999, five of the 17 cities that have more than 100
homicides a year had an increase in killings, the first time since
the early 1990s that slayings have increased in so many cities.
Through the end of May this year, seven of the the 17 cities showed
an increase from the same period last year. New York was the only
city in the group to experience a rise in homicides during both
periods _ in 1999 and the first five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these 17 cities accounted for more than a quarter of
the nation's 15,600 homicides in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about crime have been heightened recently by shocking
attacks in several cities. New York, for instance, has seen the
killing of 10 cab drivers, the fatal shooting of five employees in
a Wendy's restaurant in Queens in May and a rampage in Central Park
last weekend in which nearly 50 women reported being groped or
assaulted by young men.
</P>
<P>
   But some police officials say that the increases in homicide in
1999 and 2000 are simply a normal statistical variation after so
many good years, which had brought homicide rates to their lowest
point nationally since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And some criminal justice experts agree with them _ to an
extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the increase in murder rates is simply that, at a
certain point, you can't go any lower,'' said James Alan Fox, the
Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
``The rates have come down so far, they simply can't be maintained
at such a low level.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore this, Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at
Carnegie Mellon University, said he had calculated that if the
decline in homicide in the 1990s continued at the same rate, the
United States would have no killings in 2007, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Police Commissioner Howard Safir contends the
police may be victims of their own success in reducing the number
of killings to 671 in 1999 from 2,245 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the goal should be zero, but in a city of 8 million,
the reality is you can only go so low,'' Safir said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the other categories of serious crimes, including
robbery, assault, rape, burglary, theft and automobile theft, are
down by 8 percent this year in New York. ``So I don't think we've
bottomed out on crime, but we may have bottomed out on murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after years in which New York officials have used the
homicide rate as a measure of their success in making the city
safer, Safir suggested it might be more accurate to look at the
broader range of all serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, New York had a 6 percent increase in homicides, and
through the end of May this year there have been 269 homicides,
compared with 248 in the same period in 1999, an increase of 8.5
percent. But Safir said that with the recent adoption of Operation
Condor, which lets police officers in high crime areas work more
overtime, there had been a small drop in homicides in May and so
far in June, and he predicted that the total for 2000 would be
about where it was in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty in drawing conclusions from the national
homicide figures for 1999 and so far this year is that there are no
obvious patterns to account for the increases in homicide in the
cities that have had them.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, which had a 15 percent increase in killings in 1999,
Sgt. Jeff Halstead, a spokesman for the city's police department,
said the rise could be largely attributed to the city's rapid
population growth and its position near the Mexican border, with a
large influx of drugs and illegal immigrants. ``What we have seen
is an increase in homicides related to narcotics and undocumented
Mexican nationals making their way into the metro Phoenix area,''
Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Phoenix police put together a special homicide
task force this year, with many of its members Spanish speakers,
and the city has had a drop in homicides through the end of May,
down to 63 this year from 91 in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in Los Angeles, which had 181 homicides in the first five
months of this year, compared with 159 in the same months in 1999,
Jason Lee, a spokesman for the police department, said he did not
know why the figures were up.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Safir said there were no discernible patterns
for the increase in killings during the last year and a half. There
had been some small rise in drug-related homicides, he said, but a
decrease in gang-related and domestic killings.
</P>
<P>
   One theory advanced by some criminologists to explain the surge
is that a new generation of teen-agers, too young to have
experienced the terrifying consequences of the crack epidemic of
the late 1980s _ the shootings, gang fights and waves of
imprisonment _ may now be looking for a new form of excitement.
That might explain, Blumstein said, an incident in Providence,
R.I., on June 8 in which five young men forced two college students
at gunpoint to get into their car outside a nightclub, then drove
them to a golf course, tortured them and shot them in the head.
</P>
<P>
   But Geoffrey Canada, president of the Rheedlen Center for
Children and Families in Harlem who works with troubled juveniles,
said he had not observed any trend of a return to the gun, drug and
gang culture among teen-agers in New York. ``I've seen an increase
in kids who are cut, with box cutters and razors, but not the
return of lethality and guns,'' Canada said. ``We haven't lost a
kid in several years.''

GEORGE MARSHALL, 96, CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Marshall, a vigorous proponent of civil rights
and a conservationist with a special passion for the Adirondack
Mountains, died in Nyack, N.Y., on May 21. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's involvement in civil rights was inspired by his
father, Louis Marshall, a co-founder of the American Jewish
Committee, and by his marriage to Elisabeth Dublin, a fellow
advocate, in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   As a pioneer in the civil rights movement of the '40s and 50s,
Marshall worked closely with people like Paul Robeson, and served
as chairman of the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties
and its successor, the Civil Rights Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1946, Marshall was called before the House Un-American
Activities Committee and cited for contempt when he refused to
produce records of the NFCL. He was convicted and served three
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's other passion was preservation of the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   To publicize the need for protecting wilderness areas, Marshall,
his brother, Robert, and their mentor, Herb Clark, became the first
to climb the 46 highest mountain peaks in New York state. After
Robert Marshall died at age 38 in 1937, Marshall became a trustee
of the Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City
and graduated from Columbia College. He earned a doctorate in
economics from the Brookings Institution in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's wife died in 1993. He is survived by his son, Roger
Marshall of Springfield, Vt.; his daughter, Nancy Marshall Schultz
of Nyack; six grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. &QL;

 &HT;    Residents rally support for Haitian facing deportation
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ ``Oh, Rego! Rego! Anything new? Are you OK?
Will they let you stay? Oh, I hope so!''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Scharf, a small woman with stylishly large sunglasses,
skitters across the polished clubhouse floor at Gleneagles Country
Club and, like so many residents here, stops to get the latest from
Rigaud Moise. He is standing center stage in the big, cream lobby,
shaking hands like a rock star with his many fans.
</P>
<P>
   Moise is a club ``houseman,'' which means he does a little of
everything and does it all very well, and, as any club member will
tell you, a better such employee is not to be found anywhere. For
in this land of card parties and club tournaments and Italian Night
dinners, Rigaud Moise is a worker bee, a 5-foot-4 whirlwind who
walks with his elbows pumping, to get there more quickly. And
getting there, he has discovered, is the easy part. In America, for
Moise and others like him, it's staying that's so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, thank you so much,'' he says to his admirers,
taking time to shake each hand. ``You are so very kind to ask after
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And ask they do, and do, and do. At Gleneagles, a sweeping,
green retirement haven tucked like an emerald in the western
suburbs here _ a sweet dewdrop of a place populated by retired
professionals who now devote their days to teeing off under the
palms _ the big news is not about the school shooting or the
presidential race or even the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   No. The big news is all about ``Rego,'' as nearly everyone here
calls him. After 10 years in this country, the beloved houseman
faces deportation back to Haiti _ back to the country he sees in
his nightmares, the place he fled, he says, his voice gone soft, to
save his life. It seems an impossible prospect. With his wife,
Cinette Dorlus, he is raising a family here, in the United States.
His youngest child, Rickerson, 6, was born here and is a U.S.
citizen. Moise owns a home in Pompano Beach. He pays his taxes. He
loves his job, his neighborhood, his church. He has a little slice
of the big American life.
</P>
<P>
   But what he does not have is a permanent place in America. The
right to stay. It will be a hard fight, but he has company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody _ everybody _ in this place has been touched by
Rego,'' says Steve Matlaga, the club's affable general manager and
the man who began a vigorous public relations campaign to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just _ well, it's just the nature of Rego. He's so
genuine, he's so giving, he's so hard-working. He has this
wonderful family. He has a son who is a U.S. citizen. He came from
a country where he was persecuted, and he's honest about the fact
that, if he went back, he thinks they'd kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rego and his story, they're 100 percent the real thing. That's
why we felt we had to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   GET THE WORD OUT THEY DID
</P>
<P>
   It was spring, and the Elian Gonzalez case had secured its place
on the front page of every newspaper when the first whisper of the
houseman's predicament broke on the lush green campus at
Gleneagles. It trickled out over bridge hands and Cobb salad
lunches, then rushed like a river out to the two 18-hole golf
courses, where normally masterful players shook their heads and
missed their putts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're wondering what kind of place Gleneagles is _ it
is neatly positioned in the far reaches of the county, far removed
from rubberneckers _ you might want to ask Mort Mazor, the club's
self-appointed communications czar: ``People here like to look
beyond their own four walls. We're comfortable, but we don't put on
the ritz. If somebody's in need, we like to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when it's Rego.''
</P>
<P>
   The call to arms came via the now famous ``Rego Video,'' a
special in-house production that played over the club's popular
channel for ``social news'' twice an hour for four days straight.
Steve Matlaga, the general manager, wrote the script and appeared
against a high-tech blue background in the role of newscaster. A
club staffer who used to cover the civil rights struggle for TV
news put the thing together in the editing booth, and the star of
the show smiled cheerfully as he zipped around the club grounds in
a white pick-up and prepared the dining room for a banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, everyone,'' the slightly nervous Matlaga said from his
anchorman's chair. ``I'd like to take a few moments of your time
today to ask you for your support and help . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   The Rigaud Moise story is not unlike the stories of thousands of
others who fled Haiti with fake passports and hearts full of fear.
People who felt the heat of military thugs, who worried for the
safety of their spouses and children, who could not guess _ and did
not want to know _ when the next spray of bullets would let loose
on the streets outside their homes. Some of those people, perhaps
3,000 according to immigration experts, had children after they
settled in the U.S., and those children, perhaps 5,000 of them, are
bonafide American citizens. And now _ what if those parents are
deported?
</P>
<P>
   Do they take their U.S. citizen children back with them? Back to
Haiti? The poorest nation in the hemisphere? A violent land those
children have never seen? Or, do they leave them here, to fend for
themselves, virtual orphans in a land of plenty?
</P>
<P>
   Impossible questions, these.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the general manager continued his report:
</P>
<P>
   ``As you've seen in the news lately,'' he told the good citizens
of Gleneagles, who were eating breakfast or paying bills or riding
the exercise bike, ``an immigration battle over a Cuban boy, Elian
Gonzalez, has been daily news headlines. What you haven't seen is
that there are other situations regarding Haitian immigrants . . .
This particular situation now affects us here at home, where one of
our great employees, Rego Moise, faces a very tough decision, where
his American citizen child would either be taken back to Haiti with
him or stay here in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, for the folks at Gleneagles, the intricacies of
immigration law were no longer abstractions to be followed only on
slow Sunday mornings when they had time for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they were real.
</P>
<P>
   It was no production error that the video included the phone
number for Janet Reno, just in case any of the club's 2,000
residents felt moved to pick up the phone and ask the U.S. attorney
general to do something _ which, as you might have guessed, they
did. It also included a clip from the NBC Nightly News, in which
Tom Brokaw, who learned of the case through the media grapevine,
featured the Moise family's plight in a bit of enterprise reporting
during the heat of the Elian crisis. The lead-in said, ``For other
immigrants, there's great frustration _ and great outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   And that might have been the end of it, except this is
Gleneagles, so it wasn't. When Congressman Robert Wexler, D-Boca
Raton, opened his mail this spring, he found 500 letters expressing
support for one Rigaud Moise.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what?
</P>
<P>
   They all carried the same postmark.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM
</P>
<P>
   It is a Monday afternoon, and everybody's favorite houseman has
asked for the day off to meet at his home with a reporter. His boss
said yes right away.
</P>
<P>
   His is an American Dream house, pink on the outside and lace
curtains inside, not too big or fancy but comfortable, with a
computer in the dining room. There's a porch and a nice back yard,
and if you drop by on a summer afternoon, you might hear Jean
Moise, handsome at 13, trying out a few tunes on the trumpet. His
sister, Phara, 11, plays the flute, and she likes it well enough,
but music is just a pastime: She is definitely going to be a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there's Rickerson, the boy. You can ask him questions,
and he might say something or he might not, because he's shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to be an American citizen, Rickerson?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you live here. Not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the dining room table, his parents nod their heads. That is
what it means, precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Rigaud Moise and Cinette Dorlus were married May 11, 1987, in a
town near Port-au-Prince. He had a job in the military.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, according to the story he has told
since he stepped onto American soil, his captain ordered him to
shoot into a street full of anti-government demonstrators, and he
refused. ``I said, 'No, I will not. I will not take people's
lives.''' Eventually, he was jailed, and military thugs shot at the
roof of his home while his wife and baby daughter shivered inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' Cinette Dorlus says, ``that my breast milk
changed; the baby got sick.'' She felt sick herself with nerves
when she obtained a fake passport and with her tiny daughter got on
a plane to Miami. The doctored paper was good enough to get out of
Port-au-Prince, but in Miami, ``They held it to my face and said,
'This is not you.''' She spent a night in detention and then, like
so many refugees, was released to live with relatives and begin the
lengthy asylum process.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, her husband came to America, too. He slipped away
from his captors, collected his 3-year-old son from his mother, and
traveled by plane _ one of 10,000 Haitian refugees to arrive with
false documents in the '80s and early '90s. Moise told immigration
officials his story, and, like his wife, was released. Right away
he landed a job _ at Gleneagles _ and applied for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, an immigration judge said no: Moise had not been
physically mistreated, and he could not prove he would be
persecuted if he returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Now his lawyer, Michael D. Ray, is waiting for more bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The family has applied for residency under the Haitian Refugee
Immigration Fairness Act, but Ray says they certainly won't get it.
The 1998 law does not include special provisions for people who
came with false documents and do not have a close relative living
legally in the United States _ children like Rickerson do not
count.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fairness Act, the family has one more appeal, and it
will probably drag on, as appeals do.
</P>
<P>
   And then, says Cinette Dorlus, crying, ``It's goodbye to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sliver of hope, a sparkling fairy tale in Rigaud
Moise's mind. He considers it now, sitting with his family at his
dining room table in Pompano Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is thinking of passing a bill that would give refugees
like the Moises the right to stay in America on humanitarian
grounds. It is a complicated proposition, and nobody is saying it
will pass anytime soon, but it might pass sometime, especially if
anybody up on the Hill reads all those letters the folks at
Gleneagles are sending.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this,'' the houseman says, pulling out a brochure and
pointing to the men and women who populate the United States
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fine people of Gleneagles sent me to Washington to
lobby with Rickerson. I saw this lady, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. And Mr.
Robert Wexler. And this one, Mr. Alcee Hastings.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more names. He reads them off. He remembers how
Rickerson wore his clip-on tie.
</P>
<P>
   For just a moment, he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   No, perhaps the bill won't pass. No, he does not have his
citizenship, or even permanent residency. No, he might not be able
to stay in America. Yes, he might have to decide what to do with
his youngest son if everybody else in his family is deported.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there's this:
</P>
<P>
   Rigaud Moise has been to Washington, and for a very brief
moment, he stood like any good American on the steps of the
Capitol.

GEORGE IRVING BELL, 73, PIONEER IN STUDIES OF HUMAN GENOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Ill.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. George Irving Bell, a biophysicist at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory and a leader in its human genome studies, died
on May 28 in Los Alamos, N.M., where he lived. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia complications after surgery, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was a founder of the Center for Human Genome Studies, which
was organized at Los Alamos in 1988 with him as acting director.
The center participates in the public consortium, sponsored by the
National Institutes of Health, that has worked for 10 years to
decode the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Human Genome Project, as it is known, is to
decode the three billion units of human DNA and thereby usher in an
era in which diseases will be analyzed and treated in terms of the
genes that cause or influence them. To that end, the Los Alamos
laboratory is also participating in the Department of Energy's
Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, Calif., a venture with
Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   While heading the genome studies center for a year, Bell
continued as director of the laboratory's theoretical biology and
biophysics division, which he had led since 1974. He was named a
senior laboratory fellow in 1989 and retired the next year, but
continued his research until last September.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a mountain climber, was a member of a team that climbed
two of the highest Andean peaks in Peru in the 1950s and took part
in many treks and climbs in the Himalayas. He had hiked 14 miles
the weekend before he died.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell was born in Evanston, Ill. He graduated from Harvard
with a degree in physics in 1947, and four years later he received
a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Cornell. He joined the staff at
Los Alamos the same year, working in the theoretical division when
it was producing designs for thermonuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sequencing the human genome, his specialties were
theoretical physics and immunology, nuclear reactor theory and
mathematical models in biophysics. He contributed more than 100
papers, many of them offering novel theoretical approaches to
biological problems.
</P>
<P>
   He was a co-author of ``Nuclear Reactor Theory'' (1970) and a
co-editor of ``Theoretical Immunology'' (1978) and ``Computers and
DNA'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   Bell is survived by his wife of 46 years, Virginia Lotz Bell; a
daughter, Carolyn Prince, of Los Alamos; a son, George Jr., of
Boulder, Colo.; a sister, Dr. Barbara Bell, a solar physicist at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; and five
grandchildren.

JANE PRIZANT GILMAN, 73, LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane Prizant Gilman, a lawyer who was long active in
civic, civil rights and political organizations, died June 7 in
Middletown, N.Y. She was 73 and lived in Hudson, N.Y., and
Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Gilman studied at Adelphi University and St.
John's University before she received her law degree from New York
University in 1950. In 1956, she moved to Orange County and became
a partner in the firm of Gilman, Gilman &AMP; Guerreiro.
</P>
<P>
   She held leadership positions in the Orange Association for the
Help of Retarded Children, the County Health Organization and local
branches of the NAACP and the League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, Gilman was a lawyer for the Temporary
Commission on the Courts of the State of New York, a panel on court
reform known as the Tweed Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Orange County Human Rights Commission honored
Gilman for her pro bono work for poor women and others needing
legal help. She was in private practice in Middletown until her
death.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman was married in 1957 to Benjamin Gilman, a law partner and
fellow Republican, and in 1972 worked in his successful campaign
for Congress. Her own bid for the nomination for state attorney
general in 1978 was rebuffed by the party organization in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   After her divorce that year from Rep. Gilman, she married Manuel
G. Guerreiro, a former judge on the Family Court of New York City,
who died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Susan Harts of
Bedford Hills, N.Y.; two sons, Jonathan P. Gilman of Flemington,
N.J., and Harrison P. Gilman of Middletown; a stepdaughter, Beatriz
A. Guerreiro-Rowe of Darien, Conn.; a stepson, Matthew Guerreiro of
Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.

 &HT;    Earnhardts side by side for Father's Day
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Dale Earnhardt Jr. doesn't plan on giving his
dad any presents today for Father Day's _ at least on the race
track.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. and his famous father will start side-by-side together
on eighth row of today's Pocono 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hadn't thought too much about Father's Day,''
admitted Dale Jr. ``Dad and I are starting on the same row, and
he's probably going to want me to cut him some slack. But he knows
that won't happen. There's not much you can do to help anyone get
around this track.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dale Sr. has needed anyone's help recently. ``The
Intimidator''has had four consecutive finishes in the top 10,
including being the runner-up in the rain-shortened Michigan race
last Sunday. He is confident he can extend it to five races in row
today.
</P>
<P>
   Pocono is an important race for the Chevy No. 3 driver. Winston
Cup points leader Bobby Labonte swept the two events at the
tri-oval last year. Dale Sr. is second in the point standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a top-10 car right now, but we're not a top-five car
yet,'' Dale Sr. said. ``We're going to tune it and get it where
it's a top-five car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Labonte is there every week. We were faster than him in
practice, but that doesn't mean a lot. Tony Stewart is strong
again. He's running good, so we've got our work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an Earnhardt family reunion at Pocono this weekend.
Dale Sr. was on the headsets Saturday, giving tips to his oldest
son Kerry, who won his first ARCA race. Today, he will start next
to his son Dale for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. does have a Father Day's wish: ``It'd be great if Dad
and I ended up racing for the win. Hopefully, that will happen
sooner or later, but it would be real neat if it happened on
Father's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   After today's race, Dale Sr. will devote his attention to his
youngest daughter, 11-year-old Taylor Nicole. Wife Teresa and the
two are leaving for a three-day camping trip to New Mexico on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get away for a few days before we go to Sears
Point,'' Dale Sr. said. ``I haven't taken her out on a trip like
this before. If the fishing is any good, we might do it. We're
going to camp, roast marshmallows, tell ghost stories, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably tell Indian stories. A lot of history of the
Apache Indians is around the place. Racing keeps me busy, so this
will be a good chance to spend some time with Taylor.''

CONTRACT NOT CONCERN FOR BAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dusty Baker has more wins than any San Francisco
Giants manager, but just how many he'll tack on after this season
is in question.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's contract expires after the season, and negotiations
aren't expected to begin again until the season ends. Baker, adored
by his players and widely regarded as one of the top managers in
the game, received a two-year contract offer before the season
worth about $1.2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what transpires,'' Baker said. ``Right now, the ball
is in my court. I want to concentrate on getting the team going,
seeing more consistency from them. That's what my focus is now. The
contract stuff will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker passed Roger Craig with his 587th victory in Monday's 10-2
win against Cincinnati. He's 590-541 since taking over in 1993.
Craig was 586-566 from 1985 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Baker a new contract isn't the motivation of the
players, but they know the situation. And they understand Baker's
importance to the Giants' success. They entered Saturday 32-31, 5
games behind Arizona and in fourth place in the National League
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some managers have $90-million payrolls to work with, Dusty is
doing it with $60 million or less,'' Giants second baseman Jeff
Kent said. ``People want to play for him. I don't know what the
Giants are going to do. Dusty is a guy players want to play for.
He's a quality manager, and he's earned the respect of his players.
One of the reasons I signed on here was the attributes he brings to
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim delivers: Arizona's submarining right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim
has saved the past three Diamondbacks wins and is manager Buck
Showalter's closer, taking the job from Matt Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has everything you want in a closer, which is the ability to
throw strikes and strike out batters. He's 2-3 with a 1.67 ERA, but
the most impressive thing the 21-year-old has done is strike out 55
in 32 innings. He's walked 12, and the Diamondbacks public
relations office is pushing for an All-Star bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why,'' the Angels' Garret Anderson said of Kim's
strikeout ratio. ``Here's somebody throwing something you don't see
every day. If he keeps the ball down and throws strikes the way he
is, he is going to continue to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the catch is Kim wants to be a starter like fellow Korean
Chan Ho Park of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He's been saying that
since signing a four-year, $2.25-million deal before the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in Atlanta (again): As if the Braves haven't had enough
problems with their bullpen, right-hander Rudy Seanez is out for
the season after an MRI revealed a completely torn medial
collateral ligament in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez was 2-4 with a 4.29 ERA in 23 games. He'll become the
15th pitcher in the organization to undergo the so-called Tommy
John surgery in the past two years. With John Rocker unable to find
the plate (or his sense), manager Bobby Cox said he'll turn to
Kerry Ligtenberg to close games.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, Rockies meet: Colorado Rockies general manager Dan
O'Dowd visited with first-round pick Matt Harrington of Palmdale
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to sit with the family and talk to them
about the organization, our people, our goals, where their son fits
in, the development system, how he's going to be treated,'' O'Dowd
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that a mother and father are worried about. After that,
we'll get the kid in here so he can see the facilities, meet the
quality of ownership and all the people he's going to be working
for, and after that you begin to talk about money. There's more
issues at this stage in their life than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is expected to ask for between $3 million and $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: There was an Alex Gonzalez sighting in
Philadelphia. The Florida Marlins shortstop, benched this month
because of anemic hitting, had three extra-base hits and five RBI
in one game. Gonzalez was hitting .160, worst in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a shortstop, ladies and gentlemen,'' Marlins manager
John Boles said. ``Welcome back, Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby on market: Philadelphia right-hander Andy Ashby is on the
trading block, and scouts from Cincinnati, Arizona, St. Louis and
the Yankees went to watch him pitch last week. Ashby is 2-7 with a
6.16 ERA.

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The remarkable summit meeting between the Korean
leaders last week has left the Clinton administration widely
divided over North Korea's intentions, but has not so far
diminished its resolve to move ahead with a missile defense,
administration and defense officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent diplomatic forays that culminated in a general
agreement between the Korean leaders to work for peace and unity on
their divided peninsula, North Korea has not stopped work on the
long-range missile program that has helped provoke proposals for
the United States to build a defensive shield, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a highly classified intelligence report being prepared
for President Clinton will conclude that, if the current pace of
development remains unchanged, North Korea could still build a
missile capable of striking the United States by 2005, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Without more concrete agreements and changes in North Korea's
behavior, the officials said, it would not be prudent to back away
from plans to build the missile defense now, despite the fact that
the proposal has roiled relations with Russia, China and even
America's European allies. Three days of smiles and toasts, they
emphasized, do not erase years of effort by North Korea to build
nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not from the summit and not from any of the other things have
we seen any signs that they are changing their program to develop
missiles,'' Walter Slocombe, the under secretary of defense for
policy, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials acknowledge that they will face
even greater diplomatic pressure after last week's summit meeting
to forswear the shield.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the striking scenes of the Korean leaders
warmly embracing, holding hands and clinking Champagne glasses have
underscored divisions within the administration over how _ and how
quickly _ to proceed with a defensive shield and what the North's
true intentions might be.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, officials acknowledge that the summit meeting has
helped fuel some doubts over much of the rationale for a missile
defense, which is that the North Korean government was so
irrational and unpredictable that it would not respond to normal
threats of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we argue that we face the same threat if we have a North
Korea trying to integrate into the international community?'' a
former senior defense official said, referring obliquely to the
administration's characterization of North Korea as a rogue state.
Noting that North Korea's diplomatic steps have seemed well
calculated in recent months, the official added: ``How can we at
the same time argue that it is an irrational state?''
</P>
<P>
   The North's diplomatic opening has already prompted the White
House to indicate that it will lift a broad set of economic
sanctions that have been in place since North Korea invaded South
Korea 50 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, by
telephone on Thursday and met on Friday in New York with South
Korea's national security adviser, Wong Won Tak, to discuss the
summit meeting. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
that she would go to South Korea next week for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But officials repeatedly emphasized that it is too soon to
evaluate promises of cooperation from North Korea, and that they
were looking for more concrete steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see something more than handshakes and speeches,''
a four-star military officer said. For starters, he suggested that
the North could withdraw some of its formidable artillery dug in
near the border within easy range of Seoul, the South's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting this week has left various parts of the
administration with widely divergent interpretations as to its
significance.
</P>
<P>
   The most wary assessment, held by some senior military
officials, is that it remains impossible to decipher the true
motives of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, who before this
week had been described by U.S. officials as reclusive and
paranoid. They darkly suggest that he is in league with China and
Russia to undercut support for an U.s. missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pentagon and State Department officials, on the other hand,
are cautiously optimistic that the North is indeed beginning to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some senior intelligence officials say they believe
that reconciliation between the North and South, driven by the
determination of the 75-year-old South Korean president, will
happen faster than anyone can predict.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that the summit meeting together with
North Korea's other recent diplomatic overtures might yet force a
reconsideration of U.S. assumptions about North Korea's intentions,
but they said their assessment of the North missile abilities has
remained unchanged. The most recent intelligence finding that is to
be presented to Clinton reaches the same conclusion as last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea reached an agreement with the United States
last fall to suspend testing of missiles like the one fired over
Japan in 1998, the North Korean military has not suspended
development of a new generation of missiles, known as the Taepo
Dong 2, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has honored its pledge not to test-fire its missiles
and even renewed that pledge early this year, but intelligence
analysts say they still detect work at that site, as well as other
types of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to test motors, missile engines and things like
that,'' said a senior military officer who closely monitors North
Korea. ``There's nothing on their launch pads, but they're
continuing to make improvements'' at the test site.

</P>
<P>
   Since this week's summit meeting, officials in Washington have
tried to tamp down expectations that one of the last fronts of the
Cold War may soon disappear, fundamentally altering U.S. security
interests in Asia, including the presence of some 37,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea and its assessment of North Korea's missile
threat. The day after the summit meeting, the Pentagon's spokesman,
Kenneth Bacon, called for ``warier, controlled exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon, in particular, were adamant that
whatever diplomatic progress was made, the United States was still
justified in moving ahead with a limited national missile defense,
the first phase of which is explicitly intended to counter a threat
from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The latest assessment of North Korea's missile threat is
critical to the Pentagon's plans to develop a limited defense,
beginning with 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The current timetable for building the $60-billion system is
based entirely on last year's estimate that North Korea could have
the ability to hit the United States with nuclear- or
chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a system in place by then, the Pentagon's
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization needs to begin construction
of its first sophisticated radar site in Alaska by next spring, and
a decision must be made by Clinton before then.
</P>
<P>
   The new intelligence report on potential missile threats _ known
as a National Intelligence Estimate _ was ordered by the White
House to update last year's assessment as Clinton nears a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's intelligence report concluded that North Korea's
long-range missile program had advanced much further than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, North Korea tested a three-stage missile, known
as a Taepo Dong 1, by firing it over Japan. The third stage of that
missile, which carried a small satellite, failed to reach orbit,
but intelligence officials concluded that other aspects of the test
had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's report concluded that the Taepo Dong 1 was not
sophisticated enough to carry a nuclear warhead and that North
Korea was more likely to put weapons on a more advanced missile,
the Taepo Dong 2.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the new intelligence report had concluded that
North Korea would still be able to field an intercontinental
ballistic missile by 2005. ``Certainly there is no evidence they
have stopped their development program for the Taepo Dong 2,'' a
senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean threat is not the only factor Clinton must
consider before moving ahead, but the intelligence findings will
support arguments made by supporters of a missile defense that the
United States needs a defensive shield. Opponents are sure to seize
on the diplomatic developments to argue for postponing a decision
on deploying a shield.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even before the summit meeting, the administration was
struck by North Korea's relative opening after years of wary
seclusion. In recent months, Kim has begun a flurry of diplomatic
initiatives, including establishing relations with Italy, Brunei
and Australia and applying for membership in forums of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have also revived their on-again-off-again
discussions with the United States. At the end of May, North Korean
negotiators surprised their U.S. counterparts during a meeting in
Rome by asking to discuss their missile program, and a new round of
talks is expected soon. Only June 9, the North Korean Army agreed
to resume cooperating with searches for the remains of U.S.
soldiers killed in the Korean War, and the first team is scheduled
to arrive later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear by looking at North Korea's behavior that
something has changed in the last year, year and a half,'' the
assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, Stanley Roth, told
defense writers before the summit meeting. ``The hermit kingdom has
become the hyperactive kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans applauded this week's
summit meeting as a welcome first step in defusing one of the
world's most dangerous hot spots, but warned against dropping
America's guard against the North's still formidable conventional
and nuclear military threat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., who is on the Intelligence Committee,
spoke for many of his colleagues: ``I would hope no serious person
would assume we could change our policy on a dime just because of
what happened in the last couple of days.''

REDS NOT MAKING LIFE EASY FOR McKEON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim Bowden brought
home the city's favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   It's caused nothing but inflated expectations and the type of
losing that brings job security into question.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, heralded last season for managing a bullpen to
near-perfection and getting the fiscally aware Reds into a one-game
playoff with the Mets, all of a sudden can't manage. Or, that's
what the inside word is, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. has boosted attendance in Cincinnati, but that
doesn't mean much these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds entered Saturday's game at San Diego with one win in
seven games on their current road trip, losers of nine of their
past 10 and 13 of their past 18 to fall 5 games behind St. Louis in
the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden met with the coaching staff and McKeon in San Diego on
Thursday. And while he's saying McKeon, last season's manager of
the year, is safe, there's an undercurrent in the clubhouse that
wouldn't mind a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the manager,'' Bowden said. ``He can't pitch for them,
hit for them or field for them. It's the same manager and coaching
staff that won 96 games last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain Barry Larkin, in the middle of his own contract
negotiations that aren't going too well, thought about a team
meeting to drag the Reds out of the doldrums that has dropped them
to 32-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a message from someone in the front office that it was
time for a meeting,'' Larkin said. ``I talked to some players; the
consensus is that we're really busting our (butt). There's nobody
sloughing off.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon and Larkin talked about a possible team meeting, and
McKeon agreed with his shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that going to get any runs?'' McKeon said. ``What we're
looking for is something between the lines. Talk is not going to
get it. We're playing for professional pride. I think some of the
guys have to look in the mirror and figure it out for themselves.
Yeah, I have an occasional meeting. But I don't like to beat them
(players) when they're down.''
</P>
<P>
   While Larkin is the captain and is highly respected in the
clubhouse, talk of a meeting sounded fine to left-hander Denny
Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are little things you can do as individuals and as a
team to spark ourselves,'' Neagle said. ``Last year we did that. We
always knew the right time to fire guys up, when to call a
players-only meeting. Whether it's time or not, some of us veterans
need to sit down and talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of the Reds' losing is a lack of run production. The
Reds are in the bottom half of the National League with 218 runs
scored. But Cincinnati isn't pitching well, either. Its 4.85 ERA is
10th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Friday's loss to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Steve Parris allowed five runs in the first inning
and lasted just three innings in falling to 2-10. That puts an
enormous burden on the bullpen, which was rested after Thursday's
off day but then had to throw five innings against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's amazing that we're in second place, only 5 games
out of first, the way we've played,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the impact of Griffey Jr. isn't what anyone expected.
He tried to doctor his swing early in the season and that didn't
work. Now, the thinking is he may be trying to do too much,
especially at home. He's hitting .229.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a unit, we're not playing together yet,'' Bowden said.
``Sometimes when you add new faces, it takes time for a team to
jell. But it's only June. We have time.''

CULT-LIKE STATUS TRANSFERRED TO ASSAD'S SON AT PARTY SESSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS _ As Bashar Assad strode into the modern marble and
glass conference center Saturday in his dark suit, cutting through
the burst of camera flashes with a confident gait, he looked like a
campaigner in any Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But that was where comparisons to democracy ended at the opening
of the ruling Baath Party's first convention in 15 years, where the
34-year-old Bashar is expected to be anointed its new leader.
</P>
<P>
   For the Baath Party, led for 30 years by Bashar's father, Hafez
Assad, there is no opposition, no challenge to the appointment
during the five-day gathering. Such a move is part of the carefully
scripted succession plan by the elder Assad, the Syrian president,
who died of a heart attack on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cold, imposing Socialist-style architecture of the
conference hall, the 1,000 party delegates bristled when Western
reporters pressed them about Bashar's ascendancy and Syria's
profound economic and political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned directly, many of the Baath delegates simply
pursed their lips, quickly shook their heads, and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily guarded gathering began somberly, with a minute of
silence. Then delegates, without music or applause, began chanting
the party anthem.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, party leaders heaped praise upon the politically
inexperienced Bashar, 34, an ophthalmologist who had never held a
formal party post. ``We salute the hope of the future . . . Bashar
Assad,'' declared Suleiman Qaddah, the party's assistant secretary
general, to widespread applause. ``We are with you, comrade, and
behind you we will continue the march to express our commitment and
loyalty to the path of'' Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the nation seems to be dutifully transferring the
cult-like status it gave to Hafez Assad to his son. On street
corners, in shop windows, and in the back windows of Damascus's
battered old cars, there are posters and banners declaring Bashar
the nation's hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of his daily activities and endless photographs of him
fill the pages of the country's newspapers _ all tightly
state-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The party hierarchy seems to view Bashar as a symbol of both
continuity and change. He is a candidate who will continue his
father's hard line on foreign policy but also set out on his own
course of economic reform and modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the party announced its nomination of Bashar for
president. A formal nomination is expected to be announced during
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Then the parliament, the People's Assembly, will endorse the
nomination. When parliament reconvenes on June 25, it will set a
date for a nationwide referendum, which is not expected to be held
until the end of the traditional 40-day period of mourning over the
death of the late president.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar is, of course, one of the estimated 2 million Baath Party
members. That is roughly one-quarter of the estimated 8 million
Syrians of voting age.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed the path to the presidency after his elder brother,
Basil, who was being groomed for the job, died in a car accident in
1994. Before that, Bashar was quietly pursuing his own career as an
eye doctor and studying at a university in London.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the huge, wood-paneled convention hall, oil-painted
portraits of both his brother and his father looked down upon
Bashar as he set out on an uncertain course in the shifting
political landscape of the Middle East.

KREUTER, FETTERS CLICK WITH DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When their teammates start joking around, Chad
Kreuter and Mike Fetters turn to each other and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at each other and say this is nothing compared to what
we did in college,'' said Fetters, adding that most of their antics
``can't be put on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be put on paper is how well the pair performed on the
baseball field as teammates at Pepperdine in the mid-1980s. The two
are together again after making the Los Angeles Dodgers as
non-roster invitees this year, and both are having seasons that
rank with the best of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, a 35-year-old from Van Nuys, spent much of last year
recovering from elbow surgery and went on the disabled list again
this season with elbow problems, but he has been one of the
Dodgers' most effective relievers when healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander entered this weekend's series against the St.
Louis Cardinals with one save in 16 appearances, the staff's lowest
ERA (1.76) and a 2-0 record, marking the first time since 1996 he
has won more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter's performance is a bigger breakthrough. The 35-year-old
catcher entered the season with a .236 career batting average and
having hit better than .275 only once in 12 major-league seasons.
He is hitting over .300 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Getting regular playing time while Todd Hundley is on the
disabled list has helped, but Kreuter has hit consistently since
getting three hits in his Dodgers debut on the second day of the
season. He had a 10-game hitting streak that ended in early June
and has reached base in 23 of 25 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all,'' Fetters said of Kreuter. ``It's
something I've expected out of Chad Kreuter. In college, he was one
of our better players, and it's carried over to the pros. He's
always been hard-nosed, always giving 100 percent each time he
steps on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter attributes the improved numbers to patience at the plate
and trying to put backspin on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things (hitting coach Rick Down) said to me
in spring training is, `I want you to lead the league in fly
balls,''' Kreuter said. ``It sounds funny, but for me, if I'm
hitting fly balls, I'll be hitting a lot of line drives rather than
ground balls. I'm not gonna beat out a lot of ground balls in the
infield.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as Kreuter is doing, he has no delusions of remaining
the full-time catcher when Hundley soon returns from a strained
rib-cage injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed here as a No. 2 guy, and I'd be kidding myself if I
wasn't true to that,'' Kreuter said. ``I do what I can do. Once you
try to do too much, you fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a role player, there's two different levels of
making it difficult on yourself. If you're a guy who feels like
he's not getting a fair shake, that he's not in there enough, you
make it difficult on yourself. It's harder to play because you go
out there with so much pressure on yourself to perform while you're
in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my situation this year is that I know what my role is. I
know I'm the No. 2 guy no matter what I do on an everyday basis. It
doesn't matter if I go 4 for 4 on a Sunday. On Monday, Todd's gonna
be back in there. Knowing that makes it easier to prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter and Fetters were both used to being starters when they
led Pepperdine to postseason appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters, who holds the Waves' record for innings pitched in a
season, began his professional career as a starting pitcher but
settled in the bullpen when the Angels, and then the Brewers, both
had established rotations.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the majors has Kreuter played in more than 100
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chad doesn't play for a month, he'll be prepared the day he
gets in a game,'' Fetters said. ``If he plays every day, he's
prepared every day. He's constantly working on his game. Chad's a
guy that's always prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like me, all he wants to do is win. That's what the game
is all about.''

BUSH CRITICIZES SECURITY LAPSES AT LOS ALAMOS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas crisscrossed
Florida Sunday with his brother _ the other Governor Bush _ at his
side, and slammed security lapses at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, saying ``America's nuclear security should not be a
matter of lost and found.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Florida state
convention in Kissimmee, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee promised, ``In my administration our national labs will be
secure again, our vital information will be sealed again, our
nuclear secrets will be safe again.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating the disappearance and
reappearance at the laboratory of two computer hard drives
containing nuclear secrets. The hard drives were found on Friday
behind a copying machine in a secure area after being reported
missing on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day was more light-hearted, with the Texas governor
even teasing reporters with the possibility of a Bush-Bush ticket.
As he fended off the daily deluge of questions on his campaign
plane about his vice-presidential search, Bush turned to his
brother Jeb, who was standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' the governor of Texas asked the governor
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stick to my day job,'' Jeb hastily replied.
</P>
<P>
   But the older brother relished the idea a moment longer. ``It
would save space on bumper stickers,'' he said, imagining just one
word: Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If not a ticket, the Bush brothers were still a hit with the
veterans, who gave them a string of standing, cheering ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly want to say something about the governor of
Florida _ my big little brother,'' said George Bush, 53, referring
to Jeb, 47, who stands half a head taller than him. ``We're all
proud of him, and we know you are as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came with a positive agenda,'' the Texan said, ``he's
serving for the right reason, and both of us have been successful
because we listened to our mother.''
</P>
<P>
   With his brother serving as governor, Bush should have a
powerful advantage campaigning for Florida's 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Vice President Al Gore has also mounted an all-out drive for
the state. He even broke with the Clinton administration by
supporting legislation to grant permanent resident status to Elian
Gonzalez, a move that brought protests from many loyal Gore
backers, who called it a craven bid to win Cuban-American votes.
</P>
<P>
   The last public poll taken, in May, showed Bush ahead but Gore
gaining ground. President Clinton won Florida four years ago after
narrowly losing it to former President Bush in 1992. Asked how his
brother was doing, Jeb told reporters on the campaign plane, ``He's
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida governor conceded that if Gore were to select
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida as his running mate, ``it would tighten
the race up.'' Asked if Gore could win Florida, Jeb said:
``Everything's possible. I'm pretty optimistic, though. As long as
we get a few resources from the national campaign we'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the day, in fact, was devoted to raising money for the
campaign. George W. Bush brought in an estimated $2.75 million for
the Republican National Committee and the state party at a midday
reception in Coral Gables and at a fund-raising dinner later here
in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also won the endorsement of the Florida
chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the
nation's oldest and largest Hispanic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Bush family have said, until he lost his first
bid to be governor of Florida, they had expected that Jeb would be
the brother to run for president. But Jeb said Saturday he did not
have any ambitions to seek the presidency himself. ``I'm consumed
by my work and my family,'' he said, ``and I've got the best job in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers were dressed nearly identically in blue shirts
and red ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting that you brought that up,'' George said, when
asked whether the choice of dress was intentional. ``You can see
mine's a little kind of softer tone. It's a little more
presidential look.''

POLICE ARREST ANOTHER IN CENTRAL PARK SEX ASSAULT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police announced another arrest Saturday in a
series of sexual assaults in and near Central Park last Sunday.
Meanwhile, the police said, an arrest was thrown out after a victim
reviewed videotapes and said an earlier identification of one of
her attackers had been in error.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events left 15 young men charged in the case as the
number of victims climbed to 50, said Detective John Giammarino, a
police spokesman.

   Jason Commissiong, 20, of Brooklyn, N.Y., was charged when he
surrendered in the early hours of Saturday morning after learning
that detectives had been looking for him at his home. The
investigators were acting on a tip to the Police Department's Crime
Stoppers telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The police also voided the arrest of one of the men already
charged in the case, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, another police
spokesman. Nikas said the man, Anthony Bryant, 25, had surrendered
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had been in the park near the scene of some of the
attacks and was on one of 10 amateur videotapes that the police
used to cull pictures of suspects, Nikas said. The tape shows him
talking on a cellular telephone, but one of the victims pointed him
out and said he had abused her, the sergeant said. But after
viewing the tape at a slower speed, she said that the attacker had
looked very much like Bryant but was in fact a different man, Nikas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The police were expected Saturday to release photographs of six
additional suspects, Giammarino said.

STAPLES CENTER HASN'T BEEN KIND TO PACERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Indiana Pacers were feeling good after their
33-point thrashing of the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 on Friday
night. Not too good, but still very good.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers know they still trail the best-of-seven NBA
Finals 3-2 and now have to win two games in a place where they've
yet to win - Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers lost their only regular-season game at Staples, and
then the two opening games of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco Fieldhouse proved a warm environment for their shooting,
but Staples has been another story.
</P>
<P>
   And since no team in NBA history has ever come back from a 3-1
deficit in the Finals, the Pacers know there is still imposing work
ahead at Staples, blowout win or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned about going on the road and playing,''
Pacers coach Larry Bird said. ``It's not the homecourt. We haven't
played well in Staples Center this year, but now we have a bit more
confidence than we've ever had going there. Hopefully, we can pull
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Pacers forward-center Sam Perkins figures the Pacers
have new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we do,'' he said. ``There's no reason why we don't
think we can win down there. We've fared well on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't in the first two games there, but that seems like so
long ago. It seems like we have a handle on things, and we'll just
have to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Home is where the shot is: One of the big reasons for the
Pacers' success at Conseco Fieldhouse is how well they shoot there.
</P>
<P>
   They feel comfortable at home, and it's been reflected in their
shooting during the first five games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   In the three games at Conseco Fieldhouse, the Pacers shot .509
from the floor and .474 from beyond the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   In their two losses at Staples Center, they were .396 from the
field and .294 on their 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all mental,'' Pacers guard Reggie Miller said.
``You have to go in there, concentrate and hit shots. They're
hitting shots, so you know there's really nothing wrong with the
rims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold that parade: The Pacers were proud and cautious after their
win Friday (neither team worked out Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's just one win,'' Pacers forward Jalen Rose said.
``We're not in control. They're still the team in control, they're
still the team with three (victories).
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still the team that has fight. We know California's
going to be ready to celebrate. We heard about the parade that they
have planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't be tomorrow, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Mark Jackson: ``So many people got ready for a
celebration, which was disrespectful to us and the character we
have on this team. We wanted to give ourselves a chance to go back
and see what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's honest talk: Rose, after going just 5 of 16 from the
field in the fourth-game overtime loss, went 12 of 18 in the fifth
game to lead the Pacers with 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand we have what it takes to beat L.A.,'' Rose said.
``But it means nothing talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And since I felt like I've been doing nothing but talking
about it, especially when they got up 3-1, I figured I was going to
shut up and go out and play.''

INDIANS FANS CAN'T STOP STUFFING IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Thank you, Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a reason to change the method of All-Star
voting, the fans of Cleveland are making it clear.
</P>
<P>
   A check of the American League voting shows the Cleveland fans
are stuffing the ballots to the point where they have an Indian
leading the balloting at three of the eight positions.
</P>
<P>
   If the voting were to end today, Jim Thome would start at first
(ahead of Jason Giambi and Carlos Delgado?), Roberto Alomar would
be starting at second (ahead of Luis Alicea and Ray Durham?), and
Manny Ramirez would be starting in the outfield (ahead of Darin
Erstad and Carl Everett?).
</P>
<P>
   Even more ridiculous is Sandy Alomar (second in the voting at
catcher). Then there is Travis Fryman, who ranks second at third
base behind only Cal Ripken, and outfielders Kenny Lofton and David
Justice, who rank fourth and sixth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the fans should be a part of the voting. So here's the
solution to make the voting fair and still keep the fans involved.
</P>
<P>
   First, eliminate online voting. Stop the cyber-geeks from
dropping 5,000 votes a day on a player who once gave him/her an
autograph in a shopping mall. While it's true Major League Baseball
gets good PR by including the fans online, it's not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   So, how to distribute the ballots? Handing stacks of ballots to
fans at games only makes each ballot virtually worthless. A fan
with a hundred or so ballots will stuff it with his/her favorite
team's players, then maybe make a joke of other ballots, like
picking the players from their fantasy-league team.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make a ballot valuable, hand one ballot to each
ticketed fan at each major-league game. This rewards fans who
actually go to games. It also makes the ballot special, because a
fan is less likely to make a joke of his/her ballot if he/she gets
only one.
</P>
<P>
   It also rewards season-ticket holders, or fans who go to
numerous games. They would get a ballot each time they cross the
turnstile at the ballpark gate because they deserve it. They've
seen more baseball than fans who get their daily dose of highlights
on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa to Sox?: One team that figures to have the best shot at
trading for the Cubs' Sammy Sosa is the Red Sox. Sosa signed to
play for the Red Sox during the strike of 1994-95, but the contract
was rescinded once the strike was settled. But it's clear the Red
Sox are one team for which Sosa would gladly leave Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox infielder Manny Alexander, a former Cub and close friend
of Sosa's, has been talking to Sosa during the recent hoopla over
Sosa's status with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hopes he gets traded, and he hopes he gets traded here,''
Alexander told the Boston writers. ``We've got a lot of Latin
players here, plus Boston is a lot like Chicago. He's thinking
about coming here already to be with us all the Latin players here,
especially Pedro (Martinez), (Jose) Offerman, Ramon (Martinez).
Sammy loves to play where he's got a lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is making $10 million this season and is signed for $11
million next season, but salary should not be a problem for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Omar Olivares won a combined 15 games last season
with the Angels and A's, and the A's seemed to get a steal when
they acquired him from the Angels (along with Randy Velarde) for a
package of minor-leaguers. But Olivares has reverted to his
journeyman form - he's 0-5 with an 8.47 ERA in his past six starts
and is in danger of losing his spot in the rotation. ... Mariners
GM Pat Gillick is in the market for a second baseman. Mark McLemore
is struggling and still has to serve a suspension for charging the
mound to fight the Devil Rays' Esteban Yan. ... Blue Jays
outfielder Raul Mondesi broke a tooth recently. He explained it
happened when he was brushing his teeth ``too hard.'' Sure. ...
Former Dodgers prospect Karim Garcia, toiling in the Tigers'
minor-league system, was traded to the Orioles for future
considerations. Garcia was assigned to Triple-A Rochester. Garcia
played in eight games with the Tigers this season, hitting .176 (3
for 17).

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush criticizes Clinton about security
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush chastised the Clinton administration on Saturday
for its handling of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons
laboratory, saying that ``America's nuclear security should not be
a matter of lost and found.'' Bush, appearing with his brother,
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at the state convention of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, also blamed the administration for a ``slow slide to
military weakness'' shown through poor military recruiting and low
troop morale. Bush pledged to rebuild military strength with
lighter and more lethal weapons, and to restore morale by giving
troops clear missions and reducing peacekeeping assignments. On
Friday, two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets were
found at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   JEB BUSH PREDICTS FLORIDA WIN
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush predicted Saturday his older brother, George W. Bush,
will win Florida and contended Al Gore's campaign was ``bluffing''
about its ability to compete in the state. ``This reminds me a
little of '88, where the Dukakis campaign came in with a field
organization and they were talking about how they were going to
compete and do all these things, and then by the end, we had a
going-away party for them with a vote,'' Jeb Bush said referring to
the 1988 election when his father, former president George Bush,
won the state over Democrat Michael S. Dukakis. Democrats outnumber
Republicans in the state, which has 25 electoral votes, fourth most
in the country. A Florida poll in May put George W. Bush at 47
percent and Gore at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Bush won the endorsement of the Florida chapter
of LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the
nation's oldest and largest Hispanic organization.
</P>
<P>
   POLL: BUSH BEATS GORE BY 10 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   A new national poll found that Bush is leading Gore by a
10-point margin, 50 percent to 40 percent. The poll released Friday
by The Los Angeles Times found that Bush's support among fellow
Republicans was stronger than Gore's support among Democrats. Nine
of 10 Republicans said they backed Bush, while seven of 10
Democrats said they supported Gore. Bush also had substantially
more support among Democrats than Gore had among Republicans. The
poll of 1,600 voters has a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH BASHES GORE'S TAX PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused Gore of doubling the size of a proposed tax cut as
a last ditch way to attract voters. This week, Gore doubled the
size of his proposed tax cut to $500 billion over 10 years _ still
not as big as Bush's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan. A Gore aide even
suggested Friday that Gore could increase the tax cut by another
$20 billion to $30 billion if more surplus money becomes available.
``Surely America doesn't want a focus group-driven presidency,''
Bush said Friday.

FIRST LADY WALKS IN A PREDECESSOR'S FOOTSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has often
identified herself with Eleanor Roosevelt, spent 20 minutes
Saturday touring the two-story stone cottage to which Mrs.
Roosevelt retreated and where she lived out what she termed a
``complicated life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sat in Roosevelt's chairs, stood on her famous sleeping
porch and gazed at her books, her shortwave radios and her dining
room table, where world leaders like Winston Churchill joined her
for meals.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady went to the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic
Site to officially designate the cottage, called Val-Kill, as a
project of a national program raising money for homes and other
landmarks in need of repair and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Then she headed north to stump for her U.S. Senate campaign at a
county fair in Altamont, west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Allida Black, a professor at George Washington University and a
Roosevelt historian, introduced Clinton to several hundred donors
and others gathered under a tent outside the cottage as ``maybe the
only person on the planet who understands Eleanor Roosevelt more
than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton has often mentioned the life and work of
Roosevelt, who, at Val-Kill, was a prolific writer, churning out
newspaper columns, hundreds of articles, several books and, on
average, 150 personal letters a day.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton, who visited the cottage in 1995, noted
that Roosevelt was her age, 52, when she made Val-Kill a permanent
home in 1945, after her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
died.
</P>
<P>
   During her remarks, Clinton drew heavily on the political
symbolism of Roosevelt's work for human rights and other causes,
and spoke of ``keeping her dream alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She also alluded to the ridicule that erupted after Bob
Woodward, in a 1996 book, ``The Choice,'' said she carried on
imaginary conversations with Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   She said that during one of her first public appearances as
first lady, she told a crowd during an event at Lincoln Center in
New York City, ``You know, the White House just encourages me to
have conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd began laughing, she added, ``I meant it as a
metaphor. But it became yet again one of those things people talked
about, I guess sort of suggesting I really had gone off the deep
end. But you know, it's not a bad idea, to think about what Mrs.
Roosevelt would do or say.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing her remarks and thanking donors who had contributed
$150,000 to help restore the cottage, which has sustained water
damage and is missing pieces of furniture that were auctioned off
after Roosevelt died in 1962, she said, ``Next time I talk to her,
I will tell her everything you have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide who led Clinton through Val-Kill, Franceska Macsali
Urbin, the same guide who did so in 1995, said that on the first
tour Clinton was full of questions.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, she said, ``she wanted to drink in atmosphere and
feel what it would be like to be here when Mrs. Roosevelt was
here.''

DEEPLY DIVIDED ON SOSA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When one Red Sox veteran first heard that the team was exploring
the possibility of trading for Sammy Sosa, he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home runs,'' he said, ``are overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   There is truth in what on the face of it seems such a dismissive
remark. It has been written in these pages before, and it bears
repeating now, as Dan Duquette contemplates making a deal that
could be as franchise-defining as the Pedro Martinez trade after
the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   The last home run champion to play in a World Series was Hall of
Famer Mike Schmidt of the Phillies, and that was 20 years ago. You
have to go back to the 1985 Kansas City Royals and Steve ``Bye
Bye'' Balboni to find a World Series champ with a 35-homer hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa is a drawing card, a home run hitter, and he ain't
anything else,'' said an executive with another major league club.
``His defense has gone downhill, his arm has gone downhill, he's a
one-man band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Harry Caray with a bat. Harry wasn't the best announcer
of all time, but he was a great promoter. And Sosa isn't the best
player of all time, either.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if any team should know the value of having
one of the game's greatest sluggers, it should be the Sox, whose
last World Series title came the year before they sold the man who
was the Sammy Sosa of his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In American League parks,'' the same executive conceded,
``he'd be good. And in Boston, he could be huge. And the next two
or three years, while Pedro is still on top of his game, will be
Duquette's best chance to win anything for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Sox can land Sosa is another story. The same
team that built a dynasty around Babe Ruth may do whatever it takes
to ensure that Sosa will be in Yankee pinstripes to help them win
their third successive World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George is really in this,'' one scout said of George
Steinbrenner, ``then it's already all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, like his Boston
counterpart, has been looking for a bat for weeks. Entering the
weekend, the Sox and Yankees, though at the top of the American
League East, ranked 12th and 13th, respectively, in runs. The
Yankees can offer the Cubs a package that includes big league
outfielders Ricky Ledee and Shane Spencer, shortstop Alfonso
Soriano, outfield prospect Jackson Melian, and a pitcher such as
Eddie Yarnall.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox feel they have more attractive prospects in pitchers
Tomo Ohka and Sunny Kim, first baseman Dernell Stenson, and catcher
Steve Lomasney, and that Trot Nixon is a better big leaguer than
Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, of course, whether the Cubs agree. It
also remains to be seen whether Duquette will strip his system of
top prospects to land Sosa, though the GM hasn't been shy about
parting with young pitching in other deals.
</P>
<P>
   A compelling case can be made that the Sox need another starting
pitcher more than they need another bat. Or that Sammy just isn't
the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy whiffs a lot,'' another big league scout said. ``He's a
terrible defensive player. He'll be changing leagues. And you're
going to have to give him six or seven years in an extension, and
in a couple of years who knows how many home runs he's going to hit
for you? And he'll change the makeup of your club.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you've gone 82 years without winning a World Series,
two years down the road ceases to be the primary consideration.
Martinez is giving this team a rare window of opportunity that
could close within a moment's notice. The sight of him throwing in
the high 80s last Wednesday in New York while he nursed a sore
oblique muscle should be reminder enough of the man's mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Do you pass on Sosa because he might disrupt your team's
chemistry? Not from this vantage point, you don't. Carl Everett,
for all his splendor on the field, is not universally admired in
the Sox clubhouse, because he frequently is the last one in the
house, the last one on the field to stretch, and the first to utter
comments that teammates find either too provocative or nonsensical.
But as long as Everett produces and plays hard, teammates will be
willing to look the other way at the other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's biggest sins, from what we gather, include complaints
about the clubhouse music, the presence of a brigade-sized
entourage, and the overuse of cell phones, which were banned from
the Cubs clubhouse. Jimy Williams has no such restrictions on cell
phones, there's a team rule against playing music in the clubhouse,
and Sammy let his entourage in Chicago know they can't invade the
clubhouse. So much for Sammy turning the clubhouse inside-out.
</P>
<P>
   And those whispers about Pedro and Sammy not getting along? It's
true they're not the best of friends. They operate in different
circles, even if Martinez could throw a baseball from the balcony
of his condo into Sosa's backyard in Santo Domingo. Sosa has
grabbed every endorsement opportunity; Martinez has by and large
stuck to playing baseball. But could they coexist? No question.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa strikes out a lot, yes. But checking the leaderboard, the
top whiffers in baseball were names such as Jim Thome, Jim Edmonds,
Jeff Bagwell, Ken Griffey, Mo Vaughn, and Dean Palmer. Any of those
guys you wouldn't want to have in your lineup?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the price for Sosa would be high, especially if it included
the gritty Nixon. One scout, who didn't require a Breathalyzer,
insisted he would rather have the Red Sox right fielder than the
import from Chicago. ``That guy will just get better and better,''
the scout said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sosa may not run into as many walls as Nixon, his arm
is adequate to play right field, and his name always appears on the
lineup card. He played in every game in 1997 and 1999, and in '98
he missed just three. A slacker, he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Cubs seriously contemplating going through with this?
Absolutely. They see this as a rare chance to acquire three or four
top young prospects, then with the money they save from not signing
Sosa add an elite player or two in the free agent market. Suddenly,
you're talking about six players instead of one for a team that is
a long way away from winning anything with Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Sox afford to pay Sosa? Their Opening Day payroll was
close to $78 million, which ranked seventh in the big leagues. But
there are a half-dozen veterans in the last year of contracts _ Tim
Wakefield, Tom Gordon, Mike Stanley, Rod Beck, Jeff Frye, and Jeff
Fassero _ whose combined salaries total almost $24 million. Most,
if not all, of those players won't be back next season. Duquette
clearly has room to maneuver, not only for Sosa but another
front-line pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Cubs trade Sosa? Yes. Can the Sox get him? Yes.
Duquette had him five years ago, signing him to a contract during
the labor stoppage that was later thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Will he mean a World Series ring? That one goes unanswered. But
the Sox would have a better chance to be there with him than
without him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin as a Pac-man?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Way-Back'' crowd may not have John Wasdin to kick around
much longer. More than one club has acknowledged that the Sox have
been shopping Wasdin, and one National League scout said the Giants
are looking at him as an extra starter and long man. Forget the
jokes about Wasdin making a big splash for the Giants, though he'd
likely give up a few home runs in Pac Bell Park that would land in
the Bay. A change of scenery might be just what he needs, and
perhaps the Sox could use Wasdin as a way to get a third baseman in
return. Russ Davis, whom the Sox had interest in a year ago, isn't
playing much for the Giants but is still hitting over .300 as a
part-time player. He also has some power _ a total of 61 home runs
in the previous three years _ and he'd come pretty cheap. He's
signed for $1 million, of which the Sox would be obligated to pay
around $600,000. Davis would be a stopgap solution that takes some
of the pressure off rookie Wilton Veras, who may not be quite ready
to play every day . . . The Sox did inquire about Astros outfielder
Moises Alou, but forget the suggestion that he would be a much
cheaper alternative to Sosa. Alou has a complete no-trade clause in
his contract, and while he's due to be paid $6 million next season,
it's virtually certain he would demand that his contract be
renegotiated before agreeing to waive the no-trade. Would the
Astros move him? Absolutely. They tried to deal him as long ago as
the World Series last October, and they actually were close to a
deal with the Rockies but it fell apart because of the no-trade
language. The Astros would have been much happier to deal Alou than
Carl Everett, who is younger and a better all-around player. But
they haven't even asked Alou yet if he'd be willing to waive the
no-trade, and Alou also has told associates that he prefers to stay
in the National League . . . Two Amherst guys are working opposite
sides of the Sosa deal. There's Duquette, who recently gave his
alma mater a gift in honor of his father (money to build a new
baseball office). And one of Duquette's good friends, Tom Bourque,
is scouting for the Cubs in Pawtucket, checking out Sox and Mets
prospects . . . Is it possible that Vaughn's bitter parting with
the Red Sox could affect whether Sosa comes here? Cubs outfielder
Glenallen Hill, one of Sosa's closest friends, thinks it could. As
a 10-5 man (10 years of big league service, 5 with the same club),
Sosa has the right to veto any deal. Hill played for the Blue Jays,
Indians, and Mariners in the AL. ``I would lay it on the line,''
Hill said when asked if he would recommend Boston to Sosa. ``All
the pros, all the cons. The pros? It's the American League, a
hitter's league, and Boston is a real good team.'' The cons? ``The
weather. Boston's very cold. Sure, it gets cold here, but Boston is
a different kind of cold. Cold and wet. To play there all the time
might be tough. Boston is also a very conservative place. I think a
guy of his color would have to take a lot of things under
consideration about playing there. Boston has a reputation of being
very conservative. That's a fact. I think Sammy has to look at a
player parallel to his situation in Mo Vaughn, who was very much a
fan favorite in Boston and the center of attention wherever he
went, and look at how things turned out there. I think he has to
assess what Mo's feelings were, and how he reacted to the
attention, and what happened that made him leave. Yes, they're
different people, but the situations are similar. Sammy knows he
has a lot of options to consider. It's fair to him, it's fair to
anybody, that you don't want to go someplace where ultimately
you're going to be unhappy.'' . . . Damon Buford, who played with
Vaughn in Boston and now plays alongside Sosa in Chicago, politely
disagreed with Hill's suggestion. ``To me,'' said Buford, ``every
situation is different. Every team has a history of positives and
negatives. I could bring up the Steve Avery thing as a positive,
the way Jimy pitched him so he could get his contract option. You
just can't always weigh the negative. Sammy and Mo are in entirely
different situations. Mo came up with Boston and was there 10
years. There's no telling what happened there. Sammy would be
coming in as a new face.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a minor tiff
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the spat between Pawtucket pitchers Tomo Ohka and
Sunny Kim couldn't have been worse, what with their names having
surfaced as part of a possible Sosa deal, and with scouts in
Pawtucket to watch them pitch. Ohka and Kim had to be separated in
the dugout in Durham, N.C., last Wednesday night, and the bad
feelings carried over to the next day in the team hotel, where they
again mixed it up. Ohka came away from that one sporting a bruise
on his cheek, and on Friday, after they'd met with farm director
Kent Qualls, it was announced that both players were suspended for
five days. But Dave Jauss, Boston's minor league field coordinator,
makes plenty of sense when he says not to make a big deal of the
altercation. ``I believe it's history, I really do,'' Jauss said.
``Things like that go on all the time in the big leagues, minor
leagues, and college baseball. All the time. And you know the two
guys don't feel good about it. As long as it's been taken care of,
it should be over, and I think the ball club handled it really
well. This is an aggressive sport, where players are paid to be
aggressive. Two people argue, and you hope it doesn't come to more,
but it did. That's something that can happen in all of our lives.
It happened to be two of our quality pitchers, two of our Asian
pitchers, but it just as easily could have been anybody else. These
are good kids.'' Ohka, who is Japanese, and Kim, who is Korean,
come from countries that historically have been ancient enemies,
and Qualls was sensitive to this not turning into a political
issue. But Jauss's straight talk, and acknowledgment that
intramural scraps are as old as the game itself, was a refreshing
counterpoint to the unnecessarily high-minded press release put out
by the Red Sox, which preached about how the organization has
``zero tolerance for conduct that includes hostility between
co-workers on or off the field. The organization makes every effort
to foster a workplace where each individual treats each other with
dignity and respect.'' Save it.

JONES WAS AN OPEN BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, at the news of Gene Sarazen's death, Rees
Jones was explaining why it was particularly painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a piece of golf history that was special,'' he
said, ``and the game needs to hold onto its history.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was Jones on Thursday, accepting condolences on the
death of his father, Robert Trent Jones Sr., himself a huge piece
of golf history. Not that it was a shock _ Jones was 93 and had
suffered a stroke just after last year's US Open _ but it is ironic
that his death comes at a time when American golf is celebrating
its greatest championship. Especially because Jones, the architect
of hundreds of golf courses, was perhaps best known as ``The Open
Doctor'' _ that is, the man who refurbished and strengthened
classic layouts to meet the US Open challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In that capacity, his work included Congressional in Bethesda,
Md., Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oakmont in Pittsburgh, the Olympic
Club in San Francisco, Baltusrol in New Jersey, and Oak Hill in
Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was at Oakland Hills in Bloomfield, Mich., in 1951
that Jones solidified his reputation. Fourteen years earlier, Ed
Furgol had shot 281 to win the Open at Oakland Hills, but the
greatest player of the era, Ben Hogan, needed 287 to triumph in
1951. Why? Jones had come at the USGA's request and toughened up
the classic Donald Ross layout.
</P>
<P>
   Rees Jones was a young boy in 1951, though he'd be hard-pressed
to conjure up a more pleasant memory than the one he has of that
final round at Oakland Hills. Standing next to his mother, Ione,
Rees recalls Hogan coming over to pay his respects to a woman who
was quite popular to those in the golf business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your husband had to play his own courses,'' Hogan said to
Ione Jones, ``he'd be in the bread line.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of comment that made Robert Trent Jones Sr.
smile, because he felt the best players in the world should face
the most challenging of challenges. ``Every hole should be a hard
par and an easy bogey,'' he once said. ``The shattering of par
without a proper challenge is a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Another legendary story stems from Jones's work at Baltusrol. He
took a par-3 of about 120 yards and lengthened it to 192, bringing
water into play and causing a furor. Much too hard, screamed club
members, a charge Jones shrugged off. To prove his point, Jones
accompanied professional Johnny Farrell and two members to the hole
and teed off at 165 yards, the members' tee. Hitting fourth, Jones
borrowed a 4-iron and made a hole-in-one. ``Gentlemen,'' he said,
``I think that the hole is eminently fair,'' and to this day it is
considered by many one of the best holes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The father was a harsh critic of both sons (Robert Trent Jones
Jr. and Rees) who followed him into golf course architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a subjective business,'' said Rees, who recently
completed a spirited layout in Sutton, Mass., called Blackstone
National, and is at work on one of three courses at the Pinehills
development in Plymouth, Mass. ``And he was hard on me. But it gave
me great pride that he liked what we did to Congressional. That
pleased him.''
</P>
<P>
   A tireless worker, Jones had courses virtually everywhere _
``The sun never sets on a Robert Trent Jones golf course,'' he was
fond of saying _ and he refused to slow down. He showed up at
Pinehurst No. 2 for last year's US Open, celebrating his 93d
birthday with his sons and members of the media, many of whom he
knew personally.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his last visits with his father, Rees had the
following conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me who the greatest golf course architect was, and I
said, `You are, dad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a slight pause before Rees returned the question,
asking about No. 2, and the great man said: ``That would be you,
Rees.''
</P>
<P>
   More silence, then Robert Trent Jones Sr. spoke again. ``No,
wait a minute. Donald Ross would be second. I think you're third.''
</P>
<P>
   Rees Jones broke into a wide smile. Another memory to cherish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daly dose of nonsense
</P>
<P>
   With 52 threesomes going off, and after three days of buildup,
the start of any golf tournament _ particularly a US Open _ offers
many possibilities. Whom to follow? What to look for? So when a
colleague said he was going to follow John Daly, I shrugged.
Something always happens with him, I said, and sure enough, it did.
His behavior on the 18th hole _ he hit one drive out of bounds, two
more into the ocean, eventually took a 14, then withdrew after
shooting a first-round 83 _ was childish. He may be one of the
best-hearted people on tour, but Daly has worn out his welcome.
USGA officials must be cheering silently that his five-year
exemption has expired, because Daly has caused them grief two
straight years. He was Jekyll and Hyde (isn't he always?) at
Pinehurst, praising the USGA for a marvelous course setup after an
opening 68, then cowardly ripping it when he finished 81-83. The
stories of his generosity are too many to list (a personal
favorite: he entered a pro shop one day, saw a kid fondling a set
of clubs, and ripped off six $100 bills and bought them for him),
but for each one, there are probably 10 tales that show his total
disrespect for the game and lack of concern for his own well-being.
He has acknowledged his problems in the past, but in each case his
remedy could be called ``drive-through rehab,'' that is, he'll
check himself in a for few weeks, then return to the lonely,
high-pressure life of the PGA Tour. The game deserves better than
that. So, too, does Daly . . . Running a close second to Daly in
the ``tired, old news'' category is Mark James. Please, Mark,
enough. You've written a book, taken cheap shots at plenty of
people, made your money, and gained your moment in the sun _ now
please ease yourself into 74th place in a series of European Tour
events and shut up. Apparently, that's not possible. He continued
to hurl gasoline into the fires by claiming, ``(Tom) Lehman and his
friends can . . . bury their heads in the sand and pretend nothing
went wrong at Brookline. I want to sort this out. I want people to
be aware golf had a problem so we can sort it out for next year,
and in particular for the 2003 Ryder Cup.'' How convenient that in
his role as self-appointed diplomat he's making plenty of money in
the process . . . Yet another golf Web site to add to your list:
caddiechat.com. As the name suggests, it is a site whereby caddies
discuss what is going on out on Tour. During the US Open, a special
feature is a daily diary written by Mike Hicks, whose 12-year
association with Payne Stewart culminated with last summer's
historic triumph at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's LPGA's turn
</P>
<P>
   The US Open will fade from view, leaving the golf spotlight _ at
least for this week _ to the women. The McDonald's LPGA
Championship gets under way Thursday at DuPont CC in Wilmington,
Del., and much of the attention will be on Karrie Webb (10
victories in 17 months), her rivalry with Annika Sorenstam, the
quest of Juli Inkster to defend this major crown, and the possible
emergence of Grace Park as a weekly threat. That won't leave much
room for players such as Meg Mallon, whose career has never
received the attention it deserves. When she prevailed in a
rainstorm at the Rochester (N.Y.) International, it was Mallon's
12th win since bursting onto the scene 14 years ago. In that time,
two things have remained constant for this Natick, Mass., native _
her great play and her smile. But she thinks things could have been
sweeter. ``I feel like I put myself in this position to win a lot
of tournaments, which is what you want to do,'' said Mallon, ``but
I don't feel like I've gotten over that hump to have multiple
victories.'' In 1991, Mallon won four times _ including a pair of
majors _ and while it's a wonderful entry on her resume, it left a
daunting challenge. ``It's almost like the expectations got so high
that no matter what I've done since then, it seems to pale in
comparison,'' she said . . . The Mass. Open tees off Monday at the
Country Club of Pittsfield, with amateur Kevin Quinn defending the
title. Rodney Butcher, the 1998 champion, withdrew, given his
commitment to the US Open. Butcher's swing coach is Tom Creavy, who
learned the game as a youngster playing the Hyannisport Club.
Creavy, who was at Pebble Beach with Butcher, teaches at the David
Leadbetter Academy in Florida . . . As some of the game's greatest
names practiced their putting just off the first tee at Pebble
Beach during Thursday's first round, it was announced that fog had
crept into play, making the par-3 fifth hole a particularly
time-consuming affair. It was so backed up that officials
instituted a half-hour delay on tee times to ease the congestion on
the course. Fifth-hole problems? Jack Nicklaus peered up as he
stood over a putt, and quipped, ``Poor design.'' Of course,
Nicklaus received rave reviews for his redesign of that hole a few
years ago . . . Not far from Pebble Beach is Pasadera, a new
private club that had its grand opening last Sunday. Designed by
Nicklaus, the layout, by all reports, is quite breathtaking, with
some dramatic elevation changes. One par-3 plays just over 200
yards _ all of it carry over a 200-foot gorge. What follows is a
par-4 that can play 596 yards from the tips. No, that's not a typo.
It's a par-4 of 596 yards. Good Lord, that's a three-shot hole
after a short taxi ride for me, but those who have played it say
the elevated tee to a fairway hundreds of feet below makes it play
much shorter. How short? Orel Hershiser reportedly hit driver-wedge
and reached easily. Which leads one to believe that if the USGA got
its hands on that hole, it would be a par-3.

PATRIOTS LONG FOR A TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which active franchise among the four major professional sports
_ major league baseball, the NFL, the NBA, and the NHL _ has gone
the longest since its inception without winning a championship?
</P>
<P>
   Don't rack your brain. It's your New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Sox have gone an amazing 82 years without a
championship, they did win the World Series early in the 20th
century, as did the equally snake-bitten Chicago Cub and Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have had a sad history since they started up in
1960, getting to an AFL championship game in 1963 and falling to
the San Diego Chargers, and twice losing in the Super Bowl (in 1986
to the Bears and 1997 to the Packers).
</P>
<P>
   No current professional franchise has started this pathetically.
And we're being generous in our criteria by counting AFL and NFL
championships prior to the first Super Bowl. In hockey, we are
counting AVCO Cup championships in the old World Hockey Association
as well as the Stanley Cup. In basketball, we allow the four
holdovers from the American Basketball Association to count rings
earned before they entered the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings, for instance, haven't won a Super Bowl
since they played their first NFL game in 1961, but they won what
was still known as the ``NFL Championship'' in 1969 (they lost to
AFL champion Kansas City that season in Super Bowl IV).
</P>
<P>
   Other NFL teams have experienced even greater futility but
haven't been around as long as the Patriots. The Atlanta Falcons,
who made it to the Super Bowl two years ago but lost to Denver, are
on a 35-year championship-free streak. New Orleans has been waiting
34 years, the Cincinnati Bengals are in their 33d year, and the
Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers are in their 25th years
without a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that won AFL championships include Buffalo, which won the
'64 and '65 crowns; the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, who won
the first two titles in 1960 and 1961 but haven't won since; and
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 NHL entries of the St. Louis Blues and Los Angeles
Kings have yet to win Lord Stanley's Cup, and the 1970 Buffalo
Sabres and Vancouver Canucks continue their quests.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns have certainly been competitive over the years,
but the NBA title has eluded them since they entered the league in
1968. The Cleveland Cavaliers have been without a title since they
became a team in 1970. Ditto for the Buffalo Braves/San Diego and
LA Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Rockets/Nuggets were one of four ABA teams to enter
the NBA in 1976, along with the New York/New Jersey Nets, Indiana
Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs. The Rockets/Nuggets never won an ABA
crown, nor have they won an NBA title. The Pacers won three ABA
titles but haven't won an NBA crown. The Nets have never won the
NBA title but won the final ABA crown. We know you're thinking of
the Sacramento Kings, one of the league's most hapless franchises,
but they were once the Rochester Royals, and in 1951 they took the
NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   No comments are necessary from the Patriots on this subject.
When Bob Kraft bought the team from James Busch Orthwein in 1993,
he was a long-suffering Red Sox and Patriots fan who hoped to bring
a football championship here within five years. Unfortunately, one
window closed when the team failed to win in 1997 under Bill
Parcells. The Patriots thought they could win under Pete Carroll,
but poor drafting and the steady loss of key players hindered that
effort. Now Bill Belichick inherits a team void of depth, with huge
problems on both the offensive and defensive lines, and at running
back and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have avoided the public wrath usually associated
with such failure because the Kraft ownership has kept the team
competitive, and you can always point to the Red Sox' long history
of falling short and the current doldrums of the Bruins and Celtics
as reasons not to be too hard on the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft had the third-highest player salary expenditures in the
league last year, a sign that he's not afraid to spend the money to
win. But after an 8-8 season, the Patriots thought it was enough to
hire a new coach and not bring in major free agents. Obviously,
Kraft doesn't have an unlimited supply of money buried underneath
the old racetrack, and there is a salary cap to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the current team has glaring needs.
</P>
<P>
   It will enter the 2000 season still searching for someone to run
the football. With rookie J.R. Redmond's status uncertain after
groin surgery and veteran Raymont Harris coming back to football
after a year off, the running situation is as tenuous as ever. The
Patriots passed on a chance to trade for Jamal Anderson last year.
They passed on a chance to sign restricted free agent Priest Holmes
of the Ravens in the offseason. They have not inquired about Barry
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Since Robert Edwards went down, they've been amazingly
nonchalant in their pursuit of a 1,200-yard rusher. Yet they still
have Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn, two very exciting players, and
they hope that new schemes on the offensive line will make a
difference in Bledsoe's protection and in opening holes for Harris,
Redmond, or Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the Patriots aren't proud of the distinction
they hold in professional sports. Who would be? Some of it is bad
luck. Some is due to mismanagement. But Patriots fans would like to
see the team pull out all the stops one of these years and sign
some great players, as the Washington Redskins have done. The
Redskins may not get the ultimate prize, but owner Daniel Snyder
thinks the nine years since the Redskins' last Super Bowl
championship are too many. And love him or hate him, he's doing
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missing in action
</P>
<P>
   About 10 Patriots didn't complete the offseason strength and
conditioning program. The two most prominent were Glenn and Henry
Thomas. Glenn started out well but decided to return to his
Columbus, Ohio, home to do the rest of his workouts with Ohio State
strength coach Dave Kennedy. Glenn has always said he knows his
body has certain limits; apparently, he reached them. Thomas said
he worked out in Houston, where he lives. It doesn't appear that
either will suffer any consequences, though. The Patriots can ill
afford to lose Glenn, while the salary cap hit on cutting Thomas
doesn't make fiscal sense . . . The Patriots will not be able to
get into the Sean Dawkins hunt, as agent Angelo Wright is asking
for a guarantee that Dawkins will start and for money the Patriots
can't or won't pay . . . The NFL is hung up on workouts and not on
what a player can do in games. Ben Coates had an excellent workout
in Detroit last week, for instance. Coates usually won't look great
working out but he's a lion on the field. Ditto for Doug Flutie.
During the Bills' minicamp, there was talk of how great Rob Johnson
threw the ball in comparison to Flutie. But whom would you rather
have on the field to win a tough game? The Bills found that out in
the playoffs against Tennessee, when you just knew Flutie would
have found a way to beat the Titans . . . Bruce Armstrong still
awaits an insulting offer from the Patriots . . . Fall River's Marc
Megna has had an extremely productive season playing linebacker for
the Barcelona Dragons, and he should land a spot as a backup
linebacker for the Patriots this summer. Speaking of which, one of
the key competitions in camp will be between Tedy Bruschi and Andy
Katzenmoyer at inside linebacker. Bruschi reportedly is not a lock
to start . . . Edwards is not expected to play next season as he
continues to recover from his ugly knee injury. He has been working
out with Bob Kersee in St. Louis and Orlando . . . Some opinions
never change. Bill Walsh thought Rick Mirer was going to be a great
pro quarterback. He was wrong. But after losing Steve Young to
retirement, Walsh signed Mirer to back up Jeff Garcia in San
Francisco . . . What's going on with tight end Dave Stachelski, the
Patriots' fifth-round pick out of Boise State? Much suspicion has
been created with the team and the player's agent, William Heck,
not giving out any information other than the small scrap from
Belichick a few weeks ago that Stachelski underwent a minor knee
arthroscopy in Seattle. Heck said he's been told all information
about his client has to go through the Patriots, another oddity.
It's not common for a rookie to have surgery someplace other than
with his own team, but Stachelski had his procedure done by the
Seahawks' team physician and then worked out at Boise State. Former
Boston College assistant Dirk Kuetter, now the head coach at Boise,
said Stachelski was due back in Foxborough early this week. Kuetter
called Stachelski a ``physical specimen with great upside.''
Kuetter said Stachelski fell from a projected second-round pick
because of two factors: he had relatively little experience as a
tight end because he began his career as a defensive end, and he
has a tendency to get down on himself. Kuetter said Stachelski has
had injuries to his shoulders and knees, which also may have
dropped his stock, but he still thinks the Patriots may have a find
. . . The NFL gets more and more like a dictatorial state each day,
as teams try desperately to control the news and prevent their
players from speaking freely. The Bengals are taking it to the next
level, actually trying to include language in contracts that
prohibits players from publicly criticizing coaches and management.
Richard Berthelsen, general counsel for the NFL Players'
Association, is writing to the league to express his dismay. That
players are actually signing these contracts is a big blow, not
only for freedom of speech but for the NFLPA, which has always
lagged behind the other player unions in professional sports in
getting the most for its players. Several players have criticized
the Bengals in recent years, including Patriots punter Lee Johnson
two years ago. Johnson was later released. There have been other
incidents around the league in which a player speaks out and
suddenly finds himself out the door. Coates is a perfect example .
. . The Dolphins finally cut their losses with wide receiver Yatil
Green and signed Leslie Shepherd, whom the Patriots never could
pull the trigger on despite showing the most interest in him early
in the free-agent process. Green was an extremely promising
receiver, but training-camp knee injuries sidelined him his first
two years, and assorted leg injuries limited him to eight games
last season. He now finds himself in the same position as another
injury-prone, once-promising star, Ki-Jana Carter, who was cut by
the Bengals after five bad-luck years . . . Shawn Jefferson cut a
deal with tight end Rod Monroe to get No. 84 in Atlanta. Monroe
switched to No. 49 . . . Carroll was ripped here when he took his
team bowling. Well, the Packers' Mike Sherman did the same thing at
a minicamp last week. If the Packers underachieve, I guess we'll
know why.

REVOLUTION TAKE ONE STEP BACK

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Revolution seemed to have cast a
spell on the MLS's Eastern Division in the first half of the
season. But their dominance ended in a 4-2 loss to the MetroStars
Saturday, which left them in first place but facing four more
successive road games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Revolution's first loss to a division opponent in
six games this season, and it could be costly since they appeared
vulnerable after squandering the lead, and lost Leonel Alvarez (red
card) and Ivan McKinley (accumulation of yellow cards) to
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams tackled hard and emphasized running over conserving
energy, making this an especially difficult match in 88-degree
heat. Revolution midfielder Mauricio Ramos, who returned Friday
after a 17-hour flight from Japan, departed at halftime, and
defender Brian Dunseth collapsed on the field at the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them two presents,'' Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo
said. ``It's not shocking, because we've been playing well and our
goalkeeper (Jeff Causey) has been playing great. The important part
is that we realize our mistakes and learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be facing more of that kind of treatment
because we are first in our division. We have to be prepared to
face that kind of challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo went with Jamar Beasley in the starting lineup a week
after Beasley had provided two goals as a substitute in a 3-0 win
over San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley provided a subtle threat in the first half, helping open
space, but he squandered a point-blank chance on an open net in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But by failing to hold a 2-1 lead in the final minutes of the
first half, the Revolution raised some self-doubt. They also faced
a deficit, and though they created opportunities, it was too much
to expect a rally in the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come back from two goals down,'' MetroStars
midfielder Mark Chung said. ``Especially in that heat, because
whatever they say the temperature is, there is no wind on that
field and it's 10 degrees hotter than it is outside the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez provided a strong presence in midfield and quickly
limited Tab Ramos's effect on the game. But the Revolution broke
down in other areas, allowing Billy Walsh to launch an uncontested
28-yard drive for the first goal in the 20th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Franchino played a give-and-go with John Harkes to earn a
penalty that Imad Baba converted to tie the score in the 24th
minute. Alvarez and Mauricio Ramos combined in the 29th minute, but
Mike Ammann deflected the advance to Baba, who sent a hard 20-yard
drive toward goal. Ammann again saved it just outside the goal
area, but this time the rebound fell to Wolde Harris, who sent a
shot under Ammann for a 2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution seemed to be in control but failed to close down
Adolfo ``El Tren'' Valencia. And the MetroStars regained the
advantage as Mike Petke stabbed an interception and Valencia
outmaneuvered Dunseth and Mauricio Ramos for a 2-2 tie in the 41st
minute. Two minutes later, the Revolution defense again broke down
and Chung's rebound off the bar was followed by Steve Shak for a
3-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Mathis's free kick in the 49th minute gave the MetroStars
a two-goal lead and appeared to clinch the victory. Yet, the game
remained wide open and both teams continued to threaten. Ivan
McKinley entered for Rusty Pierce (back strain) and ignited the
offense as the Revolution shifted to a 3-5-2 alignment. Mauricio
Wright stifled Valencia for long periods. And Harris dribbled
through the defense, drew out Ammann, and laid off for Beasley to
shoot wide from the goal area with the net open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've scored on plays like that millions of times,'' Beasley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had also been in the habit of winning these types
of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed open chances which could have changed the game,''
Clavijo said. ``But we are still on track for everything we are
trying to do. This was just a step backward.''

WITH ROSE ON RISE, PACERS STOOD TALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The game was over, but the disappointment
lingered for Jalen Rose. His Pacers had just fallen behind, 3-1, in
the NBA Finals, losing an overtime heartbreaker to the Lakers in
which he, to be charitable, struggled.
</P>
<P>
   He could not shake the game or the sting, so he stayed at
Conseco Fieldhouse until his teammates had left and only the
workmen were still around, tending to their various clean-up tasks.
It was then Rose picked up a basketball, in the early morning
hours, and practiced on the same floor where he had just gone 5 for
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I needed to shoot some more,'' he said. ``I could
live with being 5 of 16, or even 1 of 16, if we won the game. You
can't leave anything in the tank, because if you do, the season is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he did, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, in Game 5, Rose was sensational. He scored 32
points in 44 active minutes. He was 12 for 18 from the field,
slashing, cutting, and knocking down jumpers, including 4 of 5 from
international waters. He had 6 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals.
He led the Pacers to a 120-87 rout of the Lakers Friday that sent
the series back to Los Angeles with Indiana trailing, 3-2. Game 6
is Monday night at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand we have what it takes to beat LA, but it means
nothing talking about it,'' Rose said. ``And since I felt like I've
been doing nothing but talking about it, especially when they got
up, 3-1, I figured I was going to shut up and go out and play. I
was very determined to come out and play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   And his game can be a sight to behold.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 8 inches, Rose can be a matchup nightmare for opposing
coaches. He can shoot from the outside, put the ball on the floor,
post up. As Rose put it, matter-of-factly, ``I think I'm a tough
matchup for a lot of guys because I'm taller than people expect and
I have the ability to shoot the three, as well as dribble, drive,
and post.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, he has improved exponentially since Larry Brown all
but gave up on him a few years back. His current coach, Larry Bird,
would like Rose to work a little harder, but he had no complaints
with what he saw Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's hitting his shots, it's almost impossible to stop
him,'' said Bird, under whom Rose has bloomed to become one of the
league's rising stars and, thanks to timing, one of its more
desirable free agents this summer. ``He keeps the defense off
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Phil Jackson put it, ``We anticipated that Jalen was
going to respond, but not quite like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Reggie Miller were a lethal 1-2 punch, combining for 57
points. It was Rose who set the tone, scoring 22 in the first half.
The two had a chat during warmups, reminding each other of the dire
consequences of a loss: It would mean a Laker celebration on their
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the Pacers have been to the NBA
Finals,'' Rose said. ``It can be old hat in California. They've had
great players, great teams. Their city thrives on so many things.
Indiana thrives on basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose has thrived under Bird's stewardship. Bird recognized what
he had and made the decision to put Rose into the starting lineup,
a move that sent veteran All-Star Chris Mullin to the bench. It was
a move Bird could no longer avoid; he had a burgeoning star on his
hands and nowhere else to put him.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase in playing time (and confidence), Rose won the
Most Improved Player award, establishing career highs in just about
every statistical department. He led the Pacers in minutes and
started every game (80) in which he played. He also led in scoring,
snapping Miller's long reign as the team's scoring champ.
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, the emergence of Rose meant an adjustment, both
mental and physical. The longtime go-to guy ceded some of his
clutch time to the new kid while also trying to learn how to play
with such a versatile player. Mullin and Derrick McKey had been
there before, and neither plays like Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in here understanding that he would start, from Day
1,'' Miller said. ``It took some time for us to find a balance with
one another. I was so used to working with Derrick as well as Chris
the last two and three years. It took us time to get our rhythm.
Now that we've found a comfortable balance, it's starting to show a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed a lot on Friday. And whether that was a sign of more
to come or simply a stay of execution, it was unquestionably a
vintage Rose performance. That's why re-signing Rose is No. 1 on
team president Donnie Walsh's ``to do'' list this summer. The way
Rose can play, is there an alternative?

O'NEAL REALLY COMING OF AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that we've devoted the obligatory space and time to
slobbering over Kobe Bryant, can we get back to reality and the
reason the Lakers are where they are? It is, of course, because of
Shaq. But everybody knows that.
</P>
<P>
   The Laker who most resembles Michael Jordan is not the player
who walks, talks, and tries to be like Mike. The Laker who most
resembles the dominating, best-in-the-business Mike is the
320-pound Shaquille O'Neal. And it's a bit scary to look at the two
of them, along with two other icons from the 1980s, Magic Johnson
and Larry Bird, to see how closely their careers mirror one
another's.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious: the Most Valuable Player award.
O'Neal was a worthy winner this year. It's his first, and he's 28.
That seems to be the Age of Reason in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan won his first MVP in 1988. He was 25. But he won his
second three years later, which also was the year he won his first
NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Bird turned 28 in 1984, the year he won the first of three
straight MVPs and the second of his three NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   And Magic? He already had three rings on his hand when he won
his first MVP in 1987. His age? 28.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq and Michael appear to bond in the dynasty department as
well. Magic and Bird had each other and their respective Hall of
Fame rosters to balance the scales in the 1980s. There was no such
equalizer for the Bulls in the 1990s, and there may be no one in
this decade who can keep the Lakers honest. As Shaq put it last
week, ``Hopefully, this will be the start of something.'' Needless
to say, Shaq and Jordan also share the erudite Phil Jackson, who
knows about dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's early. But the Lakers are winning this year with the
MVP, a burgeoning star in Bryant, and basically a lot of everyday
players. Glen Rice was once an All-Star before getting neutered in
LA. But that's it. The rest of the roster would have trouble with
Rapid City or Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   But with Shaq and Kobe healthy and committed, is there a team
out there that can keep up with the Lakers? Portland might have
been better and deeper this season _ the Trail Blazers did outplay
LA in five of the seven games in the conference finals. But the
Blazers may be getting weaker, not stronger. Arvydas Sabonis is
telling teammates he may retire, Jermaine O'Neal wants to be
traded, Brian Grant may opt out of his contract (though he may
re-sign), and Scottie Pippen (35 in September) isn't getting any
younger.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio? Last year, Tim Duncan was being anointed the game's
top player, and he is still at least No. 2 or No. 3. But unless
Grant Hill goes there to accompany him and help ease David Robinson
into the sunset, the Spurs are going to be merely good, not great.
They're old, as well. Phoenix? If the Suns can land Dikembe
Mutombo, they may have a short window before the Big Guy goes AARP
on them. Utah? No chance. Houston? It'll be better after Hakeem
Olajuwon retires. Minnesota? It needs more oomph.
</P>
<P>
   There's no one in the East. If Duncan and Hill are serious about
uniting, they should do so in Orlando to avoid seeing the Lakers
until the Finals. They'd instantly make the Magic prohibitive
favorites in the East. The Knicks, Heat, Sixers, and Pacers all are
going to be adequate, but, to recall Pat Riley's wise words when
Jordan was still around, ``We're all going to be playing for second
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you have to think the Lakers will be stronger once
general manager Jerry West unearths a real power forward and/or
backup center. When you have the aura, as the Lakers do, not to
mention the roster and the weather, that ``middle class'' exception
becomes very attractive.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sobering thought. The Lakers won 67 games and could be
even better next season. Jackson won't let them get complacent, and
Shaq will want to prove this year was not a fluke. He's looking
back and telling everyone, ``You had your chances, but now it's all
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Michael did. And there was no one around to stop
him. Only time will tell whether there's anyone out there to stop
Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good life
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few coaching vacancies (New Jersey, LA,
Toronto), and already we've had two college coaches, both bereft of
NBA experience, move up to the big time. That hasn't happened since
1970, when Bill Fitch left Minnesota to take over the expansion
Cleveland Cavaliers and Cotton Fitzsimmons departed Kansas State to
take over the Suns. We've had others over the years, from Dick
Motta to John MacLeod to Jerry Tarkanian to John Calipari to Tim
Floyd. Is the NBA a preferable lifestyle now? The money makes it
so, but it's more than that. ``I think my run in New Jersey
certainly didn't hurt the chances of college coaches,'' Calipari
said. ``They can look and say, `He turned it around in short order.
He did it.' There was a time when none of us were being
considered.'' (And all this time, we foolishly thought Cal killed
it for the college coaches. Silly us.) Calipari said he got calls
from Tom Izzo (who spurned the Hawks) and others picking his brain
about making the jump. ``I told them that it can be a great run,''
he said. ``But also don't go in there thinking that because I'm
here, we're going to win 10 more games. You better have the bodies.
I enjoyed it, and when you see what happened, it's further
confirmation of what went down. I may do it again.'' Added P.J.
Carlesimo, who left Seton Hall to go to Portland in 1994, ``I think
the NBA always has been an attractive situation for the college
coaches. It's changed a little over the years, mostly in financial
terms. There was a time when you got paid more in college. It's
different now. I think more college coaches would consider the NBA
now than they would have, say, 10 years ago.'' There are other
reasons besides money. Recruiting is getting more and more
unseemly. College coaches have to be everywhere in July scouting
prospects. They have to deal with the kids, the coaches, the
parents, the AAU, the hangers-on, the siblings, and, of course, the
NCAA. Academic requirements are stricter now, and if a player gets
caught breaking a law, it's the coach's problem. The NBA doesn't
have that. You charter everywhere, stay in great hotels, and,
depending on what you want, can basically take off the summer with
a couple of camps. That might be one reason why Floyd was telling
friends during the predraft camp in Chicago he'll never go back to
college. Sure, it's about the money. It's just not all about the
money . . . Carlesimo, by the way, said he was still looking to get
back into the NBA, although he did say he thought the job at the
University of Miami was an attractive one. ``My clear preference is
to stay in the league,'' Carlesimo said. Wonder whether Rod Thorn
would consider bringing Carlesimo back to New Jersey. The two have
not only the NBA tie-in, but also one from USA Basketball, as
Carlesimo was an assistant coach on the first (and only) Dream Team
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celtics &UR;  &LR; squeezed
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with the Celtics' interest in Jermaine
O'Neal: the dreaded base-year compensation. Portland would be able
to take back only a player who makes one-half of O'Neal's salary.
But the Celtics would have to find the room to absorb the whole
salary. That's why the Bulls and Magic are in such an enviable
spot. Both teams have plenty of cap room, so either one could trade
one of its draft picks and take O'Neal . . . The NBA is concerned
enough about audience no-shows to try to do something about it. Of
course, the logical move would be to create a better product, but,
failing that, commissioner David Stern says the league is trying to
identify the unused tickets and make them available for resale
prior to games. ``We're focused on the issue of no-shows, and we
think we can improve that next year,'' Stern said. ``It's our job
to let people know that more, not less, of our teams are
interesting to watch.'' Good luck . . . You have to wonder whether
part of Jackson's compensation package was tied in some way to the
total de-fanging of Rice. Here was a guy who, when he came to the
Lakers, had every right to think he'd be getting a huge payday when
his contract expired. But after what's happened in LA this year, he
has become, at best, an exception player. If he were to declare he
wouldn't talk to the Lakers, the best he'd do would be a team's
middle-class exception. That's about a $12 million drop-off. The
Lakers likely will re-sign him with a salary of up to 15 percent
more than his current $7 million, then trade him. One option is to
Philadelphia for Toni Kukoc, although it's hard to picture Larry
Brown wanting a 33-year-old defensive liability . . . The Knicks
weren't the only losers when the Pacers eliminated them from the
playoffs. Also losing big were the maintenance men, mainly
electricians, at Madison Square Garden. While the NBA had reserved
the building for Games 3, 4, and 5, it was also being used by Bruce
Springsteen during the week. It would have been a bonanza for
workers to dismantle the Boss's set and then set it up again. NBA
officials conceded they also were concerned about practice sites on
off-days . . . Big center Brad Millard of St. Mary's almost lapped
the field at the Chicago predraft camp in one area: weight. He
checked in at 360 pounds, some 70-plus more than the next two big
guys, Mario Bland (who is 6-5, but checked in at 287) and Greek big
man Iakovos Tsakalidis, who tipped the scales at 283. DeMarr
Johnson, meanwhile, who is on the Celtics' wish list, weighed only
201 (he's 6-9), but Jerome Moiso checked in at 7 feet, 232 pounds.
Fears that Marcus Fizer might measure small proved unfounded; the
Iowa State bull is 6-9 in sneakers.

IT MIGHT BE AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ They went with more than 18 holes of golf
again Saturday, trying to catch up in the fog-delayed,
darkness-delayed U.S. Open. And You Know Who was again the big
topic of conversation between rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular question: Could anybody prevent Tiger Woods
from winning this centennial championship?
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, who failed to make the cut after playing three
straight rounds with Woods (including a practice round Wednesday),
suspects this Open might already be closed to all but the world's
No. 1 golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that can stop Tiger from winning is Tiger,''
Parnevik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was very happy about the way he played the
second round (which Woods completed Saturday morning at 2-under-par
69). But he's good enough to play under par even when he's not
playing his best . ... If he can keep on doing what he's doing, he
should win it pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   What Woods did Saturday morning was tie and break Open records
with a 134 midway score that gave him a six-stroke advantage over
the field.
</P>
<P>
   His 134 tied Jack Nicklaus (Baltusrol in 1980), T.C. Chen
(Oakland Hills, 1985) and Lee Janzen (Baltusrol, 1993) for the
lowest 36-hole score in Open history. The six-stroke lead (over
Denmark's Thomas Bjorn and Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez) bettered a
97-year-old Open midway- margin record set by Willie Anderson at
Baltusrol in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, Nicklaus and Janzen went on to win those Opens. Is
Woods headed for similar success? His competition admits he could
be hard to catch unless he starts to back up to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, considered one of the top contenders this week
but 10 strokes off the lead entering Saturday's delayed third
round, opted for optimism after Woods got as low as 9 under par
before giving a stroke back with a bogey on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were two dozen guys up there at 9 under, then you've
got to make a bunch of birdies to get there.'' Mickelson reasoned.
``But with only one guy up there it's up to him. If he comes
tumbling back, we all want to be there to catch him .... If he
doesn't, there's nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Jose Maria Olazabel, seven strokes off the lead starting
third- round play, said Woods' excellence on a difficult course has
distorted perception of good golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, before the tournament started, somebody told me that I'd
be 1 under par after two days, I'd be very, very pleased,''
Olazabel said. ``In the U.S. Open, anything under par is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it seems as if there are two tournaments this week
- the one being played by Woods and the one played by everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome to see,'' Olazabel said. ``Very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, 10 strokes off the lead entering the third round,
was counting on USGA-toughened Pebble Beach to help bring the field
closer to the leader:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some great golf to catch him, but it's the
kind of course where even the best players can make some mistakes.
Those of us chasing are going to have to play our best golf and
hope he makes a mistake or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But will Woods retreat to the field,? Or will he just shrug
off a triple-bogey - as he did on his third-round third hole
Saturday afternoon - and offset it with three birdies in his next
four holes?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps playing like he is,'' said Jim Furyk, ``it doesn't
give very many people a chance.''

   With Dutch swimmer Inge de Bruijn still on her incredible record
spree _ seven world marks broken or tied in three weeks _ the drug
whispers are starting to swirl. Australia's Susie O'Neill, who
broke Mary T. Meagher's ``unbreakable'' record in the 200 butterfly
this year, said de Bruijn's performances are ``pretty suss''
(suspicious). ``I absolutely understand that people think that
there is something strange,'' said the 26-year-old de Bruijn (no
relation to disgraced Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruijn). ``I
am truly shocked myself.'' De Bruijn's marks would be much more
suspicious if she weren't already among the world elite. ``It's not
like she's going from 50th in the world,'' said Paul Bergin, her
part-time US coach. In any case, world swimming records are falling
like autumn leaves this year. Five were broken (three by teenager
Ian Thorpe) at the Australian championships, and Alexander Popov
(50 free) and Roman Sludnov (100 breast) broke a pair at last
week's Russian nationals . . . With Grant Hill (broken ankle) off
the US basketball team, Lakers star Kobe Bryant is the people's
choice to take his place. Hill's absence leaves Gary Payton as the
only returnee from the 1996 gold-medal team . . . How did the US
women's soccer team end up in the ``Group of Death'' at the
Olympics? Bad luck and dumbness by the international federation,
which gave the weak host Australians a top seed in one of the two
four-team prelim divisions. That's how three of the top four teams
in the world (US, China, Norway) ended up on the same side, along
with fleet and physical Nigeria. On the other side are Brazil,
Germany, Sweden, and the Aussies. Much better deal for the US
males, who get the Czech Republic, Cameroon, and Kuwait. The women,
who ended up winning the Pacific Cup when the Chinese lost to the
Canadians, are back in the States this week for the CONCACAF Gold
Cup. They'll play Trinidad &AMP; Tobago in Hershey, Pa., on Friday,
Costa Rica in Louisville on Sunday, and Brazil in Foxborough a week
from Tuesday . . . Unpleasant exit last week by the US Olympic
Committee's longtime doping-control director, who said he was
working in ``increasingly hostile, racist, threatening,
jeopardy-laden, intolerable'' conditions. Dr. Wade Exum, the USOC's
top-ranking black staffer, also claimed that the USOC was
``deliberately encouraging the doping of athletes.'' The USOC
called Exum's charges ``patently false'' and said his performance
had been under review. Exum, who quit the job after nine years,
would have been gone anyway after the Sydney Games, when the new
independent anti-doping agency takes over.

   Putting out the fire
</P>
<P>
   By choosing an Aborigine (1996 field hockey gold medalist Nova
Peris-Kneebone) as the first Olympic torchbearer on Australian
soil, the Sydney organizers were moving to defuse a delicate
domestic issue. Aboriginal leaders, furious that the Australian
government won't apologize for its former policy of forcibly
putting Aboriginal children (the ``Stolen Generation'') into white
families, have threatened a protest march on the opening day of the
Games . . . As expected, there will be a record number of female
athletes (3,952) in Sydney. That's 38 percent of the total, 4
percent more than the Atlanta figure, and it's more than 10 times
as many women than competed at Melbourne in 1956, the last time the
Games were held Down Under . . . There's a strong chance that the
US rowing team will qualify all five of its remaining boats
(women's single and double, men's pair, four, and quad) at next
month's last-chance regatta in Lucerne. The Americans need to place
in the top two in everything but the single, where top three will
do. Making the trip are West Newton's Ted Murphy (pair) and
Norwood's Carol Skricki (double). Ruffled feathers, meanwhile, in
the women's sculling camp. After last year's quad of Hilary Gehman,
Jen Dore-Terhaar, Laurel Korholz, and Kelly Salchow failed to make
the Olympic trials finals rowing in doubles, the six who did
(Skricki, Ruth Davidon, Elizabeth Smith, Julia Chilicki, Leslie
Burns Rawley, Kate MacKenzie) argued that they should be the
Olympic double and quad. Coach Igor Grinko isn't buying it (Gehman
et al. did finish fourth at the world regatta). But since the camp
is competitive enough, US Rowing may want to have a showdown trials
after all instead of having Grinko name the quad. If Skricki and
Davidon don't qualify in the double at Lucerne, they'll be in the
quad mix, too . . . Maybe they should encase the US Olympic boxing
team in bubble wrap. Three of the 12 members _ light welterweight
Ricardo Williams Jr., welterweight Dante Craig, and super heavy
Calvin Brock _ are all nursing hand injuries, with Craig and Brock
both requiring surgery . . . Yes, the Greg Gibson who'll be
competing in the greco-roman event at this week's US wrestling
trials is the same Greg Gibson who won the Olympic silver medal in
1984. He's 46.

   With as many as five of the Magnificent Seven (all but Kerri
Strug and Amanda Borden) coming back to take on Vanessa Atler,
Kristen Maloney, Elise Ray et al., next month's US gymnastics
nationals in St. Louis and the August Olympic trials at the
FleetCenter could be the most competitive ever. ``The values are so
close among the first six spots, it's going to be brutal,''
predicted team coordinator Bela Karolyi. ``A dogfight out there.''
. . . With the ranking deadline three weeks away, the US Olympic
tennis team is shaping up this way: Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras (if
he wants to go), Todd Martin, and Michael Chang on the men's side,
Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, and Monica Seles on the women's.
If Sampras opts out, as he did last time, Chris Woodruff is next in
line. The women's situation is iffy, since Williams says she might
stay home if sister Serena doesn't qualify. If Venus says nix,
Jennifer Capriati, the 1992 champion, is heiress apparent. Agassi
and Davenport are the defending gold medalists . . . Looking solid
for a spot on the US Olympic road cycling team is Marblehead's
Tyler Hamilton. Not only has he been racing well in France, he's
also Lance Armstrong's wingman. Antonio Cruz grabbed one berth by
winning last month's trials. The rest of the team will be picked
next month . . . Who'll be hosting the nightly medal ceremony in
downtown Salt Lake during the 2002 Winter Games? Just-retired 49ers
quarterback Steve Young, who has signed on as SLOC's
ambassador-at-large. He'll also help with fund-raising and be a
community liaison . . . Now that the Salt Lake organizers have the
feds off their back, they can turn their attention to more mundane
issues. Like, what's for dinner. The South Koreans have been
worrying that they'll be subsisting on Egg McMuffins and chicken
tenders during the 2002 Winter Games. But SLOC chief Mitt Romney
has assured them that he'll have chefs on hand who can whip up
bulgogi with kim chi.

DIFFERENT TWIST ON BOSTON DRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine this: It is a warm summer day in the Back Bay. The
deafening din of turbocharged, eight-cylinder racing engines fills
the air. Gleaming open-wheel cars from the Championship Auto Racing
Teams circuit _ piloted by drivers such as Paul Tracy, Jimmy
Vasser, Kenny Brack, Dario Franchitti, Michael Andretti, and this
year's Indianapolis 500 winner, Juan Montoya _ are tearing around a
2-mile street circuit lined with fans.
</P>
<P>
   Barriers and temporary grandstand seating have been erected
around the Public Garden. On Charles Street, between the Public
Garden and Boston Common, there is a temporary pit road and paddock
area. The speed limit on Beacon Street, Arlington Street, and
Commonwealth Avenue is now in excess of 100 miles per hour as cars
circle the Garden, scream down a high-speed straightaway on Comm.
Ave, make a hairpin turn on Exeter Street, and head back toward the
start/finish line on Charles Street.
</P>
<P>
   If CART officials have their way, and find a promoter to step
up, that scenario could play out two years from now. It is all part
of a recently-announced initiative by CART, with the joint
cooperation of Dover Downs Entertainment, to develop new markets
beginning in 2002. The cities where CART hopes to stage street
races are Atlanta, Denver, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San
Francisco, and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But can a CART race really fly in this city, where for nine
years traffic has been affected by that giant pothole known as the
Big Dig?
</P>
<P>
   Before he was fired Friday as CART's CEO and president, Andrew
Craig expressed optimism about such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional way in which we have located new venues is to
wait for someone to come along and tell us that they either have
built or are thinking about building a track in whatever city,''
Craig said in a telephone interview from Detroit Thursday. ``Then
we say, `Well, we're not interested,' or `We are interested.' And
that's not really a very good way to run your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Craig came to that realization a little too late.
Though the series under Craig's stewardship expanded beyond US
borders to Brazil, Japan, and Australia, CART's domestic attendance
figures and television ratings have sagged. Much of the decline was
attributed to the divisive open-wheel feud CART has waged with the
Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, that cost Craig his job.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced on the nine-member CART board by Bobby
Rahal, a former driver and current car owner, who will step in
until a permanent successor is found. James Hardymon, the former
chairman and CEO of Textron Inc., replaced Craig as CART's board
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shakeup, CART remains committed to the expansion of
its series to larger American markets. CART will not return to St.
Louis after this season and took steps Friday to solidify its 2001
schedule by announcing that the race at Homestead-Miami Speedway
was no longer on the slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for are cities which tend to have more
young people than the average, with a somewhat higher-than-average
income _ large cities, obviously, where we'd perform better on TV
than elsewhere,'' Craig said. ``And Boston makes the cut on all of
those, so certainly it is somewhere we'd like to race.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bold initiative to bring races to the masses instead of
drawing the masses to remote locales such as Nazareth, Pa., which
will no longer be on the CART schedule after 2001, and Loudon,
N.H., where attendance pales in comparison to crowds drawn by the
NASCAR Winston Cup Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we recognize that we're looking at eight possible
venues and that we may not go to every one of those,'' Craig said.
``We recognize that the Big Dig is a huge issue, but I think we
clearly want to put our flag in the ground and say `Look, this is a
city we'd like to be in,' and we hope that causes a constructive
discussion of sorts among potential race promoters who may look at
the opportunity. There are always opportunities in every city that
can be worked out if there's somebody who really wants to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a race in Boston does happen, Craig's only regret will be
that he won't be here to preside over it as CART's president and
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Back in gear
</P>
<P>
   A week after winning the Indy 500, Montoya began defense of the
CART title he won as a rookie in 1999 by capturing the rain-delayed
Miller Lite 225 at West Allis, Wis. It was Montoya's first CART
FedEx victory of the season, and the first for his Toyota engine
supplier, making the 24-year-old wunderkind from Bogota, Colombia,
the sixth different winner in as many CART events this season,
matching a series record established in 1991. Montoya, who scored
22 points to move into a fourth-place tie with Andretti in the CART
FedEx standings, will try to make it two in a row in Sunday's
Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. ``It was frustrating not
to get a win until our sixth (CART) race,'' said Montoya, ``but I
know we'll be back on the podium soon.'' Montoya was subjected to
some good-natured ribbing during a Thursday night appearance on
``Late Show with David Letterman'' for his wild opening toss at a
recent Yankees game and the steamy kiss he shared with his
girlfriend in Victory Lane at Indy. But when pressed by Letterman
on rumors of his imminent departure to Formula One, Montoya said he
was in the second year of a three-year contract with car owner Chip
Ganassi and planned to return next year to the CART series . . .
NASCAR Winston Cup driver Tony Stewart will go for his third
victory in a row in Sunday's Pocono 500. Stewart backed up his
first victory of the season at Dover, Del., two weeks ago with a
rain-shortened triumph in the Kmart 400 last weekend at Michigan
Speedway. Stewart, who set rookie records last season with three
victories and a fourth-place finish in points, is seventh in the
current standings, 295 points behind Joe Gibbs Racing teammate
Bobby Labonte. ``I'm happy winning two in a row. I don't know
anybody that wouldn't be,'' said Stewart, who had two crashes and a
mechanical failure in the first 14 races of his grueling 34-race
schedule . . . Melling Racing announced it would join the Dodge
Motorsports lineup, becoming the fourth NASCAR team to commit to
campaigning the Dodge Intrepid next season, along with Evernham
Motorsports (which will field cars for Bill Elliott and Casey
Atwood), Bill Davis Racing (Ward Burton and Dave Blaney), and Petty
Enterprises (Kyle Petty and John Andretti). Car owner Mark Melling,
who will switch from Ford to Dodge, said he signed away the rights
to his traditional No. 9 to Elliott and will field car No. 92 next
season. ``That's 92 for nine the second time around,'' Melling said
. . . Busch North driver Tracy Gordon made it two in a row with his
victory in the Primestar 150 at Beech Ridge Speedway in
Scarborough, Maine, last weekend. Gordon now leads Brad Leighton,
last year's series champion, in the Busch North standings, 874-787
. . . The Indy Racing League recently signed an agreement with
Texas Motor Speedway to host two races each year through 2004,
including the first race after the Indy 500 and the IRL season
finale. ``Texas Motor Speedway is a five-star motorsports facility,
and we are proud to know that the Indy Racing Northern Light Series
will have a home here for the next four years,'' said IRL founder
Tony George. The IRL will look to expand its nine-race schedule
next year with races at new oval venues in Chicago and Kansas City,
Kan. . . . Scott Sharp recorded the closest margin of victory in
IRL history when he beat Robby McGehee across the finish line by a
scant .059 seconds in last weekend's Casino Magic 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway. Sharp's victory, his first of the IRL season and
fifth of his career, was closer than Robby Buhl's .064-second win
over Vincenzo Sospiri at NHIS Aug. 17, 1997.

MLADIN EARNS POLE FOR SUPERBIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ It was a magnanimous gesture, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Mat Mladin had no sooner won the pole position in record fashion
for the Superbike event of Sunday's 77th AMA Loudon Classic when he
suggested that Eric Bostrom, who was fastest during Friday's
preliminary qualifying, was equally deserving of the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Mladin wasn't being charitable. He was merely speaking the truth
when he said, ``Eric should be sitting here on the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom, who set a track record with his lap of 1 minute 10.042
seconds (82.236 miles per hour) on the 12-turn, 1.6-mile road
course at New Hampshire International Speedway, figured his time
would land him the pole for Sunday's AMA Chevy Trucks Superbike
Championship race when Saturday's second qualifying session was
interrupted by a two-hour rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   However, once the track was deemed sufficiently dried, AMA
officials gave the green light on qualifying. It was a move that
caught Bostrom by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was still two more 750 qualifying sessions
left,'' he said. ``When they called us out (to qualify), I was
still in my street clothes. It caught me off guard, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom, as a result, struggled to get up to speed on track
conditions he described as ``sketchy,'' turning a fast lap of
1:10.007. With about 8 minutes left in the session, Mladin vaulted
to the pole when he surpassed Bostrom's track record with a fast
lap of 1:09.947 (82.348 m.p.h.) on his Suzuki 750.
</P>
<P>
   It resulted in Mladin's third pole of the Superbike season and
14th overall of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should've let us stay on the schedule (in which case the
2:30 qualifying session would've been rained out),'' said Mladin,
28, of Australia, who will take a scant 1-point lead (171-170) over
Nicky Hayden, 18, of Owensboro, Ky., in the AMA Superbike
standings. ``They should've let us stay on the times (from Friday's
session) and not run this qualifying session . . . Eric should be
sitting here on the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom, whose fast lap came one lap after Mladin's
record-setting tour, will start on the front row on his Kawasaki
along with Yamaha rider Hayden and Aaron Yates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Bowman of Boynton Beach, Fla., recorded his first career
AMA victory in Saturday's Lockhart Phillips USA 750 Supersport
race. It was the second podium finish of his career after a
third-place effort in last year's race at NHIS. ``I like all the
racetracks,'' said Bowman, who took the checkered flag on his Team
Hooters Suzuki over runner-up Jimmy Moore and third-place finisher
Damon Buckmaster. ``This one is a test. It's really tough and I
just hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After crashing in qualifying Friday, Kurtis Roberts of Modesto,
Calif., took another step toward defending the Formula Xtreme
championship he won last year with his third straight win of the
season in Saturday's race at NHIS. Joshua Hayes of Gulfport, Miss.,
finished runner-up to his Erion Racing Honda teammate, while Jake
Zemke of Paso Robles, Calif., finished third.

WWF BRINGS ITS TOUCH TO XFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ They were sitting around a conference room
table, coming up with up names for their racy, no-holds-barred
television show. They were thinking along the lines of MTV's
``Unplugged.''
</P>
<P>
   One member of the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc.
brain trust said, ``It has to be something raw, and out there.''
Eyebrows were raised. ``Oh, raw.'' That was it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, according to WWF fan services administrator Adam Hopkins,
they toyed with the word. Someone said it backward. Raw. War.
``They started calling it `Raw is War' and they figured it was a
nice palindrome,'' said Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   That led to spinoffs from WWFE, the unabashed 20-year-old
entertainment giant that long ago discovered a common pulse among a
viewing audience of different ages _ and presumably different
tastes. It locked in on that pulse and has been holding on with a
grip that could choke a cow.
</P>
<P>
   WWFE stages approximately 200 live events each year, produces
nine hours of original programming each week, and distributes its
wares in 120 countries in 11 languages . . . WWF's ``Raw Is War''
is the No. 1-rated regularly scheduled program on all of cable
television . . . WWF's ``Smackdown!'' is the top-rated program on
United Paramount Network . . . The WWF event ``King of the Ring''
scheduled for June 25 at the FleetCenter, sold out in 4 1/2 minutes
. . . Autobiographies of WWF superstars The Rock and Mankind both
topped the New York Times Bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   The company now wants to get its grip on the pulse of the
nation's football fans, with a new league whose season will begin
almost immediately after the Super Bowl. They believe you want to
watch more football after January, and they plan to give it to you
with an uninhibited, fan-oriented edge that has made programs like
``Raw'' popular.
</P>
<P>
   But what to call it? Early on, they thought along the same lines
as their flagship show. ``Raw Football''? No, that didn't work.
Then they thought along the lines of the latest craze among young
people: extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Extreme Football League? Not quite. They needed
something shorter and catchier, something folks could remember,
like NFL, NBA, NHL.
</P>
<P>
   How about XFL? That was it. Doesn't stand for anything. Just
XFL.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL is a $100 million joint venture of WWFE and NBC, each of
which will invest $50 million and own 50 percent of the league.
NBC, which lost its NFL coverage three years ago, will carry XFL
games on Saturday nights in prime time leading up the championship
game April 2, 2001. UPN also will televise 10 regular-season games
and one playoff game on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   WWFE has lured some top names in sports and entertainment for
the venture, including former NBC executive producer Michael
Weisman (as broadcast consultant), former MLS president Billy Hicks
(administrative vice president), former NFL and USFL executive Mike
Keller (football operations), and former Dallas Cowboys star
receiver Drew Pearson (advisory panel member).
</P>
<P>
   WWFE has announced four of the eight XFL cities: New York,
Chicago, Orlando, and Los Angeles. Sources close to the company
said San Jose, Memphis, and Birmingham will be announced soon. The
eighth site has yet to be determined, but it will not likely be
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing by their own rules
</P>
<P>
   Already XFL officials are boasting about the league's style of
play, which unlike the WWF will not be scripted or staged: It will
be 1960s and 1970s smashmouth football, with no fair catches or
touchbacks, less protection for the quarterback, and bump-and-run
play for wide receivers and cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   End zone celebrations will be allowed. Cameras and microphones
will be attached to players and coaches, on the sidelines and in
the locker room. There will be a 10-minute halftime and a 35-second
play clock. There's even talk of allowing the head slap.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking to do is not get a shift in the (nation's
football) ritual,'' said XFL president Basil DeVito. ``We're
looking to provide an extension of that ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is not another throng of deep-pocketed investors
trying to invade NFL airspace; this is one of the world's most
successful entertainment companies trying to succeed in the world
of mainstream sports.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they've pushed the entertainment envelope with their
outrageous, controversial _ some would say perverse _ wrestling
programs. But the WWF's secret to success, its officials say, can
be illustrated in one image: Picture a father entering a room while
his teenage son is seated before a blaring TV set. Dad takes a
seat. Son doesn't move. And both the volume and the channel remain
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something dads and teens connect on,'' said DeVito, a
former WWF president. ``Don't ask me why. I'm not a sociologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they will try to make that same connection with the nation's
football fans, who historically have shown only a temporary
interest in anything beyond the NFL. XFL officials plan to move
right past the novelty stage by making a lasting impression from
day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only a certain amount of curiosity to anything,''
said Vince McMahon, the WWF's cofounder and chairman, and one of
its most visible figures. ``We are long-range oriented, big on
hype, but bigger on substance. We always say that if we don't beat
the marketplace this week, the public won't have the same
expectations from us the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said he has considered starting up a new league for
about five years, and before that he thought about purchasing the
Canadian Football League or the Minnesota Vikings. He wants not so
much to be what other leagues aren't as to put the WWF stamp on
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were running the NFL, I would make one of the
prerequisites for owning a team having to line up and be the
tackling dummy for an afternoon,'' he said. ``Know what the game is
all about. Know about contact. Know the passion of the players.
Play and understand the game and get in it, rather than sitting in
a skybox having margaritas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder what prompts those confrontations between coach and
player you've seen on NFL sidelines? That won't be a problem in the
XFL. Cornerback and wide receiver taunting each other at the line
of scrimmage? You'll hear it in the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the XFL will give fans an opportunity to express
themselves during games.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so many opportunities to unveil
behind-the-scenes aspects of the game, XFL officials say, there
won't be a need for the scripts and prearranged outcomes of the
WWF.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of story-line drama when Roger Clemens
goes back to Boston to pitch,'' said DeVito, ``and it's a matter of
how you present that drama. There is no need, in competitive
sports, to script that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to allow the natural personalities of the game and
the athletes to be brought out, exposed, and promoted as never
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give a player who just created the winning play an
opportunity to express himself with his helmet off, you're going to
get some real, raw emotion. And that's what we're looking for:
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting the word out
</P>
<P>
   When former University of New Haven football players Mario
Didino and Dave Menard were interviewed about their possible
participation in the XFL, they had almost as many questions as
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you heard about it? What do you think?'' said
Didino, an offensive lineman from Providence who was contacted by
XFL officials after being cut by the Barcelona Dragons of NFL
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL, which sent out questionnaires to 3,700 prospective
``clients'' and will hold its first draft in October, clearly has
its work cut out when it comes to educating players about the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably know as much about it as I do,'' said Menard, a
linebacker from Attleboro, Mass., who was cut by the Cleveland
Browns during preseason camp last year. ``I'm honored that they've
shown interest in me, and I would love to be an ambassador for a
league just starting out, but I just don't know much about it yet.
No one does.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the players' concerns is safety, which is not surprising
considering the problems in disseminating information about the
league. An Internet site called XFLFootball.com, which is not
affiliated with WWFE, has a cartoon of a disheveled placekicker
with a caption that reads, ``Not only is roughin' the kicker
allowed . . . It's encouraged!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a player call up and he said, `Geez, are you really
going to be doing these things? I don't know if I want to play in a
dangerous game,' '' said Keller, a former Dallas Cowboys
linebacker. ``And I said, `No, we believe in players' safety more
than players do.' There are just rules in there that create great
competitive matchups that go back to the toughness that the game
was.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the league that will make players want to learn
more: It will be the best-paying football league outside of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Players will receive a base salary of $50,000, and there will be
a pool of money to be split among those on the winning team after
each game. Ties will be discouraged, as neither team will split the
pot in that event. Each member of the championship team will
receive another $25,000-$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say a team goes 7-3 during the regular season, wins the
playoff and the final,'' said DeVito. ``The player who would have
played the entire 12-game schedule would earn about $110,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's another lure: XFL-contracted players will be allowed to
play in other leagues. Make a name for yourself with the XFL, get
noticed by an NFL team, and you can sign with them, as long as you
honor the remaining portion of your XFL contract.
</P>
<P>
   Said Keller, ``How can I look you in the eye and say, `You can't
go on and make $500,000, you have to stay here and make $75,000?' I
wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But will this turn the XFL into nothing more than a farm system
for the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it depends on an individual's promotional
contract when we develop our own stars, whether they play in the
NFL or stay where they are,'' said McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   XFL officials, many of whom have NFL roots, say they are
confident NFL officials will welcome their league _ even though
some in the XFL have taken indirect shots at the NFL by saying no
felons will be allowed. NFL officials declined comment on the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   Though XFL officials might use WWF venues to promote XFL events,
you won't see wrestlers in XFL uniforms. Hopkins said stars such as
The Rock and Steve Austin earn up to $5 million a year and would
not take a pay cut to suit up for the new league.
</P>
<P>
   But Hopkins did offer this suggestion to McMahon during a
roundtable discussion: Change the popular WWF event known as the
Royal Rumble to the Royal Fumble, in which a football is dropped
among wrestlers in a steel cage and they must battle for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of looked at me cross-eyed and said, `Stick to
football,' '' said Hopkins.

CASTILLO TAKES WBC LIGHTWEIGHT TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELL GARDENS, Calif. _ With supporters shouting, ``Mexico,
Mexico,'' Jose Luis Castillo of Guymas, Mexico, lived out a dream
Saturday at the Bicycle Club Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, in a workmanlike performance, took the World Boxing
Council lightweight title from Stevie Johnston of Denver with a
majority 12-round decision before 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dr. James Jen-Kim favored Castillo, 116-111. Dick Young
scored the bout a 114-114 draw. And Gelasio Percy had Castillo
winning, 115-113.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, 27, is 30-2. He was attempting to make his 10th title
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, 26, improved to 41-4. It was his first shot at a major
world championship. That he won this particular belt was especially
pleasing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream of mine to bring the lightweight title back to
Mexico for all the other (Mexicans) who had it; Julio Cesar Chavez,
Cesar Bazan and Miguel Angel Gonzalez,`` Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was winning the fight because I was pressing all
the rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   That he was. More than anything, it was the inside fighting of
Castillo that provided the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was just a great inside fighter, you gotta give it to
him,'' said Johnston, who suffered a cut over his right eye, which
was nearly shut at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan was to fight him a little farther out, but I stayed
too close in. That was my mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Featherweight Steven Luevano of La Puente didn't waste any time
making an impression in his professional debut.
</P>
<P>
   Luevano, aggressive from the outset, stopped Hugo Rosales (1-2)
of Mexico at 2:32 of the second round after connecting with a right
uppercut.
</P>
<P>
   The bout was scheduled for four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Luevano, 19, was fighting before about 35 friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous,'' said Luevano, who was 189-16 as an
amateur, including 11 national titles and a recent second-place
finish in the Olympic Trials box-offs at 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shaky in the beginning,'' Luevano said. ``I was
wondering what he was going to be like. But he wasn't doing
anything. He was just waiting for me. So I was just boxing like I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Luevano caught Rosales midway through the second round with a
left cross. Shortly thereafter he hammered Rosales with the right
uppercut, and the referee stopped the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want nothing bad to happen, like get caught with a
lucky shot and go down,'' Luevano said. ``I got hit with one good
punch, but it didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Luevano also said he liked not having to wear the headgear for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the punches coming more easily,'' Luevano said.
</P>
<P>
   Luevano's cousin, Marshall Martinez of Fontana, also won his
professional debut. Martinez, 19, won a four-round unanimous
decision over Armen Kalagian (0-1-1) of Yerezen, Armenia, in the
lightweight division.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez suffered a gruesome cut on the left side of his nose
from a head-butt in the first round. It bled profusely. Martinez
had rocked Kalagian a couple of times in the round, but after the
cut he changed his strategy and became more of a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay away so I wouldn't get hit more in the
nose,'' Martinez said. ``The nose really hurt. I had to start
boxing. I had to lose my brawling style.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won by three scores of 40-36.

DE LA HOYA WOULDN'T PAY, BUT ARUM DID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya made a statement last week to
boxing's three crime families, the World Boxing Council, World
Boxing Association, and International Boxing Federation. So did his
promoter. As is often the case with fighter and promoter, they
didn't say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya said he would no longer do business with the WBC,
whose welterweight title he defended Saturday night against Shane
Mosley. He said this by refusing to pay its extortionist
sanctioning price, a ``fee'' charged for the right to fight for a
plastic belt that no longer carries much meaning because of the way
the three organizations have distorted rankings and sold out one
fighter after another.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, who says he often agrees with De La Hoya's point that the
organizations exploit boxers, promoters, and managers alike and
testified to that effect a week ago in federal court, nevertheless
resorted to business as usual with the WBC. And for the usual
reason: money.
</P>
<P>
   The standard 3 percent fee would have been a pretty good day for
the WBC because De La Hoya's purse could run well over $10 million,
depending on pay-per-view sales. De La Hoya refused to pay,
however, and made a public declaration to that effect Wednesday
with WBC president Jose Sulaiman standing in the back of the room
with a sour look on his face. But Arum gave in, agreeing to pay the
WBC a fee out of his proceeds. According to Arum, it would have
cost him several million dollars in international television
revenue if the WBC had removed its sanction.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the sanction, the winner surely would have been
recognized as the WBC welterweight champion. But De La Hoya,
Sulaiman, and Arum all knew the promoter did what promoters and
managers have done for decades now. He paid the ``fee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wasn't going to pay fees anymore and I'm not,'' De La
Hoya said. ``I'm standing by my word. No more taking advantage of
the fighters. I'm sticking to my guns. They're still getting paid,
but that's on Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he needed the WBC sanctioning to maximize income from
international television and to promote De La Hoya for a world tour
beginning in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why they need to generate millions of
dollars per annum,'' said Cedric Kushner, Mosley's promoter. ``I
wonder who is receiving this money. If it's not the fighters, who
is it benefiting?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is being driven home day after day in a federal court
in New Jersey, where IBF president Bob Lee is on trial for
accepting bribes for rankings and where Arum testified against him:
The sanctioning bodies are benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya tried to do his part to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Arum didn't join him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   One reason former junior middleweight champion David Reid
decided to move up to middleweight after losing the 154-pound title
to Felix Trinidad was that he was told by noted conditioning expert
Mackie Shilstone that he had only 2.9 percent body fat despite
weighing 165 pounds. Reid, the WBC's No. 2 middleweight, believes
he could beat champion Keith Holmes easily. He is willing to return
to 154 to fight Trinidad or IBF champion Fernando Vargas in title
fights but otherwise is seeking a shot at IBF middleweight champion
Bernard Hopkins, his rival from Philadelphia. Problem is, Hopkins
wants to pursue light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. on the way
up or Trinidad at 160, while Jones wants to pursue Evander
Holyfield and Trinidad wants a second shot at De La Hoya's chin.
Chances are, none of them will catch up to each other soon . . .
HBO Sports vice president Kery Davis believes the recent signing of
Trinidad to a multifight deal, which should carry him through
mid-2002 exclusively on HBO and TVKO, has done more than assure HBO
of a rematch between Trinidad and De La Hoya. ``It gives us four of
the six best fighters in the world,'' Davis said. ``Even if a
rematch with Oscar doesn't happen, we should still get some other
big fights with Trinidad and Vargas or Hopkins. Mosley would fight
him at a catch weight if he beats Oscar. This (between 147 and 160)
is the most exciting division in boxing right now. It's similar to
the days of (Marvin) Hagler, (Thomas) Hearns, (Sugar Ray) Leonard,
and (Roberto) Duran, and we have the top guys.'' . . . To build
interest in Trinidad in the United States, HBO will heavily promote
his July 22 fight in Miami, a mandatory defense of the WBA super
welterweight title against Mamadou Thiam. ``We intend to make it an
HBO event,'' Davis said. ``We want to try to raise Felix's
visibility and his popularity. He doesn't speak English, which is a
problem, but the bottom line is he may be the best fighter in the
world.'' . . . One problem with a possible De La Hoya-Trinidad
rematch is weight; as the gap widens, De La Hoya will become less
inclined to fight him. Last week, Trinidad indicated for the first
time his willingness to come down several pounds from the 154 he
says he now fights at, but he still insisted De La Hoya come up 4
or 5 pounds, which De La Hoya is not ready to do. If Trinidad does
as he has suggested and moves up to 160 to challenge for Hopkins's
middleweight title while De La Hoya remains at 147, then the
likelihood of a rematch is nil. ``You get 13 pounds between them
and you got a problem,'' Davis said . . . Mike Tyson's assistant
trainer, Jay Bright, had an interesting description of what
happened to Michael Grant when he froze up against Lewis and was
destroyed in less than two rounds in April. ``He didn't show his
true talent,'' Bright said. ``Michael Grant let his feelings
constipate his abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Mayweather Jr. is facing possible isolation after HBO
pulled its contract offer off the table for the second time because
of new manager James Prince's demands on Mayweather's behalf.
Mayweather's reaction was to evict his father-trainer Floyd Sr.
from his Las Vegas home for nonpayment of rent and to repossess his
father's car. He also evicted his younger sister the day before her
high school graduation in Las Vegas. Mayweather and Prince then
went looking for a new trainer and reportedly have been turned down
by Emanuel Steward, Miguel Diaz, and even Mayweather's uncle Roger
. . . Prince has also taken over the career of WBA welterweight
champion James Page. Not long after that, Page announced he will
not fight for promoter Don King again after a mandatory defense vs.
Andrew Lewis. King says he has a long-term contract, and with King
that often means until three days after you're dead. If Page and
Prince try to break it, they may find out how long a champion can
go without work. The way Prince is going, he's going to have the
biggest stable of unemployed or underpaid world champions in boxing
. . . New York promoter Joe DeGuardia has been charged with double
dipping for allegedly taking a one-third manager's fee from the
purse of Lou Del Valle when he fought Jones last July 18 and then
also accepted a check for $132,500 as a promotional fee from
Kushner, the promoter of record. DeGuardia was paid $238,833.33
from Kushner as his slice of Del Valle's $798,000 purse and his
promotional company received a second check for the remainder, a
violation of a New York law. Asked if DeGuardia knew what was going
on at the time, Kushner said, ``He's a lawyer, isn't he?'' . . .
Tyson's trainers, Bright and Tommy Brooks, insist their man will
appear as scheduled June 24 in Glasgow to meet Lou Savarese despite
Tyson delaying his arrival in England to attend the funeral of a
friend who was shot on a Brooklyn street corner last week. The
fight has been postponed twice by Tyson, but Tyson reportedly has
been training diligently of late to peel off some of the 274 pounds
he had swollen to during the idle time since his quick blowout of
Julius Francis in February. The fight is expected to attract
40,000-plus at Hamden Park, a Scottish soccer stadium . . .
Savarese's trainer, Jesse Reid, once trained Tyson for 10 days
before he was fired after a string of angry exchanges. Reid now
claims, ``Tyson walks a tightrope. I do not think he's right
mentally. He has a lot of negativity in his mind. We're going to
work on that and try to bring it out. We're going to try to break
his heart and mind. When you do that to a fighter, you've got
him.'' . . . David Tua made such quick work of Obed Sullivan that
Nevada Athletic Commission executive director Marc Ratner approved
Tua as an instant opponent for John Ruiz June 10 if King wanted to
use him as a substitute for Holyfield, but neither King nor Ruiz
was interested. Ratner said he would have approved the quick
turnaround for Tua because he defeated Sullivan in less than a
minute and passed a postfight physical . . . IBF junior
welterweight champion Zab Judah has a new opponent for his first
title defense next weekend. He was originally set to fight Jason
Rowland (24-1) but now will be in with another Brit, Junior Witter,
about whom he knows very little. What he does know is that although
the IBF recently named Terron Millett ``champion in recess,''
school's out on the IBF title because he now holds it. The IBF has
termed him ``interim champion,'' but Judah is of the opinion that
his term will be a long one.

PRONGER'S DOUBLE AWARD BRINGS HART-ACHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Pronger, the NHL's top defenseman and most valuable
player?
</P>
<P>
   Where did they get the ballot boxes this year, out of some
back-county Alabama sheriff's race?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Pronger is truly one of the game's fine talents. Once a
struggling soul on the Forever .500s backline, he has spent the
last three years chiseling himself into an impressive chunk of
granite in the Blues' game plan. Given his age (28), his size (6
feet 6 inches), and what looks to be an extending growth curve in
his game, he probably would be the first defenseman any of the
Original 30 would select in an open draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Norris Trophy and Hart Trophy? Hello, Professional Hockey
Writers' Association? Has that repetitive-stress disorder worked
its way up your arms?
</P>
<P>
   I'll grant the Norris without argument, although the good folks
in Detroit might wonder just what Nicklas Lidstrom has to do take
home that prize: He has been runner-up three straight seasons. The
last guy to finish second three straight years was then-Ranger Brad
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before I get into the Hub's indignity over Pronger, let's
review the definition of the Hart (MVP) Trophy: ``The player
adjudged to be the most valuable to his team.'' We don't even have
to get into the discussion about who is the best player in the game
and blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   Just working off the definition, it says here that goaltender
Roman Turek was the player most valuable to the Blues in 1999-2000.
Take Turek out of the cage and the Blues would be back around .500
at best. Losing Pronger would not be nearly as damaging. So the
argument should end right there in the Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as for the rub in the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, who edged Jaromir Jagr by a single point (396-395) in
the balloting, now stands shoulder to shoulder with Bobby Orr as
the only ones to win the Norris and Hart in the same season. Orr
did it three times ('70-72). Placing Pronger on a par with Orr is
just as inappropriate as comparing Michael Jordan to anyone playing
in the NBA today. History will now link Orr and Pronger. Someone
get me the bolt cutters, titanium-coated please.
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's travel back 10 years and review the outcome of the
'90 Hart balloting:
</P>
<P>
   Winner _ Mark Messier; runner-up _ Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Response now, as it was then: What!?
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, edged by 2 points in the balloting, didn't win then
because many voters held that defensemen were accorded due
recognition with the Norris Trophy alone. That kind of thinking
changed in the '90s when goaltender Dominik Hasek copped
back-to-back Harts. A goalie hadn't been MVP since Jacques Plante
in '62.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, without question, should have won the Hart in 1990.
Messier was still a valuable part of the Oiler dynasty, but the
Bruins without Bourque never could have dreamed of making it to the
Stanley Cup finals (against Messier's Oilers) for a second time in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   To see the old defensemen-need-not-apply standard dropped now
makes it even harder to look at Bourque both Cupless and Hartless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes going wild
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, with Wayne Gretzky at the money wheel, say they're
committed to not cutting payroll for 2000-01, and it appears
they'll make room to pay Nikolai Khabibulin the $4 million-$5
million he wanted last summer before moving to the sidelines for
the full 1999-2000 season. Meanwhile, Mikael Renberg, obtained from
Philadelphia in the late-season swap for ex-Bruin Rick Tocchet,
told the Desert Dogs last week that he'll play the next five years
back home in Sweden (Lulea). There's a saving of $2 million right
there, although there are better ways to save dough than to lose a
28-year-old right winger who not long ago looked as if he could
score 60-80 points every season . . . By the way, don't be
surprised if Tocchet, 35, an unrestricted free agent, signs back on
with the Coyotes. Prior to agreeing to buy in as a partner, Gretzky
consulted regularly about the Desert Dogs with his old pal from LA
days . . . The Sabres all but cut ties with tough guy Rob Ray. They
also don't expect to bring back fellow pugilist Paul Kruse, the
30-year-old left winger who finished out the season in the minors.
Unless GM Darcy Regier goes shopping over the summer, the Sabres
will start the season without a resident ruffian . . . Petr Sykora,
last seen headed to Palookaville via a crushing, dirty check by
Derian Hatcher in Game 6 of the finals, recovered in time to take
the Devils' flight home from Dallas the next morning. Think anyone
on that flight had a bigger headache than Sykora? Linemate Patrik
Elias, as his pal Sykora was being wheeled off the ice on a
stretcher: ``Don't worry, we are going to win the Cup for you.'' .
. . Petr Bondra wants out of Washington and the Capitals want him
out of Washington. Trouble is, at $3.9 million, there won't be a
lot of takers. If he can't get it done with Adam Oates dishing him
the biscuit, then who is going to help him light it up? . . . NHL
insiders believe that Columbus still owes Colorado a favor for
picking up goalie prospect Marc Denis for only a second-round draft
pick. It could be that the Blue Jackets also agreed to take Rick
Tabaracci off the Avalanche's hands in Friday's expansion draft,
thus minimizing Colorado's risk of losing a serviceable forward or
defenseman . . . His game was gone when he came to the Bruins (37
games/15 points in '95-96), but it was nice to see ex-BC Eagle Joe
Mullen get voted into the Hall of Fame last week. Hockey dads keep
in mind: Mullen, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen, didn't pull on
skates until age 10. For his first ice time, he had to make his way
to New Jersey via bus or train. There were times, said Mullen, ``We
would be (accidentally) hitting commuters on the heads with our
sticks.'' Mullen will enter with Denis ``Spinarama'' Savard; Walter
L. Bush Jr., president of USA Hockey; and old pal Jim Matheson,
hockey columnist for the Edmonton Journal. Induction is Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And a cherry on top
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, by the way, picked up an extra $500,000 for his two
awards, a nice sweetener for his salary of $3.425 million. He's
headed into the final year of his contract, with a base salary of
$3.675 million, but look for Blues GM Larry Pleau to try to work
out a long-term extension over the summer. Pronger is one of the
few talents who could entice a club to forfeit five first-round
picks to sign him to a Group 2 free agent offer sheet . . . Shayne
Corson's scoring touch has faded, but a lot of clubs feel he still
has enough grit and soul to be an everyday asset. Montreal coach
Alain Vigneault said at the NHL Awards ceremonies Thursday night
that the Habs still want him back, but word around Montreal is that
they've offered only a three-year deal worth a total of $4.5
million (only $500,000 more than the one-year option they
declined). Corson is thinking more like $8 million over four years
. . . Remember this during Friday's expansion draft: In 1993, both
Florida and Anaheim figured the 28-year-old Czech goalie that
Buffalo left unprotected wasn't worth the time of day. And you know
the rest of Hasek's story . . . In a conference call last week, new
Rangers GM Glen Sather said this of ex-Bruin Stephane Quintal: ``I
think we are going to trade him.'' That said, the most likely
landing spot would be Montreal. Quintal was booted off the Rangers
for the final week of the regular season after being quoted in a
Montreal paper as saying that, on the whole, he would rather be
back with the Habs. The ``Q'' could make a nice fit behind the
Boston blue line, too, especially if the Bruins lose free agent Don
Sweeney. But the Rangers first would have to agree to pay at least
half of the $12 million he is due over the next three seasons . . .
No fewer than 45,000 Devil worshipers showed up in the Meadowlands
parking lot for New Jersey's victory party. Larry Brooks, hockey
columnist for the New York Post, now refers to 16W as the ``Exit of
Champions.'' Not quite the Canyon of Heroes, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Checking the Oil
</P>
<P>
   The position hasn't been finalized, but the next Oilers head
coach will be ex-Bruin Craig MacTavish, who was just 19 when he
first came to the Bay State as a University of Lowell pivot. Now
41, he'll succeed Kevin Lowe, who moved up to GM . . . Lou
Crawford, whose only shot at the big time came here with the Bruins
at the start of the '90s (26 games/3 points) has the top minor
league job for the Maple Leafs, coaching the AHL club in St.
John's, Newfoundland. He'll have ex-Whaler draft pick Kevin
McClelland, a four-time Cup winner with the Oilers, as his top aide
. . . Just three years ago, the three names in the mix as
prospective Bruins coaches were Pat Burns, Robbie Ftorek, and Jack
Parker. Of the three, who do you suppose is happiest this morning?
Ftorek, by the way, could see his name etched into the Cup, if the
Devils were to petition for it. ``I don't expect that,'' said
Ftorek, who was fired with eight games to go in the regular season.
``The only thing I'm working on now is my resume.'' . . . Roger
Neilson, still recovering from treatment for multiple myeloma, has
applications in to be head coach in Columbus, Minnesota, Calgary,
and Edmonton. Got to love the guy's guts and his passion . . . The
Colorado deal Bourque agreed to last week will add at least $6.5
million to his coffers, perhaps as much as $11.5 million if he also
plays in 2001-02. If the Avalanche don't want him back after paying
him $5.5 million next season, they'll essentially have to pay a
kill fee for '01-02, not unlike the $2 million the Canucks will
have to give Messier for negating the final two years of his deal,
worth $12 million . . . Ex-Bruin Wayne Cashman hasn't been asked
back to Philadelphia as an assistant. He wanted the No. 2 job in
Tampa Bay, but GM Rick Dudley also is considering John Tortorella
and Neilson . . . . . . In case you missed it, ex-Bruin Greg
Hawgood, a.k.a. Hawgie Hockey, signed again with Vancouver for a
bargain-basement $450,000. Left unprotected, he could be bound for
Columbus or Minnesota, which would give him eight cities on his NHL
resume . . . Meanwhile, the Canucks will hold an informal rookie
camp in Vancouver in July, and hope that prized rookies Daniel and
Henrik Sedin attend the freshman mixer . . . Pavel Bure picked up
the Rocket Richard Award as the league's leading goal scorer. To
his surprise, he also picked up a personalized photo, one of the
last things Rocket autographed before his death . . . Ex-Bruin Joe
Juneau flew from Quebec to Boston last week _ piloting a plane he
made himself. For those of us who never quite mastered the
one-timer, and also cringe at Toys ``R'' Us boxes that read, ``Some
assembly required,'' that makes Juneau some kind of wonderful.

CORDOVA IS JUST VISITING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty Cordova was sitting on the top step of the Toronto dugout
and making small talk with teammate John Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the place he thought he'd be when he signed as a free
agent with Boston six months ago. He was to be the outfield
insurance the Red Sox were desperately seeking.
</P>
<P>
   However, Marty Cordova isn't looking back. He's pleased to be
where he is. The Toronto Blue Jays are his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play for the Sox anymore and whatever the situation
was over there is in the past. Now I play for the Blue Jays,''
Cordova said. ``My job now is to try and beat the Red Sox, the
Yankees, and all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova wasn't in the starting lineup Saturday when the Blue
Jays took the field against the Red Sox after a 41-minute rain
delay, but he has given Toronto everything it had hoped for when he
signed March 27 _ a day after he was released by the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He filled in nicely when starting left fielder Shannon Stewart
went on the disabled list with a right hamstring pull. But with
Stewart back in the lineup, Cordova has been relegated to spot
duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a lot when he was hurt, but since he's been back,
it's been mostly against lefties and we haven't seen a lot of
lefties lately,'' he said. ``I think I've only been in three games
the past two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova played in 37 of Toronto's first 68 games. He was hitting
.277 with a pair of home runs and 11 runs batted in. He hit
successfully in 23 of 33 starts.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers compare favorably with those of the two men Cordova
had hoped to share playing time with in Boston. Darren Lewis was
hitting .301 with one home run and four RBIs, and Troy O'Leary was
batting .210 with five homers and 17 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova, who was the 1995 American League Rookie of the Year
with Minnesota when he hit .277 (24 HRs, 84 RBIs), would love to be
in the lineup more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's content to not be playing every day shouldn't
even be wearing a uniform,'' he said. ``I want to play every day
but you have three quality outfielders out there who deserve to be
there. I had my opportunity to play every day in Minnesota but I
let that get away from me so I have nobody to blame but myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever my role is here, if it's just playing against
lefties, then I'll do the best I can do. Whenever I'm out there
I'll always give it my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova said he hasn't paid much attention to the trade rumors
that have Sammy Sosa coming to Boston for a host of minor leaguers
and possibly Trot Nixon, but doesn't see how any team couldn't want
the slugging Cubs outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I really haven't given it a thought,''
he said, ``but I don't think anyone who'll hit 60 home runs and
drive in 100 runs can hurt. He can only help. I don't know what
their needs are over there, but I bet they'd love to have him.''

ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT CHARGE BEING STUDIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers plan to ``aggressively
contest'' allegations that they illegally recruited and signed a
Venezuelan pitcher who is now a part of their minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue centers on whether the Dodgers signed Felix Arellan to
a legal contract before his 16th birthday in 1997, which would be a
violation of baseball's minimum-signing-age rule.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office informed the Dodgers that it will soon
begin an investigation of the matter, based on the content of a
letter it received last month claiming misconduct in the signing of
Arellan, now 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers senior vice president Derrick Hall declined to discuss
the specifics of the case Saturday, citing the upcoming
investigation, but said the team will protest every allegation made
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did we ever claim to have a binding contract with
him before he was the age of 16,'' Hall said. ``In fact, that
shouldn't even be in question ... all the facts will come out soon
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will be the third in 12 months regarding the
Dodgers' possible illegal contact with foreign players. Last June,
two Cuban players, Juan Carlos Diaz and Josue Perez, were declared
free agents after baseball officials determined that the Dodgers
illegally recruited the players and arranged for their defections.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the commissioner's office ruled that the Dodgers
signed third baseman Adrian Beltre in the Dominican Republic before
his 16th birthday, although Hall quickly dismissed any connection
between the three incidents and stressed that the Arellan case did
not involve falsification of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it perfectly clear that this is in no way close
to the Beltre or the Cuban players situation,'' Hall said. ``In
this case there is no falsification of a birth certificate (as in
the Beltre case). That is not even in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Arellan nor his agent, Gus Dominguez, who also
represents the two Cuban players, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Arellan, a left-hander, began his second season with the
Dodgers' rookie-league team in Great Falls, Mont., last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nice knowing you: The Dodgers traded backup catcher and former
UCLA standout Adam Melhuse to the Colorado Rockies on Saturday for
a player to be announced, less than 24 hours after they recalled
him from Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The move was necessitated by the return of Beltre, who started
Saturday for the first time since going on the disabled list May 29
with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre singled and doubled in four at-bats, and the 28-year-old
Melhuse, who struck out Friday in his only at-bat with the Dodgers,
seemed to relish the chance to get a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely the way I see it,'' Melhuse said. ``I've
never been involved in a trade before, but I interpret that as (the
Rockies) really want me there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a better opportunity than what I got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd favorite: The biggest cheer of the afternoon came in the
top of the seventh inning, when Mark McGwire hit a fastball from
Antonio Osuna halfway up the left-field bleachers to give the
Cardinals a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's third home run against the Dodgers this year,
and he received a standing ovation from approximately
three-quarters of the Dodger Stadium fans. The home run was his
24th of the season and 546th of his career, putting McGwire two
short of Mike Schmidt for seventh on the all-time list.

DREW'S THREE-RUN HOMER DOWNS DREIFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the course of nine innings, the outcome of a
single pitch doesn't typically alter the course of a baseball game
all that much.
</P>
<P>
   It took just one pitch, however, to dampen the spirits of Darren
Dreifort and his Los Angeles Dodgers teammates Saturday afternoon,
as J.D. Drew's three-run home run in the fifth inning made the
difference in St. Louis' 4-3 victory before 46,048 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreif had great stuff, it was just that one pitch,'' said
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who also watched reliever Antonio
Osuna give up a home run to Mark McGwire in the seventh. ``The 0-2
pitch just got up and over the middle of the plate, and (Drew)
crushed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (4-5) escaped a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the fourth
inning and had seven strikeouts going into the fifth, but the
right-hander's luck finally ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria led off with a single, and Dreifort hit Jim
Edmonds with the next pitch. He came back to strike out McGwire and
Ray Lankford, but Drew drove an errant fastball over the fence in
right-center field for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right pitch, bad location,'' Dreifort said. ``If they don't
give Edmonds first base on a ball that didn't hit him - it missed
him by 10 inches - we're still playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort ended the fifth with his 100th pitch, and was pulled
for a pinch hitter in the bottom half of the inning to end another
frustrating outing. Dreifort, who struck out nine and allowed eight
hits and two walks, has won just one of his past six starts, but
that includes two no-decisions in which he threw well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Philadelphia and the Angels,'' Dreifort said,
referring to games in which he allowed a combined 13 runs in seven
innings, ``I think I've done pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew's home run wouldn't have meant nearly as much had the
Dodgers capitalized on two excellent scoring chances earlier in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth singled to lead off the first and advanced to
third on Gary Sheffield's one-out single, but Shawn Green flied to
left and Eric Karros struck out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre, activated from the disabled list before the game,
doubled to lead off the second and reached third on Paul LoDuca's
sharp single to left, but St. Louis pitcher Andy Benes retired the
bottom two hitters in the Dodgers' order, Alex Cora and Dreifort,
and got Hollandsworth to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (7-3) struck out 10, walked two and gave up seven hits in
six innings, and stumbled only once, when Gary Sheffield hit a
two-run, two-out home run to left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the deficit to one run in the eighth off
reliever Matt Morris, when Sheffield doubled into the right-field
corner, took third base when Eric Davis misplayed the ball, and
scored on Green's fielder's choice grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis closer Dave Veres retired the side in order in the
ninth to earn his second save in two games and his 13th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team (St. Louis) that you have to score on,''
Johnson said. ``Four runs against them is a good pitching job.
We're a little sluggish with the bats, but you have to tip your hat
to them because they made some good pitches when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort said the team isn't sluggish, just worn down from a
trying month full of injuries, roster moves and the fallout of the
Wrigley Field incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a hockey team with five guys in the penalty box and
the other team has a power play every time,'' Dreifort said. ``We
still have a hell of a team, no matter who is out there.''

TESTING IS UNDER WAY ON KC WEAPONS WORKERS EXPOSED TO BERYLLIUM
DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR and CAIT PURINTON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beryllium is a gray metal lighter than aluminum but stiffer than
steel. It is used to make other metals stronger and more resistant
to bending. It makes golf clubs harder, bicycle frames lighter and
nuclear weapons more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The metal is so toxic that in 1949 the government adopted a
maximum exposure limit of 2 micrograms per cubic meter of air over
eight hours. That is the equivalent of pulverizing a beryllium
marble and dispersing it into the air six feet high over one square
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Department of Energy concluded that the standard
should be only one-tenth that amount. But there was no standard at
all in the early 1940s, when beryllium became an element vital to
the nation's nuclear weapons program. And it was used in Kansas
City from the time the plant began making nuclear weapons
components in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest danger comes from breathing beryllium dust. So
those most at risk are the craftsmen who drilled, ground and shaped
beryllium-copper alloys into the parts that make warheads work. The
metal included about 2 percent beryllium to add strength to the
copper.
</P>
<P>
   But other workers _ including hundreds of people who tested,
inspected or processed beryllium copper alloys at the Kansas City
plant _ could have been exposed, Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because people react differently to beryllium, even incidental
exposure to the metal's dust can trigger the disease in some
people.
</P>
<P>
   At other weapons plants, some secretaries, security guards and
others who never handled beryllium were diagnosed with CBD. Even
some women whose only contact with the dust was through handling
their husbands' dirty work clothes came down with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   CBD is particularly insidious because it often does not show up
for 10 to 30 years after exposure, government researchers said.
That means even people who originally test negative to beryllium
sensitivity can become sensitive years after the last exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people develop the sensitivity within months of
exposure,'' Cragle said. ``Others won't show sensitivity for more
than 20 years. ... We have no idea how long after sensitivity that
a person will develop CBD. Those data are just now being
gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Paul Abma died before the government advised former
Kansas City workers to get tested.
</P>
<P>
   Abma, who worked at the plant from 1955 to his taking of early
retirement in 1992, died last November in New Mexico. His death
certificate lists lung cancer and emphysema as the causes of death.
CBD causes emphysema and is often accompanied by lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His widow, LaVerne Abma, said her husband's job was to mix, pot
and bake various metals, including beryllium. In January, LaVerne
Abma filed a workers' compensation claim against AlliedSignal,
saying his CBD was identified in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She said company officials acknowledged her husband's breathing
problems in 1982. They advised him to quit smoking. Abma retired in
1992 and the Abmas later moved to New Mexico to help his breathing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell officials would not discuss Abma's case. The only
response to the claim was filed on behalf of Honeywell and its
insurance carrier. It denied Abma's allegations and demanded
``strict proof ... on all elements of this claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Mainprize, who worked at the plant from 1979 to 1994,
said she had known about Abma's lung problem when they worked
together. But she said she didn't connect it to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his death brought realization to a lot of us that we
could test positive, too,'' Mainprize said.
</P>
<P>
   Several retired workers said they feared that their exposure to
beryllium at the Kansas City plant will lead to lung problems.
</P>
<P>
   They said they often lacked protective equipment and for years
used production techniques that would never be allowed today. They
said they were rarely warned about the toxic nature of the
materials they handled.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Andrews, who worked at the plant from 1968 to 1997, said
that when she started, her group routinely sanded or filed
beryllium copper bars to get rid of adhesives or metal burrs _ a
now prohibited technique that could create the toxic dust.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews' test results show abnormalities that could mean she's
on her way to developing sensitivity to beryllium. So Andrews will
undergo tests annually to determine whether the ailment is
developing inside her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Still Andrews is not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good place to work,'' said Andrews, who lives in
Independence. ``But there was a lot of ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roepke, the business representative for Lodge 314 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said
many workers told him they were never warned about the dangers of
the materials they handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were told what not to do,'' said Roepke, who worked in the
plant for 20 years. ``But you weren't told why, and you were never
told what the ramifications were if you did do it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials told The Kansas City Star that supervisors
instructed employees in the proper handling of beryllium at least
since 1958. At least since 1963, the company also gave beryllium
workers annual physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also used techniques, such as wet machining of parts
and the use of exhaust fans, that minimized beryllium dust. But
officials said at least two common grinding and polishing
procedures were done dry at least until the mid-1990s.

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nearly 6,400 former workers at the Honeywell
International plant in Kansas City are being asked to undergo tests
this year to determine whether they were exposed to toxic levels of
beryllium dust.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is one of 26 facilities in at least 10 states that the
Department of Energy has cited as possible sources of
beryllium-related disease. The illness, which has been linked to
lung cancer, is an incurable and often fatal ailment that eats away
lung tissue and causes breathing to grow increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Plant officials insist that the risk of exposure is minimal for
most workers at the plant, which makes triggers and other precision
parts for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facility from a safety standpoint is at world-class
levels,'' spokeswoman Sharon Tiley said. The Kansas City plant, she
said, has never had a confirmed case of chronic beryllium disease,
also known as CBD.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered to test all 2,850 current workers at
the Kansas City plant. Of 268 current workers who have been tested,
four were found to be sensitive to beryllium, a condition that can
be a precursor to CBD.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is owned by the Department of Energy and operated by
Honeywell International, which until last December was known as
AlliedSignal.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell officials said plant management took significant steps
over the past four decades to limit exposure to beryllium as the
dangers of the metal became known.
</P>
<P>
   But Energy Department officials acknowledge that, for most of
the plant's 51 years in operation, government standards for
protecting workers from the harmful effects of beryllium dust were
far more lax than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our handling of beryllium was a lot like the way we handled
asbestos,'' said David Caughey, the Energy Department's acting
assistant manager for safety and security at the plant. ``Our
knowledge of the dangers improved over time. Remember, we used to
put asbestos in schools. We stopped when we realized it wasn't a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Several former workers at the plant said they were rarely warned
about the dangers of beryllium. And today the government wants to
know if those days in the Kansas City plant have harmed them.
</P>
<P>
   The tests in Kansas City are part of a Department of Energy
effort to find former workers who contracted beryllium-related
ailments on the job and to provide compensation. Nationwide, the
testing and compensation program for workers involved in the
nuclear weapons industry is expected to cost at least $111 million
a year for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Letters about the tests were sent Nov. 30 to 2,571 retirees and
former employees of the Kansas City plant. Those that failed to
respond were sent another letter in March.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,270 people have responded. The tests are voluntary, and
673 persons were scheduled for blood tests. The rest chose not to
be tested, said Donna Cragle, an Oak Ridge, Tenn., researcher who
oversees the testing of former workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Letters will be sent later this year to 3,800 more former
employees at the Kansas City plant, she said. The notifications
have been staggered because so few laboratories perform the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department testing also covers employees of
subcontractors who came into the plants to install machinery, make
repairs or perform other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cragle said her program has tested about 15,700 current
and former nuclear weapons plant workers across the country for
beryllium exposure. About 400, or 2.5 percent, showed sensitivity.
About 140 have CBD, though not all of them suffer symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The government is so concerned about beryllium exposure that
plants involved with nuclear weapons were ordered last year to
develop a CBD prevention program. In January, a new regulation took
effect that cut the maximum allowable exposure level by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in April, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced that
the government would reverse its longstanding practice of opposing
workers' claims for compensation based on exposure to hazards at
nuclear weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposed a package of benefits worth
at least $100,000 to each worker suffering diseases caused by
exposure to beryllium or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the Senate approved an even more generous proposal.
The plan would allow workers who are victims of beryllium,
radiation or silicosis to receive a minimum of $200,000 in
benefits. No price tag has been put on the Senate plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the cost of the Cold War,'' said David
Michaels, assistant secretary of energy for environment, safety and
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it making peace with the past. We spend millions each
year to clean up environmental problems associated with nuclear
weapons. We have an obligation to meet the human costs as well.''

THOSE LINKED TO JOHN ROBINSON SHARE ONE CHARACTERISTIC: ALL WERE
FEMALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Their names may forever appear on the same
page from one of the ugliest chapters on area crime. But for now,
the 11 dead and missing persons linked to John E. Robinson Sr.
share just one obvious characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   All were female.
</P>
<P>
   The first to vanish, Paula Godfrey, 19, was a hometown skater
with a confident, competitive way on the ice and a bright future 16
years ago. And the last to die, Suzette Trouten, 27, was lured away
this spring from her restaurant job in Michigan by someone
promising to pay her well as a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   In between are middle-age women, a disabled teen-ager, a baby
and her 19-year-old mother, a college student born in Poland and
two victims still unidentified. A few were local; several were from
out of town, apparently drawn to Robinson because of loneliness or
a quest for adventure or sex.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the women who have crossed paths with this married,
middle-age father of four have made the headlines. Some not listed
among the missing or dead appear from court records to have been
prostitutes. Others got involved intimately, but escaped his orbit.
Still others shunned his propositions completely.
</P>
<P>
   From all that, does another pattern emerge?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators won't yet discuss what lies within a high stack of
legal papers on Robinson, who has spent much of his life
flimflamming people and now is jailed on five counts of murder and
linked with six other missing persons. But Johnson County, Kan.,
District Attorney Paul Morrison hinted at a ``developing financial
angle'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   None of the missing or dead women appears to have been rich.
Most, in fact, were young and struggling, far separated from their
families. Yet some had access to checks _ Social Security or
alimony payments, for example _ or were allegedly hired to help
Robinson's companies make money.
</P>
<P>
   Women and money. Records suggest that Robinson has long obsessed
on both, exploiting one to get the other.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his alleged victims wanted to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly J. Bonner, the oldest, talked of going overseas in a new
line of work after leaving her library job at the Western Missouri
Correctional Center in Cameron, Mo. Robinson had served time there
between 1991 and 1993 on theft and fraud convictions.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Eugenia Reece, recalled Bonner's departure from
Cameron:
</P>
<P>
   ``She had tears running down her cheeks. She was such a darling
woman, and I don't think she wanted to leave her friends. But she
was excited about this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Bonner's name would appear on papers filed in Missouri as
president for Hydro-Gro Inc., ostensibly a horticultural firm that
appears much like defunct Kansas firms Robinson created in the
1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Bonner may have first met each other decades
earlier in Kansas City, when both worked at Mobil Oil Corp.'s
credit offices on West 10th Street. Robinson was a systems analyst
there in 1970; Bonner was a supervisor in another division.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sharp gal,'' said Jim Chappell, a former Mobil employee.
``She was very businesslike and hard-working, but very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's brief tenure at Mobil ended when he was charged with
stealing more than $300 in postage from the company. Bonner _ then
known as Beverly Lake _ continued to work for Mobil until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s she was married to William Bonner, an amiable
physician on good terms with most of the inmates he treated. He
recently recalled the marriage that ended in 1994 with some
bitterness, saying she had extramarital affairs, possibly even with
Robinson in the prison library.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped from sight in 1994, at 49.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, investigators found her body in a barrel in
a Raymore storage locker she rented years ago. The locker, now
linked to Robinson, also had two other barrels containing as yet
unidentified bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of her disappearance parallel those of other
alleged victims: women searching for direction, landing jobs that
promised travel and clinging to false hopes of fresh starts.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Clampitt, 27, a one-time drug user seeking to
rehabilitate, moved in 1987 from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Overland
Park, Kan. Her brother, Robert Bales, said her hopes were lifted
when she found work at Equi-II, a management consulting firm
created by Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promised a great job, a lot of traveling and a new
wardrobe,'' Bales said.
</P>
<P>
   She remains missing.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, Suzette Trouten moved to Lenexa, Kan.,
from Michigan after meeting Robinson on the Internet, investigators
said. She told relatives she had found a $65,000-a-year job,
complete with worldwide travel, taking care of a man's aging
father.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found in a barrel on Linn County farm property
owned by Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the women mentioned in the Robinson investigation, the
one whose disappearance is least understood may be Godfrey's, whose
family reported her missing in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's probation officer, Steve Haymes, who had become
suspicious of his activities, noted in a report: ``Robinson had
allegedly hired her to be a sales representative. Overland Park
Police Department later received a letter from this girl stating
that she was thankful for John Robinson's help and that she was
o.k.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, old friends say she was hardly the vulnerable type.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a happy girl, very outgoing. She wasn't gullible,''
said Jan Kunzle. ``I think she would have realized it if she was in
trouble. She seemed book smart; street smart, too.''
</P>
<P>
   (More)
</P>
<P>
   Izabela Lewicka also was book smart. Before she vanished last
fall at age 21, her parents back home in Indiana told neighbors of
her supposed trips to California and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was working in Johnson County for Robinson's trade
magazine venture _ Manufactured//Modular Home Living, a publication
related to the mobile home industry.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of leaving home, she applied for a marriage
license in Johnson County with a man listed on the document as
``John Anthony Robinson,'' whose birth date matched John E.
Robinson's.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, she was frequently with Robinson as the two
cobbled the magazine together. She handled the advertising and he
produced the copy, said Pamela Guthrie, a free-lance graphic artist
who designed one of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   The artist, who last week spoke with investigators, said Lewicka
referred to Robinson as her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he'd have his hands all over her,'' she said. ``Hands on
her back, across her shoulder, resting near her breast. I thought,
`That's no uncle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said her dealings with Robinson and Lewicka lasted only
a couple of months. The bill for her free-lance work _ $1,800 _
never was paid, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Lewicka's body, discovered in another barrel in Linn County, was
identified last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It happens, experts say. A woman yearning to find her direction
and purpose in life falls prey to a controlling, often violent man
_ sometimes a virtual stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a system of blind control, and it can happen
quickly,'' said Palle M. Relinger, executive director of the
Metropolitan Organization to Counter Sexual Assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who may be at a low point in life, some extra
attention and the promise of something better can be hard to
resist. Sex offenders typically are looking for that
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura L. Douglas, 34, said she first met Robinson at the Belton
mobile home park where both lived in the mid-1990s. She was a
single mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To begin with, he was very polite. Nice. Minded his manners,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after she went to work for Robinson painting a mobile home,
``he was very handsy. When he wasn't attempting to touch, he was
making references.'' She thought Robinson knew she was coming out
of an unhappy relationship, and his repeated passes prompted her to
stop working for him.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said Robinson tried to persuade her to move to Florida
with him to remodel mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to divorce his wife and the whole nine
yards,'' she said. ``His kids were down there, and it would be away
from his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memories of constant harassment echo those of other women in
the Olathe mobile home community where Robinson was living when he
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dirty old man,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's past is spotted with questions _ and some accusations
_ of sexual impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   While running a hydroponic gardening enterprise under the
Hydro-Gro name in the late 1970s, he surprised some investors in
his greenhouses near Hutchinson, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in her early 30s ``appeared like magic one day,'' an
investor who insisted on anonymity said last week. ``He told us he
(was) saving her for some friends of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, she actually lived there in one of the greenhouses!
She loved living there. She'd pick the tomatoes and care for the
plants, but I told him ... she had to leave or I'd be gone from the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time we visited, she was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, after Robinson was convicted of embezzling
from Guy's Foods Inc. in Liberty, Haymes and the FBI moved toward a
theory that ``Robinson is involved in prostitution,'' according to
Clay County court records.
</P>
<P>
   Haymes, the probation officer, also was investigating reports
that a young mother, Lisa Stasi, had disappeared from Overland Park
with her infant daughter, Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi _ described in a police report as ``unstable, lonely and
gullible'' _ had earlier met with a man claiming to represent a
charity organization. The group offered to provide her with
housing, job training and a high school equivalency degree.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi and her baby have not been found. Some authorities at the
time suspected the infant may have been sold on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of that investigation, FBI agent Tom Lavin told
Haymes that a Kansas City, Kan., woman _ not Stasi _ ``was asked by
Robinson to prostitute for him and//or run some girls who are
prostituting for him,'' according to notes Haymes compiled at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to revoke Robinson's probation, authorities called yet
another young woman to testify that he made her ``dress entirely in
black'' and to wear a blindfold for a sadomasochistic sexual
encounter she said she had with a Robinson friend. She also said he
had sexually assaulted her with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson took the stand, Clay County assistant prosecutor
Michael Murphy asked him point-blank if he was involved in ``any
kind of prostitution or escort service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Robinson said.

<P>
   Shortly after Stasi disappeared, one of the women linked to
Robinson spread a story designed to find its way to Overland Park
police. The woman said that she had recently seen Stasi and that
she was well and avoiding her family.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by federal agents and police, the woman confessed
that she made up the story at Robinson's behest because he had nude
photographs of her, court records say.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of extortion would again be leveled against Robinson
15 years later.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas-licensed psychologist who met Robinson this spring for a
sadomasochistic encounter told police that Robinson had tried to
photograph her, then threatened to expose her to Texas authorities,
after he brutalized her beyond terms of their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The woman stepped forward anyway, and police charged Robinson
with sexual battery, just weeks before investigators uncovered
bodies on his property.
</P>
<P>
   At least two women from other states apparently knew him through
his ``Slavemaster'' identity on the Internet. One lost a $17,000
investment in one of Robinson's businesses; the other told police
another episode of too-rough sex.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by Internet or a personal ad in a newspaper, Sheila Dale
Faith was also drawn to strangers offering romance and happiness.
Especially ``John.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Guerrero, Faith's neighbor in Pueblo, Colo., said Faith in
1994 described her new friend as a ``dream man.'' Faith, seeking
companionship, started using personal ads after her husband died in
1991. This new prospect, she told another acquaintance, was
``really nice. ... We're going to go to Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Faith and her teen-age daughter Debbie, who used a
wheelchair, vanished from the neighborhood. Their mail _ including
Debbie's disability checks, according to Guerrero _ was forwarded
to a post office box in Olathe.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Robinson's wife, Nancy, who married him in
1964 and stayed through arrest after arrest for his white-collar
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently lost their comfortable home with its riding
stable and lake when he was sent to prison for theft in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In a Kansas corrections evaluation of Robinson in 1990, a
psychologist referred to Robinson calling Nancy ``loving and loyal
... (she) supported him through this whole ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's former defense attorney, Bruce Houdek, recently
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy's a really nice lady,'' he said shortly after John
Robinson's arrest this month. ``She loved John and stuck by him
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, her testimony on her husband's behalf during the
probation revocation hearing was thin on personal details, but it
revealed her to be a thorough and diligent record-keeper.
</P>
<P>
   The husband she described on the stand paid close attention to
his business and was careful to make time for his children's music
and sports programs in the Blue Valley School District.
</P>
<P>
   His family echoed that sentiment recently, when the Robinsons
issued a statement expressing sympathy for the victims' families
and stressing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The John Robinson we know has always been a loving and caring
husband and father, the type of parent who has never missed a
sporting event, a school function, or missed an opportunity to be
there with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   At least once, however, their marriage teetered, as Nancy filed
for divorce in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She never followed through on the action. But according to Scott
Davis, a former neighbor in the Stanley community of Overland Park,
she spent many tearful hours discussing her marriage with Davis'
mother, who lived across the street from the Robinsons.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles resulted, Davis recalled, from an affair John
Robinson was having.
</P>
<P>
   Other friends Nancy made later while managing large mobile home
communities in Belton and Olathe think she was unaware of the
darker elements of her husband's life. ``I don't think she had a
clue,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after authorities arrested her spouse this month,
police apparently gave her information about the evidence they had
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was devastated,'' said Alberta Merritt, who helped Nancy
Robinson run the office at the Santa Barbara Estates mobile
community. ``She just didn't know what to do. ... I felt sorry for
her, and I still do. And I think she should be left alone.''

ELS HAPPY HE'S GOT `HALF A CHANCE'
</HEADLINE>

By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It looked easy for the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els, who earned his nickname
with one of the most-fluid swings in golf, negotiated wind-buffeted
Pebble Beach Golf Links in 3-under-par 68 Saturday during a third
round that sent most scores soaring.
</P>
<P>
   His secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some good saves,'' said Els, who finished with four
birdies and an eagle to move to 2 over par for the tournament and
into third place, within 10 strokes of front-running Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the best rounds I've played in major
golf, considering the weather conditions,'' Els said.
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean for the big South African, who won Open titles
in 1994 at Oakmont and '97 at Congressional?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got half a chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the field would like those odds.
</P>
<P>
   Area update: Seven players with area ties failed to make the cut
of 7-over-par 149, including 1995 U.S. Open champion Corey Pavin,
the one-time UCLA All-American who finished 150 after bogeying the
final hole of his second round.
</P>
<P>
   Former USC player Brian Henninger also missed by a stroke at
150, a stroke better than another ex-Trojan, Craig Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-UCLA players Duffy Waldorf of Valencia and Brandt Jobe also
finished 151. Agoura's Steve Pate, another former Bruin, finished
154, as did David Berganio Jr. of Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cal State Northridge player Jon Levitt wound up 157.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings: Bobby Clampett, the CBS golf commentator who
was born in nearby Monterey and got in the tournament as a
qualifier, made the cut with a 36-hole score of 145. Curtis
Strange, who won back-to-back U.S. Open titles in 1988 and 1989 and
now serves as golf commentator for ABC, missed the cut at 162.
</P>
<P>
   Golden oldie: Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus, playing in a
record 44th consecutive U.S. Open, missed the cut at 155 but not
before showing his old form to Tom Watson during the fog-delayed
first round.
</P>
<P>
   When a Nicklaus tee shot disappeared into the mist shortly
before play was suspended Thursday, Watson, waiting on the tee in
backed-up playing conditions, told the 60-year-old Golden Bear,
``You hit it out of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed emotions: David Gossett, who won the 1999 U.S. Amateur
championship at Pebble Beach shortly after completing his freshman
season at Texas, was paired with Nicklaus for the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a bittersweet experience,'' said Gossett, who
finished 13-over-par 155 and failed to make the cut. But he
tremendously enjoyed being in the same group with the greatest
golfer in the history of the game - a man he called ``Mr.
Nicklaus'' for two days until he Golden Bear convinced him to
``call me Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To see him getting those standing ovations was really
something special,'' Gossett said. ``He's a great man. He does it
with class and he's a fine competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   What lessons did Gossett learn?
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience and he's extremely competitive. I just learned that
he plays really smart golf, and he's really systematic the way he
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's why: Qualifier Jeff Coston, the golf academy operator
who faded to 77 after a brief stay on the leaderboard with a
first-round 70: ``I tried too hard, took too long and thought too
much. Maybe I needed a lobotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: Loren Roberts on his fog-suspended first-round score
of 68, accomplished Thursday and Friday, which enabled him to make
the cut despite shooting 78 in the second round: ``Sure I'm happy
with it, especially since it took 24 hours to play it.''

ASHCROFT AND CARNAHAN MAKE THE MOST OF `SOFT MONEY' CONTRIBUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Gov. Mel
Carnahan scout for contributions in their U.S. Senate race, they're
hitting their biggest pay dirt with companies and individuals
giving unregulated ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has helped raise about $500,000 in such donations since
the start of last year, including two $50,000 corporate
contributions. Carnahan has helped raised $262,000, including
$50,000 from an individual and two $25,000 corporate donations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money cannot be used by candidates themselves. Instead, it
is transferred to committees set up by their political parties and
used for advertising and party-building to benefit candidates
nationwide. There are no donation limits, which has drawn
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft set up the Ashcroft Victory Committee, which works with
the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Carnahan set up
Missouri 2000 with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Senate and House candidates have set up such committees
to raise soft money, as have national party committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission says that in the 15 months that
ended March 30, $85 million has been raised for Republican
committees and $77 million for Democratic committees. That is
nearly double amounts for the same period two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing both sides raising records amounts of money,''
said Jeff Cronin, spokesman for Common Cause, which wants soft
money banned. ``They are giving to both sides in the same race.
This is not about ideology. It's about access and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan would stop taking soft money if Ashcroft would do the
same, said Carnahan campaign manager Marc Farinella. That doesn't
surprise Ashcroft supporters, given how much more money he is
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe campaign contributions are free speech and that the
First Amendment protects people's rights to participate in the
political process,'' said Jonathan Grella, spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the soft money, Carnahan's Missouri 2000 has raised
$613,000 in ``hard money'' for Carnahan's Senate campaign and for
the Democratic senatorial committee. It is called hard money
because there are limits on donations. The Ashcroft Victory
Committee has raised $1.3 million in hard money.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's Grella said Carnahan has not been very effective in
raising money for his Missouri 2000 Committee, given that he is a
sitting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a race that has two incumbents, in essence,'' Grella
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnahan supporters said an incumbent senator has a natural
advantage over any challenger because of the influence a senator
holds and his connections in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A ``vulnerable Republican'' such as Ashcroft could be expected
to be even more pressed to raise money from special interests, said
Jim Jordan of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said his committee realizes that soft money is a
sensitive public issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only position this committee has on soft money is that
it's, sadly enough, a necessary evil in politics,'' Jordan said.
``We play the cards as we are dealt them.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carnahan's soft-money committee trails Ashcroft's in
raising money, Carnahan's own committee for his Senate race is
keeping pace of late.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months that ended March 31, Carnahan was slightly
ahead with $2.9 million. But dating back to the beginning of the
campaign two years ago, Ashcroft has raised $5.9 million, about $1
million more than Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of soft money, the biggest corporate contributions to
the Ashcroft Victory Committee, at $50,000, came from St.
Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Companies and from the drugmaker
Schering Corp., also known as Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strive for balance,'' Anheuser-Busch spokesman Jim Schwartz
said. ``Over the long term, we try to support candidates on both
sides.'' The company gave $25,000 to Carnahan's Missouri 2000 in
December and may give more, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Schering spokesman William O'Donnell said its $50,000 donation
to the Ashcroft Victory Committee was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft has emerged as one of the important new
leaders in the U.S. Senate,'' O'Donnell said. ``He is widely
recognized as an advocate for the advancement of technology and the
protection of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan campaign spokesman Tony Wyche questioned whether the
Schering donation resulted from Ashcroft's co-sponsorship of a bill
the company wanted last summer that could protect drug patents,
such as the Schering drug Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does nothing specifically for Schering-Plough,''
Ashcroft campaign spokesman David James said. ``It has to do with a
lot of companies. John Ashcroft supports the protection of
lifesaving research, which this bill provides.''
</P>
<P>
   The main sponsor of the bill was Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New
Jersey Democrat and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. Schering also gave $50,000 to that committee.
</P>
<P>
   The largest soft-money contributor to Carnahan was education
consultant Peter Buttenwieser of Philadelphia, who also gave
$50,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and has
backed other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect (Carnahan) very much and I feel his winning is
important for Missouri and the country,'' Buttenwieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri 2000 got its second largest soft-money contribution,
$25,000, from the Mills Corp. of Arlington, Va., a real estate
trust company that helps develop and manage shopping centers in
Missouri and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rivers, executive vice president of Mills, said that the
company gave to Missouri 2000 because it was asked to and that it
developed a relationship with Carnahan while providing jobs under a
welfare-to-work program in the state two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest corporate soft-money donor from Kansas City was CNS
Corp., the holding company for Ozark National Life Insurance. It
gave $25,000 to the Ashcroft Victory Committee. In addition, Ozark
Chief Executive Officer S.A. Weber of Olathe gave $14,000 in hard
money to the Ashcroft Victory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, we supported (former) Governor Ashcroft for many
years,'' Weber said. ``He is a good man, and we'd like to keep him
in the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin of Common Cause said laws allowing soft money give large
corporations and rich people too much influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes political parties less reliant on the grass roots,
where they traditionally went for their support,'' Cronin said.
``It's made them more reliant on wealthy special interests.''

NBA OFFICIALS NOT CHARITABLE TO KOBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles is the sort of place where you can
share a common wall with someone for years and never see the
person, much less strike up a single conversation. So we were a
little suspicious when we heard that Kobe Bryant and Reggie Miller
kept running into each other at a gym over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind there are a hundred places to work out in the
narcissistic city. Miller is so sneaky, we're not surprised he got
Bryant to divulge some of his trade secrets. In their summer
one-on-one sessions, Indiana's star guard prevailed upon Bryant to
show him a couple of flashy ball-handling moves guaranteed to help
him create off the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   We're guessing the former UCLA standout worked Bryant the same
way he does game officials, leaning on him until he plain wore him
down.
</P>
<P>
   What the 34-year-old Miller did for Bryant in return is not real
clear. He certainly didn't divulge any of his secrets for drawing
fouls like a magnet does nails.
</P>
<P>
   For all his lip-flapping and flopping in the NBA Finals, Miller
deserves an Emmy nomination for Best Actor in a drama series.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games of the ongoing best-of-seven championship
series (Game 6 is Monday at Staples Center), Miller wended and
whined his way to the free-throw line more times than anybody save
for Shaquille O'Neal. While in the act of shooting, he finagled
eight fouls out of seven Los Angeles Lakers - he victimized Derek
Fisher twice - and converted 15 of 16 free throws. He also made
three free throws off technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, meanwhile, didn't try a single free throw in Games 4 or
5. Incredibly, inexplicably, he has been sent to the line only once
in the series, in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the sore left ankle that sidelined Bryant for most of
Game 2 and all of Game 3 has limited his aggressiveness in the past
two games. But drawing zero fouls in 84 minutes while putting up 47
shots? That's every bit as astonishing as was his acrobatic putback
of Brian Shaw's miss for the winning basket in overtime of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, it was hard to believe what you were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, 21, might have launched a thousand comparisons to
Michael Jordan with his eight-point performance in the five-minute
overtime period in Game 4. But it would appear the league's finest
officials are less generous than the media when it comes to
granting him superstar status (and the auspicious calls that go
along with it).
</P>
<P>
   All we know is that during the regular season, the slash-happy
Bryant averaged 6.1 free throws a game, which was fewer than Vince
Carter (6.7) or Grant Hill (8.2), the latter of whom Bryant could
end up replacing on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's Game 5 blowout loss, Miller appeared to graze
Bryant's arm as the fourth-year guard was putting up one of his six
errant shots of the first half. From our seat behind the basket,
you could hear the thwack.
</P>
<P>
   The next sound we heard wasn't an official's whistle, but
Bryant's plaintive ``Hey!'' in response to nothing being called.
Bryant would go on to pick up his second and third fouls in the
span of 12 seconds late in the second quarter. He would finish the
game with five.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two games, Bryant has been whistled for nine fouls
to Miller's two. If that doesn't make you go hmmmm, then you're
obviously a Hoosier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's frustrating for him,'' Shaw said of Bryant,
``because he'll be close to somebody on their team, breathe on them
and they call the foul on him. And then he won't get the same call
on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   What more does Bryant have to do to earn his due? He was named
to the league's first-team defensive unit this season. He has
worked hard to become a fundamentally solid defender, to dull down
some of his flashy offensive game, to prove he isn't a
one-dimensional wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It has to freeze him - either that or fry him - just a little to
be under the hottest spotlight of his young career and be picking
up fouls like lint and getting precious little chance to prop up
the Lakers' foul free-throw shooting (Bryant converted 82 percent
of his attempts from the line during the regular season).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bryant should look at his not receiving much charity as a
back- handed compliment. Just as O'Neal is so much taller and wider
and stronger than everybody he is made to suffer more non-calls on
the offensive end, so, perhaps, is Bryant's talent viewed as so
ridiculously large as to put opponents at a decided disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is that in trying to even the playing
field the officials are making a mockery of it.

(Clarifying lede.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Saturday in story refers to June 24.) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six years of perilous effort by thousands of
workers have come down to this: The $1.3 billion last leg of the
Red Line subway finally is about to open, offering suburban San
Fernando Valley residents an easy, congestion-free way downtown.
</P>
<P>
   But finishing Los Angeles' subway system has come at a great
cost: $4.5 billion, budget overruns, a street cave-in, business
disruptions, and political wrangling and scandal that rocked the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the MTA throws open the doors to its new Red Line
subway extension to North Hollywood, hoping the prospect of zipping
under the Santa Monica Mountains at 70 mph will attract enough
riders to make the massive investment worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, the subway either is a waste of
sorely needed transportation money, or it transcends the geographic
divide that has split Los Angeles in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way for the huge population in the Valley to come
through into the (Los Angeles) basin, and it is equally important
that people in the basin can get to the Valley on one line without
having to figure out how to get over or around that mountain,''
said MTA General Manager Julian Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really breaks into an entirely different set of people,
simply because it is on the other side of the mountains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Red Line extension consists of stations at North
Hollywood, Universal City and Hollywood Boulevard/Highland Avenue.
It follows the Hollywood Freeway through the Santa Monica
Mountains, diving as deep as 900 feet at some points.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership on the entire MTA subway system is now about 145,000
boardings a day. With the new extension, plus new, faster bus lines
in the Valley that link to the stations, ridership is expected to
climb to 200,000 daily boardings by next year.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if MTA estimates are right.
</P>
<P>
   Valley residents who have previewed the new stations at North
Hollywood, Universal City and Hollywood/Highland say they are
impressed and expect many of their neighbors to start using public
transit.
</P>
<P>
   But ask them if they plan to use it themselves and they hedge.
</P>
<P>
   It depends, they say, on where they need to go and whether the
subway cars remain clean and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mort Allen, a Studio City Realtor who sat in traffic on the
Hollywood Freeway for more than an hour returning from a recent
trip to City Hall, said he might consider taking the subway. But
he's worried about safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the New York subway in the movies and I see the
crime on it,'' Allen said. ``If nice people are riding on it, I'm
going to ride on it.''
</P>
<P>
   MTA officials say they have a host of safety features and have
managed to keep crime low on the existing lines. Among their
efforts are regular patrols by transit officers, security cameras
and stations with open-air designs that keep everything in public
view.
</P>
<P>
   The three stations were built on time and under budget for $1.3
billion, unlike the rest of the Red Line, which went over budget by
about 12 percent. Overall, the Red Line subway cost $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood segment of the line, in particular, was beset by
problems. In 1995, a 70-foot sinkhole opened up on Hollywood
Boulevard during construction. A short time later, the MTA fired
the contractor, who promptly responded with a lawsuit. Several
workers died and many more were injured during construction.
Federal occupational safety officials issued multiple fines to
contractors involved in Red Line construction.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood segment had its own problems. Congress,
losing confidence in the MTA, had considered withholding money for
the line. At one point, Congress held up funding until the MTA put
together a plan that reduced rail projects in other parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate subcommittee cited the subway's history of cost
overruns, redesigns, corruption, mismanagement, accidents and
political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants along Lankershim Boulevard complained that they lost
millions in dollars in lost business, while the street itself
suffered more than $1 million worth of damage during the
subterranean work.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stark, the MTA's top construction official, said the
agency kept costs under control in this last segment by learning
from past mistakes, keeping a tight rein on the contractors and by
removing certain nonessential elements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a massive ventilation shaft in the middle of the
Santa Monica Mountains was not built. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will not be needed until the system is running at a higher
capacity several decades from now, Stark said, so room was left for
it to be added in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous achievement of any agency and especially the
MTA, given the fact that our history hasn't been that good,'' Stark
said. ``For us to have brought in a project, which had very
difficult tunneling conditions both in North Hollywood and under
the Santa Monica Mountains, without any of the incidents that we
had suffered in the past and still bring the project in under
budget, makes us tremendously proud.''

WHITE SOX BEAT YANKEES, 10-9 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day was headed for certain disaster. The Yankees
were self-destructing in torturous fashion against the best team in
the American League. They trailed the Chicago White Sox, 8-0, the
air was as stagnant as their bats, and it was only the bottom of
the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after a 57-minute rain delay that day turned
into night, and the Yankees, led by Bernie Williams, mitigated
disaster and found a silver lining in a bizarre marathon game with
emotions running from personal horror to team consolation.
</P>
<P>
   The early meltdowns of the rookie starter Jake Westbrook and
reliever Jason Grimsley, the miscue of shortstop Derek Jeter and
the continuing horror of Chuck Knoblauch were nearly rendered
irrelevant amid a dramatic late-inning comeback, thanks mostly to
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But while Williams cranked out a season-high seven runs batted
in, his effort and his teammates' redoubled effort after the rain
delay were not enough to keep the Yankees from losing to Chicago,
10-9. It was their third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had been just 5 for 20 on the six-game homestand,
came alive Saturday. After his walk in the first inning, he went 4
for 4.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a double for two runs in the third inning, another double
that scored three in the sixth inning, and then, with the Yankees
trailing by 10-7 with two outs in the eighth inning, blasted a
two-run home run, bringing the Yankees within one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a great day and not win the game doesn't mean that
much,'' Williams said. ``We keep fighting. We just keep coming up
short.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was hope and exultation in the dugout once again
late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel we can never stop bleeding, and that was the bad
part,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``I'm pleased with the way we're
able to come back against people.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook, a 22-year-old right-hander touted within the Yankees
organization for being poised and promising, took his place in the
steamy fishbowl for his first major league start.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first trip to Yankee Stadium, and no sooner did he
take the mound than he started to melt. First, waterfalls of sweat
fell from under his new cap. Then the hits poured from the White
Sox bats.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook's initiation was a terrible unraveling in one and
two-thirds innings that took nearly an hour. He gave up six runs
and seven hits, fulfilling none of the expectations the Yankees had
for him as the temporary replacement for the injured Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Torre just wanted Westbrook to get the Yankees to the middle of
the game. Instead, Torre had to empty the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After Westbrook burned a fastball born of pure adrenaline past
Ray Durham on his first pitch, he struggled with his control. He
got out of a jam in the first inning, allowing just one run on two
hits and a walk, but he had thrown 20 pitches already.
</P>
<P>
   The next inning finished him off. He gave up a leadoff double to
Carlos Lee, Greg Norton hit a sacrifice fly to center field, and
Shane Spencer, playing for Paul O'Neill in right field, trapped a
short fly by Brook Fordyce. Durham followed with a shot up the
middle past Westbrook. Frank Thomas singled and then Magglio
Ordonez belted a fastball for a three-run home run to left-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook finished his debut with a walk to Paul Konerko, and
Jason Grimsley came on to relieve him. The inning could have been
over when Chris Singleton hit a soft liner to Jeter, but he bobbled
it for an error before Lee struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley's troubles began in the third when he gave up a leadoff
single to Norton and followed with a walk to Fordyce. A single and
two sacrifice flies later, the Yankees trailed, 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth inning, they trailed by 9-3, which was when things
got strange again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Knoblauch returned to the lineup after his ignominious
three-error game on Thursday, he had no ground ball chances Friday
night. On his first chance Saturday, he showed that nothing had
changed, that the demons had only been sleeping. He collected a
grounder by Norton, cocked his arm and sent the ball fluttering
into the seats along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had been crucial in the Yankees' third-inning rally,
hitting a single off an 0-2 pitch from Cal Eldred and coming around
to score on Williams' double.
</P>
<P>
   But the defensive woes would not go away. He admitted Friday
night that his problem _ mental, not physical _ was not solved by
just returning to the ballpark. Saturday, though, he was also
affected physically, playing with his left ankle taped after
injuring it on a slide Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After the rain delay, Knoblauch was better, like his teammates.
He turned an easy ground ball into an out in the seventh, which
seemed to settle him down.
</P>
<P>
   And after the delay, Eldred returned and got out of the fifth,
allowing just a single to Williams. Eldred started promisingly in
the sixth as well, with two quick outs. But Knoblauch drew a walk,
Jeter followed with a single and O'Neill walked to load the bases.
In came Kelly Wunsch, a sidearming left-hander, and Williams
promptly doubled to the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's second baseman, Durham, threw the relay wide to the
catcher Fordyce, allowing O'Neill to score. Tino Martinez cracked a
single to short center off Wunsch, to bring the Yankees within
10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' home run made it 10-9, but the comeback ended there. &QL;

PACERS ARE BRAND X, NOT BRAND NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Indiana crowd never did get the hang of ``Beat
L.A.!''
</P>
<P>
   In other places, the chant is delivered in the same insistent
left-right-left cadence as ``U-S-A!'' or ``We're Number 1!'' But
with the Conseco Fieldhouse public-address announcer setting a bad
example - yes, in Indiana, the PA guy is an unabashed cheerleader -
it came out in syncopated rhythm as ``Beat ... Uh-Laaay! Beat ...
Uh-Laaay! Beat ... Uh- Laaay!''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Indiana Pacers fans never had much practice over the
years, Games 3, 4 and 5 of these NBA Finals marking the first time
they ever considered the possibility of their team beating the
Lakers with a trophy at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever - it's not how they say it, it's the thought that
counts, and in a low-glamour NBA city like Indianapolis, the plea
is heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   Why do they hate us? We're friendly folk here in Los Angeles, as
long as you don't expect us to actually say good morning when
passing on the sidewalk. We respect the right of way of the
pedestrian as long as he gets a move-on. We work hard while
awaiting our cinematic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity is easier to understand if you look at it from the
point of view of frustrated Indianans.
</P>
<P>
   Since franchise player Reggie Miller's rookie season in 1987-88,
the Pacers have qualified for the playoffs 10 times and advanced to
the Eastern Conference finals five times, yet had to wait until now
to play for the NBA championship. In the same stretch, the Lakers
have been able to win the 1988 title at the climax of one dynasty,
wave goodbye to all of those stars and endure back-to-back sub-.500
seasons in 1992-93 and 1993-94, then rebuild quickly enough with
fresh stars to stand today one victory away from a new title and a
view to a new dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Before these Lakers of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil
Jackson, the only teams to pull off such quick nosedives and
recoveries had been the Lakers of Magic Johnson and the Boston
Celtics of Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Such things seem to happen for the glamour franchises, not for
the Pacers and, say, the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the result of an NBA conspiracy. It is the result of a
force that will be no easier for franchises like the Pacers to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start with a little bit of an advantage because it's Los
Angeles, because it's the Lakers, because of their history,'' David
Kahn, the Pacers' general manager, said Friday before Indiana's
120-87 victory cut the Lakers' series lead to 3-2 and sent
everybody back west for Game 6 Monday night. ``I think the Lakers'
brand name still means something, much like the Bulls' still does,
and the Celtics'.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``advantage'' pertains to the ability of those teams to
attract players who have the freedom to choose their homes. Kahn
wasn't complaining, merely stating a fact and praising Lakers
executive vice president Jerry West and general manager Mitch
Kupchak for taking advantage of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, being in Los Angeles has not been much help to the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (West and Kupchak) deserve an immense amount of credit
for two things. One is that when they had that moment when they got
under the cap, they managed to attract the guy who obviously will
be !ital!the!off! star player in our league for the next six or
seven years,'' Kahn said of the 1996 free-agent signing of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, several teams passed on Kobe Bryant,'' Kahn
said, referring to Bryant lasting until the 13th pick in the 1996
draft. ``That was their mistake. But it was certainly Jerry West's
wise decision-making in making that pick.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from Indiana is tinged with envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Lakers) look a little bit to me like what Chicago
was in the decade of the '90s,'' said Kahn, the guiding force
behind the construction of Conseco Fieldhouse, the delightfully
retro arena that will become the Pacers' best built-in recruiting
tool. ``With those two huge cornerstones in place, they're just
adding in those other components.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say that's not hard to do. But when you have
those two monsters there, I think it's easier than trying to build
a whole team. You're basically just sprinkling in specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, signed in October, might be the sprinkle that put
the Lakers over the top this season. Rick Fox, signed in 1997, is a
subtler example of the L.A. advantage. Fox passed up larger offers
from other teams to sign one-year contracts in 1997 and 1998 and a
relatively modest six-year, $24-million contract last summer. The
attraction: Fox knew playing with O'Neal gave him a shot at a title
and - though he says Hollywood wasn't a major factor - he's an
aspiring actor as well as husband of singer-actress Vanessa
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else to play?'' Kahn said. ``They (the Lakers) took
advantage of it, though. They should be commended; seeing that
situation, they used it to their best advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The golden history, the media exposure, the proximity to
Hollywood - wouldn't you be jealous of the Lakers if you didn't
live here? The ability of West and Kupchak to turn that glamour
into baskets - wouldn't you hate the way they keep finding ways?
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure did make themselves championship caliber (again) in
a pretty short period of time,'' Kahn said. ``They've done an
incredible job. And not just for the present, but if you look
(ahead) six or seven years, they'll be awfully hard to beat year in
and year out. They are poised to be, unfortunately for the rest of
us, the team of the next decade. The rest of us will have to be
scrambling to figure out ways to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   However it's said, ``Beat L.A.!'' could be everybody's goal for
years to come.

WOODS CONTINUES TO FASHION A MASTERPIECE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ In command of his game and in command of
the U.S. Open, Tiger Woods appeared headed toward another
remarkable masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday afternoon, most players were so far behind
Woods, they needed a telescope to see him. Nobody in the 100-year
history of the Open had led by six strokes after 36 holes. Nobody,
that is, until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in recent years had dominated the Open this way, leading
the Open by 10 strokes through three rounds. Nobody, that is, until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the field behind, and leaving many of his peers in awe,
Woods seemed destined to win his third major championship on Sunday
at the age of 24. Continuing an incredible three-day performance at
Pebble Beach, Woods finished the day eight under par for the
tournament (65-69-71), holding his enormous 10-stroke lead over
Ernie Els, who was two over par through three rounds (215,
74-73-68). Miguel Angel Jimenez (66-74-76) of Spain and Padraig
Harrington (73-71-72) of Ireland were tied for third place at three
over par.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Woods had another dominating performance at a major,
winning the Masters by a record-setting 12 strokes. This
performance was also one for the record books. Woods held the
largest 54-hole lead in Open history, shattering the previous mark
by Jim Barnes, who led the 1921 Open by seven strokes through three
rounds. Woods has a chance to win the Open by the largest margin in
history. The record is 11 strokes by Willie Smith in 1899, a mark
that seemed very safe until Woods began making the extraordinary
look routine on Thursday. Woods also tied the record for the
largest 54-hole lead in any major, set by Henry Cotton at the 1934
British championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Woods was the only player still under par,
because his play was in a class by itself. Woods led by six strokes
after finishing his second round Saturday, the biggest 36-hole lead
in Open history, surpassing the five-stroke leads of Willie
Anderson in 1903 and Mike Souchak in 1960. And Woods' 134
second-round total tied the lowest 36-hole score in Open history,
equaled by three others _ Jack Nicklaus in 1980, Tze-Chung Chen in
1985 and Lee Janzen in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon Woods continued to overwhelm the field with
extraordinary shot-making and putting. Would anyone catch Woods on
Sunday? Not likely, as long as he remembered his way to the first
tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play hard and do the same things I've been doing,
which is hit the fairways,'' Woods said after he finished his
second round Saturday morning. ``If I have a good situation, I'll
go ahead and attack. If not, I'll dump it on the side of the green
and make my par.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played true to his word, and after already winning the
Masters (1997) and the PGA Championship (1999), he looked almost
certain to add a U.S. Open to his collection. Nothing bothered his
machine-like efficiency. Not a demanding golf course that showed
little mercy Saturday. Not a triple-bogey on No.3 Saturday
afternoon that might have shaken lesser players.
</P>
<P>
   One concerning moment occurred when he bogeyed the 10th hole and
shook his wrist after hitting a recovery shot out of deep grass.
But Woods continued, appearing unhampered.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he made mistakes, Woods quickly made amends. He made a
triple-bogey at the par-4 No.3 when his second shot landed in thick
rough near a green-side bunker. His first attempt out of the rough
barely moved two feet. His next attempt floated toward the green,
but fell short, still in the rough. He finally reached the green on
his next chip, but the ball stopped 15 feet short of the hole.
Woods two-putted for a 7, dropping him to six under par, while
Jimenez was at one under par.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as anyone came to Woods. His birdie at the
par-5 No.6 was set up by a remarkable third shot. His ball was
buried in a terrible lie in deep rough near a bunker, forcing Woods
to put his left foot into the bunker and his right foot on the
grass, with the ball well above his feet. Somehow, Woods floated a
soft 70-foot shot toward the green, and as the ball came to rest 6
feet past the hole, the echoes of the gallery exploded against the
Pacific Ocean. Woods sank the ensuing putt for birdie, then birdied
the par-3 No.7, hitting his tee shot to 8 feet and making still
another putt.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Woods had an eight-stroke lead again. Meanwhile,
the rest of the field was feeling the impact of rock-hard greens
and tricky winds that sent everyone except Woods tumbling over par.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went a long way toward cementing his position Saturday
morning, when he completed his second round with a six-stroke lead.
Teeing off at 6:30 a.m, Woods started on the 13th hole and made it
through the final six holes of his second round without any
disastrous holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' lone morning mistake came at the par-5 finishing hole,
when he pulled his tee shot into the rocks bordering the ocean.
Seconds after the ball left his club, Woods yelled a series of
expletives, knowing his ball was headed toward oblivion. But after
a penalty stroke, Woods put his next drive on the right side of the
fairway, then reached the green with his next shot and two-putted
for a bogey-6, avoiding what could have been a double-bogey or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mistimed it and hit it left,'' Woods said of his errant tee
shot. ``Just a really poor shot. But I stepped up there, collected
my thoughts, and ripped the second one like intended the first one
to be. I walked away without doing any kind of big damage to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the field, the damage had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the other prominent players who hoped to challenge
Woods? Lee Westwood was five over par, Hal Sutton had a third-round
83 and fell to 12 over, Phil Mickelson was four over, David Duval
was seven over, and Colin Montgomerie shot a 79 to fall to 13 over.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's symbolism was hard to ignore. As Jack Nicklaus walked
up the 18th fairway on Friday, saying farewell to the U.S. Open,
Woods was on the putting green, preparing for another superb day.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the torch being passed, from one dominant player to
another. Through three rounds, the gap between Woods and the rest
of the field was large, just like the gap between Woods and
everyone else in golf.

LOOK OF A CHAMPION? LAKERS AREN'T THERE YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Jackson sits on a familiar platform, before a
familiar audience, at a very familiar event, elaborating on
well-worn topic: The outstanding achievements of his team. But
suddenly the discussion is anything but familiar.
</P>
<P>
   A championship-caliber team, losing its focus? Again? Failing to
close out a series? Again? Getting routed? Again?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls never did this, did they?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson certainly lived through a few setbacks while guiding the
Bulls and Michael Jordan to six NBA championships, but never did
they push the limits of his understanding as the Los Angeles Lakers
have in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's 33-point loss to the Indiana Pacers ranked as the worst
this season for the Lakers - and it came in Game 5 of the Finals.
Of course,it will mean nothing if the Lakers win Monday, or even
Wednesday, to claim the championship. But the fact remains: they
are muddying up their own fantastic season with these frequent
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think of a team that has championship quality
in it that loses by 33 points,'' Jackson said. ``We have to prove
something to ourselves ... in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they have something to prove to historians as well. Their
67-win season instantly pushed the Lakers into elite company, the
third-best season in NBA history. Their 19-game winning streak also
ranked third all-time, and they were the third team ever to post
three double-digit winning streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they follow all that with a championship, the Lakers
have lost the look of a dominant team. Consider how they stack up
against nine other teams that won 65 or more games and the
championship:
</P>
<P>
   ---The Lakers are 3-6 in elimination games (0-5 on the road). No
other 65-win team lost more than two closeout games, and the
previous worst elimination-game record was 3-2, by the 1967
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   ---The Lakers are 14-8 in the playoffs, the worst record among
the 65-win teams (the previous worst was the 1992 Bulls, at 15-7).
</P>
<P>
   ---The Lakers are the only the second 65-win team not to sweep a
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ---Among the 65-win teams, the Lakers are the only one that
needed seven games to win the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ---And the Lakers are more likely than any prior 65-win team to
get blown out in a playoff game. They are 8-5 in games decided by
10 or more points; no other 65-win team lost more than three games
by double digits.
</P>
<P>
   And as Jackson noted, champions aren't supposed to lose by 33
points in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid an egg,'' Ron Harper said. ``We've laid the egg
before. This is nothing new to us. This is our third egg in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, the Lakers always rebound quickly, which is
how they've survived to this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn,'' Glen Rice said. ``When you get your butts kicked,
you learn. You really go out and you try and stay focused on what
happened in that game. And you try and stop that for the next game.
And we've been doing a pretty good job of bouncing back.''
</P>
<P>
   So after losing by 13 points to Sacramento, the Lakers routed
the Kings by 27 points in Game 5 to close out the first round. And
after losing by 19 points to Phoenix, the Lakers held the Suns to
65 points in Game 5 to finish the second round. A 29-point loss to
Portland was followed by two victories on the Trail Blazers' home
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that we're not capable of winning these
games,'' Rick Fox said. ``It's that we abandon, almost, the
persistence in execution that we have to have to work our way back.
We did it in Game 3 and 4 in the Portland series after being down.
But as you saw again (Friday), being down 15, 16, 17 points, we
took a lot of jumpshots, we tried to get it all back with the
15-point shot, which doesn't exist in the game of basketball. And
when you're looking to get it back as quickly as we did,and not
work, you continue to dig yourself a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would like to think that at least some of the trend
has to do with tough opponents playing well on their home court.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Pacers) were up against the wall,'' Fox said, ``and
they've been a good team, especially on their home floor. You have
to think that they play at least one half of great basketball,
which they did. We played one half of terrible basketball, which
there's no excuse for. Yet it's not the first time we've seen this.
And we'd like to right this sometime this year before we look back
at this championship run and have it not amount to aesthetically
pleasing.''

   &QL; 
KOREA _ Last week, leaders of the two Koreas stunned the world by
signing an agreement to work toward reunifying their divided
homeland, stirring a range of emotions among Korean veterans and
families. It would mean, in a sense, victory _ a word seldom used
in connection with the war, said Ted Barker, a spokesman for the
Korean War Project. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BARRETT _ Paradise Valley resident Craig Barrett, Intel's president
and chief executive officer, is one of the most powerful business
leaders in the world. But because of his low-profile personality,
he can walk Valley streets and hike local peaks in almost complete
anonymity. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXICO-ELECT _ Public opinion polls leading up to the July 2
presidential election show a strong majority of Mexican voters are
disenchanted with the ruling PRI, or Institutional Revolutionary
Party. Many Mexicans, however find themselves torn between anger at
PRI's 71-year stewardship and anxiety about what the future would
be like without it. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXICO-ECONOMY-ELECT _ Should either challenger Vicente Fox,
candidate of the right-leaning National Action Party, or Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, candidate of the left-leaning Democratic Revolution
Party, win the Mexican presidency, neither is likely to shift much
from the government's policies of encouraging private investment in
state enterprises and supporting free trade. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Undated)
</P>
<P>
   By EJ MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TV-GOODY (Undated) - Every niche cable network needs an offbeat
hit. And with Iron Chef, the Food Network definitely has one. By
BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``E'' category. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ANGLOMANIA: A European Love Affair &LR;  By Ian Buruma. Vintage,
$14. The author, whose Jewish great-grandparents left Bismarck's
Germany to settle in England, examines an idea that has taken many
forms in the European imagination over the centuries: the idea of
Britain. ``His own and his family's story is artfully woven''
through the book, ``making this both a memoir and a work of
intellectual history,'' Alexander Stille wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLLECTED POEMS: 1920-1954 &LR;  By Eugenio Montale. Translated by
Jonathan Galassi. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $18. This bilingual
version of the three major books of one of Italy's greatest poets
(1896-1981) is filled with verse ``of an unignorable kind'' and
features ``Galassi's superb translation ... and commentary,''
Nicholas Jenkins wrote last year. Montale was ``an unequaled
chronicler of the seedy but meaningful edges of modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; REPAIR &LR; , by C.K. Williams
($12), a Pulitzer Prize-winning collection by an American poet
known for his ``exact, bewildering, slant rendering of raw emotion
and careful thought,'' as one critic put it in 1999. ``Williams
spares neither himself nor the reader anything. This is his
singular genius and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEANOR ROOSEVELT. The Defining Years: Volume 2, 1933-1938 &LR;  By
Blanche Wiesen Cook. Penguin, $17.95. In her continuing account of
the iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners first lady, the author
``continues her diligent pentimento, getting at the tender,
sprightly creature behind the starchy, strident image, chronicling
how the timid housewife ... shed her chrysalis and turned into the
New Deal's relentless `Eleanor Everywhere,''' Maureen Dowd wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HANNIBAL &LR;  By Thomas Harris. Dell, $7.99. The third part of the
author's horror trilogy about the far reaches of abnormal
psychiatry involves a rematch between the intrepid FBI agent
Clarice Starling and her nemesis, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, aka Hannibal
the Cannibal. Last year the reviewer Stephen King called this ``one
of the two most frightening popular novels of our time, the other
being `The Exorcist.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE &LR;  By Diane Smith. Penguin, $12.95. In
1898, a young medical student and avid botanist becomes the sole
woman on a Smithsonian-backed expedition to Yellowstone National
Park. Last year one critic called this ``a thoroughly enjoyable,
intriguingly offbeat epistolary novel'' with ``a host of memorable
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ART OF THE MOVING PICTURE &LR;  By Vachel Lindsay. Modern
Library, $14.95. In one of the earliest books of serious film
criticism, the poet champions the silent films of D.W. Griffith and
others. ``He is eloquent in his repudiation of whatever slur there
be in the term `canned drama,''' The New York Times Book Review
said in 1916. Lindsay ``has a vision of the nation remade by this
new art form which cuts deeper than the newspaper or the public
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library, as part of a series on the movies, has also
reissued  &UR; AGEE ON FILM: Criticism and Comment on the Movies &LR; , by
James Agee ($14.95), a collection of reviews that originally
appeared in Time magazine and The Nation in the 1940s, and several
other essays, including ones on John Huston and silent comedy
written for Life magazine. ``Each of his reviews brings the movie
before you, alive and whole,'' Richard Griffith wrote here in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MEMO FROM DAVID O. SELZNICK &LR; , selected and edited by Rudy
Behlmer ($15.95), the legendary producer of ``Gone With the Wind''
and ``Rebecca'' is given flesh though his voluminous
correspondence, primarily his private letters, telegrams and
memorandums. ``Selznick was at once a brilliant man and an
unmitigated interfering nuisance,'' Charles Higham wrote in 1972,
and his memos ``make harrowing reading.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PREEMPTING THE HOLOCAUST &LR;  By Lawrence L. Langer. Yale
University, $12.95. In these essays, a scholar argues that the
Holocaust was an act of pure evil ``beyond guilt and atonement,''
with no redeeming lessons and without heroes or martyrs, only
victims. ``Always thoughtful and provocative, he writes about
complex moral issues in a lucid and forceful style,'' Lore
Dickstein wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE BREAD OR I'LL APPEAR &LR;  By Emer Martin. Anchor, $12. In this
novel about an Irish family struggling to stay connected, a young
woman journeys to Japan and Central America in search of her older
sister, who fled home 14 years earlier. Her ``odyssey movingly
reveals the harm of clinging to the past, even in the name of
family,'' Megan Harlan wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE METAPHYSICAL TOUCH &LR;  By Sylvia Brownrigg. Picador USA, $15.
This first novel uses a weird online romance between a lonely
graduate student in philosophy and a suicidal, possibly
nonexistent, author to explore the nature of being and the
intersection of the physical and metaphysical worlds. The result is
``a serious and intelligently wrought piece of fiction,'' Geoff
Nicholson said in 1999.
