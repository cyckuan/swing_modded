<HEADLINE> Compaq Stock Slides 23 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Shares of Compaq Computer Corp. tumbled 23  
percent in early trading today following the company's stunning 
disclosure late Friday that first quarter earnings would fall far 
short of Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Compaq, the world's largest personal computer  
maker, said it anticipates reporting a profit of 15 cents a share 
on revenue of $9.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call had been predicting a profit of 31 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which will disclose first quarter profits April 21,  
blamed industry price-cutting and weaker sales for its financial 
malaise. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares were down $7.18 3/4 to $23.75 in the first 30 minutes  
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit warning came in advance of the quarterly crush of  
earnings reports from U.S. companies that starts this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement stunned many analysts who thought the  
company's profits were on track, and might be boosted by the 
integration of Digital Equipment, which Compaq bought last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq officials said sales were $600 million  
lower-than-expected in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Sci-Fi Film 'Matrix' Takes in $22M / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The special effects-filled adventure ``The  
Matrix'' held its No. 1 spot at the box office, while spring break 
crowds gave Drew Barrymore's back-to-school film ``Never Been 
Kissed'' a strong opening, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix,'' bringing in $22.2 million, stars Keanu Reeves in  
the story of a computer hacker who finds out that reality isn't 
what it seems. The film has emerged as the year's second breakout 
hit, grossing $72.9 million in just two weeks, according to 
estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' was the year's first breakout hit.  
</P>
<P>
	But not even the wizardry of ``The Matrix'' could pull the year  
out of its post-''Titanic'' syndrome. After a momentary upturn when 
``The Matrix'' opened, the overall box office was once again down 
last weekend, this time 4.4 percent, from last year's weekend, when 
``City of Angels,'' ``Lost in Space'' and ``Titanic'' were going 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than half the nation's young people on vacation last  
week, youth-oriented films predictably dominated the top 10 -- with 
a mixed bag of results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never Been Kissed,'' with a strong $11.7 million, led the  
pack. The hip-hop comedy ``Foolish'' opened with $2.26 million in 
10th place for an impressive per-screen average of $7,410 -- even 
though its studio, fearing bad reviews, didn't screen the movie for 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``10 Things I Hate About You,'' the loose adaptation of  
Shakespeare's ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' slid 38 percent in its 
second week to finish fourth with $5.2 million. The movie played 
particularly well to vacationing teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
	But another new film, the Sundance Film Festival favorite ``Go''  
opened with a somewhat disappointing $4.7 million for sixth. Sony 
is now counting on strong word of mouth to keep the critically 
praised rave-scene film from plummeting into oblivion when most 
kids go back to school this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $22.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Go,'' $4.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Forces of Nature,'' $3.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Twin Dragons,'' $2.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' $2.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Foolish,'' $2.26 million.

<HEADLINE> Bulldogs Guard Decides To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Fresno State guard Courtney Alexander said  
Monday he will forgo his chances in the NBA draft and play his 
senior season for the coach who gave him his ``second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing next to Jerry Tarkanian, Alexander said his decision to  
stay at Fresno State would have been much more difficult if the 
coach had left the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian signed a one-year contract extension last month.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't come back, that would have put a twist in my  
decision,'' Alexander said. ``I don't think I would have played for 
any other coach here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander transferred to Fresno State from Virginia in 1997  
after he was convicted of beating his fiancee. He was sentenced to 
four days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was his first with Fresno State after sitting out a  
season as a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian ``stuck out his neck for me numerous times and I feel  
like I owe it to him,'' Alexander said. ``Fresno State welcomed me 
with open arms when my life was upside down, when my basketball 
career came to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing his degree also was important in making his final  
decision, said Alexander, an anthropology major. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys in Courtney's position, when they feel like  
they're going to turn pro, ... would not have gone to class and 
continued with school,'' Tarkanian said. ``Courtney went to class, 
he continued to do school work, maintained his good grades and is 
on target to graduate next December. I'm real proud of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, projected to be a first-round draft pick, said he  
hopes to lead the Bulldogs to their first NCAA tournament since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like I have a lot of unfinished business here,''  
he said. ``I feel deep down in my heart that I have to return with 
a different attitude and provide the ultimate leadership, and help 
coach Tarkanian guide this team not only to the NCAA tournament, 
but as far as we can go once we get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Alexander was inconsistent in the beginning of last  
season, he led the team in scoring at 21.4 points per game and was 
named team MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was out of basketball for a year and for the first half of  
the year, Courtney had a real difficult time adjusting,'' Tarkanian 
said. ``His shot selection was down and mentally he was frustrated 
a lot, so we didn't even see the best part of Courtney until the 
last of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarkanian thinks Alexander has a very good shot at being a  
lottery pick in next year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every phase of the game, we haven't seen the best of  
Courtney yet,'' he said. ``And I think we will next season.''

<HEADLINE>  Shanghai GM Starts Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Shanghai GM, General Motors Corp.'s joint  
venture with a Chinese automaker, said it began regular production 
of Buick sedans Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.  
is the biggest foreign joint venture in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will produce about 20,000 Buicks this year  
and gradually increase annual production to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Production through August already has been sold, Shanghai GM  
vice president Philip Murtaugh said in a prepared statement. He 
said orders had been generally in line with expectations, though 
the company got more private orders than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Private companies and individuals had been expected to account  
for 40 percent of sales, with the rest going to joint ventures, 
state companies and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanghai GM did not release detailed sales figures.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Take Over Kwik-Fit Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. is buying Kwik-Fit  
PLC, Europe's largest auto repair chain, for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today marks another step by the world's  
second biggest automaker to expand its operations in Europe. 
European Union antitrust authorities last month authorized Ford's 
$6.45 billion purchase of the passenger car division of Swedish 
automaker Volvo AB. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's president and chief executive, Jacques Nasser, said the  
deal would bring the company closer to becoming the world's leading 
consumer company for automotive products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto repair chain was founded by Chairman Tom Farmer in 1971  
and has some 1,900 specialist tire, exhaust and brake-fitting 
outlets across Britain, Ireland and continental Europe. It also has 
an insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer will join the Ford board responsible for the company's  
global parts and services operation once the acquisition is 
completed, Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Edinburgh-based Kwik-Fit soared 118.5 pence to 540  
pence, or $8.69, a share in midday trading in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford offered 560 pence, or $8.96, a share for the company,  
nearly one-third above Friday's closing price of 412.5 pence, or 
$6.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by Kwik-Fit shareholders at a  
special meeting, to be scheduled probably within the next two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's announcement said Kwik-Fit would continue  
operating as a separate company and would maintain its Scottish 
headquarters, and secure the jobs of its staff of 9,500 people.

<HEADLINE> 'Click and Clack' To Address MIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Last year, President Clinton was the commencement  
speaker at MIT. This year -- Tom and Ray Magliozzi. 
</P>
<P>
	Never heard of them?  
</P>
<P>
	They're better known as ``Click and Clack, the Tappet  
brothers,'' hosts of the syndicated National Public Radio talk show 
``Car Talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part mechanics self-help, part car-based comedy hour, their show  
is heard on 370 NPR stations. They once advised a nun to consider 
having a special collection at Mass to pay for new tires on her 
Plymouth Sundance. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers are themselves graduates of the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology -- Tom in 1958 with an economics degree, Ray 
in 1972 with a humanities degree. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Charles Vest has demonstrated tremendous courage by  
inviting us to give the commencement address, since he has 
absolutely no idea what we're going to say,'' Ray said. ``And 
needless to say, neither do we.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force Tries To Rescue Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third day in a row, Air  
Force controllers worked feverishly today to try to rescue a $250 
million missile-warning satellite that's stranded in a useless 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still working around the clock trying to see what they  
can do with the satellite,'' Carol Searson, a spokeswoman at 
Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado, said this morning. ``They're 
in contact with it and they have control of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Defense Support Program satellite cannot be salvaged, the  
failed mission will have cost taxpayers $682 million, including the 
rocket cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was launched Friday aboard an Air Force Titan  
rocket. It was the first flight of a Titan IV since a much more 
expensive spy satellite was destroyed in a $1 billion explosion 
shortly after liftoff last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titan did its job in its long-awaited return to flight. But  
an upper-stage motor apparently malfunctioned late Friday and left 
the satellite in a highly lopsided rather than circular orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials said the Boeing-built motor separated as  
planned from the satellite seven hours after liftoff, but it was 
unclear whether it fired properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was intended for a 22,300-mile-high orbit, where  
it was to have joined other Defense Support Program spacecraft in 
detecting missile and rocket launches as well as nuclear 
detonations. The 2 1/2-ton satellite is equipped with 6,000 infrared 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials insisted before Friday's launch there was no  
rush for the new satellite, even with the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
They said the existing Defense Support Program network is providing 
complete, worldwide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellites were instrumental in tracking Scud missiles  
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 19th Defense Support Program satellite built by TRW  
for the Air Force, which has been launching the spacecraft since 
1970. Another DSP satellite isn't scheduled to go up until 
December.

<HEADLINE> Bill Targets Filmmaking in Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Movie makers and television producers would  
have to start paying more to work in national parks and wildlife 
refuges under a bill the House passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would authorize the department to set a schedule of  
fees for commercial use of public lands and allow department 
agencies to keep the money generated by the fees. The fees would be 
based on such factors as the number of people at the site and the 
duration of filming. 
</P>
<P>
	Television news products, newsreels and some commercial  
photography projects would be exempt from the fees. The bill, 
passed by voice vote, also would authorize the interior secretary 
to reduce fees for projects that have educational benefits for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This a good bill which is long overdue,'' said Rep. Jim  
Gibbons, R-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be charging appropriate fees for the use of national  
parks and refuges,'' said Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's 
Democratic delegate to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1948, filmmakers paid fees to use public lands as  
backdrops for their movies based on a standardized rate schedule. 
But that year, for an unknown reason, the Interior Department 
prohibited future collection of location fees in national parks or 
wildlife refuges. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  
are limited to charging user fees to cover personnel expenses. The 
Forest Service, in the Agriculture Department, and Interior's 
Bureau of Land Management still have policies in place allowing 
them to collect commercial filming fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar measure last year, but the Senate  
never voted on it before the 105th Congress adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 154.

<HEADLINE> Study: Ads Soaring on Prime-Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wondering why you're reaching for the  
remote-control more often? The number of ads cluttering prime-time 
television is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	An average hour of prime-time TV contained 15 minutes, 44  
seconds of advertising last November, a jump of 25 seconds over the 
year before, according to a study released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most ad time ever recorded since two trade groups  
began measuring in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	At 16:27, ABC had the most ``clutter'' during an average  
prime-time hour among the top four networks. Fox had been the 
network leader in ad time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ABC and NBC pack in nearly five minutes more of ads and  
promotions into a prime-time hour than they did a decade ago, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an indication of a business in trouble,'' said Jon  
Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom, an ad buying firm. With 
viewership declining, the networks need to sell more ads because 
they can't promise their sponsors as many people will see their 
message as they did in the past, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Programming costs have been going up at the same time, forcing  
network executives to look harder for more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising community is concerned that the commercials will  
have less of an impact on viewers because there are too many of 
them, said Stuart Gray, senior vice president of audience research 
for the ad buying firm BBD&AMP;O. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really think that people are going to stop watching  
television because there are too many commercials,'' Gray said. ``I 
think it will have the effect of causing viewers to use the remote 
even more than they are using it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime network television is even more cluttered. The networks  
added 11 seconds of commercial time last year to crack the 
20-minute barrier: one-third of each hour in daytime is taken up by 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	Network news programs and late-night shows had fewer commercial  
messages, on average, in 1998 than they did the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	E! Entertainment Television, TBS and MTV ranked among the most  
cluttered cable networks last year, all with just over 18 minutes 
of ad time during an average hour, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandel said he saw instances of a cable station running an  
eight-minute commercial break during the airing of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad part is that they're ruining the viewing experience,  
they're ruining the advertisements' effectiveness and they're not 
getting anywhere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was prepared by the American Association of  
Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers, 
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,339.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street hit a grand slam Monday as major  
market indexes, including the Dow industrials, bounced back from an 
early drubbing to close at new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest demonstration of resilience, the market shook off  
a stunning earnings warning from Compaq Computer that depressed 
technology issues and turned it into an excuse for a stock-shopping 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down 77 points in early  
trading, finished with a gain of 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, at 
10,339.51, its first close above both 10,200 and 10,300. The 
previous high of 10,197.70 was set Thursday. The average of 30 
blue-chip stocks is now up 12.6 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, despite its heavy weighting in hard-hit  
computer stocks, rose 5.76 to 2,598.81. The S&AMP;P 500 index closed at 
1,358.63, up 10.28. The composite index of the New York Stock 
Exchange also set a record, rising 6.54 to 633.13. 
</P>
<P>
	All three beat records set Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The bears are saying, `I give up,' ... and the bulls are  
saying, `I can't wait any more; I've got to buy,' '' said Larry 
Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was a trouble spot all day, closing down 6 7/8, or 22  
percent, at 24 1/16 as the most active issue on the NYSE. Compaq 
said after markets closed Friday that it expected earnings would 
come to 15 cents a share for the first quarter, less than half 
analysts' average estimates of 31 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq in part blamed industrywide personal-computer price cuts,  
which fed investors' uneasiness about computer makers' earnings in 
general. Dow component IBM fell 2 7/8 to 183 7/16. Dell shed 1 3/4 to 41 
13/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	An analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens &AMP; Co., Dan Niles,  
added to the concerns by lowering his estimate of PC revenue growth 
to 3 percent this year from an earlier forecast of 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about Compaq's troubles were for the most part  
confined to computer-related stocks. Rather than touching off an 
all-out selloff, Compaq's warning and the weakness in technology 
issues prompted investors to seek shares in other sectors that may 
have been undervalued, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said  
such a ``rotation'' showed up in strength Monday among consumer 
issues, some economically sensitive shares and financial stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of big Dow stocks were higher, including International  
Paper, up 2 3/16 to 46 7/16, and Caterpillar, up 2 5/8 to 51 3/8. Merrill 
Lynch upgraded its rating for Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in economically sensitive stocks reflects a  
broadening economic recovery worldwide, said Jack Shaughnessy, 
market strategist at Advest Corp. in Hartford, Conn. Shaughnessy 
said Western Europe, for example, should benefit from last week's 
cut in European interest rates. And, he said, the picture brightens 
almost daily in Asia and is at least not worsening in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is broadening because worldwide economic activity  
is broadening,'' Shaughnessy said. He was buying paper stocks, for 
example, ``because we can see pulp and paper prices improving, and 
Asia is a major consumer of these products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also said the broadening of leadership beyond technology  
shares was a sign that the market could continue to go higher. 
Technicians, market analysts who examine things like the ratio of 
advancing issues to decliners, have been worried since early 
October that while the Dow and even the Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 continue 
to make new highs, the advances have been confined to too few 
high-flying technology names to be sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday was different, Wachtel said. ``Not only does the Dow  
recover, but the breadth recovers, the Russell 2000 recovers, the 
whole shooting match recovers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of small- and medium-sized companies  
advanced 6.46 points, or 1.59 percent, at 412.32, although it is 
still down 2.28 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
NYSE. Consolidated volume on the Big Board was 1.01 billion shares,

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Artest, who led St. John's to a 50-19 record  
in his two seasons there, has decided to forgo his final two years 
with the Red Storm and apply for the NBA draft, The Associated 
Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Artest, who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity, said Sunday that the 6-foot-6 swingman, who was a 
third-team All-America last season, will announce his decision 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest, who led the Red Storm to the NCAA tournament regional  
final last month, is planning to make the announcement at a news 
conference at the community center in his Queensbridge 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest led St. John's (28-9) in scoring last season at 14.5  
points and also grabbed 6.3 rebounds, but had one of his worst 
offensive games of the season in the Red Storm's 77-74 loss to Ohio 
State in the South Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest had nine points and nine rebounds in what turned out to  
be his final college game, but he was 4-for-10 from the field, 
including 1-for-5 from 3-point range. He also had five turnovers in 
the opening 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recruited to St. John's by former coach Fran Fraschilla  
and played for him as a freshman as the Red Storm went 22-10 and 
made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraschilla was fired after the season and replaced by Mike  
Jarvis. The only senior starter for St. John's last season was 
forward Tyrone Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest would become the first player to leave St. John's early  
for the NBA draft since Walter Berry, who left after being named 
national player of the year as a junior in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players to have declared for the draft include Maryland's  
Steve Francis, a second-team All-America as a junior, and junior 
forward Albert White of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who might enter the NBA draft are: Duke's William Avery  
and Elton Brand, the latter the national player of the year; 
Richard Hamilton of national champion Connecticut; Lamar Odom of 
Rhode Island; Baron Davis of UCLA; Jumaine Jones of Georgia; Chris 
Porter of Auburn; and Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Top NBA prospects who have said they will return next season  
include point guards Ed Cota of North Carolina and Scoonie Penn of 
Ohio State, both juniors, and sophomore Khalid El-Amin of 
Connecticut as well as DePaul freshman swingman Quintin Richardson.

<HEADLINE> Market Ignores Compaq Dive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You had all the perfect ingredients for a rotten  
day on Wall Street: a warning of weak profits from a big name in 
computers, a weekend to worry about it, and a pricey stock market 
ripe for profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	After some early quivers, however, investors delivered an odd  
verdict Monday. They pummeled the bringer of bad news, Compaq 
Computer, but sent four major indexes to new records. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq dove 22 percent following late Friday's  
announcement by the personal computer maker that its first-quarter 
earnings per share would amount to just half of what most Wall 
Street analysts were forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	The discouraging news weighed down other computer stocks, but  
the Dow Jones industrial average shook off an early slide and shot 
165 points higher to a record 10,339. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock index also closed at a record. 
</P>
<P>
	More conspicuously, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index  
wiped out an early 2.5 percent plunge and set a new high too. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering how much hope and hype has been crammed into  
cyber-centric stock rally of recent months, that might seem a 
blissfully ignorant response to a warning from the No. 1 maker of 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, few observers condemned the market as cavalier or  
headstrong for shrugging off the Compaq announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, had the news come from investor favorites like IBM,  
Intel or Microsoft -- companies seen as better barometers of the 
technology business -- Monday's selling might have lasted more than 
a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Wall Street quickly decided that Compaq's weak results  
had a lot more to do with Compaq than the industry or the overall 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything points to the fact that this is company-specific  
problem,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist for 
Advest Inc., noting that PC price wars have are particularly rough 
on Compaq, which relies more heavily on store sales than telephone 
and Internet sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell and Gateway, by contrast, don't sell PCs through retailers,  
eliminating the need to coordinate with vendors and give them a cut 
of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is ``one of the few indirect sellers, one of the few  
high-cost operators,'' said Shaughnessy. ``Prices are coming down, 
and they can't get their costs down fast enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor that may be holding back Compaq, analysts said,  
is last year's acquisition of computer maker Digital Equipment, a 
merger that hasn't gone as smoothly as hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	Although rival PC makers took some lumps on Monday, the damage  
was rather contained compared with drubbing given Compaq's shares, 
which fell $6.87 1/2 to $24.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Dell, which last week told analysts that its business  
has been on target in recent months, fell 4 percent, or $1.75 to 
$41.82 1/2 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which last week announced a major foray into direct PC  
sales from its Web site, fell $2.87 1/2 per share to $183.43 3/4 on the 
NYSE. Gateway's shares fell 2.87 1/2 to 69.87 1/2, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Activist Rathbun Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- ``Brownie Mary'' Rathbun, the grandmotherly  
activist whose arrests for distributing pot brownies to AIDS 
patients built momentum for the medicinal marijuana movement, has 
died at 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jane Rathbun died at a hospital Saturday of undisclosed  
causes. She had been hospitalized and in considerable pain ever 
since she injured her spine in a fall last August, said her friend 
Larry Bittner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rathbun became a fixture at San Francisco General Hospital  
in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, preparing and delivering 
marijuana-laced baked goods to sick people to relieve their nausea 
and pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she made 134 dozen a month during the heyday, 1984 to  
1990. All in her little old kitchen in her subsidized apartment. 
And you could smell it all through her building. The old ladies 
there were all cool about it. Hey, it's San Francisco,'' said 
Dennis Peron, who with Ms. Rathbun founded the now-defunct San 
Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and twice agreed to perform  
hundreds of hours of community service, spending the time with AIDS 
patients, Peron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests helped build support for San Francisco's Proposition  
P and, later, the 1996 state initiative that made growing and using 
marijuana with a doctor's permission legal under California law. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrests also prompted research into whether marijuana really  
does have medicinal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, she and Peron published ``Brownie Mary's Marijuana  
Cookbook,'' which is missing the brownie recipe. Peron said that 
before she died, she asked him to try to sell the recipe and give 
the proceeds to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would never put the famous brownie recipe in it,'' Peron  
said. ``Now I've got to get the brownie recipe from her safe 
deposit box, and approach Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, whatever, and 
sell it and use the proceeds for her `kids.''' 
</P>
<P>
	She had no survivors. Ms. Rathbun had a daughter who died in a  
car accident in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the mother of every gay kid in San Francisco,'' Peron  
said.

<HEADLINE> BoxCar Willie Dies of Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- BoxCar Willie, whose gentle country voice  
and songs of life on the road evoked memories of a time when hobos 
watched America pass by from the door of a freight car, died Monday 
of leukemia. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at home, a family spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie had recently announced he was canceling his 1999  
season of shows when the disease, first diagnosed in 1996, 
returned. Until his health began to fail, he was not only a Branson 
performer but one of the music town's elder statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Clark became the first nationally known entertainer to put  
his name on a Branson theater in 1983. But BoxCar Willie liked to 
boast that unlike Clark, who often booked other people into his 
venue, he became the first name entertainer to work the town 
year-round when he arrived in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	He did six or more shows a week nine months of the year until  
his health failed. 
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie took it upon himself to mentor performers as they  
arrived in Branson, telling them what worked and what didn't in a 
conservative, heartland town of 3,700 residents and millions of 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	And he fumed about performers who left Branson.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's been about 30, 35 artists that came into this town and  
then left since I've been here,'' he said in 1996. ``They don't pay 
their taxes here, they don't vote here. Doggone it, it just kind of 
bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931, BoxCar Willie was  
the son of a railroad man who used to play his fiddle on the porch 
while his son sat in on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	By his teens he had graduated to playing in jamborees all over  
the state, but he gave up show business to enlist in the Air Force. 
He spent 22 years there, logging some 10,000 hours as a flier. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the service he returned to performing, and  
by the 1970s he had developed the singing hobo persona, complete 
with overalls, a battered old hat, worn suit jacket and two days' 
growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never had a hit single, his albums sold well over  
the years and he built a loyal following that would later make him 
one of the most popular performers in Branson, where he operated a 
motel and train museum as well as his theater. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took the BoxCar Willie look, as well as the name,  
after seeing a freight train pass him by one day in Lincoln, Neb., 
as he was stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there was an old boy sitting on a boxcar, dressed the way  
I dress today, and he looked just like a buddy of mine named Willie 
Wilson,'' he told The Associated Press in 1997. ``I said, `There's 
Willie in a boxcar, and that's where it came from.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he had traveled by freight train as a young man  
himself, BoxCar Willie said in that interview, he had long since 
given it up as America changed and it became too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sisters.

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Indians Draw Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- American Indians who consider the Cleveland  
Indians' ``Chief Wahoo'' logo derogatory burned a homemade wooden 
coffin today outside Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 protesters peacefully demonstrated outside the ballpark  
before the home opener against Kansas City. As police watched from 
a distance, the protesters burned the coffin which had a wooden 
sculpture of Chief Wahoo laid out inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar protests against the grinning, red-faced Chief Wahoo  
have resulted in arrests in recent years, but there were no arrests 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Five protesters who were arrested on suspicion of arson last  
year after a straw figure of Wahoo was burned have sued city police 
for allegedly violating their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The five, including Vernon Bellecourt, president of the American  
Indian Movement, were jailed for about a day and released without 
being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday, accuses the Cleveland Police  
Department and former Chief Rocco Pollutro of wrongful arrest, 
illegal imprisonment and violation of the right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thrust of the Native American community is to call  
attention to the racism of the Chief Wahoo logo,'' attorney Terry 
Gilbert said. ``Going to Jacobs Field and demonstrating is a 
critical part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hastings declined to  
comment on the allegations because he has not seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's entitled to say whatever he wants to say. That's what the  
courts are for,'' Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the arrests last spring, three protesters were  
arrested during the 1997 World Series after burning a straw effigy 
of Chief Wahoo. A municipal judge eventually threw out the case.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Testimony in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In finding President Clinton in contempt of court, U.S. District  
Court Judge Susan Webber Wright cited answers from his testimony in 
the Jones case that were ``false, misleading and evasive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answers were responses to questions about whether he was  
ever alone with Monica Lewinsky in the White House and whether he 
and Ms. Lewinsky had sexual relations: 

</P>
<P>
	Question: At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky together  
alone in the Oval Office? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the  
legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the 
weekends. She -- it seems to me she brought things to me once or 
twice on the weekends. 

</P>
<P>
	Question: At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky alone in the  
hallway between the Oval office and this kitchen area? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: I don't believe so. ... I don't believe we were alone in  
the hallway, no. 
</P>
<P>
	Question: At any time have you and Monica Lewinsky ever been  
alone together in any room in the White House? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: I have no specific recollection, but it seems to me that  
she was on duty on a couple of occasions working for the 
legislative affairs office and brought me some things to sign, 
something on the weekend. That's -- I have a general memory of that. 

</P>
<P>
	Question: Did you ever have an extramarital sexual affair with  
Monica Lewinsky? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: No.  

</P>
<P>
	Question: If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with  
you beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie? 
</P>
<P>
	Answer: It's certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilot union, held in contempt  
over a February sickout that canceled thousands of flights and cost 
millions of dollars, was due back in court today as a judge 
considers the amount of the union's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered the Allied Pilots  
Association to make a $10 million down payment, about 25 percent of 
the union's worth, toward a fine levied for the three days pilots 
defied his back-to-work order in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between the union and the air carrier reached a  
fever point over American's decision late last year to buy Reno 
Air. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated into 
American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
effected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Their inability to reach an agreement led to a massive sickout  
of about 2,500 pilots over 10 days, resulting in the cancellation 
of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,  
estimates the work stoppage cost more than $50 million. The APA 
contends that the sickout was within the union's rights, saying the 
company had violated the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	As the union contends with the dispute with its company, as well  
as the contempt fine before the court, APA also is dealing with 
several civil lawsuits. Several passengers have filed lawsuits 
against the union because their flights were disrupted by the 
sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, which have all been moved to federal court in  
Dallas, seek damages of more than $200 million. Attorneys expect 
the complaints will be consolidated into a single class-action 
lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while the pilots brawled with the company over the Reno Air  
purchase, flight attendants were able to reach agreement with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Professional Flight Attendants and AMR  
reached a settlement last week on how to absorb the low-cost 
carrier. They did not disclose details. AMR also has announced it 
has reached agreement with the Transport Workers Union, which 
represents American's 28,000 aviation maintenance technicians and 
fleet workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, American will begin training Reno airport and  
reservations agents to join the airline. The integration is 
expected to be completed by August.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Compete on Shuttle Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways and Delta Air Lines have launched a  
new competition for airline shuttle traffic between Boston and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways announced today that it would rename its hourly  
service between Boston's Logan International Airport and 
Washington's Reagan National Airport as US Airways Shuttle service 
starting July 9. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also make the same changes to its hourly service between  
Washington's Dulles International Airport and both Boston and New 
York within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle service, which is currently used on flights between  
Boston and New York and between New York and Washington, provides 
for separate check-in areas, free newspapers and light snacks. 
</P>
<P>
	While mentioned in general terms when US Airways bought shuttle  
routes at the end of 1997, the change comes less than a week after 
Delta revealed that it would begin offering its own nonstop shuttle 
service between Logan and National starting June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike US Airways' hourly service, the Delta flights will  
operate every other hour during the business day. Delta currently 
offers hourly service between Boston and New York and between New 
York and Washington. On all its shuttle flights, it has amenities 
including free newspapers and snacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northeast Corridor has been a historic battleground for  
airlines. Each month Delta alone flies an average of 170,000 
passengers between Boston, New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak recently announced that it bid for more of the market  
later this year, when it begins running 150-mph ``Acela'' trains 
between Boston and New York and between New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-speed trains are designed to be competitive with the  
airlines when considering travel from the center of one city to 
another. Airline passengers often have to account for travel time 
to and from the airports in each city, which can add delays and 
expense to a trip.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Lower; Down Down 55.23 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Monday morning on worries  
about market-leading technology stocks after Compaq Computer warned 
that its first-quarter earnings would be less than half what 
analysts had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 55.23 at 10,118.61, after losing 23.86 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares were down 7 3/16, or by 23 percent, at 23 3/4. Citing  
industrywide price cuts, Compaq said after markets closed Friday 
that it expected earnings would come to 15 cents a share for the 
first quarter, well below analysts' average estimates of 31 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile computer stocks were sharply lower, with Dow  
component IBM off 4 3/16 at 182 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement hit the broader stock indexes, which are  
heavily weighted in technology shares, especially hard. The Nasdaq 
composite index was down 45.89 at 2,547.16, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was down at 12.04 at 1,336.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 1 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 102.75 million 
shares, up from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.07 percent in  
anticipation of a selloff on Wall Street. In afternoon trading, 
Germany's DAX index was up 0.09 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.50 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Former Boeing CEO Wilson Dies at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Former Boeing chairman and chief executive  
officer Thornton Arnold ``T'' Wilson has died at his winter home in 
Palm Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 78, was credited with developing and producing the  
Boeing 757 and 767 jetliners. The cause of his death was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined Boeing in 1943 as an engineer. He became company  
president in 1968, chief executive officer in 1969 and chairman in 
1972. He retired as CEO until 1986 and as board chairman in 1987, 
though he served as board chairman emeritus until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wilson's leadership, Boeing introduced the 747 and  
subsequently developed and produced the 757 and 767, establishing 
the company as the world's leading supplier of commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Sikeston, Mo., on Feb. 8, 1921, Wilson joined Boeing  
after earning a degree in aeronautical engineering at Iowa State. 
He earned his master's degree at California Institute of Technology 
in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson first made his mark with Boeing on the B-47 swept-wing  
bomber. He later was project engineer for the B-52 bomber program 
and then led the proposal team that won Boeing the Minuteman 
intercontinental ballistic missile program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was elected company vice president in 1963 and in 1964  
was put in charge of operations and planning for corporate 
headquarters. Two years later, he was named executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his numerous awards was the Wright Brothers Trophy in 1979  
for ``significant public service of enduring value to aviation in 
the United States.'' He and Boeing won the 1982 Collier Trophy for 
the private development of the 757 and 767. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson won a place in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in  
1982, and was inducted into the National Business Hall of Fame in 
1989. He was a life member of the Corporation of Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, where he was a Sloan fellow in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is survived by his wife, Grace Miller Wilson; their three  
children, Thornton A. Wilson III, Daniel Wilson and Sarah 
Parkinson; and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson and his wife had long resided in Normandy Park, south of  
Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Starwood Wants Out of Gaming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The parent company for the posh Caesars casino  
resorts has confirmed persistent rumors that it is discussing the 
sale of its gambling properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide Inc. said in a statement  
Monday it is ``in discussions concerning the possible sale of its 
gaming business. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood's gambling properties include Caesars resorts in Las  
Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City, as well as the Desert Inn 
hotel-casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood said it would not comment further on any potential  
transaction ``until a definitive agreement is reached, or 
discussions are terminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Roffman, gambling industry analyst for Roffman Miller  
Associates, said Monday's confirmation by Starwood was no surprise 
to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's any secret on the street that (Starwood  
Chairman) Barry Sternlicht would like to sell Caesars,'' Roffman 
said Monday. ``He doesn't have a warm spot for gaming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he wants $2.5 billion to $3 billion in cash, and I  
don't think he's going to get a cash deal,'' Roffman added. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation Starwood was discussing a deal with  
Park Place Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Davis, Park Place vice president of corporate  
communications, declined comment. Park Place is a spinoff of Hilton 
Hotels Corp., and encompasses the gambling properties once owned by 
the hotel giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood has more than 700 hotels in 72 countries through its  
St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton, Four Points, W and Caesars brands.

<HEADLINE> Bifocal Contacts Pushed for Boomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For aging baby boomers, bifocal glasses have  
seemed an inevitable rite of passage. But the pharmaceutical 
company Johnson &AMP; Johnson now is pushing a more youthful-looking 
alternative: bifocal contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Acuvue disposable bifocals aren't the first bifocal  
contact lenses, and a few competitors exist. But very few of the 89 
million Americans who need bifocal vision correction have tried 
them or know they exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eye care providers were not suggesting them to people, because  
we never had faith they would work,'' said optometrist Thomas Quinn 
of Athens, Ohio. Now that he's suggesting Acuvue, ``patients' first 
reaction is surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testing the Acuvue, Quinn said about 70 percent of his  
patients had successful bifocal vision correction. He said older 
bifocal contacts had about a 25 percent success rate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Acuvue is not for everyone, both Quinn and the Food and  
Drug Administration cautioned Monday. It seems to work best on mild 
to moderate bifocal vision problems, said FDA ophthalmic devices 
chief Dr. James Saviola. Quinn said people who have problems with 
night vision may not be good candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	As people age, the eye's lens gradually loses its flexibility to  
change visual focus from near to far. One of the first symptoms of 
this ``presbyopia'' is difficulty reading, forcing people to hold 
books at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms typically begin around age 40. Even people with perfect  
vision in their youth need at least reading glasses by their 40s 
and 50s, which they remove to see at a distance. Others use bifocal 
glasses, or even try ``monovision,'' putting a contact lens for 
near vision in one eye and one for far vision in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	A few companies make bifocal contacts with special near and far  
vision zones. But only about 1 percent of presbyopics wear contact 
lenses, the vast majority of whom wear monovision contacts, Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acuvue bifocals comprise five concentric rings that alternate in  
correcting near or far vision, called a ``pupil intelligent'' 
system. Look through them, and the eye automatically adjusts to see 
near or far, J&AMP;J says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're presenting the lens in such a way that light is  
focused, both for distance and near vision, at the back of the eye 
simultaneously in a way companies haven't before,'' explained FDA's 
Saviola. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the Acuvue provides a little clearer vision than  
some older competitors, Saviola said, but he cautioned that people 
with difficult visual requirements may still get crisper vision 
from glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA actually approved Acuvue bifocals two years ago, but J&AMP;J  
only test-marketed them in a handful of cities until last summer. 
The FDA hadn't required the company to prove how well Acuvue 
corrects vision, so the test marketing measured doctor and patient 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said optometrists must be trained to properly fit the  
bifocal. Instead of eye exams done in a darkened room testing one 
eye at a time, the Acuvue requires testing in a lighted room with 
both eyes open. J&AMP;J began optometrist training in July, and on 
Tuesday begins telling consumers, in a campaign that includes 
nationwide TV ads, that the lenses are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn says a year's supply costs about $300, plus he charges  
about $200 for the eye exam and fitting. A pair of quality bifocal 
glasses, in contrast, costs about $300, he said.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shattered records today, charging back  
from an early drubbing tied to a stunning earnings warning from 
Compaq Computer. The Dow Jones industrial average, down 77 points 
in early trading, finished with a gain of 165.67 points, or 1.6 
percent, at 10,339.51, its first close above both 10,200 and 
10,300. The previous high of 10,197.70 was set Thursday. Broader 
indexes also ended in record territory after shaking off early 
losses. The Nasdaq composite, despite its heavy weighting in 
hard-hit computer stocks, rose 5.70 to 2,598.75. The S&AMP;P 500 index 
closed at 1,358.64, up 10.29. Both indexes beat records set Friday.

day, down 6 13/16 points at the close, or 22 percent, at 24 1/8 as the 
most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Compaq said after 
markets closed Friday that it expected earnings would come to 15 
cents a share for the first quarter, less than half analysts' 
average estimates of 31 cents. Compaq in part blamed industrywide 
personal computer price cuts. That caused general concerns today 
about computer makers' earnings. Dow component IBM fell 2 13/16 to

IBM is testing a system this spring that combines its technology 
with RealNetworks software, which already is used by more than 55 
million people to play music, listen to radio and watch video 
clips. The new system targets computer users who get Internet 
access across telephone lines, the most common avenue to the Web. 
Microsoft, for its part, is expected to announce a deal tomorrow

	Insurers Paid $1.85B in 1Q Claims  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. insurance industry paid an estimated  
$1.85 billion to homeowners and businesses for losses to insured 
properties caused by five storms in the first quarter of this year, 
a trade group reported today. That was up from the $1.1 billion 
paid for damages caused by 10 storms and other catastrophic events 
in the first quarter of 1998, according to the Property Claim 
Services unit of the Insurance Services Office Inc. The group 
tracks insurance payments for catastrophes, which it defines as 
events that cause $25 million or more in insured property losses to 
a large number of policyholders. Four winter storms in January 
resulted in payment of $1.8 billion for property losses. A fifth 
storm in the Pacific Northwest in March added $50 million in 
insured property losses, it said.

	CBS Invests in Two Web Sites

	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is exchanging $200 million worth of  
advertising and promotion for stakes in two Web sites, continuing a 
strategy that has already paid off handsomely with two other 
startup companies. CBS will get 35 percent of hollywood.com, a Web 
site that provides information and listings for movies as well as 
interviews with stars. In the other deal, CBS will get a 50 percent 
ownership stake in storeRunner.com, a year-old site that scans 
other locations on the Internet for good deals for shoppers. 
Separately, the company announced the acquisition today of a 
Dallas-area TV station for $485 million in stock. With the purchase 
of KTVT from Gaylord Entertainment Co., CBS will own 15 stations 
across the country, reaching 34 percent of the population.

	Continental's Fare Hike Collapses

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines' weekend attempt to increase  
its air fares proved unsuccessful after other major carriers failed 
to follow suit. Continental said Friday it would bump up ticket 
prices by 3 percent for leisure travel and 1 percent for business 
fares, those purchased on a walk-up basis. Delta Air Lines and 
United Airlines then said they would raise fares. But when other 
major competitors like American Airlines and Northwest Airlines 
failed to implement higher prices, most ticket prices were returned 
to pre-hike levels.

expectations, as the investment bank and brokerage was helped by 
Wall Street's heightened activity and an increased flow of new 
securities offerings. Bear Stearns earned $204 million, or $1.42 a 
share, in the third fiscal quarter ended March 26, up from $166.3 
million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Its earnings per share 
topped the $1.15 average that analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
had expected. Shares of Bear Stearns were at 50 3/8 up 3/4.

the investigation of voice-mail theft at the company. George 
Ventura filed a motion Friday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court 
that claims prosecutors unfairly targeted him while ignoring other 
suspects and that the methods they used violated his constitutional 
rights. Ventura is accused of stealing voice mail from Chiquita 
Brands International Inc. for a newspaper investigation of the 
company. He has pleaded innocent to five counts of unlawful 
interception of communications and five counts of unauthorized 
access to computer systems. He could get 12 1/2 years in prison if

injuring seven circus workers, minutes after the audience of about 
125 was evacuated as the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators at the Roberts Brothers Circus in this Roanoke Island  
community could have been killed had the firefighters and circus 
crew not acted quickly Sunday afternoon, Dare County Fire Marshal 
Doug Remaley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had just started juggling when the ringmaster said there  
was some severe weather in the area, and if the fire department 
came in and blew a whistle, the tent would have to be evacuated,'' 
Remaley said. ``They got everybody out in an orderly manner. The 
people got in their cars and left. It was handled very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the 25-foot-high tent went down, Roanoke Island  
firefighters quickly got ambulances to the scene. The ringmaster 
and six other circus employees were hurt by poles and other falling 
objects, Remaley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, it was just straight-line wind,'' said Dare County  
Emergency Operations Director Sandy Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the injured were taken to hospitals and the other three  
were treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The traveling circus, based in Sarasota, Fla., was in its second  
day of performances in Wanchese. Circus officials said a show 
scheduled for today at Knotts Island would be canceled.

<HEADLINE> India Tests Nuclear-Capable Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Fending off international criticism of  
India's missile test, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has 
reaffirmed that his country will not be the first to unleash 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics at home accused him of playing politics, using the test  
to shore up his collapsing government. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials said Sunday's 11-minute test flight over the  
Bay of Bengal showed that the second generation Agni missile was 
ready for battle, capable of delivering a 2,200-pound payload of 
nuclear or conventional explosives more than 1,240 miles -- far 
enough to reach any target in Pakistan and penetrate deep into 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was long expected. India had made it clear it would  
ignore the advice of the United States to refrain from further 
missile developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``India remains committed to minimum deterrence, to no-first-use  
of nuclear weapons, and never to use them against non-nuclear 
weapons states,'' Vajpayee said in an address to the nation late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``India cannot depend on others to defend her. We have to  
develop our own indigenous capabilities. Agni is a symbol of that 
resurgent India,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	India gave advance notice that it would conduct the test to  
neighbor and rival Pakistan and the United States on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said he had cautioned  
India against the test. It ``would be a negative development which 
would adversely affect the talks between the two countries, but 
India replied that it was part of its program,'' he told the 
British Broadcasting Corp. Urdu-language service. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan said it would decide early this week how to respond.  
The United States, Japan and Australia also issued statements of 
regret and concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``This flight test appears to be out of step with positive  
developments in the political sphere,'' said White House spokesman 
Mike Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch came 11 months after India conducted a series of  
underground nuclear tests, prompting Pakistan to respond with tests 
of its own. The two countries have fought three wars since they 
were created from the British colony in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	It also came as Vajpayee's multiparty coalition government was  
approaching a political day of reckoning. A key partner has 
threatened to withdraw support, depriving the alliance of its 
majority in parliament. Leaders of dozens of parties and factions 
gathered in the capital today for closed-door lobbying before the 
legislature convenes on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister George Fernandes said the missile test was  
unrelated to the political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics said the timing was suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now, when the government is about to leave, it clearly appears  
that the flight-tests have little to do with security concerns and 
more with political concerns,'' said Sitaram Yechury, of the 
influential Communist Party of India-Marxist.

<HEADLINE> Author Wins Tokyo's Governor Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo governor-elect Shintaro Ishihara received a  
mixed welcome today, with expressions of hope for change and of 
concern over his reputation as an outspoken nationalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Ishihara, 66, defeated a host of contenders on Sunday. The  
outcome was a major defeat for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling 
party, whose official candidate ended an embarrassing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ishihara, author of the controversial book ``The Japan That Can  
Say No'' and a former transport minister, succeeds Tokyo Gov. Yukio 
Aoshima later this month. The governor-elect is also a vocal 
opponent of the U.S. military presence in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	A clearly disappointed Obuchi said he was responsible for the  
outcome, which he called ``very regrettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it seriously,'' he was quoted as saying by Kyodo News  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the head of Tokyo's municipal government has little  
influence over national policy, the governor's race was widely 
viewed as a political barometer for the country as well as a gauge 
of Obuchi's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction elsewhere in Asia was cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, the story was a major item in the international  
section of most nationwide newspapers, and it made the front page 
of all the major newspapers in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's Liberty Times, while welcoming Ishihara's support,  
urged Taiwan to distance itself from Ishihara's nationalism in 
order to maintain the delicate equilibrium between Taiwan, China, 
Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times offered a warning, saying, ``His habit  
of upsetting China with outrageous statements and his hard-line 
stance against Japan's security alliance with the United States 
could prove embarrassing for the Obuchi administration in future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ishihara interpreted his victory as a manifestation of the  
electorate's will. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people have waited for a strong and clear message,'' he  
told supporters in a victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Some expressed hope that the win would inject a dose of dynamism  
into the running of Japan's largest local government. 
</P>
<P>
	Ishihara, with his judgment and leadership abilities, could  
become Tokyo's answer to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Nihon 
Keizai, Japan's top economic daily, said in an editorial today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Giuliani became mayor in 1993, New York became a clean  
and safer place to live,'' the paper said. ``This showed a city's 
development depends on the leadership of its chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others questioned Ishihara's lack of experience at the local  
level and stubborn image. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saying `No' alone cannot push metropolitan politics forward,''  
editorialized the nationally circulated Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's 
largest. ``Coordination and leadership are needed to achieve 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ishihara's campaign slogan was ``The Tokyo that can say `No' to  
the country.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA Talks End; Resume Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The opposing sides in the WNBA labor talks met  
for two hours today without reaching agreement on a new collective 
bargaining agreement. More discussions were scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some progress was made, but there are still some significant  
issues that remain to be resolved,'' said Dan Wasserman, a 
spokesman for the players union. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most contentious issues has been the minimum salary.  
The union was asking for $45,000; the league was offering $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the league has been generous, especially in promoting  
the image of strong, positive role models for young girls,'' said 
Sue Wicks of the New York Liberty. ``So it's really funny when it 
comes to money, which would really cement it, they don't want to 
come through. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should go hand-in-hand. It just seems logical to pay on  
principle for doing a respectable job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Val Ackerman and four attorneys represented the  
WNBA at the talks, while players Theresa Weatherspoon and Kim 
Hampton were among the union negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	No details of the discussions were disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA is scheduled to open its pre-draft camp next Thursday  
in Chicago, which means a labor agreement would need to be in place 
by Wednesday at the latest for the league to start up on time for 
its third season. 
</P>
<P>
	The season is scheduled to begin June 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Wicks, currently playing in Strasbourg, France, said most  
players probably would agree to a compromise on the minimum salary 
to avoid a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to risk not playing,'' said Wicks, who did not  
back the creation of a union last November for fear of a labor 
dispute. ``Everyone feels that the league has done a lot for us, 
but we see a couple of things that aren't right. I think the league 
will definitely work with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have already agreed in principle on year-round health  
care coverage, the guaranteeing of contracts after a certain date 
and the creation of an advisory panel to give players input into 
league operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides also are debating the number of players from the  
defunct ABL who could join the 12-team league. The union wanted two 
players per team, while the league wanted four roster slots open to 
ex-ABL players and six slots for the expansion teams in Orlando and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best players have to play,'' Wicks said in a  
telephone interview. ``There is no ABL now, so there's no need to 
label a player. If somebody is better and takes my job -- that's 
sports.''

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Starts Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Shanghai GM, General Motors Corp.'s joint  
venture with a Chinese automaker, said it began regular production 
of Buick sedans Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.  
is the biggest foreign joint venture in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will produce about 20,000 Buicks this year  
and gradually increase annual production to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Production through August already has been sold, Shanghai GM  
vice president Philip Murtaugh said in a prepared statement. He 
said orders had been generally in line with expectations, though 
the company got more private orders than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Private companies and individuals had been expected to account  
for 40 percent of sales, with the rest going to joint ventures, 
state companies and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanghai GM did not release detailed sales figures.

<HEADLINE> Editors Glimpse High-Tech Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Valley may be powering the 21st  
century, but translating high technology into something newspaper 
readers can relate to is a challenge for editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Soaring technology stocks are driving a robust stock market,  
while computers and the Internet are changing the way the world 
communicates. 
</P>
<P>
	Top newspaper executives from across the country spent Monday in  
San Jose learning about these information-age advances and 
considering how to tell their readers about the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley is such a unique place that when you're outside  
of it, it's very difficult to understand,'' said American 
Electronics Association executive director Leslee Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we are bringing these editors here, to touch, see  
and feel the Silicon Valley,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stretching from Stanford University in Palo Alto to former prune  
orchards south of San Jose, the Silicon Valley is home to most of 
the major high technology companies in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Giles, executive director of the Media Studies Center in New  
York, said the region is ``a major business story in the U.S., and 
not everyone is getting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for newspaper editors is to interpret that force  
in a meaningful way, editors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't need to know the ins and outs of  
technology,'' said Chris Peck, editor of The Spokesman-Review in 
Spokane, Wash. ``They need to know how it's going to change their 
day-to-day lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Steffens, editor of Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine, said  
high-tech stories are now showing up in all parts of newspapers, 
not just the business pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Editors are the last of the generalists. They need to  
understand what's happening here to make news and budget 
decisions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 editors began their day at The Tech Museum of Innovation,  
where they used ultrasound equipment to look at their own hands, 
designed roller coasters, built satellite models and designed 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	They also met Monday with investors and Silicon Valley corporate  
executives, and toured an IBM research laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The editors are in California for the weeklong American Society  
of Newspaper Editors 1999 convention.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Operatic superstar Luciano Pavarotti was given  
a standing ovation when he returned to this gambling haven after a 
14-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti smiled broadly, extending his arms toward the crowd of  
12,500 that cheered his appearance Saturday night to christen the 
Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first concert here since March 1985, when he  
performed at the city's Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. A year earlier, he 
performed at the Riviera Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti appeared fit and happy as he launched into Giacomo  
Puccini's ``Addio, Fiorita Asil'' from ``Madame Butterfly,'' the 
first of a series of arias on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which paid $50 to $450 each for the evening's  
entertainment, roared its approval with each number, prompting 
Pavarotti to exclaim, ``Thank you, thank you, thank you.''

<HEADLINE> Bucs Agree To Terms With Gooch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and restricted free  
agent linebacker Jeff Gooch reached agreement Monday on a four-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Gooch chose to remain with the Buccaneers rather than execute an  
offer sheet with another NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	As a restricted free agent, Gooch had negotiated with several  
other teams and was in position to receive offers from two clubs 
but was able to negotiate a contract of similar terms with the 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old started 21 games over the past two seasons,  
including all 16 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 12 players to start all 16 games for Tampa Bay last  
season, Gooch finished sixth on the team with 72 tackles and had 
one sack, a team-high four forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and 
eight special team tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	An undrafted free agent out of Austin Peay, Gooch has 107

<HEADLINE> Congress Embraces Land Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A billion-dollar land rush is under way in  
Congress, with both political parties saying they want to preserve 
open spaces, protect wildlife and set aside environmentally 
sensitive places. 
</P>
<P>
	But the details are very much in dispute. Environmentalists and  
their Democratic allies want the bulk of funds to go for new 
parkland, suburban green spaces and wildlife protection. Most 
Republicans are backing a proposal to funnel money into coastal 
states with offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences, never before have lawmakers, liberal  
Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, been as gung-ho to 
spend money for land conservation -- as much as $2.6 billion a year 
under one proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	There could emerge ``a classic congressional bargain'' for  
unprecedented and permanent annual funding for land conservation 
programs, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in an interview. 
``There's no question the money is available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of Congress giving little attention to land  
conservation programs, the change of heart has left 
environmentalists stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need new open spaces and finally it looks like Washington  
might be about to play the kind of role it should,'' said William 
Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are coming from conservatives such as Rep. Don  
Young, R-Alaska, a property rights advocate and frequent critic of 
environmentalists, to liberal Democrats such as Rep. George Miller 
and Sen. Barbara Boxer, both Californians with strong links to 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures introduced this year in both the House and Senate far  
exceed even the ambitious $1.1 billion ``land legacy'' initiative 
unveiled by President Clinton in February -- itself a record amount 
for conservation should it be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration has yet to endorse any specific bill,  
Babbitt already has a $295 million shopping list of 86 priority 
projects, including buying 450,000 acres in California's Mojave 
Desert, along with forests in New England and property in the 
Florida Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of room for agreement'' among the various bills,  
says George Frampton, chairman of the president's Council on 
Environmental Quality. 
</P>
<P>
	And the politics seem to be right. Last November, voters  
approved local and state ballot initiatives calling for spending 
more than $4 billion on urban parks and setting aside farmland and 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a significant constituency that's opposed to this.  
In this case, we're dealing with something that's motherhood and 
apple pie,'' Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, it's been a race of one-upmanship.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Clinton proposed doubling conservation spending to $1.1  
billion, including $642 million for federal and state land 
purchases under a program that for years has been largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,  
proposed spending $2.1 billion, including $620 million to buy new 
land for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Young and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., came up with  
a $2.59 billion package, with $756 million for federal and state 
land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of these bills would allocate about half of the total  
spending for ``impact assistance'' from offshore oil drilling. 
Under Young's bill, Louisiana alone would get $360 million, nearly 
the total earmarked for federal land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have criticized the bills because of fear the  
potential windfall might prompt states and local communities to 
push for increased oil development at the expense of other wildlife 
protection and land acquisition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is heavily tilted to offshore oil producing states,'' said  
Babbitt. ``That's something that needs to be bargained about.'' 
Young counters that he's only trying to ``resolve the inequities'' 
in how revenue from offshore oil drilling -- which would pay for the 
programs -- is distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists, meanwhile, have lined up behind legislation  
offered by Miller and Boxer that would pump $2.3 billion into 
conservation spending, including $900 million for federal and state 
land purchases. They would prohibit favoring states with oil 
drilling and putting more money into park restoration, farmland 
preservation and endangered species protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite opposition to all the bills from some property rights  
groups, Miller said he wants to avoid ``sniping at each other's 
bills or motives'' and work on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a solid base to begin working cooperatively,'' agreed  
Young.

<HEADLINE> Results Same for Norman at Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- This time, he was patient. This time, he was  
prudent. And purposeful, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, the result was the pretty much the same  
</P>
<P>
	Greg Norman said he didn't believe in destiny. Over and over,  
through all four days of the Masters, he kept insisting what's done 
was done. To prove the point, he went out and showed he could play 
Augusta National differently from the way he had every time before. 
</P>
<P>
	He still lost, finishing close enough to the man for whom the  
green jacket was destined to know his measurements by heart. On 
this day, it was slipped over the shoulders of Jose Maria Olazabal. 
Three years ago, it was Nick Faldo. Nearly a decade before that, 
the names were Larry Mize and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	What has changed over the years, Norman said one more time  
Sunday, is his perspective on the losses. Shoulder surgery sent him 
to the sideline for nearly a year. He rediscovered his family and 
his motivation, and found the calm that a hectic schedule and the 
pressures of competing had kept hidden all these years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that leaderboard,'' Norman said after finishing two  
strokes behind Olazabal and one back of Davis Love III. ``There's 
probably a lot of other guys who can sit here and say they're 
heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
	``But don't make a mountain of a molehill on this one.''  
</P>
<P>
	If Norman arrived at Augusta no longer tortured by his past, he  
has to be leaving it -- brave words aside -- with some lingering 
concerns about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	Climbing into contention in his first major back must be  
satisfying, especially given the long and painful rehabilitation. 
Finding a new way to lose, though, has to be gnawing away at his 
assured new self. 
</P>
<P>
	He was tied for the lead at 7 under when he stepped onto the  
14th tee Sunday and he bogeyed that hole and the next. But let's be 
clear: Norman didn't collapse. No single flaw in his game proved 
fatal. He didn't fire at sucker pin positions and he didn't pull 
the wrong club from his bag. He didn't put too much spin on his 
approach shots at the wrong holes or make a loose swing in a tight 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	He proved adaptable. Even though Norman made eagle at No. 13, a  
par-5 of 485 yards, by going for the green in two, he showed enough 
maturity to play No. 15, a par-5 of 500 yards, as a three-shot 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy wound up backfiring when he hit his approach shot  
into the right bunker, then exploded to 12 feet and missed the par 
putt when the ball curled on the lip and spun out. And his 
explanation for the wedge shot that found the right greenside 
bunker at No. 15 was the only time all day he sounded like the old 
Norman -- the one who never lacked for an alibi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had mud on the ball, it was 94 yards, and I tried to squeeze  
a sand wedge in there,'' he said. ``The ball seemed to sail a 
little bit right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On some other day, against someone less opportunistic than  
Olazabal, Norman might have gotten away with it. He started the day 
two strokes behind, shot 1-over 73 to Olazabal's 71, on a day when 
only seven players in the entire field broke par. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he deserves the jacket as much as anybody else,'' the  
Spaniard said. ``When we were in the scoring tent, I said, `I 
really enjoyed your company today. Just keep on trying. You have 
the game and you deserve the jacket. Hopefully, you will get it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That same scene, with a different cast of characters, played  
itself out all day long. One after another, Norman's fellow pros 
fell out of contention and came to the interview room after their 
rounds were complete to say he was now the guy they were rooting 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the horrible collapse of 1996, when Norman  
squandered a six-stroke lead. But what made even the toughest of 
his competitors reach out to him then is the same bit of his 
character that made them do so again on this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For lack of another word, call it grace -- a quality that hadn't  
been observed around Norman until that humbling loss three years 
ago. Before that, he made excuses when he lost, he was arrogant and 
not beyond flaunting his wealth. Sometimes, in private, he unfairly 
trashed reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	Grace is a funny thing that way. Lose it once, and usually it's  
gone forever. Now that Norman has it in his grasp, he'd better hold 
on tight. He said after 1996 that he was certain all those freakish 
losses had been a test for something, though he didn't know what. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspicion is that he was being tested, all right, by losing  
over and over until he got it right. On Sunday, he aced the exam. 
All that remains to be learned is whether it's his destiny to do it 
over and over.

<HEADLINE> Judge Finds Clinton in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge found President Clinton  
in contempt of court Monday for giving ``intentionally false'' 
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, imposing a 
historic judicial rebuke on a chief executive who survived 
congressional impeachment just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians said they believed Clinton was the first president to  
face such a penalty, a lasting stigma that could also force him to 
pay tens of thousands of dollars more to Paula Jones beyond the 
$850,000 he paid to settle her sexual harassment claims. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright imposed a civil rather  
than a criminal penalty for Clinton's testimony in the Jones case, 
ordering him to pay Mrs. Jones ``any reasonable expenses including 
attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to obey this court's 
discovery orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also ordered the president to pay $1,202 as  
reimbursement for the judge's travel in the case, and set in motion 
a legal process that could strip Clinton of his Arkansas law 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that  
the president responded to plaintiff's questions by giving false, 
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the 
judicial process,'' Wright wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said she would delay enforcement for 30 days to give  
Clinton an opportunity to ask for a hearing or to appeal. One 
option is for him to use his legal defense fund, which has raised 
$4.5 million, to pay the sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	John Whitehead, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said the legal  
expenses could be ``tens of thousands of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all the expenses related to seven lawyers who  
attended the deposition -- air fares, the time spent there, the time 
preparing, meals, and what we believe was the cause and effect of 
the whole thing,'' said Whitehead, who runs a conservative legal 
group that paid some of Mrs. Jones' bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as relatively light since 
the judge had the option of citing the president for criminal 
contempt. But the lawyers were keeping options open until they 
learned how large a monetary penalty Mrs. Jones might seek. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will have no comment until I have had the opportunity of  
reviewing this matter fully,'' said Robert Bennett, the private 
lawyer who represented Clinton in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, a public reminder of the Lewinsky controversy at a  
time when national interest has turned to Kosovo and other matters, 
came just two months after the Senate voted to acquit Clinton of 
impeachment charges that grew out of the relationship and his 
denials of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, the Arkansas Republican who was one of the  
House prosecutors in the impeachment trial, said a ``nonpartisan 
and nonpolitical judge'' had found the president had willfully 
disobeyed court orders to be truthful and ``I have to underline the 
'willful' part of her ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose  
investigation prompted the impeachment effort, declined comment 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitehead said the ruling was ``a vindication'' for his client  
and the first time ``where the president was actually held 
accountable in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is believed to be the first chief executive to be found  
in civil contempt while in office, according to Robert Dallek, a 
historian at Boston University. ``It's not going to help Bill 
Clinton's historical reputation,'' Dallek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, a Bush-appointed Republican and a former law student of  
Clinton's, said in her ruling, ``The court takes no pleasure 
whatsoever in holding this nation's president in contempt of 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said her decision to dismiss the Jones case a year ago  
would not have changed, even if the president had been ``truthful 
with respect to his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal, but then she settled the case  
by accepting an $850,000 payment from Clinton. She alleged that 
Clinton, as Arkansas governor, made an unwanted sexual advance in a 
Little Rock hotel room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Mrs. Jones was entitled to information regarding any  
state or federal employee with whom the president had or proposed 
to have sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton said: ``I have  
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the president's DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms.  
Lewinsky, he acknowledged an ``inappropriate intimate 
relationship'' with her before a federal grand jury last Aug. 17 -- 
and again in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also is the judge who sent Susan McDougal, one of  
Clinton's Whitewater partners, to jail for 18 months for refusing 
to answer grand jury questions in Kenneth Starr's inquiry. The 
contempt ruling came the same day that a jury acquitted Mrs. 
McDougal of obstruction of justice and deadlocked on two contempt 
of court charges in a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In her decision Monday, the judge wrote, ``It is difficult to  
construe the president's sworn statements ... as anything other 
than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding  
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally 
false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in 
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally 
false,'' said the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	She directed Mrs. Jones' lawyers to submit a statement of their  
expenses and fees within 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton decides not respond, the court will enter an order  
setting out the time and manner by which Clinton has to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the payment to Mrs. Jones, Clinton must reimburse  
the court for the judge's travel expenses in going to Washington at 
Clinton's request to preside over ``his tainted deposition'' on 
Jan. 17, 1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she will refer the matter to the Arkansas  
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct to review any 
disciplinary action it thinks is appropriate, including action 
against Clinton's law license. She noted the Model Rules of 
Professional Conduct deem it misconduct for a lawyer to engage in 
conduct involving ``dishonesty, fraud, deceit or 
misrepresentation.''

<HEADLINE> British Colonial Plans Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Britain's new effort to modernize a holdover from the days of  
empire -- laws that its colonies have kept unchanged for more than 
100 years -- is firing up a rebellion among some of the queen's 
not-so-loyal subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a formal proposal in March, London said its 13 remaining  
colonies must scrap the death penalty, drop laws against 
homosexuality and end secretive banking rules if they want the 
prestige and security of remaining British. 
</P>
<P>
	``The churches will have an uproar,'' Chief Minister Ralph  
O'Neal of the British Virgin Islands says of the demand that the 
colonies scrap laws making homosexual sex a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	And rather than dropping the death penalty, which hasn't been  
used in years because of Britain's resistance, he wants to extend 
it to include drug traffickers. ``Those are the people who have no 
regard for life,'' he argues. 
</P>
<P>
	London's demands smack of ``a form of imperialism,'' O'Neal  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest reaction has been in Bermuda, where some people  
suggested the island might be better off going it alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a referendum to decide whether or not the country  
wants to be tied to the United Kingdom,'' former Premier Pamela 
Gordon says. ``If not, then the only choice would be 
independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time in years such a notion has been given  
serious thought in Bermuda -- the oldest colony since it was settled 
in 1609 by Britons headed for Virginia and thrown off course by a 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most populated colony, with 60,000 people, has grown  
wealthier per capita than Britain by encouraging ``offshore 
banking,'' locally based banks that offer foreigners secretive 
refuges for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussions about the colonial relationship, Britain's  
colonies had been pushing for more autonomy and more aid -- 
especially Caribbean islands that three centuries ago were cash 
cows for the British Empire through a sugar industry manned by 
slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	One welcome proposal in the colonial blueprint presented to  
Britain's Parliament in March was the offer to rescind the 
second-class citizenship that was forced on the colonies to prevent 
an influx of immigrants into Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Britain is ready to return  
without conditions the full citizenship rights revoked in 1981 for 
its colonies -- from Anguilla in the Caribbean to St. Helena halfway 
between Africa and South America to the Pitcairn Islands in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, fearing mass migration among Hong Kong's 6.4 million  
people ahead of the island's handover to China, Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's government made people in the colonies 
``British subjects'' and stripped them of the automatic right to 
live and work in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	That caused a ``strong sense of grievance,'' Cook noted, not  
least because Thatcher excluded Gibraltar and the Falklands -- the 
only colonies with overwhelmingly white populations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook still had a hard time getting Prime Minister Tony Blair's  
Cabinet to agree to his proposal. There are concerns that Hong Kong 
residents could sue for similar rights, and fears of an influx from 
the 148,000 black British subjects in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook argued such fears are unfounded.  
</P>
<P>
	The change will give colonial residents ``the right to travel  
freely throughout the European Union, and will enable their young 
people to support themselves through work experience while they 
study in Britain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That has been most welcomed by the 6,000 people on St. Helena,  
which has high unemployment, and those from Montserrat, a Caribbean 
island abandoned by most of its 12,000 people because of an active 
volcano. The two islands are the only colonies that still receive 
British aid. 
</P>
<P>
	For most opponents of Britain's proposal, the major sticking  
point is London's insistence that its colonies meet the standards 
of international organizations to which Britain belongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, we require changes in the law in a minority of  
overseas territories which retain corporal punishment and 
criminalize consensual homosexual acts in private,'' Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the islands' local governments do not comply, Britain will  
change their laws for them, he said. ``We are committed to seeing 
it is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said that includes abolishing the death penalty and  
tightening regulation of offshore banking, which has become the 
lifeblood of Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the shadowy offshore banks contend billions of  
dollars in illicit drug profits are ``laundered'' through those 
operations every year. 
</P>
<P>
	The islands say they have strengthened supervision of the  
industry. But Cook wants them to force the highly secretive 
offshore banks to open their books to foreign investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda's government had to fight hard last year to stay off a  
blacklist of questionable offshore jurisdictions being compiled by 
the multinational Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	And with offshore banking contributing to one of the highest per  
capita annual incomes in the world -- $36,000 -- London's demands 
could drive Bermudans to forsake British citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda's premier, Jennifer Smith, says she finds ``nothing  
threatening'' in Britain's plan but wants to study the demand for 
the abolishment of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	But a legislator from her party, John Barritt, says he may have  
to reconsider his opposition to independence. ``For me, it amounts 
to a reassertion of the parent-child relationship,'' he says.

<HEADLINE>  Bosnian Croat Suspects Go On Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Two top Bosnian Croat war crimes  
suspects went on trial today, charged with commanding troops who 
carried out a bloody ethnic purge of Muslims from central Bosnia in 
1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dario Kordic and Mario Cerkez were being tried together before  
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. U.N. prosecutors allege they were 
responsible for the slayings of at least 100 defenseless civilians 
in a bloody campaign to drive all Muslims out of the Lasva River 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	They face up to life imprisonment if convicted of even one of  
the 22 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity lodged 
against them. Both men insist they are innocent, and Kordic's 
lawyers issued a statement today expressing confidence ``that when 
all the evidence has been heard, justice will be done and he will 
be found innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is significant because it focuses on so-called  
``command responsibility'' -- the extent to which a leader can be 
held accountable for failing to prevent or punish atrocities 
committed by subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribunal prosecutors say troops under the command of Kordic --  
the most senior of the two suspects -- murdered men, women and 
children and torched, shelled or dynamited their houses and 
mosques. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Ahmici, one of those hardest hit by the purge,  
``the village was turned red by the flames which burned its houses 
and the blood of its people,'' prosecutor Geoffrey Nice said in his 
opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kordic stared blankly as the prosecution laid out its case,  
while Cerkez occasionally took notes. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least part of the time, Kordic was the head of the  
central Bosnian branch of the Croatian Democratic Union, which 
controlled both civilian and military aspects of Bosnian Croat 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerkez was commander of the Croatian Defense Council brigade,  
based in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, which was actively 
involved in the campaign of persecution and terror, according to 
the men's 1995 indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long the trial would last. Kordic and  
Cerkez surrendered themselves to the U.N. court in 1997 and have 
been held since then in the tribunal's high-security detention 
cells outside The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal was set up by the Security Council in 1993 to bring  
to justice those responsible for atrocities in the wars that 
followed the breakup of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Plans N.Y. Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to make several  
stops in New York, from Long Island to Niagara Falls, so she can 
gauge what a Senate campaign in the state might be like, an adviser 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is considering running for the Senate seat being  
vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The race 
could pit her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is 
also thinking of running. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Republican announced the formation of an  
exploratory committee that will allow him more freedom in raising 
and spending money in anticipation of a possible Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's New York trip begins next Monday with a speech  
at Columbia University in New York City followed by a fund-raising 
event to benefit Rep. Jerrold Nadler. The Manhattan Democrat was 
one of President Clinton's biggest supporters during his 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton heads to Long Island for a visit to  
Hofstra University. That night, she is back in New York City for a 
speech at a $250-a-person fund-raising dinner for the United Jewish 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the schedule is a speech Thursday to the annual  
convention of the politically powerful New York State United 
Teachers Union in Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	That appearance will put her in the Buffalo area in the midst of  
the eight-day ``Operation Save America'' anti-abortion protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, a top adviser to Mrs. Clinton and a veteran of the  
New York political scene, said the trip should help give the first 
lady a sense of what a New York campaign would be like. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll be more press, more people taking to her and so I  
think she'll come away with a much better feel about the intensity 
of the situation,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York  
Republican, said Mrs. Clinton's planned appearance in May at a 
fund-raiser for Rep. Nita Lowey, a Democrat who has said she would 
run if the first lady does not, is an indication Mrs. Clinton will 
not run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes said he still doesn't expect any decision from Mrs.  
Clinton on the Senate race until sometime this summer, at the 
earliest.

<HEADLINE> Disney's Challenger: Universal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With four theme parks, 17 resorts, three  
water parks and two nightlife venues, Walt Disney World is the 
undisputed champion of Orlando tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	But a strong challenger is Seagram's Universal Studios Escape,  
formerly known as Universal Studios Florida, newly muscled with a 
second theme park, a new nightlife complex, a hotel under 
construction and a recently acquired water park. 
</P>
<P>
	With next month's opening of Islands of Adventure, Universal's  
second theme park, the battle for customers in the nation's largest 
tourist market promises to be a bruising fight. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing the new Universal park during a recent  
dress-rehearsal tour, Scott Meyer, an Orlando retiree with season 
passes to both Disney and Universal, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time Disney got chopped down a bit. They were uppity. Now  
they have competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Islands of Adventure in May; the debut of  
CityWalk, Universal's restaurant and club complex this winter; the 
recent acquisition of Wet 'n Wild in Orlando, the nation's busiest 
water park; and the addition of the soon-to-be finished Portofino 
Bay Hotel transforms Universal from merely a theme park into a 
destination resort. And one that offers visitors a multiday 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The new additions give Universal's visitors something that  
Disney has offered its guests for two decades: a self-contained 
world that doesn't require tourists to ever leave the property. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you have a reason to go for two or three days. It's a  
total resort,'' says Cathy Nichols, chairwoman and chief executive 
officer of Universal Studios Recreation Group, which oversees 
Universal's theme parks in California, Florida and one under 
construction in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion Islands of Adventure has 20 attractions and is  
divided into five sections. The child-oriented Seuss Landing has 
characters from the children's books; Toon Lagoon is based on 
popular comic strips; the thrill rides-filled Marvel Super Hero 
Island and The Lost Continent have attractions based on myths; and 
Jurassic Park is an animatronic-filled area based on the Steven 
Spielberg film. 
</P>
<P>
	Islands of Adventure provides the Orlando theme park market with  
something it has lacked: high-speed roller coasters in the form of 
The Hulk Coaster and Dueling Dragons rides. Fans of 
toss-up-your-lunch coaster rides previously had to travel 80 miles 
to Tampa's Busch Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Universal's new venues hasn't been without its  
problems. Universal recently fired CityWalk's general contractor, 
Baker Mellon Stuart Construction, and filed a lawsuit alleging the 
company missed deadlines. The contractor filed a breach of contract 
countersuit and filed a lien for $16 million against CityWalk, 
alleging Universal still owes it money. 
</P>
<P>
	With 30,000 acres and 50,000 employees, Disney will still be the  
800-pound gorilla of tourism in Orlando, which as a community 
attracts roughly 40 million visitors a year. But the expansion at 
Universal, which now has 2,640 acres and will have 16,000 employees 
by the summer, does mean stiffer competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Although officials at Walt Disney World claim they're not  
worried about the increased competition, Disney plans to open later 
this year its first fast-speed roller coaster ride, Rock 'n Roller 
Coaster. It recently opened the thrill-intensive Test Track ride, 
which recreates an automaker's proving ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I am more threatened by competition from Las Vegas  
or potentially the cruise industry ... or travel to Australia,'' 
says Judson Green, chairman of Walt Disney Attractions, the 
division responsible for the entertainment giant's theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will their park take a little attendance away from us? Yeah,  
it might,'' he says. ``But in the big picture, frankly, it just 
makes central Florida all the more attractive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nichols sees Disney and Universal as two very different  
brands. ``Disney owns early childhood. We want that 
8-year-old-and-above audience,'' she says. ``We don't need to beat 
Disney. We're just looking for at least two days of your 
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combined attendance at Disney's four Florida theme parks (the  
Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios and Animal Kingdom) 
reached an estimated 41.5 million visitors last year. Universal's 
single Florida theme park last year had an estimated 8.9 million 
visitors. Universal officials expect Islands of Adventure to 
surpass that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Vickie Singer, executive vice president of Adventure Vacations,  
a Hunt Valley, Md., tour operator that last year booked 150,000 
visitors to Orlando, doesn't think tourists will choose one theme 
park resort over the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families save a long time to pay for airfare and hotels, so  
when they come here, they'll want to see both places,'' Mrs. Singer 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian snowbirds Richard and Anne Kwiatkowski thought  
otherwise after visiting Islands of Adventure during a dress 
rehearsal. With its thrill rides and sharp humor, the Universal 
park is edgier than the saccharine Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will give Disney a run for its money,'' says Kwiatkowski,  
a Disney shareholder from Woodstock, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Universal piggybacked off Disney marketing and  
advertising that brought tourists to Orlando. Universal would then 
poach visitors through local advertising. That has all changed with 
Universal embarking on a multimillion-dollar international 
advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition against Disney could heat up further in the near  
future. SeaWorld Florida, Orlando's third major player in the theme 
park market, will unveil its plans for a new park later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	And late last year, Universal purchased an additional 1,900  
acres of nearby land. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got land for as many theme parks as we want,'' Ms.  
Nichols says.

<HEADLINE> Do You Need Home Networking? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like fashion, personal computing has its fads. And the latest  
fad to come prancing down the silicon runway is home networking. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks are wiring schemes that link computers and allow them  
to share peripherals and software. They first appeared in 
businesses and came in two flavors: LANs (Local Area Networks) that 
link computers within a room or a building, for example; and WANs 
(Wide Area Networks) that link computers in different buildings, 
even in various parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel jumped on the bandwagon in early April by introducing  
Anypoint Home Network, a pair of widgets that use ordinary 
telephone wiring to link two PCs on a network with data rates of up 
to one megabit per second. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's offering and the accompanying software cost $189 --  
almost twice as much as the $99.95 HomeFree, a similar package from 
Diamond Multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both packages support the Home Phoneline Network standard, which  
allows the phone line to be used for a voice call while it's being 
used by the PCs. The difference is that Diamond's product is a pair 
of PCI add-on cards, while Intel's is a free-standing unit with its 
own power supply. It connects through the parallel port. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're uncomfortable about opening your PC case, Intel gets  
the nod. If not, check out the Diamond product. (Intel also has a 
PCI card entry, which costs $79 for a single card vs. $49.95 for 
Diamond's.) 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the possible benefits of home networking are few for  
most people. Promoters will say, for example, that it's cheaper for 
two computers to share a printer. But with excellent inkjets 
available for less than $200, that's hardly a compelling argument. 
The high data transfer rate makes it easy to transfer files, say 
promoters. True, but for most of us, a floppy disk will do. 
</P>
<P>
	Another use touted is multiplayer games, the kind now played on  
the Internet. The idea of several family members, each in a 
different room, playing ``together'' via a network is something 
best left for sociologists to ponder. It's just not the same as 
playing a board game on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, promoters point to shared Internet access. And there,  
if you have a cable modem or other high-speed Internet access, they 
have a point. But that's a subset of a subset -- by the end of the 
year, it's expected that only about 17 percent of U.S. homes will 
have more than one PC, according to the Yankee Group research firm. 
And cable modems and other high-speed Internet connections are 
available, but hardly ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
	That's for home use, which is what promoters are pitching. But  
the folks who ought to be rushing to buy these devices aren't Mom 
and Pop, but the thousands of small businesses that could benefit 
from networking their office PCs. From the business perspective, 
these phone-line-based networks are cheap, reliable, and easy to 
install and maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Real-estate offices, small newspapers, brokerage firms, law  
offices and others could reap immediate benefits from being 
networked, including having a single high-speed Internet connection 
available to all. If those businesses don't check out these 
offerings, they're not paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Some caveats: Diamond Multimedia wants to see PCs that have at  
least 16 megabytes of RAM and run Windows 95 or 98, while Intel 
will cruise on eight megabytes of RAM. So that pretty much bags any 
thoughts of dusting off that old 386 in the attic and networking it 
with the new Pentium. And the network likes to find less than 500 
feet of phone wire, which isn't a problem for most homes and small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Diamond Multimedia and Intel products are widely available  
at retail, and also on the Web.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Signs Jeffers to Offer Sheet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers signed Dallas  
Cowboys restricted free agent wide receiver Patrick Jeffers to an 
offer sheet Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers would not reveal terms of the offer, and Jeffers'  
agent, Brad Blank, said only that it was a one-year deal ``for 
mostly a signing bonus and then there's a base salary.'' Blank said 
he and the Panthers had agreed not to disclose the financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas has until Saturday's NFL draft to decide whether to match  
the Panthers' offer. If the Cowboys elect against matching, they 
would receive Carolina's fifth-round selection in the draft as 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Jeffers had 18 receptions for 330 yards and two  
touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffers would add depth to Carolina's receiving corps, which  
includes likely starters Rae Carruth and Muhsin Muhammad as well as 
second-year reserves Donald Hayes and Jim Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers cut Mark Carrier, their career receptions leader,  
earlier this month. Unrestricted free agent Raghib Ismail, who led 
Carolina in receptions last season, has agreed to a contract with 
the Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> IBM, RealNetworks Offer Online Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM joined with software maker RealNetworks  
today to deliver CD-quality music over the Internet to computer 
users, intensifying IBM's challenge to a rival effort by Microsoft 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is testing a system this spring that combines its technology  
with RealNetworks software, which already is used by more than 55 
million people to play music, listen to radio and watch video 
clips. The new system targets computer users who get Internet 
access across telephone lines, the most common avenue to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for its part, is expected to announce a deal on  
Tuesday for its own system for delivering music over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks' stock soared as much as 14 percent this morning.  
It was up $25.50 a share at $233 in midmorning trading on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. IBM was down $4.31 1/4 at $182 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM already is testing technology that, in conjunction with five  
leading record companies, lets people with high-speed Internet 
access over cable-TV lines to record albums off the Internet. The 
test is part of an industry effort to develop security standards 
for digital music sales, while battling technology that lets people 
easily download free and often illegally copied songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales represent just a tiny fraction of the $12  
billion music industry. Major record companies hope to outdo the 
music pirates by offering better-quality sound and greater choice.

<HEADLINE> Bifocal Contacts Pushed for Boomers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tired of bifocal glasses, those telltale signs  
of aging that force you to look down to read and up to see far 
away? Johnson &AMP; Johnson is launching a huge campaign to urge aging 
baby boomers to try bifocal contact lenses instead, promising 
consistently clear vision near and far. 
</P>
<P>
	A few other companies sell bifocal contact lenses, but few of  
the 89 million Americans who need bifocal vision correction have 
tried them -- or know they exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eye care providers were not suggesting them to people because  
we never had faith they would work,'' said optometrist Thomas Quinn 
of Athens, Ohio. Now that he's suggesting Johnson &AMP; Johnson's new 
Acuvue bifocal contacts, ``patients' first reaction is surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testing the Acuvue, Quinn said about 70 percent of his  
patients had successful bifocal vision correction. He said older 
bifocal contacts had about a 25 percent success rate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Acuvue is not for everyone, both Quinn and the Food and  
Drug Administration cautioned Monday. It seems to work best on mild 
to moderate bifocal vision problems, said FDA ophthalmic devices 
chief Dr. James Saviola. Quinn said people who have problems with 
night vision may not be good candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	As people age, the eye's lens gradually loses its flexibility to  
change visual focus from near to far. One of the first symptoms of 
this ``presbyopia'' is difficulty reading, forcing people to hold 
books at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms typically begin around age 40. Even people with perfect  
vision in their youth by their 40s and 50s at least need reading 
glasses that they take off to see at a distance. Others use bifocal 
glasses, or even try ``monovision,'' putting a contact lens for 
near vision in one eye and one for far vision in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	A few companies make bifocal contacts with special near and far  
vision zones. But only about 1 percent of presbyopics wear contact 
lenses, the vast majority of whom wear monovision contacts, Johnson 
&AMP; Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acuvue bifocals consist of five concentric rings that alternate  
in correcting near or far vision, called the ``Pupil Intelligent'' 
system. Look through them, and the eye automatically adjusts to see 
near or far, J&AMP;J says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're presenting the lens in such a way that light is  
focused, both for distance and near vision, at the back of the eye 
simultaneously in a way companies haven't before,'' explained FDA's 
Saviola. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the Acuvue provides a little clearer vision than  
some older competitors, Saviola said, but he cautioned that people 
with demanding visual tasks may still get crisper vision from 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA actually approved the Acuvue bifocals two years ago, but  
J&AMP;J only test marketed them in a handful of cities until last 
summer. The FDA hadn't required the company to prove how well 
Acuvue corrects vision, so the test marketing to gauged doctor and 
patient satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said optometrists must be trained to properly fit the  
bifocal. Instead of eye exams done in a darkened room testing one 
eye at a time, the Acuvue requires testing in a lighted room with 
both eyes open. J&AMP;J began optometrist training in July, and on 
Tuesday begins telling consumers, in a campaign that includes 
nationwide TV ads, that the lenses now are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn says a year's supply costs about $300, plus he charges  
about $200 for the eye exam and fitting. A pair of quality bifocal 
glasses, in contrast, costs about $300, he said.

<HEADLINE> Beavers Threaten Cherry Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A second beaver was nabbed Sunday amid  
Washington's blooming cherry trees, but a trapper spotted a third 
one near where the gnawing rodents have toppled the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an official sighting,'' said Julia Long, National Park  
Service biological sciences technician. ``My trappers this morning 
saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michele Adcock Gann, office manager at Adcock's Trapping  
Service, said the company's employees who retrieved the trapped 
beaver spotted the third animal near the Tidal Basin between the 
Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service called in the College Park, Md.,  
company to catch the little rascals, who have been busy as beavers 
at the height of the capital's cherry blossom season. Their 
activities have made them a strong secondary draw to residents and 
tourists in town to view the banks of white and pink blossoms of 
the Yoshino cherry trees. 
</P>
<P>
	John Adcock Jr., whose father owns the trapping service, said  
the beaver caught Sunday appears to be a yearling. ``It's in very 
good health. He's pretty mellow at this point, not agitated, seems 
pretty comfortable,'' Adcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first one trapped, early Saturday, was an adult female, he  
said. The third one may be the female's mate and father of the 
smaller animal, which is about half the size of the female, Adcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service's Long said it is possible the three constitute  
a family group. Beaver families live together in dam-like lodges in 
water, which Long said they could have been trying to construct at 
the Tidal Basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they began gnawing on April 1, she said the beavers have  
felled or damaged 14 trees. Four cherries, five white cedars and 
one holly have been brought down, and four larger cherry trees have 
been damaged. Two are severely damaged and might not survive, Long 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's capture was in front of a National Park Service  
structure beside the Tidal Basin. The female was trapped Saturday 
near the Jefferson Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Traps used are designed not to harm the beavers. The Park  
Service said they will be reunited in an undisclosed location where 
trees are less famous. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Gaumer at the National Park Service office on the National  
Mall said he had mixed feelings about trapping the beavers, 
although he realizes why it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want the cherry trees damaged,'' he said. But, on  
the other hand, ``it's nice sometimes to see wildlife in the 
area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say bite marks and other damage to some 30 trees have  
appeared in the area since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bank Puts Money Behind Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- These days, sports and corporate sponsorship are  
as American as, well, baseball and hot dogs. Airlines, brewers and 
computer companies have all spent big bucks to get their names on 
stadiums and ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a bank is putting its money behind baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Fleet Financial Group has become an official sponsor of Major  
League Baseball and the 1999 All-Star game, to be played in Boston 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Announced at Fenway Park on Monday, the sponsorship comes a  
month after Fleet detailed plans to merge with BankBoston, becoming 
the nation's eighth-largest bank and New England's dominant lender. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball agreement, however, does not mean that the All-Star  
game will be named after the bank. The rights to that moniker 
belong to Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 other corporations have some form of sponsorship with  
baseball, but Fleet is the first bank among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the sponsorship were not disclosed, and bank officials  
declined to give even a ``ballpark'' figure. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship helps cement the bank's presence in New England  
and give it a broader advertising reach across the country -- one it 
plan to use to full marketing advantage, bank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a capacity that we didn't have before. It gives  
us a reach we certainly didn't have before,'' said Anne Finucane, 
Fleet's senior vice president for corporate marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship strengthens the bank's ties to baseball. Last  
year, Fleet arranged $425 million in financing for baseball. Fleet 
has relationships with 12 major league teams, including the Red Sox 
and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't be better for Fleet, marketing specialists  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's a lot of questionable press about the  
Fleet-BankBoston merger and what the effect is going to be on the 
New England economy,'' said Kathleen Brewer Doran, a professor of 
marketing at Babson College in Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really what they're going after here in my opinion is a chance  
to prove their roots in the Boston market,'' she said. ``If the 
All-Star game were going to be in San Diego, there's no way they 
would have done this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsorship also gives them some national clout, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank plans an advertising blitz -- both inside and outside  
ballparks -- with the theme, ``Fleet keeps baseball going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who played a brief game of  
catch with Fleet chairman Terrence Murray, also will serve as a 
bank spokesman.

situation and decided to put to rest the institutional void created 
by the sudden death of (President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara),'' 
Djibrila said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses and diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said  
members of the Presidential Guard repeatedly shot Bare with a 
truck-mounted large-caliber machine gun as he crossed the tarmac at 
Niamey's airport Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite widespread knowledge of the assassination, state radio  
continued to insist that he died in an ``unfortunate accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new government ordered the Supreme Court and National  
Assembly dissolved, the constitution suspended, February's local 
elections annulled and what amounted to a complete ouster of the 
former regime. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few indications, though, whether the military  
government would eventually allow democratic elections. Bare also 
seized power promising polls; he was confirmed as president a few 
months later in elections widely seen as fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the exact motives for Bare's death remain unclear, he  
was not a popular figure. The army coup he led three years ago 
ousted Niger's first democratically elected government. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare's mismanagement, nepotism and failure to pay salaries to  
soldiers and bureaucrats had alienated him from Niger's civilians 
and its military. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he faced down repeated military mutinies and protests by  
students and civil servants, and earned the wrath of the opposition 
by imprisoning some of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare's death followed a week of increasing tension in Niger,  
with the opposition calling for his resignation, accusing his 
government of orchestrating attacks against polling workers 
tallying results from February's regional and municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the new military regime, the news was greeted with  
guarded optimism on the streets of the capital, Niamey, where Bare 
was deeply disliked. 
</P>
<P>
	The stability offered by the new government and the end to  
Bare's regime was enough to give many of the people of Niger -- a 
deeply destitute nation of 9.7 million inhabitants -- a little bit 
of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation was so chaotic, so this was good,'' said Ali  
Moudaha, a university student in Niamey. ``People have been wanting 
their salaries, students have been wanting their scholarships. 
That's why you saw no reaction from the public to the president's 
killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, in a funeral ceremony in Bare's home village,  
the late president's flag-draped wood coffin was hoisted aloft and 
carried into a simple tomb in his personal compound by an honor 
guard of silver-helmeted firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of soldiers in red berets stood at attention and top  
military leaders, government officials, opposition politicians and 
diplomats turned out for the funeral in Doumega, 185 miles east of 
Niamey. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the military brass conspicuously absent from Bare's  
funeral was Wanke -- although dozens of his colleagues were in 
attendance.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WILKESBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Firefighters battled more than a dozen  
wildfires Monday that burned 1,000 acres across dry and windy 
western North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wilkes County the winds revived fires that burned 500 acres  
over the weekend, forcing the evacuation of 60 homes Monday. One 
firefighter went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing right now is protecting the structures and  
trying to make sure none of the houses get burned,'' said Lt. Mike 
Cardwell of the Wilkes County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen wildfires of various sizes burned in the Nantahala and  
Pisgah national forests and other counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service officials said more than 300 firefighters were  
attempting to put out the fires, with fresh crews scheduled to 
arrive Monday night and Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Five helicopters and three air tankers dropped water and  
retardant on the flames to slow their spread, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breezy conditions were forecast through Tuesday, with rain  
forecast to arrive by Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Writers Wrestle With Hemingway Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fitting for an all-star, centennial tribute to  
Ernest Hemingway, guests were served Spanish olives, Cuban 
guacamole and Key West clams. Fitting, too, for this famously blunt 
writer, that attendees were not always polite about the man they'd 
come to honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrician.'' ``Mannered and coy.'' ``Terrifyingly  
misogynist.'' From Nadine Gordimer to Derek Walcott to E. Annie 
Proulx, writers gathered over the weekend at the John F. Kennedy 
Library made clear that admiring Hemingway doesn't mean admiring 
everything about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Hemingway's own son, Patrick, managed to embarrass his  
dad's memory by informing a crowded banquet hall that the great 
writer suffered from hemorrhoids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, Ernie's a big guy; he can take it,'' the  
library's curator, Stephen Plotkin, said Sunday. ``There is stuff 
to criticize and that's fine. It's not going to knock him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway, who killed himself in 1961, would have turned 100  
this July. He is well remembered. Guests included four Nobelists: 
Gordimer, Walcott, Saul Bellow and Kenzaburo Oe. Also speaking were 
such prize-winning writers as Proulx, Chinua Achebe, Peter 
Matthiessen, Robert Stone, Tobias Wolff, Robert Coles and Robert 
Shacochis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mostly unsentimental event, despite the presence of  
several Hemingway family members. Even as he was celebrated during 
two days of speeches and panel discussions, few pretended the late 
Nobel laureate was easy to get along with or that all of his books 
were of Nobel quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Walcott, who likened Hemingway's influence to that of  
Shakespeare and Dante, still found that his later work suffered 
from ``deserted joy'' and that its tone became ``patrician.'' 
Novelist Leslie Epstein said that Hemingway, when not at his best, 
could be ``mannered and coy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proulx thought the women in his work tended to be ``dummies''  
and novelist Francine Prose cited the ``appalling quality of many 
of his female characters.'' She criticized his famous short story, 
``The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,'' in which a wife 
shoots her husband on safari in Africa, as ``one of the nastiest 
stories ever written'' and ``terrifyingly misogynist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Achebe, a Nigerian writer, said he forgot all about ``Francis  
Macomber'' after reading it because he couldn't relate to any of 
the characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is full of people who will forget stories in which  
they are beside the point,'' said the author of ``Things Fall 
Apart'' and other novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordimer, Saturday's keynote speaker, was especially tough on  
him. She praised him as a major 20th century writer, but found 
passages in the novel ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' highly contrived, 
questioned why he didn't write about American blacks and thought he 
showed little interest in the people of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ernest Hemingway was in love with Africa and as with others in  
such a state of emotion ... he constructed for himself, according 
to his needs and desires, something that had little relation to the 
reality of the continent,'' said Gordimer, a native South African. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I won't offend anyone with heresy when I say that  
Hemingway never had both feet down on Africa,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gordimer urged the audience to leave his private life  
private, some panelists couldn't resist anecdotes about his macho 
persona. Paris Review editor George Plimpton, who met Hemingway in 
the '50s, remembered suggesting an interview. His idea was to have 
the writer revisit his old hangouts in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he interrupted me in the middle of all this and said,  
`That's the worst goddamned idea!''' Plimpton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellow told a story about a mutual friend, author Josephine  
Herbst, who once went out to sea with her husband and Hemingway, 
only to have Hemingway amuse himself by shooting at some sharks and 
then pointing the gun at her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said he aimed his gun several times at the husband,''  
Bellow recalled, ``and then, Josie, waiting for her chance, seized 
the pistol from Hemingway and said, `If you speak one more word of 
abuse I'll shoot you dead.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And Hemingway was much impressed with this and said, `You're a  
good woman, Josie! You're a better woman than this guy deserves!'''

<HEADLINE> McDougal May Testify on Counsel Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If House Democrats have their way, Susan  
McDougal will be the star witness at a hearing next month on the 
fate of the expiring Watergate-inspired law that gave Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that she will testify,'' said Rep. William  
Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
commercial and administrative law. ``Obviously, she gives a 
perspective that we haven't heard from yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, President and Mrs. Clinton's former Whitewater  
partner, has been outspoken in her contempt of Starr and his 
efforts to get her to testify against the first couple regarding 
their land dealings. She spent 18 months in prison for refusing to 
testify, saying her decision was based on a fear she would be 
charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated the president 
and first lady in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Little Rock, Arkansas, acquitted Mrs. McDougal  
on Monday of obstruction of justice charges, and a deadlocked-jury 
mistrial was declared on two criminal contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony is sought by Democrats who attacked Starr during  
last year's presidential impeachment hearings for his tactics 
during five years of investigating Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Democrats have requested that one hearing be  
devoted to abuses of the 1978 law and are considering calling 
officials including former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
Delahunt said. Espy was acquitted in December of 30 charges brought 
by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz that he accepted gifts and 
entertainment from companies or organizations regulated by the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also have discussed calling Monica Lewinsky but  
believe Starr's restrictions against her public comments would 
prevent her from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Mrs. McDougal would be the star witness in a hearing  
that could open as early as May, Democratic counsel Julian Epstein 
said, but he cautioned that no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under active consideration,'' Epstein said. He said he  
has talked with Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's fiance, lawyer Pat Harris, said the subcommittee  
wants her view ``of how this particular independent counsel had run 
this investigation and whether or not she feels she has been 
treated fairly.'' Harris said she was invited to testify and is 
willing to do so. 

</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's acquittal was another in a series of blows to  
Starr, who saw the Senate acquit Clinton in February and is being 
investigated by the Justice Department on charges of illegally 
leaking grand jury information. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr and the three-judge panel that appointed him are to  
testify Wednesday on the future of the independent counsel law 
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Congress must 
decide whether to let the law die or extend it in some form.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Worker Rescued From Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A firefighter dangling perilously from a  
helicopter cable climbed atop a burning crane Monday and rescued a 
construction worker who was trapped for more than an hour above a 
raging fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames were licking at the cable as the unidentified  
firefighter grabbed the crane and climbed aboard, scrambling to the 
end where the man was waiting anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Strapping the man to his chest, the firefighter held on tightly  
as both were lowered by the helicopter to some nearby grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The man walked to a stretcher under his own power. Firefighters  
and paramedics surrounded him. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectators applauded as the man was wheeled to an ambulance.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire had engulfed an old mill that was being converted to  
loft apartments in eastern Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The worker, who was not identified, crawled to the end of the  
crane's horizontal arm to get away from the black smoke and flames 
rising from the large, red brick building. He seemed calm and alert 
as he lay on his stomach waiting to be rescued, the crane swaying 
in winds that gusted above 20 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke and flame could be seen at the center of the crane, about  
20 feet from where he was. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on how the fire started or what the  
man was doing on the crane.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Put Piazza, Reed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the New York Mets keep winning games, they  
keep losing players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Rick Reed was put on the 15-day disabled list before  
today's home opener against Florida because of a torn calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not an Achilles' tendon injury,'' general manager  
Steve Phillips said, describing the diagnosis as good news. ``It's 
likely at the end of the 15 days we'll be able to activate him and 
put him back in the rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 16-11 with a 3.48 ERA last season, hurt his left leg  
trying to stretch his game-tying RBI single into a double during 
Sunday's 6-3 win at Montreal. ``I don't want to miss my next 
start,'' he said. ``I don't think I will. It started to stiffen up 
but after I got some ice I was able to walk around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star catcher Mike Piazza also was put on the disabled list  
today, retroactive to Saturday, after spraining the medial 
collateral ligament in his right knee during a rundown Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York filled the roster spots by recalling left-hander Rigo  
Beltran and outfielder Terrence Long from Norfolk of the 
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine said Allen Watson would take Reed's turn  
in the rotation against Philadelphia this weekend and that Todd 
Pratt would be the everyday catcher until Piazza returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss a big cog, but we're going to be able to  
play,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza didn't want go on the disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor made it clear that if I do play, and I run the  
bases and suddenly have to change directions it could be a full 
tear and that would mean surgery,'' he said. ``Considering that 
possibility, I figure that this is for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets returned home after a 5-2 opening road trip and sent  
Bobby Jones (1-0) against Livan Hernandez (0-1) on a cold but sunny 
afternoon at Shea Stadium. The Mets had an advance sale of about 
45,000 coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels like the season didn't start yet because we've  
been on the road, so tomorrow I guess the season will start,'' 
closer John Franco said after Sunday's game. ``We'll have our own 
crowd behind us, rather than everyone else's. We've played two home 
openers, Florida and here, and now we'll have our own, and guys can 
get settled in and get apartments and get used to the home 
surroundings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the Mets' first game at Shea Stadium since their  
season-ending flop last year, when they went 0-5 and scored just 
seven runs to finish one game behind Chicago and San Francisco in 
the NL wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will be Bobby Bonilla's first game at Shea Stadium in a  
Mets uniform since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some pretty good opening days for New York, so that's  
one positive thing,'' Bonilla said. ``But everybody's really pretty 
fired up. We were able to do a nice job here in Montreal, which was 
very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have won five of six since losing their opener at Miami  
last Monday. But because of Piazza's injury, many fans worry 
whether their offense will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they'll be disappointed that he's not there because  
he's such a great player,'' first baseman John Olerud said. ``He's 
the guy for us, offensively speaking, and so it definitely hurts 
having him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we have a good team. We have a lot of good guys on  
this team, guys that can swing the bat, so hopefully we can pick up 
the slack until he comes back.''

<HEADLINE> Toothbrush Makers, ADA Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A lawsuit has been filed against toothbrush  
makers for failing to warn adequately people about the possible 
dangers of the brushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed against several toothbrush manufacturers and  
the American Dental Association, seeks damages on behalf of anyone 
who suffers from toothbrush abrasion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important health-care issue ... and an easily  
solvable problem that probably should never have gotten out of 
hand,'' attorney Michael Applebaum said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Applebaum represents a suburban Chicago man, Mark Trimarco, who  
says he suffers from ``toothbrush abrasion,'' which causes receding 
gums and sensitive teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	He said dentists have known about toothbrush abrasion for about  
50 years. The suit, filed last week, demands that toothbrushes come 
with warning labels and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA said toothbrush abrasion is associated with a number of  
factors in addition to improper brushing, including eating acidic 
foods, consumption of citrus fruit drinks and carbonated beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADA recommends gentle brushing and a toothbrush with soft,  
polished bristles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a toothbrush is used properly, toothbrush abrasion is not  
an issue,'' ADA president S. Timothy Rose said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Report: Singapore GIC Splits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The Singapore government's investment arm -- one  
of Asia's biggest fund managers -- has split into three companies in 
a major reorganization, a news report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Singapore financial community believe the move  
will make the Government Investment Corporation, or GIC, more 
transparent and accountable for its performance, The Business Times 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government body has split its real estate and special  
investments departments into separate companies as of April 1, the 
newspaper quoted a GIC official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The old GIC will be left to handle market investments such as  
bonds, equities and foreign investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that real estate and special investments are  
separate asset classes, distinct from public markets investments,'' 
Chang Siew Kang, director of the corporate affairs department, told 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``As separate companies, GIC Real Estate Pte. Ltd. and GIC  
Special Investments Pte. Ltd. will be given business autonomy to 
evolve their own business practices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A new $1 billion venture capital announced by the government  
last week to invest in promising new technology will be managed by 
GIC Special Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang said GIC Special Investments will focus on direct  
investment in both public and private companies, and participate in 
management buyouts and venture-capital investments. 
</P>
<P>
	GIC manages more than $58.82 billion of taxpayers' money in  
overseas investments.

<HEADLINE> GAO Says Fed Reserve Is Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Federal Reserve Board's computers should be  
fine when Jan. 1, 2000, rolls around, according to a report 
released by the General Accounting Office on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding unusually optimistic, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah,  
chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 
Technology Problem, said he was confident the Fed was ready for 
Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GAO report outlines a responsible level of readiness in  
the Federal Reserve Board,'' Bennett said. ``Unlike many other 
federal agencies whose Y2K readiness must be taken at its word, the 
Fed's compliance has been independently verified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is especially critical for the Fed, which handles a  
daily average of 390,000 electronic transfers of funds totaling 
more than $1.3 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, the watchdog arm of Congress, said it examined eight  
mission-critical systems as well as the management process for the 
Y2K efforts. The report stated the Fed has ``effective controls to 
help ensure that its Year 2000 progress is reported accurately and 
reliably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed is handling the complex conversions well, the report  
said, and has completed its fixes and is working on contingency 
plans in case it missed anything. As of February, 98 percent of its 
computer systems are compliant, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed still has a way to go, the report continued,  
``before it is fully ready, ... such as completing validation and 
implementation of its internal systems and completing its 
contingency plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means the computer fixes have been made but still need to  
be verified, and implies that backup plans are almost, but not yet 
fully, in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, (the Fed) has plans for completing remaining tasks,  
and has implemented ... controls to ensure that they are 
accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Grabow, founder and chief executive officer of Millennium  
Investing Corp., a company involved in monitoring global financial 
markets and Y2K problems, said he was confident of GAO's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure their systems are where they say they are,'' he said.  
Regulators at the Fed were already well along in working on the Y2K 
problem when he became involved with it in early 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of their great awareness, our securities industry and  
our banking industry is enjoying great progress on this issue,'' he 
said. ``But will they have other glitches? It's such a big area 
that people have to realize that there will be mistakes, but they 
can be managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900. Some 
computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded 
microchips that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett requested reports on U.S. banks and other financial  
institutions from the GAO in 1997. In the past, he has fretted 
publicly about the reliability of electrical power and possible 
rationing of airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, anticipating a surging demand for cash  
toward the end of the year, plans to stockpile an extra $200 
billion, one-third more than normal, to cover extra withdrawals as 
jittery bank customers pull out extra crash.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Meeting Planner Enters Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A planner for the National Baptist Convention  
USA pleaded guilty today to a single minor count, ending her case 
the morning she was to go on trial on charges of conspiracy, money 
laundering and bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Harris, 48, said she was guilty of ``misprision of a  
felony,'' or failing to inform police when a crime was being 
committed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is scheduled for July 26, and as part of the plea  
agreement, prosecutors won't seek a prison term, Lawson said. 
Misprision of a felony carries a maximum sentence of three years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for Ms. Harris to forfeit a $340,000 home in  
Brentwood, Tenn., paid for with money from the former director of 
the convention, the Rev. Henry Lyons, said Ms. Harris' attorney, 
Peter Strianse. 
</P>
<P>
	Money in bank accounts also will be forfeited, Lawson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was convicted in February on state charges of bilking $4  
million from companies doing business with the Nashville, 
Tenn.-based black church group, and taking nearly $250,000 donated 
by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. The money was 
supposed to go to rebuild black churches that had been burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax evasion and  
fraud, and will be sentenced June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	His co-defendant Bernice Edwards, a convention public relations  
director, was acquitted in state court but pleaded guilty to two 
federal tax evasion counts and faces sentencing in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before today's plea was reached, Ms. Harris, who says she  
had an affair with Lyons, admitted that Lyons gave her a 
substantial amount for a down payment on the Tennessee home, as 
well as jewelry and other gifts during their two-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea agreement was presented by the government Sunday and  
finally recognized that Ms. Harris was a minor player, Strianse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Ms. Harris apologized for her role in the  
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry I let people down. We had an opportunity to be in a  
Christian environment and hold up our Lord, and we failed,'' Ms. 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	She reiterated her position that her relationship with the  
married minister was not about money or gifts, but about love, 
saying, ``He was a good person to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in The Tennessean of Nashville on  
Sunday, she said, ``I did do a stupid thing. I allowed myself to 
get involved with a married man. Now, I feel like I've been used. I 
didn't know about ... any other woman other than his wife, and I 
thought he was going to get a divorce. I thought it was just me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troubles for Lyons, pastor of a St. Petersburg church who became  
the national group's president in 1994, began in 1997 when his wife 
set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he owned with Ms. Edwards in 
the St. Petersburg area. The fire led to closer scrutiny of Lyons' 
lavish spending.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Mixed in Quiet Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed Monday with  
long-term bonds rising for the sixth time in seven days while 
short-term securities lagged as key stock market indicators rose to 
new records. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32  
point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.45 percent from 5.46 percent on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term bonds have gained as investors believe inflation  
remains in check, and thus they expect interest rates to stay low. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter maturities, however, have been more sensitive to the  
stock market, where five major indexes all rose to new highs 
Monday. As traders flock to stocks, money often flows out of 
short-term Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16 point Monday  
and intermediate maturities ranged from a gain of 1/32 point to a 
drop of 1/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.30 percent as the  
discount fell 0.07 percentage point from Friday to 4.19 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.49 percent, as the discount was unchanged 
at 4.33 percent. One-year yields were 4.62 percent as the discount 
rose by 0.02 percentage point from to 4.41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 7/8 from 124 5/8. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Harness Driver Brennan Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- An attorney representing George Brennan  
filed a notice of appeal with the New Jersey Racing Commission on 
Monday regarding the six-month suspension it gave North America's 
leading harness driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission had not responded to the notice by late Monday  
afternoon, said Joe Faraldo, a New York City attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have made up their minds on what they want to  
do,'' Faraldo said in a telephone interview with The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission suspended Brennan and fellow drivers Jim Morrill  
Jr. and Howard Parker for six months for unsatisfactory 
performances during a race at Freehold Raceway last month. All 
three were also fined $500. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation of the March 10 race detected ``suspicious''  
wagering payoffs, officials said. In that race, Brennan finished 
eighth and last with My Dream Come True, the 2-1 second choice. 
Parker was seventh with Bo Knows Matt (7-1), and Morrill was fifth 
with Neirda No, the 7-2 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The resulting trifecta paid only $92.50 although the No. 1  
horse, World Class Storm, an 8-1 shot, won the race and the 
favorite came in second. The exacta paid $26.40. 
</P>
<P>
	One bettor wagered heavily on the exacta and trifecta and earned  
$24,000. An investigation revealed it was Parker's chauffeur, who 
transported him from Freehold to the Meadowlands daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan said all he did was follow the instructions given him by  
Joe Krajczewski, the trainer of My Dream Come True. 
</P>
<P>
	Faraldo said Brennan took a polygraph administered by the State  
Police and he answered all the questions truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever made the bets did not include George, so they (the  
commission) decided George must be guilty,'' Faraldo said. 
``They've decided to ruin him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal will first be reviewed by the executive director of  
the commission. If it is rejected, an administrative law judge will 
conduct a hearing, although the commission can reject, accept or 
modify his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension can later be appealed to a state court. The  
courts can also allow Brennan to continue racing while the appeals 
process continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan, 31, is Freehold's leading driver with 94 victories and  
the national leader with 171.

<HEADLINE> IBM, RealNetworks Offer Online Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM joined with software maker RealNetworks  
today to deliver CD-quality music over the Internet to computer 
users, intensifying IBM's challenge to a rival effort by Microsoft 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is testing a system this spring that combines its technology  
with RealNetworks software, which already is used by more than 55 
million people to play music, listen to radio and watch video 
clips. The new system targets computer users who get Internet 
access across telephone lines, the most common avenue to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, for its part, is expected to announce a deal on  
Tuesday for its own system for delivering music over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	RealNetworks' stock soared as much as 14 percent this morning.  
It was up $25.50 a share at $233 in midmorning trading on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. IBM was down $4.31 1/4 at $182 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM already is testing technology that, in conjunction with five  
leading record companies, lets people with high-speed Internet 
access over cable-TV lines to record albums off the Internet. The 
test is part of an industry effort to develop security standards 
for digital music sales, while battling technology that lets people 
easily download free and often illegally copied songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales represent just a tiny fraction of the $12  
billion music industry. Major record companies hope to outdo the 
music pirates by offering better-quality sound and greater choice.

<HEADLINE> German Leader Wants Unity on Kosovo </HEADLINE>

<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Facing dissent over Kosovo, Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder appealed to his party today to support his stand 
on bombing Yugoslavia, flatly rejecting calls by left-wingers to 
stop NATO's air assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, speaking at an emergency convention of his Social

stake in a conflict that has launched its military into combat

Schroeder told some 470 delegates. ``We also have a responsibility

gruesome human rights violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO alliance says airstrikes will continue until Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws police and military units 
sent to Kosovo to crack down on separatist rebels. The Serb forces 
are accused of terrorizing ethnic Albanian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing his critics, Schroeder repeated NATO's argument that  
continued airstrikes -- including German Tornado warplanes -- are 
necessary to make Milosevic agree to peace in Kosovo and allow for 
the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``An end to airstrikes would not bring us one millimeter closer  
to this goal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That stand has provoked vocal objections from a leftist minority  
in the party as well as the once thoroughly pacifist Greens, 
Schroeder's junior partner in the 6-month-old center-left 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-wingers and the Social Democrats' radical youth  
organization introduced a motion at the convention calling on the 
government to press for an end to the airstrikes and for fresh 
Kosovo peace talks with Yugoslavia. Though the motion's defeat 
seemed certain, the move indicated the depth of unease among many 
Germans about their country's assertive new role in the post-Cold 
War world. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schroeder argued Germans had a special responsibility to  
stand firm against Milosevic precisely because of the nation's Nazi 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially as Germans, our response must be clear: We must  
never again allow murder, expulsions and deportations to be 
tolerated by politicians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo crisis overshadowed a meeting originally called to  
install Schroeder as new party chairman after his leftist rival, 
Oskar Lafontaine, quit that post and the finance minister's job in 
a power struggle last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates were expected to elect Schroeder later today, lifting  
him into a dual leadership role that consolidates his power after a 
rocky start. Even so, many Social Democrats feel he doesn't 
represent the party's soul after building his centrist reputation 
by keeping aloof from its core left-wing traditions.

<HEADLINE> High Court Asked To Drop La. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court was asked by both sides  
Monday to drop a closely watched Louisiana dispute over alleged 
excessive force by police, a case that was to have been argued 
before the justices next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans, Mayor Marc Morial's office said the city reached  
an out-of-court settlement with James Snyder, who was shot in the 
back and paralyzed during a police chase on July 4, 1992. A brief 
statement disclosed no details of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers' request invoked a Supreme Court rule most often  
used when such settlements have been agreed. Once the court gets 
all relevant paperwork, it always grants the requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court granted review in January to an appeal filed  
by Snyder's lawyers, and was to hear arguments April 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has been paralyzed below the waist since New Orleans  
policeman Sidney Trepagnier shot him. He won a $1.96 million jury 
award against the city, only to have a federal appellate court wipe 
it out last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of  
Appeals that was in the city's favor and still stands as law,'' the 
mayor's office quoted City Attorney Avis Russell as saying. 
``However, considering the risks of further litigation, we believe 
it is in the best interest of the city to settle this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder had been a passenger in a car that eluded police during a  
high-speed chase. The car's two occupants eventually fled on foot 
into a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's version of what happened differed greatly from  
Trepagnier's. Snyder's lawsuit said the officer shot him while 
keeping him restrained face down in the mud and told him, ``The 
swamp's a hell of a place to die, ain't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trepagnier said he shot Snyder while chasing him through the  
swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled that Trepagnier had violated Snyder's  
constitutional rights but was entitled to qualified immunity for 
having done so and therefore could not be forced to pay monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's lawsuit also had named the city as a defendant, and the  
jury ordered New Orleans to pay him $1.96 million, the amount of 
his past and future medical payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding trial judge upheld Trepagnier's immunity and the  
jury's finding of liability against the city but ordered a new 
trial to increase the amount of money Snyder could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inconceivable for a jury to find that an individual who  
has been shot in the back, subjected to multiple operations, 
hospitalized for several months and will be confined for the rest 
of his life to a wheelchair endured no pain and suffering and 
permanent disability,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had refused to award any money under those categories.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5th Circuit court found no discrepancy in the jury's finding  
that Trepagnier had violated the Constitution but could not be 
forced to pay damages. The appeals court ruled as well that the 
city could not be held liable, which would leave Snyder with 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court had been expected to use Snyder's case to  
decide whether a police officer found by a jury to have used 
unlawfully excessive force can be shielded by the same jury from 
paying that person any monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's lawyers had argued that the judge, not the jury, should  
have decided whether Trepagnier was entitled to the qualified 
immunity he received. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Urbonya, a William and Mary law professor who has  
studied the case, wrote recently in the ABA Journal, an American 
Bar Association magazine, that the court's ruling would resolve 
sharp conflicts among federal appeals courts on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the case had the potential to profoundly affect  
excessive-force lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups  
supported Snyder's claims in a friend-of-the-court brief, and 
Trepagnier was supported in a brief filed by the National 
Association of Police Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was Snyder vs. Trepagnier, 98-507.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Mother Admitted to Hopsital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The mother of Vice President Al Gore has  
been admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for what was 
termed a routine test. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokeswoman Jennifer Devlin said Pauline Gore, 86, was  
admitted Sunday night. She would not comment on what the test was 
for or how long Mrs. Gore would be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing very well,'' Devlin said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore was one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt  
Law School and for years was a familiar figure on the campaign 
trail with her son and husband, former U.S. Sen. Al Gore Sr. The 
elder Gore died Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore has suffered two strokes and a heart attack since 1993

<HEADLINE> Congress Returning From Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning from its spring break,  
with Republicans planning a publicity offensive for their 
tax-cutting goals but facing the likelihood that the war with 
Yugoslavia will overwhelm their message. 
</P>
<P>
	With April 15 -- the day income tax returns are due -- falling on  
Thursday, Republicans are ready to appeal to voters by a focusing 
on their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, due back at the Capitol today, should approve a  
fiscal 2000 budget blueprint this week allowing $800 billion in tax 
cuts over the next decade. And there will be other votes and events 
aimed at rallying disgruntled taxpayers to the GOP cause. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republicans acknowledge that with NATO's conflict with  
Yugoslavia in its third week, it will be tough to attract the 
attention they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier to ride a wave then to make a wave, and this  
is a particularly hard wave to ignore,'' said Tony Blankley, a 
political commentator who was press secretary to former House 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers themselves also will be concerning themselves with the  
fighting in the Balkans and the flood of refugees it has spawned. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders planned to meet with President Clinton  
tonight to discuss the crisis, and a larger group of legislators 
will get another White House briefing Tuesday. Defense Secretary 
William Cohen plans to testify to House and Senate committees on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Congress began its two-week recess a day after the  
bombing started, there are certain to be speeches galore on the 
subject. Quick votes seem unlikely, but Rep. Tom Campbell, 
R-Calif., planned to introduce resolutions today aimed at forcing a 
House vote on whether U.S. military action should continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the first to say it was a  
mistake to rule out ground troops, said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press'' that he would seek a Senate resolution authorizing the 
president to use whatever means necessary to complete the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic to know we are  
not going to stop the air war if that doesn't work,'' Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, D-Conn., said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Kosovo distraction, Blankley and other Republicans  
say the GOP would be wise to press ahead with its tax agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the No. 4 House GOP leader, said  
despite the country's concern with the crisis and U.S. troops, 
``America also wants us to try and do the business of the country 
in a professional manner. Part of that is doing what the American 
people want us to do, and part of that is cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along those lines, Republican leaders hope to resolve relatively  
minor differences in separate budgets the House and Senate have 
approved so Congress can pass a compromise by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Their biggest remaining disputes include whether to use Social  
Security's massive surpluses to also shore up Medicare, and how to 
use any additional surpluses expected to be projected this summer. 
Clinton's signature is not needed for the congressional budget, 
which sets levels for future tax and spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday -- tax deadline day -- the House plans to debate a  
longtime conservative favorite: a constitutional amendment that 
would require three-fifths majorities in the House and Senate for 
approval of tax increases. It is sure to fall short of the 
two-thirds majority that constitutional amendments need but will 
help Republicans call notice to their anti-tax agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats also hope to win publicity for one of their  
causes, but they face the same obstacle as Republicans from the 
higher-profile fighting in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Democrats plan to begin circulating a petition  
demanding a vote on legislation revamping campaign finance laws by 
limiting expenditures. It will take the signatures of 218 
representatives -- a bare House majority -- to force the vote, and 
with just 211 Democrats some GOP support will be needed to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	In other congressional action planned this week:  
</P>
<P>
	--Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose investigation of  
Clinton led to his impeachment, will testify Wednesday before the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering whether 
to renew the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House will debate a bill that would let local officials  
challenge census counts before they become final. Democrats say the 
measure could cause endless delays in the 2000 count.

<HEADLINE> Kill the Ump Is No Idle Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kill the ump? Some people take it almost  
literally. Umpires and referees say they are getting punched and 
kicked, and are seeing even their cars attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are tired of it. Many umps and refs are quitting --  
taking themselves out of the game rather than putting up with abuse 
from fans, coaches and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming a disturbing trend that we are seeing more and  
more officials being assaulted,'' said Bob Still, spokesman for the 
National Association of Sports Officials and a part-time ref. The 
group counts nearly 19,000 refs and umps as members. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no national tally of assaults on sports officials,  
Still said. A lot of incidents on the local level never get 
reported to national governing bodies because there is no 
requirement for reporting. And there is no national center to 
collect every group's assault data. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trend is clear, Still said. In the past, only an  
occasional report of an assault would make its way to his group's 
headquarters in Racine, Wis. ``Now, we are getting them on a weekly 
basis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis by the organization cites cases dating as far back  
as 1995. ```Kill the ump' has become more than just a taunt by some 
disgruntled fans,'' it said. ``In fact, certain players, coaches 
and fans have engaged in actions in which it seemed as if they were 
indeed trying to `kill the ump.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the incidents wind up in the news.  
</P>
<P>
	Last July, a Manassas, Va., man head-butted a referee during an  
an adult amateur soccer match. The ref said the player struck him 
from behind after he had ejected the man for being verbally 
abusive. In 1996, a Washington state wrestling official was knocked 
out by a high school wrestler who head-butted him. 
</P>
<P>
	In other incidents,''punches are being thrown, guns are drawn,  
people are firing shots over (referees') heads,'' Stills said. 
Referees have been chased off the field, tailgated for miles in 
their cars, and had their car windows bashed in with baseball bats, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This insurrection of incivility seems to be spreading by  
example, the report said. Amateurs see pros abuse refs and get away 
with light punishment if anything, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study cited the Roberto Alomar case in September 1996. The  
Baltimore Orioles player spit in the face of umpire John 
Hirschbeck, and later had to be restrained by manager Davey 
Johnson. Alomar received a five-game suspension to take effect, 
after the playoffs, in the following season. 
</P>
<P>
	In amateur play, when perpetrators are brought up on criminal  
charges, the punishments also are often light, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports officials increasingly are unwilling to put up with the  
risks, Still said, adding: ``People are saying, `I've had enough, 
it's not worth it.'' Officials commonly work free in recreational 
and youth league play; they may get $35-$50 a game in high school 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The scarcity of officials also is showing up in the news. An  
article in the Chicago Tribune last month quoted an official of a 
Chicago-area umpires' organization as saying the number of baseball 
umpires has plummeted. A Los Angeles Times report this week quoted 
an official of a referees' organization as saying shortages have 
hit all sports in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups, however, consider themselves relatively unscathed.  
``In general, injuries to referees is not a particular problem,'' 
said Brian Davies, national referee administrator for the American 
Youth Soccer Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacks on refs seem to be more common in games with older  
players, and most players in AYSA leagues are 14 or under, Davies 
said. However, the organization does not have a national reporting 
system for attacks on referees, so he may not know about some 
incidents that could be happening on the local levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the same, Davies' organization takes the risk seriously,  
issuing a 20-page guide, ``How to Deal with Difficult Adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guide advises refs to deal with disruptive adults quickly,  
firmly and carefully. Tell them ``I recognize you disagree with my 
decision, but I'm the one who has to make it,'' the guide says. If 
the situation continues to deteriorate, the ref should tell the 
person causing the problem, ``For the players' sake, you'll have to 
leave. The game cannot continue while you are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umps don't expect to be loved, Still said. ``It's perfectly OK  
to yell at the ump; that's part of the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But people should realize that officials are only human and do  
make bad calls, Still said. How to live with the occasional bad 
call is a life skill that sports is supposed to teach, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Takes the Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jenny Jones testified in a $50 million  
lawsuit Monday that she treats those who appear on her talk show 
with respect and didn't try to humiliate a man who killed a fellow 
guest after a segment on secret gay crushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I treat the guests on the show the same way I would expect to  
be treated if I appeared on the show -- with respect,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure's family is suing ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' and  
its producer, Warner Bros., over Amedure's slaying by Jonathan 
Schmitz. Schmitz shot Amedure three days after the taping of a 1995 
episode that never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family alleges the show tricked a mentally troubled  
Schmitz into appearing on an episode, then humiliated him by 
letting Amedure reveal his crush on Schmitz. Schmitz has said he is 
heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	On the witness stand Monday, Ms. Jones bristled at claims by  
Amedure family attorney Geoffrey Fieger that she ridiculed Schmitz 
before a studio audience in pursuit of ratings and ad revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my intent to embarrass the guests,'' Ms. Jones  
testified, appearing more confident and assertive than when she 
took the stand during Schmitz's 1996 murder trial. She is not being 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the show's revenue and ratings, Ms. Jones testified:  
``That's not what I'm thinking about when I'm taping the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Schmitz ``didn't seem to be embarrassed to me'' after  
hearing Amedure describe his sexual fantasy involving Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether she would find such fantasies offensive, she  
countered that ``it could be exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the jury was led out Monday, Judge Gene Schnelz ruled the  
defense could offer testimony from people who say Amedure told them 
he had a sexual relationship with Schmitz. Amedure's family denies 
those claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, a counselor who treats former talk show guests  
testified ``The Jenny Jones Show'' refused his services for a 
prescreening before Schmitz and Amedure appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	James Huysman, who runs Florida-based Aftercare, suggested a  
prescreening before Schmitz's appearance might have detected the 
potential emotional fallout. Schmitz was known to have been 
depressed and had attempted suicide four times since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger asked if Schmitz was identifiable as a person ``you would  
want to screen out'' as a potential guest. Huysman replied: 
``Clearly. There was nothing ambivalent about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given Schmitz's mental history, Huysman said: ``I don't think he  
should have been on the air.''

<HEADLINE> American Snaps Mast in Sailing Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- The only American left in an  
around-the-world sailing race limped toward port Monday after the 
mast on his boat snapped in rough South American seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Van Liew, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., had been in a tight  
race for second place in Class II of the Around Alone regatta when 
his mast broke Sunday afternoon -- early in the fourth and final leg 
to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was around 100 miles out of Punta del Este in steep and  
very uncomfortable seas. Without any warning the mast just went,'' 
race director Mark Schrader said from the port of Punta del Este, 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Liew and eight other solo sailors left Punta del Este on  
Saturday to begin the last leg of the globe-circling race that 
began last September in Charleston, S.C., and is to end there in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad's on his way back now,'' said Schrader. ``He obviously  
was very, very discouraged and his campaign doesn't have an 
unlimited budget, so he's not sure if he's going to be able to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race is a 27,000-nautical mile adventure that has taken  
sailors from South Carolina to South Africa, then on to New Zealand 
and Uruguay. Saturday marked the start of the final dash back to 
the southern U.S. seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The last leg to Charleston, about 5,750 nautical miles, is the  
shortest of the four. But it is potentially tricky because of 
fickle air currents off Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Italian sailor Giovanni Soldini continues to lead the  
main Class I competition with an overall lead of 89 days and 5 
hours -- a daunting 12-day advantage over competitor Mark Thiercelin 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
	In Class II, Jean Pierre Mouligne of France commanded a hefty  
lead with 99 days and 14 hours accumulated after three legs. But 
the race for second place had been extremely close until Van Liew's 
dismasting on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Boost Workers' Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Check processors in training at First Chicago  
NBD bank used to be taught what to do with large checks. Now they 
also learn how to read and write large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, U.S. companies are teaching workers their ABCs  
and 123s on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a tight labor market and a rising need for  
better-skilled applicants, companies are offering remedial programs 
or -- like First Chicago -- infusing job training with basic skills 
lessons, according to a study released Monday by the American 
Management Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as easy to walk into a K-Mart, Sears or Burger King  
and get a job now, considering the higher level of skills needed to 
deal with inventory or computers,'' says Eric Rolfe Greenberg, 
director of management studies at the New York-based nonprofit 
management-education group. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's January survey of 1,054 member companies  
found that nearly 15 percent of companies offer basic skills 
programs, about the same as a year earlier. Nine percent even hire 
applicants who lack basic skills and then enter them in remedial 
training programs, up from 5 percent two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	First Chicago, now merging with Bank One, began blending basic  
skills into its regular training programs four years ago with a 
grant from the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	In one class about checks, new hires ``were taught parts of a  
check, but never dealt with the mathematics of it, and errors were 
made,'' said Tamara Baloun, vice president and regional staffing 
manager for Bank One, First Chicago's merger partner. 
</P>
<P>
	In another class, trainers teach workers how to cope with  
written directions, she said. ``Before, you'd assume they could 
skim and scan and prioritize. ... Today you make sure they know 
how,'' said Ms. Baloun. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more job applicants are lacking basic skills, the  
American Management Association study found. Nearly 36 percent of 
applicants lack the reading and math skills they need to do the job 
they seek, up from 23 percent in 1997, the management group found. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that's partly becuase higher levels of skills are  
demanded today, it's also true that many Americans can't read or do 
simple math well. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 federal survey found that 40 million to 44 million  
American adults had problems reading, writing and doing math -- the 
skills considered necessary for functioning in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	Until three years ago, Boeing didn't give hourly workers any  
basic skills assessments. Nowadays, many of those workers volunteer

<HEADLINE> Tomato Nutrient May Fight Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A study has found the first direct evidence  
that the nutrient that makes tomatoes red may protect men against 
prostate cancer by shrinking tumors and slowing their spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutrient, lycopene, has emerged as one of the trendiest of  
all nutritional supplements in recent years. Large population 
surveys have suggested that those who eat plenty of tomatoes -- the 
primary natural source of lycopene -- are less likely to get 
prostate cancer and some other malignancies. 
</P>
<P>
	To see if tomatoes are truly the reason why, researchers from  
the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit gave lycopene capsules to 
men who were about to undergo surgery to remove their cancerous 
prostate glands. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 33 men who were randomly assigned to take  
lycopene or nothing for 30 days before their prostate operations. 
Before surgery, the volunteers showed no obvious signs that their 
cancer had spread. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery, the doctors found that cancer tissue was less  
likely to extend clear to the edges of the lycopene users' prostate 
glands. And pre-cancerous cells in their prostates were less 
abnormal-looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that lycopene results in a decrease of the tumor  
size and makes the cancer less aggressive,'' said Dr. Omar Kucuk, 
who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were presented in Philadelphia on Monday at a  
meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucuk warned that his study is small, and cautioned against  
routine use of lycopene supplements without further evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycopene pills are widely available. In the study, financed by  
the Karmanos institute, volunteers were given two daily 
15-milligram capsules of Lyc-O-Mato, a lycopene extract made by 
LycoRed Natural Products of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucuk said this is the amount of lycopene found in about a pound  
of tomatoes. However, since lycopene is not easily absorbed from 
raw tomatoes, it might take two or three pounds to actually raise 
blood levels as high as were seen in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are significant,'' said Dr. Frank Rauscher of the  
Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. ``It's remarkable that lycopene 
may have both therapeutic and preventative value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among American  
men. The American Cancer Society estimates that 179,300 men will be 
diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and 37,000 will die from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the study's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Cancer had spread to the very edge of the prostate gland or  
beyond in seven of the 21 men on lycopene, compared with nine of 
the 12 in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	--Levels of PSA -- prostate specific antigen, a measure of tumor  
activity -- fell 20 percent between the start of treatment and 
surgery in the lycopene patients. They were unchanged in the 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pre-cancerous but worrisome tissue in the lycopene patients was  
also less abnormal-looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is real, I would expect to see a decrease in the  
relapse rate and increased survival in these patients'' taking 
lycopene, Kucuk said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most influential pieces of research on tomatoes and  
cancer was a large Harvard study released in 1995. It followed the 
eating habits of 47,000 men for six years. Those who had at least 
10 weekly servings of tomato-based foods were up to 45 percent less 
likely to develop prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In an analysis published in February, Dr. Edward Giovannucci of  
Harvard Medical School reviewed 72 studies that looked for a link 
between cancer risk and food made with tomatoes. In all, 57 linked 
tomato intake with a reduced risk, and in 35 of these, the 
association was strong enough to be considered statistically 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
	The data were most compelling for cancers of the prostate, lung  
and stomach. They also suggest links between tomatoes and lower 
levels of several other tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, 
esophageal, oral, breast and cervical cancer.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Disaster Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses and homeowners who want to  
improve their property or move to lessen the impact of natural 
disasters would get financial help from the government under a bill 
the House passed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the legislation, the government would create a four-year,  
$15 million pilot loan program. The low-interest loans would be 
used to take preventive measures to lessen the impact of floods, 
hurricanes and other acts of nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed it by voice vote Monday. The Senate passed an  
identical measure in March. 
</P>
<P>
	It now goes to President Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	The cost of repairing damage cause by natural disaster has grown  
rapidly in recent years because of rising construction costs, Rep. 
John Thune, R-S.D., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that efforts must be made to hold down these  
costs,'' Thune said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until today, businesses have only been able to get help after  
it is too late,'' Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., said. ``Today's 
legislation will change this story. Today we're taking an important 
step to being proactive, rather than just reactive, to natural 
disasters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loan money would be drawn from existing disaster loan  
programs and would not constitute new spending, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program would be administered by the Small Business  
Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA 
has estimated that every dollar spent on preventive measures will 
save $2 in costs associated with damage caused by natural 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 388.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visiting U.S. Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steadfastly set against using ground troops in  
Kosovo, President Clinton is taking his message on the road again 
in hopes of blunting criticism of his policy on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was traveling today to Barksdale Air Force Base in  
Louisiana, which has been sending B-52 bombers on missions to 
Yugoslavia, for a visit similar to one he paid to the Norfolk, Va., 
naval base earlier this month. Defense Secretary William Cohen and 
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, planned 
to accompany him. 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said the  
president would deliver a message of support to the men and women 
in uniform and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to thank them for the contributions and  
sacrifice, and also to make clear to the American people and allies 
in Europe that the United States will persist until we prevail,'' 
Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his return to Washington, Clinton will gather House and  
Senate leaders at the White House tonight for a report on NATO's 
effort to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's quest to 
clear Kosovo, a Serb province, of its ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy said Clinton expects to review the air campaign and  
discuss an emergency appropriation to finance the Kosovo mission. 
He will meet with a larger group of lawmakers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the president has faced relatively muted criticism over  
his handling of the Kosovo operation and reliance on airpower 
amidst a growing refugee crisis caused by the warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Congress returning from a two-week recess today, that  
dynamic could change as lawmakers challenge Clinton's determination 
against ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Sunday that he wants Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., to offer a resolution authorizing Clinton to ``use 
all means necessary'' to bring the Kosovo crisis to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``No military commander, past or present, would think that it's  
appropriate, that it's anything but foolishness, to say that you 
are not allowed to exercise any option or at least threaten it,'' 
said McCain, a Republican presidential hopeful. ``It's not logical, 
and the administration has to change their position on that 
issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., appearing with McCain on NBC's ``Meet  
the Press,'' agreed. ``I don't think we should have ever taken 
ground troops off the table,'' he said. ``I think that's a judgment 
that should be able to be made by the commanders in the field, but 
it should be available to them if they need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he is reluctant to send U.S. troops into Kosovo  
because he is uneasy about ``the prospect of never being able to 
get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff John Podesta told NBC, ``The  
president does not have the intention to use ground troops. And at 
this point, NATO's commanders have not requested that, but if they 
do and NATO decides to move forward with planning, we can do that 
quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Illegal Toy Smugglers in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Illegal ``arms dealers'' from China are  
undercutting legally imported and locally made weapons for 
Thailand's annual water gun war, a newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smuggled supplies have already reached the Bangkok battlefront  
and Chinese dealers in the guise of tourists are selling everything 
from pistols to canons,'' said the Bangkok Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy arsenal is being employed by revelers during Songkran,  
the three-day Buddhist New Year which begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally a gentle festival of spiritual renewal, it has  
largely been perverted in recent years by rowdy Thais and foreign 
tourists who engage in water fights and hurl buckets of water at 
passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese smugglers, who arrived on tourist visas, are selling  
their guns at half the price of legal products, according to the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	This is adding to the woes of Thai dealers who say sales of toy  
guns and other festival items are down by 70 percent from last year 
due to the economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for the water guns range from 15 baht to 500 baht (42  
cents to $13.90), but few of the higher priced toys are being sold.

<HEADLINE> Bloomberg Sues Over Hoax Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bloomberg LP filed a lawsuit Monday against the  
unidentified people who posted and promoted a bogus report last 
week on the Internet that boosted the value of a California 
company's stock 31 percent before the hoax was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan will help the  
global financial news service learn the real identities behind the 
screen names of those who joined the scheme, said Richard L. Klein, 
a Bloomberg lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought unspecified damages and a court order to  
prevent the defendants from engaging in counterfeiting again. The 
defendants were listed as John Does, No. 1 through No. 5. Four of 
them had alias screen names. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone copied the Bloomberg page design and created a false  
news story that caused the dramatic increase last Wednesday in the 
trading value of PairGain Technologies, a Tustin, Calif., maker of 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said PairGain would be acquired by an Israeli firm,  
ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its market value at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, the value of PairGain stock rose as high as  
$11.12 1/2 from a closing price the day earlier of $8.50. After 
company officials disputed the report and the page was pulled from 
the Internet, the stock dropped to $9.37 1/2 on trading volume of 13.7 
million shares, nearly seven times its usual volume of about 2 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said Bloomberg does not know the identities or screen  
names of those who caused the bogus story to appear on 
Angelfire.com, the personal Web page site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've issued subpoenas to the companies that sponsor the Web  
site where this phony story was posted and the discussion boards 
where messages were posted referring readers to the counterfeit 
page,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain and Bloomberg officials said last week that they had  
turned the matter over to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein would not comment on investigations under way by federal  
agencies.

<HEADLINE> New P.D. James Mystery To Be Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- P.D. James took a late springtime walk in the  
Middle Temple, where many of London's lawyers ply their trade, and 
envisioned a murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was feeling how tranquil and beautiful it is, how  
historical, how astonishing. It's like a Jane Austen town, all 
Regency houses, a medieval church. The squares are lit by 
gaslight,'' the writer of mysteries says by telephone from her home 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking of the contrast between all the learned,  
historical, traditional aura and the dreadful and violent events 
with which a criminal trial usually deals. I thought about bringing 
murder right into the heart of this sacred enclave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result of that thinking resulted in her 14th novel, ``A  
Certain Justice,'' and now, for the next three Thursdays at 9 p.m. 
EDT, a TV version on PBS' ``Mystery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The author has no control over screenwriting or casting, which  
sometimes frustrates her. But she finds the tone of ``A Certain 
Justice'' generally satisfactory and says, ``There are always 
things that get changed one wouldn't change oneself. I don't think 
there's much point in worrying about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to consult me if they want to make any drastic  
changes in plot but it's consultation, not control. It's natural to 
want more control, but in practice it's a bit difficult to see how 
that would operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If she were to control casting, she acknowledges she wouldn't  
know which actors were available, and anyway, no one in the cast of 
``A Certain Justice'' struck her as jarringly wrong for the part. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm writing about a particular character, I almost become  
that character. I live inside her, understand her thoughts and 
emotions, more than I tend to see what she looks like. The same 
with male characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She realizes new scenes need to be added when the book becomes a  
film, but wishes her dialogue would be used in scenes taken from 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Dorothy James, now 78, married Dr. Ernest White and had  
two daughters. White came out of World War II incapacitated by 
shell shock, so his wife became the breadwinner and went to work as 
a hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	To make ends meet, she started getting up two hours early each  
morning to write a mystery novel. ``Cover Her Face,'' published in 
1962, and ``A Mind to Murder'' (1964) were set in hospitals. Other 
early books took place in a nurses' training school, a psychiatric 
clinic and a police forensic laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	After her husband died in 1964, James entered government service  
and became a specialist in juvenile delinquency. Only after she 
retired in 1979 did she become a full-time writer. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, ``Innocent Blood'' established her fame  
internationally, and in 1990 Queen Elizabeth II made her a 
baroness. James novels of note include ``Unnatural Causes,'' 
``Shroud for a Nightingale,'' ``The Black Tower,'' and ``The 
Children of Men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James is acclaimed for her ability to combine complex plots with  
evocative descriptions of place and believable characters, chiefly 
Commander Adam Dalgliesh, the Scotland Yard detective and published 
poet, who is one of the best known and most interesting creations 
in popular English fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The books have become fixtures on the ``Mystery'' slot, usually  
shown in three or more one-hour segments. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Certain Justice'' is typical James: it starts with a murder,  
then introduces a range of characters all of whom might benefit 
from the death. Dalgliesh's task is to detect the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	James' next book is a departure from crime fiction. She is  
writing a year in the life of an author, based on her 1977-8 
diaries. ``I will hinge a great deal about my past on that,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she'll write another mystery.

<HEADLINE> Zhu, Daley Say Trade Pact Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and U.S. Commerce  
Secretary William Daley said Monday that China's membership in the 
World Trade Organization could still be approved this year, despite 
their failure to seal an agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu vowed China would open ``wider and wider to the outside  
world'' if it joins the WTO. But he also cautioned U.S. officials 
to step in before other Western countries lay claim to billions of 
dollars worth of business with his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you demand too much too soon, maybe you'll end up with  
nothing,'' Zhu, who spoke through an interpreter, said at a 
luncheon at a downtown Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said President Clinton would like to see China admitted  
into the WTO this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good for America. And it is good for world trade,''  
Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of talks in Washington last week deprived visiting  
Zhu of a potent weapon to push forward his sweeping free-market 
reforms that have cost millions of jobs in an attempt to turn 
around money-losing state industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 years of on-again, off-again talks, China appeared  
increasingly intent in recent months on membership and showed new 
willingness to offer concessions. Daley said Monday that U.S. 
officials want to be more sure of China's willingness to open its 
markets to U.S. companies and imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the premier toured the currency trading floor of  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where harried traders briefly 
greeted him with applause. Zhu rang the exchange's bell and flashed 
the Chinese hand signal for ``good fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the applause, some traders said they had mixed feelings  
about Zhu's visit. One chuckling trader even held up two pieces of 
paper -- one reading ``Free'' and the other ``Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu next heads to New York, part of a six-city tour that has  
already taken him to Los Angeles, Denver and Washington.

<HEADLINE>  Is Gretzky Leaving at Season's End? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY KEN RAPPOPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the New York Rangers' season nearly over,  
the speculation is just beginning: Will Wayne Gretzky retire? 
</P>
<P>
	As far as one old friend is concerned, the answer won't come  
easily, and certainly won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Wayne, he would weigh everything and talk to a lot of  
people before making that decision,'' said Bruce MacGregor, 
assistant general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. ``It's a very 
hard decision. When you retire, it's for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacGregor, instrumental in bringing Gretzky to the Oilers, said  
``it wouldn't shock me'' if he did call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a frustrating year for him ... the way the club has  
played and the (neck injury). Those kind of injuries bother you a 
lot,'' MacGregor said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. 
``Maybe there's some speculation that he's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect (Gretzky's retirement) would have to do more with  
this than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Tuele, another member of the Oilers' organization who also  
is a close friend of Gretzky, was fairly sure he would not retire 
after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say this, Wayne has not shared any final decision with  
anyone,'' said Tuele, Edmonton's vice president and public 
relations head. ``Wayne's dad doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuele, in an interview from San Jose, Calif., where the Oilers  
are playing the Sharks, said he has had conversations with Gretzky 
over the season. While not able to share anything private, Tuele 
said, ``I honestly don't think he'll retire (now). He'll keep 
playing until (he can't).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers broadcaster John Davidson raised the issue on Sunday  
while broadcasting the Detroit-Pittsburgh game on Fox TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``... The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very close,  
feel there's a very strong possibility Sunday will be the last time 
he plays,'' Davidson said in part, referring to the Rangers' 
season-ender against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden.

<HEADLINE>  Is Gretzky Leaving at Season's End? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY KEN RAPPOPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the New York Rangers' season nearly over,  
the speculation is just beginning: Will Wayne Gretzky retire? 
</P>
<P>
	As far as one old friend is concerned, the answer won't come  
easily, and certainly won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Wayne, he would weigh everything and talk to a lot of  
people before making that decision,'' said Bruce MacGregor, 
assistant general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. ``It's a very 
hard decision. When you retire, it's for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacGregor, instrumental in bringing Gretzky to the Oilers, said  
``it wouldn't shock me'' if he did call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a frustrating year for him ... the way the club has  
played and the (neck injury). Those kind of injuries bother you a 
lot,'' MacGregor said in a telephone interview from Edmonton. 
``Maybe there's some speculation that he's not 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect (Gretzky's retirement) would have to do more with  
this than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Tuele, another member of the Oilers' organization who also  
is a close friend of Gretzky, was fairly sure he would not retire 
after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say this, Wayne has not shared any final decision with  
anyone,'' said Tuele, Edmonton's vice president and public 
relations head. ``Wayne's dad doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuele, in an interview from San Jose, Calif., where the Oilers  
are playing the Sharks, said he has had conversations with Gretzky 
over the season. While not able to share anything private, Tuele 
said, ``I honestly don't think he'll retire (now). He'll keep 
playing until (he can't).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers broadcaster John Davidson raised the issue on Sunday  
while broadcasting the Detroit-Pittsburgh game on Fox TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``... The people very close to Wayne ... and I mean very close,  
feel there's a very strong possibility Sunday will be the last time 
he plays,'' Davidson said in part, referring to the Rangers' 
season-ender against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday night's game against Tampa Bay, Gretzky denied  
that he was planning to announce his retirement at the end of the 
season.

<HEADLINE> AP Wins Pulitzer for Clinton Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pictures of a somber President Clinton, his  
head bowed, a defiant Linda Tripp and a determined Monica Lewinsky. 
Those images and more captured a president's turbulent struggle 
against impeachment and won a Pulitzer Prize for The Associated 
Press for feature photography. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a news story that dragged on for more than a year,  
requiring round-the-clock vigilance by members of the AP's photo 
team in Washington and around the nation. Day after day, they spent 
long hours tracking the cast of characters embroiled in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys were there at 5 o'clock in the morning,'' Sandra K.  
Johnson, chief of the Washington bureau, said during a celebration 
after Monday's announcement. ``They were there at midnight. They 
were at the courthouse. They were at (special prosecutor) Ken 
Starr's house every single day. And this is the payoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Sweets, assistant chief of bureau for photos, congratulated  
the photographers who captured the images in the field as well as 
staff who worked the story in the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, this might be corny -- it sounds like the Oscars when  
you say you had a lot of support. I can't say enough about the team 
effort -- the photo editors, the photographers, the support staff. 
They worked long, hard hours for 13 months to make AP a success,'' 
Sweets said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 winning photos were taken by nine photographers in  
Washington and five from Baltimore, Boston, Dallas and Portland, 
Maine. Among them were Khue Bui's images of Mrs. Tripp, the woman 
who secretly taped Ms. Lewinsky's phone calls, and presidential 
confidant Vernon Jordan; Dan Loh's close-up of Ms. Lewinsky and her 
attorney William Ginsburg; and Joe Marquette's photo of a tense 
confrontation on Capitol Hill between Clinton lawyer David Kendall 
and Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran photographer Scott Applewhite's photo of a downcast  
President Clinton walking through stately columns at the White 
House was among the winners. ``I knew it was something special when 
I brought it back to the office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Martinez Monsivais took his winning photo the second day  
on the job in Washington. He snapped a photo of former Rep. Bob 
Livingston, R-La., who was in line to become speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day was orientation,'' Monsivais said. ``The second  
day -- Livingston walking down the Capitol steps.'' For a Pulitzer.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A helicopter carrying a seven-member  
Ecuadorean military mapping team crashed in a stretch of Amazon 
jungle, the armed forces said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers have found three bodies and the remaining four are  
presumed dead, said Col. Jorge Brito, head of an Ecuadorean 
peacekeeping delegation in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident has not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter crashed Sunday about 225 miles south of Quito  
near Ecuador's border with Peru, where the Andean nations fought a 
brief war in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The nations signed a peace treaty in 1998 that ended more than  
50 years of tense border relations that had led to three wars.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The colonel who led Nicaragua's State  
Security Office under the leftist Sandinista administration is 
coming out of retirement to help the former rebels campaign in 
upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenin Cerna, 50, announced Sunday he would resume his work with  
the Sandinista National Liberation Front political party ahead of 
the 2001 presidential and congressional elections. He will also 
help with mayoral races in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerna had left political life after the Sandinistas lost power  
in 1990 elections. He retired from the Nicaraguan army last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During his term as president of the security office, Cerna was  
the target of several complaints of human rights violations. 
President Arnoldo Aleman said last month he was tortured by Cerna 
and other Sandinista leaders while imprisoned in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader and former Nicaraguan  
president, applauded Cerna's announced return to political 
activity.

	PACHUCA, Mexico (AP) -- A woman who allegedly took revenge on her  
relatives by serving them a strychnine-laced drink -- killing her 
mother-in-law, sister-in-law and 2-year-old nephew -- has been 
captured after four years on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, acting on a tip from family members, arrested Viviana  
Islas Meneses over the weekend in the Hidalgo state town of 
Singuilucan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old woman allegedly served her family poisoned atole  
-- a traditional Mexican sweet drink made from milk and corn -- 
because she felt she had been cheated from an inheritance and 
mistreated by her relatives, police said. 
</P>

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican prosecutors  
on Monday ordered investigators to exhume the body of a television 
producer who died after undergoing cosmetic surgery at a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Television producer Isabel Vargas, 49, died April 3 after  
undergoing liposuction at the Bellas Artes clinic in Santo Domingo. 
Prosecutor Francisco Dominguez Brito said she was the fourth woman 
to die after operations by surgeon Edgar Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas' family initially failed to tell prosecutors about her  
death, saying it was a private matter. Vargas and Contreras were 
friends, and Vargas helped the doctor with his public relations 
campaign after the death of a U.S. patient, Dhelmalyz Rios Rivera, 
on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras' brother and partner in the clinic, Frank Contreras,  
was convicted in Puerto Rico on charges of practicing medicine 
there illegally and is a fugitive from a 14-year prison sentence. 
</P>

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The foreign minister vigorously  
criticized a top U.S. human rights official on Monday for accusing 
Colombia's military of having sponsored right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh used ``unfair terms''  
during a weekend conference on human rights in Medellin, the 
country's second-largest city, said Foreign Minister Guillermo 
Fernandez de Soto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unacceptable ... to describe the Colombian security  
forces as one more agent of the violence plaguing the country, 
putting them on an equal footing with the armed insurgency, 
paramilitary groups and drug traffickers,'' Fernandez de Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to the conference, Koh said government security  
forces had committed ``extrajudicial killings, disappearances and 
massive internal displacement in the name of combating 
paramilitaries and guerrillas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military aid to Colombia is restricted by law to  
anti-narcotics operations, in large part due to concerns about 
links between the army and violent paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's military leaders insist they have severed such ties.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Put Piazza, Reed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the New York Mets keep winning games, they  
keep losing players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Rick Reed was put on the 15-day disabled list before  
today's home opener against Florida because of a torn calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not an Achilles' tendon injury,'' general manager  
Steve Phillips said, describing the diagnosis as good news. ``It's 
likely at the end of the 15 days we'll be able to activate him and 
put him back in the rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 16-11 with a 3.48 ERA last season, hurt his left leg  
trying to stretch his game-tying RBI single into a double during 
Sunday's 6-3 win at Montreal. ``I don't want to miss my next 
start,'' he said. ``I don't think I will. It started to stiffen up 
but after I got some ice I was able to walk around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star catcher Mike Piazza also was put on the disabled list  
today, retroactive to Saturday, after spraining the medial 
collateral ligament in his right knee during a rundown Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York filled the roster spots by recalling left-hander Rigo  
Beltran and outfielder Terrence Long from Norfolk of the 
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine said Allen Watson would take Reed's turn  
in the rotation against Philadelphia this weekend and that Todd 
Pratt would be the everyday catcher until Piazza returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss a big cog, but we're going to be able to  
play,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza didn't want go on the disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor made it clear that if I do play, and I run the  
bases and suddenly have to change directions it could be a full 
tear and that would mean surgery,'' he said. ``Considering that 
possibility, I figure that this is for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets returned home after a 5-2 opening road trip and sent  
Bobby Jones (1-0) against Livan Hernandez (0-1) on a cold but sunny 
afternoon at Shea Stadium. The Mets had an advance sale of about 
45,000 coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels like the season didn't start yet because we've  
been on the road, so tomorrow I guess the season will start,'' 
closer John Franco said after Sunday's game. ``We'll have our own 
crowd behind us, rather than everyone else's. We've played two home 
openers, Florida and here, and now we'll have our own, and guys can 
get settled in and get apartments and get used to the home 
surroundings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the Mets' first game at Shea Stadium since their  
season-ending flop last year, when they went 0-5 and scored just 
seven runs to finish one game behind Chicago and San Francisco in 
the NL wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will be Bobby Bonilla's first game at Shea Stadium in a  
Mets uniform since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some pretty good opening days for New York, so that's  
one positive thing,'' Bonilla said. ``But everybody's really pretty 
fired up. We were able to do a nice job here in Montreal, which was 
very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have won five of six since losing their opener at Miami  
last Monday. But because of Piazza's injury, many fans worry 
whether their offense will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they'll be disappointed that he's not there because  
he's such a great player,'' first baseman John Olerud said. ``He's 
the guy for us, offensively speaking, and so it definitely hurts 
having him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we have a good team. We have a lot of good guys on  
this team, guys that can swing the bat, so hopefully we can pick up 
the slack until he comes back.''

<HEADLINE> Deere Files Patent Suit Vs. Kubota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere &AMP; Co. has sued Kubota Corp., charging  
that the Japanese company copied a component in Deere's line of 
lawn and garden tractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The patent infringement lawsuit was filed last week in U.S.  
District Court in Rock Island, Ill., and names as defendants 
Osaka-based Kubota, Kubota Tractor Corp. of California and Westbay 
Equipment Co. of Monmouth, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere claims Kubota has violated one of its patents over the  
past year by manufacturing and selling tractors with a suspension 
mechanism designed to ensure even grass cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubota denied its design infringes the Deere patent.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kubota intends to vigorously protect its rights with respect  
to the technology in dispute,'' Larry Nenneman, a spokesman for 
Kubota Tractor, said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deere says it patented the design in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	Deere asked the federal court to permanently stop Kubota from  
infringing the patent and award Deere unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbay Equipment is named as a defendant because Kubota  
products are sold there and it is in the jurisdiction covered by 
the federal court in Rock Island, Deere said. 
</P>
<P>
	Westbay did not immediately return a message seeking comment  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Beaver Sought in D.C. Tree Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wildlife experts in the nation's capital are  
hoping to arrange a family reunion for a beaver clan, but they 
aren't saying where. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of three beavers thought to be responsible for killing or  
damaging 14 cherry, white cedar and holly trees around the Tidal 
Basin since April 1 were caught over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were an adult female and a yearling,'' said Julia Long, a  
biological sciences technician with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The beaver still prowling the area that is home to the city's  
famous cherry trees and monuments is probably the father of the 
yearling and mate of the female, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	He may be feeling blue right now.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is believed beavers mate for life, and young beavers live  
with their parents for about two years,'' Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	The male beaver may be somewhat difficult to catch, said John  
Adcock Jr., owner of Adcock Trapping Service, which was called in 
by the National Park Service to catch the tree-chomping rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, with his mate and child gone, he is probably  
leery,'' said Adcock, who set the humane traps. 
</P>
<P>
	The two beavers caught Saturday and Sunday were released to a  
wooded area right away, Long said, adding, ``You can't keep wild 
animals in captivity. It's too stressful for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would not identify the location of the beavers' new home,  
citing their privacy. ``They're too famous,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When papa beaver is caught, he will be released in the same  
place, Long said, adding that there is no doubt a family reunion 
will take place. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can find each other by odor,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Apologizes for Memo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in four months, ``60  
Minutes'' apologized on the air over a report on drug smuggling, 
acknowledging that a memo cited by the newsmagazine had turned out 
to be bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology was part of a settlement reached with a customs  
official who had sued CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' issued the apology Sunday night over a report on  
April 20, 1997, about drugs flowing across the U.S.-Mexico border 
at San Diego. Correspondent Lesley Stahl, who made the apology, 
emphasized that CBS stuck by the underlying theme of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, ``60 Minutes'' founder Don Hewitt apologized for  
airing a June 1997 story based on a British documentary about 
smugglers swallowing heroin in latex gloves to get past 
authorities. An investigative panel later found that the 
documentary producers had faked locations and paid actors to 
portray drug couriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on smuggling along the Mexican border cited a memo  
supposedly written by Rudy Camacho, the San Diego district director 
of the Customs Service, calling for customs agents to quickly 
process trucks owned by a company linked to Mexican drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service in Washington investigated the memo and  
found that it was fake and that no preferential treatment was 
offered, Stahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' reported in February 1998 that the memo was  
declared bogus. But Camacho sued the newsmagazine, which launched 
its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concluded that we were deceived, and ultimately so  
were you, our viewers,'' Stahl said. ``Under the circumstances, we 
regret that any reference to that memo or to Mr. Camacho's 
connection with it was included in our original report and 
apologize for any harm to Mr. Camacho's professional reputation and 
any distress caused to him and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said that CBS and Camacho ``have  
come to an amicable settlement.''

<HEADLINE> 91-Year-Old To Miss Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARWICH, Mass. (AP) -- He is a symbol of the Boston Marathon as  
enduring as Heartbreak Hill. But this year, Johnny Kelley will be 
sitting out the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The 91-year-old, who has finished the marathon 58 times and won  
twice, is recovering from colon surgery in January and a subsequent 
bout with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been a patient at the Cranberry Pointe Rehabilitation and  
Skilled Care Center since March 1 and is scheduled to stay at least 
another week. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday at the rehabilitation center, Kelley  
said he would miss next Monday's 103rd running because it could 
hamper his improving health. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need a little more time,'' said Kelley, who won the race in  
1935, 1945 and placed second seven times. ``I feel going up to 
Boston I would lose all I've gained here. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be sure I'll miss it. It's the greatest marathon in  
the whole world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race director Guy Morse said Kelley would be missed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Johnny has always listened to his body, and his body is  
telling him it's not quite ready yet,'' Morse said. ``He'll be 
there in spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though this year's race is out, Kelley said he has his sights  
set on the 2000 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the biggie,'' he said. ``Hopefully I'll be myself long  
before then. I'll be the belle of the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley has run Boston 61 times. The past four years, he has  
served as grand marshal of the marathon.

<HEADLINE>  Magician Shaky After Week in Coffin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seven days after he entered a transparent coffin  
set 6 feet into the ground, magician David Blaine was helped out 
today looking fit but slightly wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of spectators cheered when the 3-ton tank of water that  
covered his see-through coffin was lifted and Blaine sat up and 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw something very prophetic ... a vision of every race,  
every religion, every age group banding together, and that made all 
this worthwhile,'' he told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The shirtless, tattooed magician donned sunglasses and stepped  
unsteadily out of the coffin, aided by security people, and was 
taken to a doctor for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
	The coffin had given him only about 6 inches of head room and 2  
inches on each side. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaine has insisted the subterranean sojourn was not a publicity  
stunt -- he has a television special scheduled Wednesday on ABC -- 
but a test of will. His hero, Harry Houdini, planned a similar feat 
but died in 1926 before he could perform it. 
</P>
<P>
	Two guards from Sunrise Security Services Inc., hired by the  
event's promoter, had been at the site 24 hours a day. ``I attest 
to the fact that Mr. Blaine has not left the premises for the past 
seven days,'' company president William T. MacLellan said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Air was pumped into the coffin, but Blaine said he was given no  
food and received only 3 to 4 tablespoons of water a day through an 
intravenous tube. A plastic container and tube handled toilet 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	In case of emergency, there was a panic button in the coffin, a  
crane to quickly remove the water tank, and round-the-clock medical 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people had visited the grave on Manhattan's upper  
West Side, waving and staring through the water in the tank at 
Blaine in his Plexiglas coffin. Spokesman Pat Smith estimated that 
some 75,000 people had visited the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't stop thinking about it, being confined to such a  
small space,'' said Tavia Trusch, 42, a dance teacher from Queens 
who was back Sunday for a second visit with her 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	``We waved and gave thumbs up'' to offer encouragement, she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa Corporan, a 20-year-old cashier, got into the line of  
spectators a second time Sunday to get another look and take a 
picture. ``He's a handsome guy,'' she explained.

<HEADLINE> Do You Need Home Networking? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like fashion, personal computing has its fads. And the latest  
fad to come prancing down the silicon runway is home networking. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks are wiring schemes that link computers and allow them  
to share peripherals and software. They first appeared in 
businesses and came in two flavors: LANs (Local Area Networks) that 
link computers within a room or a building, for example; and WANs 
(Wide Area Networks) that link computers in different buildings, 
even in various parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel jumped on the bandwagon in early April by introducing  
Anypoint Home Network, a pair of widgets that use ordinary 
telephone wiring to link two PCs on a network with data rates of up 
to one megabit per second. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's offering and the accompanying software cost $189 --  
almost twice as much as the $99.95 HomeFree, a similar package from 
Diamond Multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both packages support the Home Phoneline Network standard, which  
allows the phone line to be used for a voice call while it's being 
used by the PCs. The difference is that Diamond's product is a pair 
of PCI add-on cards, while Intel's is a free-standing unit with its 
own power supply. It connects through the parallel port. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're uncomfortable about opening your PC case, Intel gets  
the nod. If not, check out the Diamond product. (Intel also has a 
PCI card entry, which costs $79 for a single card vs. $49.95 for 
Diamond's.) 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the possible benefits of home networking are few for  
most people. Promoters will say, for example, that it's cheaper for 
two computers to share a printer. But with excellent inkjets 
available for less than $200, that's hardly a compelling argument. 
The high data transfer rate makes it easy to transfer files, say 
promoters. True, but for most of us, a floppy disk will do. 
</P>
<P>
	Another use touted is multiplayer games, the kind now played on  
the Internet. The idea of several family members, each in a 
different room, playing ``together'' via a network is something 
best left for sociologists to ponder. It's just not the same as 
playing a board game on the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, promoters point to shared Internet access. And there,  
if you have a cable modem or other high-speed Internet access, they 
have a point. But that's a subset of a subset -- by the end of the 
year, it's expected that only about 17 percent of U.S. homes will 
have more than one PC, according to the Yankee Group research firm. 
And cable modems and other high-speed Internet connections are 
available, but hardly ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
	That's for home use, which is what promoters are pitching. But  
the folks who ought to be rushing to buy these devices aren't Mom 
and Pop, but the thousands of small businesses that could benefit 
from networking their office PCs. From the business perspective, 
these phone-line-based networks are cheap, reliable, and easy to 
install and maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	Real-estate offices, small newspapers, brokerage firms, law  
offices and others could reap immediate benefits from being 
networked, including having a single high-speed Internet connection 
available to all. If those businesses don't check out these 
offerings, they're not paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Some caveats: Diamond Multimedia wants to see PCs that have at  
least 16 megabytes of RAM and run Windows 95 or 98, while Intel 
will cruise on eight megabytes of RAM. So that pretty much bags any 
thoughts of dusting off that old 386 in the attic and networking it 
with the new Pentium. And the network likes to find less than 500 
feet of phone wire, which isn't a problem for most homes and small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Diamond Multimedia and Intel products are widely available  
at retail, and also on the Web.

passenger train, flinging cars off the track and setting them 
afire. Yugoslavia's army press center said rescue workers were at 
the scene, 180 miles south of the Yugoslav capital, pulling charred 
bodies from the wreck. NATO issued a statement saying it had hit a 
rail bridge it considered an important military supply line and 
that ``incoming military reports indicate there was a train on or

report on the shootout between the outposts of Morina and Kosare

mortar fire hit police headquarters and a residential area in the 
Albanian border town of Tropoja, killing two people and wounding 
nine, said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
which monitors the frontier. Western officials expressed deepening

they intend to file a $130 million lawsuit against two Internet 
porn sites, several computer game companies and the makers and

lawsuit claims that confessed shooter Michael Carneal, a

officials say the league's cross-ownership rules would prevent 
Angelos from owning the Orioles and the Redskins. The NFL has put 
off a decision on the sale of the Redskins after team owners were 
unwilling to support a winning bid selected by the estate of late

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Slide / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid renewed worries over the world 
supply situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures led the declines, falling sharply on perceptions  
rainfall in U.S. winter wheat-growing areas will benefit a crop 
already considered in excellent shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were on the defensive from the beginning of trading in  
follow-through selling from Friday's weak close. Futures tumbled 
Friday on U.S. Agriculture Department projections that inventories 
at the end of the marketing year will stand at 134.06 million 
metric tons, up from 127.39 projected a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans fell mostly in sympathy with the decline in  
wheat and amid fears farmers this spring will plant record acreage 
of those crops, boosting inventories at a time when there will be 
heavy competition from bumper crops in Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 7 cents to $2.69 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.14 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 2 1/4 cents to 
$1.14 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans fell 3/4 cent to $4.79 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures advanced sharply on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while beef futures retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .20 cent to 65 cents a pound; May feeder  
cattle fell .10 cent to 73.72 cents a pound; June lean hogs rose 
1.10 cents to 55.82 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose the limit 
3 cents to 55.20 cents a pound.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices advanced early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes for new export 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the gains, rising on speculation that Russia this  
week will seek to purchase soybeans and soybean meal under U.S. 
subsidized trade programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn edged higher on rumors that South Korea and Taiwan are in  
the market for U.S. corn and in continued buying tied to 
expectations for planting delays following a weekend of bad weather 
across the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat gained mostly on the strength of corn and soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $2.77 1/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.19 a bushel; May oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.17 a 
bushel, and May soybeans rose 3 cents to $4.83 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 148.46 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes were solidly higher Monday  
afternoon, and the Dow industrials were in record territory, after 
erasing sharp early losses tied to a stunning earnings warning from 
Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 148.46 at 10,322.30, after losing 23.86 points on Friday. That 
put the Dow on track to easily surpass its previous closing high, 
the 10,197.70 of Thursday. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks had 
dropped as low as 10,096.69 in the early going this morning, down 
77.15 points, before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad indexes had also recovered by midafternoon. The Nasdaq  
composite was up 11.58 at 2,604.63, and the S&AMP;P 500 index was up 
9.17 at 1,357.52, shaking off early losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was still a trouble spot, down 6 7/8 points, or by 22  
percent, at 24 1/16. Compaq said after markets closed Friday that 
it expected earnings would come to 15 cents a share for the first 
quarter, less than half analysts' average estimates of 31 cents. 
The company in part blamed industrywide price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile computer stocks also were sharply lower, with Dow  
component IBM off 3 13/16 at 182 1/2. AOL was down 2 1/8 at 157 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But the effect of Compaq's announcement was confined to  
computer-related stocks, and the market quickly got back on its 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bears are saying, `I give up,' ... and the bulls are  
saying, `I can't wait any more; I've got to buy,' '' said Larry 
Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. ``Not only 
does the Dow recover, but the breadth recovers, the Russell 2000 
recovers, the whole shooting match recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of small- and medium-sized companies was  
up 6.83 points, or 1.68 percent, at 412.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than touching off an all-out selling spree, Compaq's  
warning and the weakness in technology issues appeared to be 
sending traders to seek shares in other sectors that may have been 
undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said  
such a ``rotation'' appeared evident in strength today among 
consumer issues, some economically sensitive shares and financial 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of big Dow stocks were higher, including International  
Paper, up 1 15/16 at 46 1/8, and Caterpillar, up 2 5/16 at 51 1/16. 
Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating for Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues overtook decliners at midafternoon by 4 to 3 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 558.38 million 
shares, up from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 2.07 percent in  
anticipation of a selloff on Wall Street. In Europe, the DAX index 
in Frankfurt rose 0.68 percent, and the FT-SE 100 index in London 
rose 0.5 percent, although the CAC in Paris slipped 0.19 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bear Stearns Profit Up 22.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. reports its profit jumped  
22.6 percent in its latest quarter, easily beating analysts' 
expectations, as the investment bank and brokerage was helped by 
Wall Street's heightened activity and an increased flow of new 
securities offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news Monday, Bear Stearns stock jumped nearly 2 percent,  
or by 87 1/2 cents, to $50.50 a share in afternoon trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns earned $204 million, or $1.42 a share, in the third  
fiscal quarter ended March 26, up from $166.3 million, or $1.09 a 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Its earnings per share topped the $1.15 average that analysts  
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Its revenue after interest expense rose 17.1 percent to $1.23  
billion from $1.05 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Cayne, the company's president and chief executive,  
said extremely active stock markets led to higher levels of 
customer orders. Commission revenue derived from arranging stock 
purchases or sales for clients, for example, rose 8.4 percent. 
Revenue from principal transactions involving securities that the 
firm owned climbed 32.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment banking revenue rose 16 percent on strong  
underwriting activity in both stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear Stearns was the lead underwriter on a number of  
Internet-related initial public stock offerings including that of 
Prodigy Communications Corp. It was also a leader in corporate debt 
offerings including global offerings for Ford Motor Credit Co., 
Lucent Technologies Inc. and General Motors Acceptance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Bear Stearns  
earned $404 million, or $2.63 a share, down 17.2 percent from 
$488.2 million, or $3.21 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month 
revenue after interest expenses fell 4.1 percent to $2.99 billion 
from $3.12 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines reflected a weak first fiscal quarter when bond  
markets were hurt by turmoil in Russia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Foreign Ministers Gather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- With no end in sight to the air war  
against Yugoslavia, NATO foreign ministers gathered today to 
demonstrate their unity. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told 
reporters the alliance ``will not be divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 NATO ministers used the meeting at alliance headquarters,  
called by Albright, to show Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
that they are holding together despite his tough resistance to the 
bombing campaign, now in its 20th day. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, ``The purpose of this  
meeting is to send a very strong and clear message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright denied any discussion of partition as a possible option  
for the future of Kosovo. ``There is no discussion of that,'' she 
said. ``That is not an option that is being considered, certainly 
not an option I favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Albright had said she would not rule out partitioning  
Kosovo as part of a settlement, provided there were ways to protect 
Orthodox Christian holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
	There ``has to be recognition'' of the Serb offensive that has  
forced the expulsion of more than one-third of the ethnic Albanians 
in what the United States has denounced as a ``scorched-earth'' 
campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers also expressed their concern about the hundreds of  
thousands of displaced ethnic Albanians still inside Kosovo and 
reports that they are without food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned with the fate of all the displaced  
people there in Kosovo,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana. ``This is another humanitarian crisis in the making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military authorities, he said, have been asked to see how the  
displaced can be helped. Air drops would be difficult because 
low-flying cargo planes would be exposed to anti-aircraft defenses 
and any food dropped could end up feeding Serbian military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is not only trying to stop Milosevic's brutality, but to  
care for his victims,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO now says Milosevic must agree to an international  
peacekeeping force in Kosovo before the bombing can be halted. In 
recent days, officials have dropped the requirement of a 
``NATO-led'' force, a possible move to win approval from Russia and 
even Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO has to have a core leadership role in it and has to have  
a command structure in it that works,'' Albright said. ``We are in 
no way trying to hide NATO. NATO is the crucial aspect of this 
operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 aircraft were en route to the war zone to step up  
the air operations against Yugoslav army and police forces accused 
of waging a systematic campaign to empty Kosovo of ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Military and political leaders insist the airstrikes have been  
effective in damaging the Yugoslav military's support network and 
in hitting ground forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials say Serb activity in Kosovo has slowed and  
most Yugoslav forces are now engaged in dispersing and defending 
against allied air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly Milosevic is trying to divide NATO,'' Albright told  
reporters at the end of the four-hour meeting. ``But we will not be 
divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What kind of political agreement is now possible in Kosovo is a  
more difficult question than it was three weeks ago. Originally, 
the peace accord reached in Rambouillet, France, was to be the 
basis for any settlement. That agreement called for wide autonomy 
for Kosovo, a province within Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians, who once made up 90 percent of the province's  
2 million people, largely favored independence for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Rambouillet framework appears less realistic, but no  
viable alternatives have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says ground troops will only enter the province in a  
``permissive environment,'' either as part of a NATO implementation 
force or to escort refugees back into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem faced by the NATO ministers is how to repair  
relations with Russia, which has strongly opposed the allied 
bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stressed Russia's constructive role in Bosnia, where it  
still has troops within the NATO-led force, and in the peace 
negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in February and 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary of state will meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor  
Ivanov on Tuesday in Oslo, Norway. ``The discussion tomorrow is to 
see where we can find common ground again,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 2, Senators 0 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Mark Parrish and Scott Mellanby scored 33  
seconds apart and Kirk McLean made 37 saves as the Florida Panthers 
ended an eight-game winless streak with a 2-0 win over the Ottawa 
Senators on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was just the second for Ottawa in its last 13 home  
games as Florida won the season series against the Senators, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottawa had a chance to break the shutout when Ted Donato was  
awarded a penalty shot late in the first period after Panthers 
defenseman John Jakopin smothered the puck in his own crease. But 
Donato couldn't beat McLean with a wrist shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida was outshot 19-4 in the first period and 39-11 overall.  
</P>
<P>
	It was McLean's 22nd career shutout as he extended his career  
record against the Senators to 6-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference-leading Senators failed to increase their  
two-point lead over the New Jersey Devils, who lost 4-2 to the New 
York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida was missing 10 regulars from its lineup due to injuries,  
but managed to win for the first time this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish put Florida ahead with his 23rd when he sneaked behind  
the Ottawa defense and deflected a great feed from Ray Whitney past 
Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt, for the game's first shot and goal 
3:20 into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next shot, 37 seconds later, Mellanby ripped one from the  
top of the circle and over Tugnutt's outstretched arm for a 2-0 
Florida lead and Mellanby's 17th goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tugnutt, who was 2-0-1 before this season against Florida, lost  
his third straight decision against the Panthers.

<HEADLINE> GM Board Finalizes Delphi Spinoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the big  
parts-making unit of General Motors Corp., will become an 
independent company May 28 when its remaining stock is distributed 
to GM shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's board voted Monday to distribute 80 percent of Delphi  
shares worth $7.8 billion. The move follows an initial public 
offering in February, in which GM sold nearly 18 percent of Delphi 
at $17 a share. The other 2 percent of shares are to fund a trust 
for retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax-free spinoff is expected to be completed with the  
distribution of 80 percent of Delphi shares worth $7.8 billion on 
May 28. The other 2 percent of shares are expected to fund a trust 
for retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	GM executives say the split will allow Delphi to expand its  
business and form relationships with other automakers that have 
been reluctant to work with a supplier owned by one of their 
competitors. GM is expected to remain Delphi's largest customer 
well into the next decade, but the spinoff will allow the world's 
largest automaker to turn to lower-cost, independent suppliers for 
more of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that both companies will become stronger and more  
competitive in our respective businesses,'' GM chairman Jack Smith 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi is the largest auto parts manufacturer in the world,  
followed by Ford Motor Co.'s Visteon Automotive Systems, and 
Johnson Controls Inc. The spinoff marks a drastic shift away from 
GM's history as a vertically integrated automaker that made its own 
parts and assembled them into cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote was expected, though GM had previously said only  
that the spinoff would occur before year's end. By spinning off the 
rest of Delphi before summer, executives expect GM will be 
better-positioned to negotiate a separate contract with its largest 
union, the United Auto Workers, in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But the timing is unlikely to please UAW leaders, who have  
publicly opposed the deal. The union represents 46,000 of Delphi's 
198,000 workers; they currently are under GM's national contract. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW president Stephen Yokich had urged GM to retain at least 51  
percent ownership of Delphi, fearing wages of Delphi workers will 
suffer once it is fully independent. The UAW is expected to push 
for Delphi's contract to be the same as what GM negotiates for its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also is worried about what an independent Delphi may  
do with its U.S. plants that it considers unprofitable or 
noncompetitive. UAW leaders have long argued that GM has not 
invested in those plants to make them competitive with independent 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have assured the leadership of the United Auto Workers, the  
International Union of Electrical Workers and our other unions that 
we are prepared to promptly enter into agreements to protect the 
interests of Delphi employees affected by the spinoff,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW spokesman Roger Kerson said the UAW would have no comment on  
Monday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi employees would continue to receive their GM benefits and  
their pension plan would remain fully funded. If GM receives a 
favorable IRS tax ruling by May 14, it plans to contribute 2 
percent of its Delphi shares into a trust that can be used to fund 
benefits for hourly worker retirees. Otherwise, those shares will 
also be distributed to GM shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, earned $370 million  
on sales of $28.4 billion in 1998, which places it among America's 
largest corporations. It operates 168 manufacturing plants, 40 
joint ventures and 27 technical centers in 36 countries.

<HEADLINE> Yankees May Stay in Bronx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After years of complaints and threats, George  
Steinbrenner now says the New York Yankees might stay right where 
they are -- at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	With the team's lease expiring in 2002, the team's principal  
owner said in Crain's New York Business magazine today that he may 
exercise an option and remain in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some options on that lease. ... We can extend it at  
least five years,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner has repeatedly delayed a decision on whether the  
World Series champions would remain at their hallowed ballpark, 
move to the West Side of Manhattan or to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has no deal from New Jersey and would face  
considerable opposition if he wanted to go forward with the West 
Side plan. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks jumped Tuesday after Wall Street  
rallied to another record close. The dollar edged higher against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 275.16 points, or 1.67 percent, to  
16,782.56 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the index 
shed 348.23 points, or 2.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.48 yen in early trading, up 0.12 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also higher than its level of 120.19 yen 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices bounced back after the  
Dow Jones industrial average rose 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 
close at 10,339.51 Monday. The previous high of 10,197.70 was set 
last Thursday. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks is now up 12.6 
percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Japanese stocks plunged amid worries that earnings at  
Japanese technology companies would be lower than forecast. Those 
fears were sparked after major computer manufacturer Compaq said 
Friday its first-quarter earnings would be less than half analysts' 
average estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 19.90 points, or 1.51 percent, to 
1,336.10. The TOPIX closed down 26.71 points, or 2.00 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar hardly reacted to monthly  
reports by the Economic Planning Agency and the Bank of Japan, 
which said that economic deterioration was coming to a halt in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if fundamentals are going to depend on the monthly  
reports,'' said Koichi Udagawa, assistant manager of the treasury 
division at Daiwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the dollar was traded at 130.44 yen, up  
from 130.12 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.570  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.565 percent, driving its price 
down to 102.01 yen from 102.06 yen.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Isn't Forgotten Golfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Until he slipped on the same green jacket he  
wore five years ago, Jose Maria Olazabal had become the forgotten 
Spaniard, caught between the past and the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Fading into the twilight was Seve Ballesteros and his five major  
championships, two of them at Augusta National in which he 
conquered the treacherous greens with a majestic short game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63rd Masters was the debut of the heir apparent to  
Ballesteros -- Sergio Garcia, a cocky kid who won the British 
Amateur last summer at 18 and became the first European to take low 
amateur honors at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was lucky to be playing again. He spent 18 months out  
of golf with a lower back problem that left him unable to walk. He 
returned in 1997 and won the Turespana Masters, but made the Ryder 
Cup only as a captain's pick. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the forefront Sunday with a dynamic display of  
pressure golf on the back nine of Augusta, and suddenly he was the 
toast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros, who missed the cut and returned home, sent his  
congratulations by fax and released a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won with authority from beginning to the end,'' Ballesteros  
said. ``This triumph will compensate him, in part, for some of the 
bad moments that destiny wanted him to face with courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar also  
offered congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory of faith,'' the Spanish sports newspaper Marca wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper El Pais added: ``Spanish golf is at the top  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Greg Norman for as long as it took him to line up a  
20-foot birdie putt on the 13th, Olazabal put three strokes between 
them over the next three holes and won by two strokes over Davis 
Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal became the only player to win two Masters in the 1990s,  
and the 11th European to win in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one, I'm pretty sure I'm going to enjoy much more than  
the one I had before, for several reasons,'' Olazabal said, tugging 
at the lapel of his green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important one is the problems I went through to be  
here,'' he said. ``And also because it's my second major. I won my 
first one ... you might say, 'OK, it might have been a lucky week.' 
But when you win two -- especially the way I did it -- means a lot 
more to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Olazabal won is the how the Masters is almost always  
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew that after his 66 in the second round gave him the lead  
going into the weekend. He knew after he made three straight bogeys 
early in the final round that knocked him out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked down the steep slope toward the sixth tee, turned to  
caddie Brenden McCartain and said, ``We still can make a few pars, 
make a birdie or two, and I think we have a chance to win the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the alterations at Augusta, one thing never changes  
-- the Masters doesn't begin until the 10th tee has the sun begins 
to drop behind the Georgia pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal played those final nine holes better than anyone. He  
became only the fourth champion since 1981 to go without a bogey on 
the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner is not going to be the one who makes the most  
birdies, but the one who makes the fewest mistakes,'' Colin 
Montgomerie predicted after the first round, alluding to the rough, 
the extra length on the 17th hole and the newly raised green on No. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal did a little of both. Augusta required no less.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time he and Greg Norman walked to the 10th tee, five  
players were tied for the lead at 5-under -- those two, along with 
Davis Love III, Steve Pate and Bob Estes. David Duval and Lee 
Janzen were another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, they dropped from the top.  
</P>
<P>
	Pate, who made a Masters-record seven consecutive birdies on  
Saturday, made 10 straight pars on Sunday. That might have sufficed 
on a most difficult day at Augusta when no one broke 70 in the 
final round for the first time since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pate finally buckled at the 11th with a bogey, and then fell  
out of contention for good with bogeys on the 16th and 17th. Estes 
dropped only one shot, also at No. 11, but never could get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the only other player among the contenders who didn't  
make a bogey, but even his unforgettable chip-in on No. 16 -- he 
played the shot 25 feet left the flag and let it catch the slope 
into the hole -- wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal took care of that, and he also took care of Norman.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Spaniard knew the green jacket he wore Sunday  
was the same he was given in 1994 because his name on the inside 
was misspelled -- Olazabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many knew about him in 1994, and not many cared about him  
this time. The cheers were for Tom Lehman then, and they were even 
more raucous for Norman on Sunday, everyone pulling for him to end 
a career of misery at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman didn't collapse like he did in 1996. He didn't get burned  
by a miracle shot like the one Larry Mize pulled off in 1987. He 
didn't make a blunder on the 18th hole like 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't play the kind of golf Olazabal produced, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a heartbreak,'' said Norman, who finished third after  
playing in the final group at a major for the eighth time. ``Look 
at that leaderboard. There's probably a lot of other guys here who 
can sit here and say they're heartbroken, too.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Gold Rises in Europe </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar fell against other major currencies in  
European trading Monday. Gold prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0853, up from $1.0794 Friday, and the  
British pound was quoted at $1.6160, up from $1.6070. The dollar 
was also lower against the Japanese yen, buying 119.94, down from 
120.85 Friday. In New York, the dollar bought 120.21 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in New York, the euro was quoted at $1.0844, and the  
British pound was quoted at $1.6149. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Friday: 1.4767 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.4809, and 1.4950 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.5000. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar was worth: 1.8021 German marks, down from 1.8120; 
6.0440 French francs, down from 6.0771; 2.0305 Dutch guilders, down

<HEADLINE> Sugar Down on Oversupply Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled Monday to 13-year lows on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as harvesting of a bumper Brazilian 
crop loomed, bringing more supplies to a world awash in sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat futures fell sharply, as did copper.  
</P>
<P>
	Sugar prices, already depressed for months on a world supply  
glut, tumbled amid reports that early harvesting in Brazil are 
pointing to a second consecutive record crop. Brazil is the world's 
largest producer, and its abundant supplies last year also came 
amid bumper crops from other major suppliers, including Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the concerns were reports that Thailand's milled  
production is coming in more than 18 percent higher than last 
year's weather-reduced output. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvests in Australia and South Africa also were expected to be  
larger than last year, said Prudential Securities analyst Arthur 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Those larger supplies are being met with weaker demand from Asia  
and Russia, two areas hit by financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy losses were trimmed in late trading as some investors  
covered their positions. Raw sugar for May delivery settled down 
.18 cent, or 3.3 percent, at 5.25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat tumbled for the fourth consecutive session on the Chicago  
Board of Trade on perception weekend rainfall in U.S. winter 
wheat-growing areas and in China will benefit crops already 
considered in excellent shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were on the defensive from the beginning of trading in  
follow-through selling from Friday's weak close, in which futures 
tumbled on U.S. Agriculture Department projections that inventories 
at the end of the marketing year will stand at 134.06 million 
metric tons, up from 127.39 projected a month earlier. That would 
put inventories at their highest in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 7 cents to $2.69 1/4 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  
world inventories continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Metal Exchange in its daily report said its warehouse  
supplies rose 3,100 metric tons to 721,575 metric tons, keeping 
inventories near a record high reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains came despite expectations warmer weather would  
increase U.S. construction demand for the industrial metal in pipes 
and wiring. Analysts said with many producers increasing output to 
try to match falling prices, the only way to sustain a rally would 
be to see increased construction activity out of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	May copper fell 1 cent to 63.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> British Truckers Protest Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Hundreds of trucks jammed London's Park Lane  
alongside Hyde Park and the centers of seven other major cities 
Monday to protest higher taxes on diesel fuel and heavy vehicle 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The truckers, who say European rivals have lower operating  
costs, rumbled down four major highways leading into the capital -- 
the M1, M2, M4 and M25 -- bringing traffic to a halt in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests also disrupted traffic in Scotland's two major cities,  
Edinburgh and Glasgow; in England's northern cities of Newcastle, 
Middlesbrough and Manchester; and in Truro and Plymouth in 
southwest England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Party government called the protest a form of  
blackmail and argued that British trucking companies' overall costs 
were lower than those in Germany, France and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public will not understand -- and nor do I -- why today some  
hauliers have decided to penalize, disrupt and inconvenience the 
public once again,'' Transport Minister John Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was the second since last month, when the government  
in its annual budget increased gasoline taxes and increased the 
cost of an annual license for a 40-ton, five-axle truck from $4,000 
to $9,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said the 40-ton truck, which Britain is required to admit  
under European Union regulations, created the equivalent in road 
damage and pollution of 10,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	He said French, German and Dutch truckers paid higher corporate,  
income and capital gains taxes, and had higher labor costs.

	AP Wins 2 Photography Pulitzers  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press has won both of the 1999  
Pulitzer photography awards. The spot news photography award was 
given for a portfolio on the embassy bombings in Kenya and 
Tanzania. The feature photography award was given for a collection 
of photographs of the players and events surrounding Clinton's 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky and his impeachment. This was the first 
time a single news organization has won both of the photography 
awards.

	Washington Post Wins Pulitzer  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Washington Post won the Pulitzer Prize for  
public service today for a series on reckless gunplay by city 
police officers. The prize for breaking news reporting was awarded 
to The Hartford Courant for coverage of a shooting rampage in which 
a lottery worker killed four supervisors and himself. The prize for 
investigative reporting was awarded to The Miami Herald for 
exposing pervasive voter fraud in a mayoral election that was later 
overturned. The prize for explanatory reporting was awarded to 
Richard Read of The Oregonian of Portland, Ore., for showing the 
impact of the Asian economic crisis on a local french fries 
exporter.

	'The Hours' Wins Pulitzer Prize  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Cunningham won the Pulitzer Prize for  
fiction today for his book ``The Hours.'' The drama award was 
presented to ``Wit,'' a play by Margaret Edson. The history prize 
was given to ``Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898'' by 
Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace.

	Serbs Claim 9 Killed on Train  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavian reports say nine people  
were killed and 16 injured today when a NATO missile struck a 
passenger train, flinging cars off the track and setting them 
afire. Yugoslavia's army press center said rescue workers were at 
the scene, 180 miles south of the Yugoslav capital, pulling charred 
bodies from the wreck. NATO issued a statement saying it had hit a 
rail bridge it considered an important military supply line and 
that ``incoming military reports indicate there was a train on or 
near the bridge at the time of the strike.''

	Serbs Say 150 Kosovo Rebels Dead  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia is claiming 150 Kosovar  
rebels were killed in a battle near the Albanian border. The Tanjug 
report on the shootout between the outposts of Morina and Kosare 
could not be independently confirmed. The report came a day after 
mortar fire hit police headquarters and a residential area in the 
Albanian border town of Tropoja, killing two people and wounding 
nine, said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
which monitors the frontier. Western officials expressed deepening 
concern, meanwhile, over the more than half-million ethnic Albanian 
refugees who have fled or been driven out of Kosovo by Yugoslav 
forces over the past 20 days.

	McDougal Innocent of Obstruction  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal was found innocent of  
obstructing Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation and the judge 
declared a mistrial today on the other two charges against her. The 
charges stemmed from Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury 
questions about the truthfulness of President Clinton's testimony 
in a 1996 Whitewater trial. She said she thought Starr was ``out to 
get'' Clinton.

	Colombia Plane With 46 Aboard Lost  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An Avianca passenger plane carrying 46  
people disappeared today on a domestic flight over the Andes 
mountains. The twin-engine Fokker-50 turboprop, with 41 passengers 
and five crew members, left the northeastern city of Bucaramanga at 
10:32 a.m. en route to Bogota, the capital, the civil aviation 
authority said. The Bucaramanga-Bogota flight normally takes 65 
minutes. Two hours after it took off, there was still no word on 
the plane's fate.

	British Truckers Protest Taxes  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Hundreds of trucks jammed London's Park Lane  
alongside Hyde Park and the centers of seven other major cities 
today to protest higher taxes on diesel fuel and heavy vehicle 
licenses. Traffic was brought to a halt in some places. The 
truckers say European rivals have lower operating costs. The Labor 
Party government called the protest a form of blackmail and argued 
that British trucking companies' overall costs were lower than 
those in Germany, France and the Netherlands.

	Parents Blame Shooting on Hollywood  
</P>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The parents of three students killed during  
a shooting spree at a Kentucky high school claim that media 
violence inspired the boy who fired the shots. The parents said 
they intend to file a $130 million lawsuit against two Internet 
porn sites, several computer game companies and the makers and 
distributors of the 1995 film ``The Basketball Diaries.'' The 
lawsuit claims that confessed shooter Michael Carneal, a 
14-year-old freshman at Heath High School at the time of the Dec. 
1, 1997, shootings, was influenced by the violence in the movie and 
video games like ``Doom.''

	Dow Up 121

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Dow industrials were  
up 121.82 to 10,295.66. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange 
led decliners 1,639-1,291. The Nasdaq was up 9.39 to 2,602.44.

	Angelos May Bid for Redskins Again  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos is  
considering a new bid of at least $625 million to buy the 
Washington Redskins, The Washington Post reported today. But NFL 
officials say the league's cross-ownership rules would prevent 
Angelos from owning the Orioles and the Redskins. The NFL has put 
off a decision on the sale of the Redskins after team owners were 
unwilling to support a winning bid selected by the estate of late 
Redskins Owner Jack Kent Cooke. Howard Milstein withdrew his 
group's $800 million bid last week when it became clear he would 
not receive the necessary votes.

	Cleveland Indians Draw Protests  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- American Indians who consider the Cleveland  
Indians' ``Chief Wahoo'' logo derogatory burned a homemade wooden 
coffin today outside Jacobs Field. About 40 protesters peacefully 
demonstrated outside the ballpark before the home opener against 
Kansas City. Similar protests against the grinning, red-faced Chief 
Wahoo have resulted in arrests in recent years, but there were no 
arrests today.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- American Indians who consider the Cleveland  
Indians' ``Chief Wahoo'' logo derogatory burned a homemade wooden 
coffin today outside Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 protesters peacefully demonstrated outside the ballpark  
before the home opener against Kansas City. As police watched from 
a distance, the protesters burned the coffin which had a wooden 
sculpture of Chief Wahoo laid out inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar protests against the grinning, red-faced Chief Wahoo  
have resulted in arrests in recent years, but there were no arrests 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Five protesters who were arrested on suspicion of arson last  
year after a straw figure of Wahoo was burned have sued city police 
for allegedly violating their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The five, including Vernon Bellecourt, president of the American  
Indian Movement, were jailed for about a day and released without 
being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday, accuses the Cleveland Police  
Department and former Chief Rocco Pollutro of wrongful arrest, 
illegal imprisonment and violation of the right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thrust of the Native American community is to call  
attention to the racism of the Chief Wahoo logo,'' attorney Terry 
Gilbert said. ``Going to Jacobs Field and demonstrating is a 
critical part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hastings declined to  
comment on the allegations because he has not seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's entitled to say whatever he wants to say. That's what the  
courts are for,'' Hastings said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the arrests last spring, three protesters were  
arrested during the 1997 World Series after burning a straw effigy 
of Chief Wahoo. A municipal judge eventually threw out the case.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Prices Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets fell Monday, with  
share prices slumping in Tokyo after a warning by Compaq Computer 
that its earnings will fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed  
348.23 points, or 2.07 percent, closing at 16,507.40. Before 
Monday's loss, the Nikkei index had gained 3.5 percent, or 565.44 
points last week, including Friday's 8.94-point gain, or 0.05 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing weaker demand and severe price competition, Compaq  
Computer warned Friday in the United States that first-quarter 
earnings would fall below analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning raised worries that earnings at Japanese technology  
companies may also be lower than forecast, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Losers included high-technology and blue-chip shares such as  
Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Hitach Ltd. amid worries about 
earnings outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.36 yen in late  
afternoon, down 0.60 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below 
its late Friday level of 120.98 yen in New York.

sharp advances.

<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chip shares, fell 169.36 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 
11,744.74. On Friday, the index had gained 186.26 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors took profits after the key index gained more than 800  
points over the past three sessions, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had largely discounted a quarter-point cut by local  
banks in the deposit rate to 3.75 percent on Friday, they said. 
Major Hong Kong banks also cut their lending rates for their best 
customers to 8.50 percent from 8.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Philippine Stock Exchange, where the  
key index rose 2.5 percent following a fresh cut in the central 
bank's key overnight rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies  
surged 52.2 points to 2,157.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Monday, the Philippine central bank reduced its overnight  
borrowing and lending rates by another 0.375 points to 11.375 
percent and 13.375 percent, respectively, to help lower the cost of 
capital and jump-start lending activity.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Experts for the Allied Pilots Association say that  
American Airlines' losses from a sickout earlier this year are more 
than $50 million less than the company estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Heal, an economist at Columbia University, and Robert  
Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst, both testified for the union 
Monday that the losses they had calculated range between $1.4 
million and about $4.5 million, depending on the time period 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	That's compared to the $58.7 million estimate made by American's  
parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., which has yet to 
call witnesses in the compensatory damages hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses are being debated before U.S. District Judge Joe  
Kendall, who will determine damages in the civil contempt of court 
charge against the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA was held in contempt for failing to encourage its  
members to return to their cockpits during a 10-day job action in 
February. A total of about 2,500 pilots called in sick, resulting 
in the cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall ordered the union to make a $10 million down payment,  
about 25 percent of the union's worth, toward damages resulting 
from the three days that pilots defied his back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	At Monday's hearing, union attorneys argued that only the 233  
pilots who called in during the 21 hours immediately following the 
temporary restraining order should be considered as ignoring the 
judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was unimpressed with that argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I said in that order was, the harm caused here wasn't  
just the people who called in but the hundreds and hundreds who 
failed to clear themselves off the sick list,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst for the dispute that led to the sickout was an  
inability by the union and American to agree on the assimilation of 
the recently purchased Reno Air, an issue that has yet to be 
resolved. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated 
into American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
affected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled, but are 
expected to resume. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing will start up again Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Defense Tries To Save Ng's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who took part in the torture  
killings of 11 people, including two baby boys, should be spared 
execution because his strict upbringing in Hong Kong led to his 
crimes, a psychiatrist testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Charles Ng began their bid Monday to save his life  
by calling the psychiatrist, who said Ng was beaten by his father 
and had a mental disorder that made him follow the dictates of 
co-conspirator Leonard Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers also said Ng he helped other inmates while in  
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will realize that he is a person of value and he should be  
saved,'' defense attorney William Kelley told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, an emigre from Hong Kong and former U.S. Marine, was  
convicted Feb. 24 of killing six men, three women and two baby boys 
in a spree of kidnapping, bondage and sadism. The penalty phase 
began last month and resumed after a three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stuart Grassian, a Boston psychiatrist, said Ng's severe  
personality problems developed early in life because of a strict 
upbringing in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never encouraged as a child to be assertive,'' Grassian  
said. ``He was always morbidly shy as a child and when teachers 
would say that he didn't speak in class, his father would beat him 
with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt debased, devalued. He was told he was stupid.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ng loved animals, Grassian said, and was devastated when one of  
his pet chickens was killed by a family member and wound up on the 
dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassian said that once Ng came to the United States he sought  
guidance from authority figures because he was incapable of 
determining his own path in life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley also called Ng's aunt, Alice Shum, who testified that Ng  
had a normal childhood except for extreme shyness and beatings by 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just like any other kid,'' she said through a Cantonese  
interpreter. ``A regular kid. He was shy. He was quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were shown greeting cards that Ng created for his aunt in  
jail. On one he had drawn an angel and expressed profuse thanks for 
his aunt's support. 
</P>
<P>
	She wept as she showed photographs of a little boy in short  
overalls posing with sisters and cousins. She said she still loves 
him. ``I feel that it's really a pity ... just because he knew some 
bad people he became what he is,'' the aunt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The outline of Ng's life was offered to explain his drift into  
crime, first in the Marine Corps, where he joined others in 
stealing weapons, and then later when he joined Lake in 
torture-murders at Lake's home in Wilseyville, 150 miles east of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassian also testified that Ng lacked the inner rage that  
motivates cult leaders such as Charles Manson and Jim Jones. He 
said Ng would be more likely to become a follower of such men but 
would never have the resources to lead a cult himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles Ng was the type of person that would have ended up in  
South America drinking Kool-Aid,'' he said, referring to the 
suicides at Jonestown in Guyana. ``I don't think he was predestined 
in terms of violence or sadism.'' The psychiatrist said he found Ng 
to be ``very unusual'' in his ability to accept punishment without 
emotional eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng spent 14 years in jail before going on trial in the murders.  
Before the murder case, the Marine Corps weapons case had put him 
in Leavenworth federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake killed himself with cyanide after police arrested him for  
shoplifting in San Francisco in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Eric Lindros was  
released from the hospital Monday, four days after undergoing 
surgery to remove a blood clot from his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros left the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania  
around 10 a.m. Monday, said Dr. Larry Kaiser, a chest surgeon who 
performed the operation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he looks great; he's certainly feeling 100 percent  
better than he felt the other day,'' Kaiser said. ``From the chest 
surgery standpoint, he's breathing well, feels well, (is) moving 
around, not really having much pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser had removed a blood clot that was pressing against the  
lower lobe of Lindros' right lung, keeping it from fully expanding. 
Lindros, 26, underwent the surgery after suffering a setback in his 
recovery from a collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 90-minute procedure, called video thoroscopy, doctors  
inserted a tube and a microscopic camera through two small 
incisions in Lindros' chest. The fluid and clotted blood was in the 
area between the lung and the diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros currently is on medication to regenerate the blood he  
lost, Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still dealing with the situation with his blood counts,  
and that's going to take a while until they begin to come up,'' 
Kaiser said. ``Hopefully over the next couple weeks, those counts 
will come up significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know for sure what caused about six pints of blood  
to seep into Lindros' chest after a 2-1 victory over the Nashville 
Predators on April 1. Kaiser said the blood likely seeped from his 
lung, adding that he found no evidence that a blood vessel had 
ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers' prolific scorer and team captain flew to  
Philadelphia after being released from a hospital in Nashville, 
Tenn., on April 8. He was expecting to go to the arena and meet 
with teammates before their game with Pittsburgh. Those plans were 
canceled after he ran a fever in excess of 102 degrees and doctors 
discovered the fluid buildup in his chest cavity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, one of the toughest players and most dominant scorers  
in the NHL, has endured numerous injuries during his career, 
although none have been as serious as the latest one. The chance of 
Lindros returning for the playoffs is considered slim, and Rod 
Brind'Amour has been elevated to captain while Lindros is out.

<HEADLINE> Education Dept. Reviews Test Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kentucky was among the states feted last month  
for large gains in the reading test scores of its fourth-grade 
students. But the state may have helped its scores by not including 
large numbers of children with disabilities in the latest test 
sample in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, federal officials are investigating whether Kentucky and  
other states participating in a voluntary national test showed 
significant increases from 1994 simply because they excluded more 
special education students. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials say there's no evidence of wrongdoing by the  
states, which were following new federal rules to exclude the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Pascal D. Forgione Jr., chief of the Education Department's  
statistical branch, said the question for the department is whether 
the excluded students, if they had taken the test, would have 
performed poorly, thus negating much of the gain in scores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in a decade, many states posted large gains  
in the reading scores of fourth-grade students, the only grade 
level available for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-ranking states, many of which suffered political fallout  
over previous poor showings, also made gains, drawing the attention 
of Vice President Al Gore, who celebrated the gains last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those states also left out more special education  
students from the testing sample. Kentucky pulled out 10 percent of 
students selected for its 1998 sample, compared with 4 percent in 
1994. Louisiana pulled 13 percent in 1998, up from 6 percent in 
1994. And Connecticut, the nation's highest-scoring state, removed 
10 percent of the students selected to participate, compared with 6 
percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say states can't attribute the gains to better student  
performance. The theory is that a state's overall scores could rise 
by excluding high portions of students with disabilities, who often 
make poorer scores. 
</P>
<P>
	But, there are no scores for excluded students, so no one can  
say for sure, Kent Orlander of the Lexington-based Family 
Foundation, which has questioned Kentucky's reform efforts, 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said, the increase is troubling: ``If you're  
taking out so many more students who are judged as less likely to 
achieve well on the test, how can you confidently assert that you 
are, in fact, improving?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Parks, spokesman for Kentucky's Department of Education,  
said critics can't assume the excluded children would have dragged 
down scores. ``Nobody knows what those students would have scored 
if they had taken the test,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department study, to be done by the nonprofit  
Educational Testing Service, will use a model to compare test 
scores of included students with the estimated performance of the 
types of students who were excluded, Forgione said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, scheduled for release in May, could lead officials  
to change policies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, called the National Assessment of Educational  
Progress, is administered by a nationwide group established by 
Congress. The test is given roughly every two to four years to a 
nationwide sample of children in three grade levels in core 
subjects like math and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	It is generally the only way to compare student progress  
nationwide, because states' tests vary. States are not required to 
participate in national testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, the national test does not offer special  
consideration to students with special needs, such as reading a 
test to a blind student. But state-sponsored tests often give such 
special help in an effort to compare their results with others. 
</P>
<P>
	Special students were allowed to take the national test --  
without special help -- if they spent at least half their time in a 
mainstream classroom. But for the 1998 test, states had to follow a 
federal law that required that special-needs students get special 
help on any test comparing their results with others. The national 
test-givers responded by having states exclude those students from 
the national sample, regardless of whether they were in mainstream 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states, who already excluded special-needs children from  
taking the NAEP test, had consistent or lower exclusion rates. The 
nationwide percentage of students excluded did not change. Thus, 
Education Department officials say their study would not affect the 
overall national test results for 1998, which showed a slight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states also exclude children with limited English, but  
those percentages changed less than for special-education children 
and are believed to have had less of an impact on test scores.

<HEADLINE> Speeds Again Climbing at Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's only April, and the top Indianapolis  
500 practice speeds already are faster than Billy Boat's 
pole-winning average of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be a while before anyone approaches Arie Luyendyk's  
near-240 mph records for practice and qualifications, thanks to the 
Indy Racing League changes in car and engine setups two years ago. 
But speeds again are beginning to climb -- as they always do. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Greg Ray turned a fast lap at 227.072 mph, while  
Billy Boat clocked at 224.456 and four others were above 223. Boat 
qualified for the pole last year with a four-lap average of 
223.503. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions were just really good today,'' Ray said. ``You  
aren't going to see 227 mph in the month of May unless the 
conditions are cool. When you go out and scrub at 225, you know the 
conditions are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the first crash in four days of practice, John Paul  
Jr. was taken to Methodist Hospital for x-rays after his car blew 
an engine and spun into the second-turn wall. He suffered a bruised 
left knee and a bruised right foot, but no fractures. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, 25th as a rookie in 1997, started from the middle of the  
front row and led 18 laps before a gearbox failure left him 18th 
last year. He joined Team Menard this season after Tony Stewart 
left for the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray also was the fastest on Saturday at 223.914 mph and on  
Sunday at 222.695. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fast laps Monday were by Arie Luyendyk at 224.215, Scott  
Sharp at 223.547, defending Indy winner Eddie Cheever Jr. at 
223.253, and Sam Schmidt at 223.281. 
</P>
<P>
	The open testing for rookies and veterans, scheduled to end on  
Sunday, was extended through Tuesday because of wind gusts of more 
than 30 mph and temperatures in the mid-50s over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions (Sunday) didn't feel right,'' Ray said. ``It's  
best to listen to your instincts. The track (temperature) dropped 
15 degrees in an hour and another 6 degrees in five minutes after 
that. It's taking too long to warm up the tires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk had a lap at 223.176 on Saturday. Mark Dismore and  
Roberto Guerrero improved their top laps Monday to 222.651 and 
222.623, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do fast times around this track in the wind, but you  
can't fine-tune the car,'' said Luyendyk, a two-time winner who 
will retire as a driver after the May 30 race. ``Since the wind is 
so strong out there, you just have to adjust your line and the way 
you drive, which can vary on how much the wind blows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, Cheever and Buddy Lazier are the only former winners  
on the Indy entry list; Dave Steele, Robby McGehee, Mike Borkowski, 
Wim Eyckmans, John Hollansworth Jr. and Jeret Schroeder are the 
rookies that have been assigned to entries, although four other 
first-year drivers also passed their rookie tests over the weekend 
and are eligible to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers without rides is Lyn St. James, the 1992 Indy  
rookie of the year, who is still looking for sponsorship. St. 
James' best finish in six starts at Indianapolis was 11th as a 
rookie. She was entered but did not qualify last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not retired. My desire and hunger are stronger than  
ever,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Full practice will begin May 15.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds IRS Does Fewer Audits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- As the tax deadline approaches, more and  
more Americans can rest easy: the IRS is doing fewer audits. 
Wealthy people can relax even more, as a university study shows the 
rate is dropping fastest for high-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Internal Revenue Service audited slightly less  
than 1.2 million returns out of more than 120.3 million filed, 
Syracuse University researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than 20 percent less than in 1997, when more than  
1.5 million Americans were audited either by mail or in 
face-to-face meetings, according to the study by the Transactional 
Records Access Clearinghouse. In 1996, nearly 2 million taxpayers 
were audited. 
</P>
<P>
	``For an average taxpayer ... this should be welcome news,''  
said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, a 
300,000-member watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of people who get W-2s and have small  
investments comply with the tax system the best they can and don't 
need to be hauled into an audit,'' Sepp said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The audit rate dropped for every income class but was sharpest  
for those earning $100,000 or more, according to the report, which 
was based on IRS data. 
</P>
<P>
	High-income taxpayers still faced the highest audit rate of any  
income class, at 1.66 percent in 1998. But a decade earlier, 11.4 
percent of high-income taxpayers were audited. During that same 
period, the number of people reporting incomes of more than 
$100,000 nearly doubled to 6 million, TRAC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	For individuals earning less than $25,000, the audit rate was  
slightly more than 1 percent in 1988 and 1.14 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar pattern was seen in IRS audits of corporate tax  
returns, where an overall decline was led by the largest 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the IRS audited just under 3 percent of all companies.  
Last year, that number had fallen to just under 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the IRS audited one out of every two corporations with  
assets of $250 million or more. Last year, the IRS audited slightly 
more than one out of every three of those giants. 
</P>
<P>
	A general decline in audit rates accelerated in 1995 when the  
Republican-controlled Congress cut IRS spending sharply and 
required more emphasis on customer service. The steps followed 
hearings at which taxpayers complained of abusive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the cutbacks reduced the number of auditors by 5  
percent, to 15,800. Another 400 employees have been transferred 
into phone answering positions where they help answer taxpayers' 
questions, said Tom Smith, the IRS executive in charge of measuring 
the agency's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials said their ability to collect taxes hasn't been  
hurt by the cutbacks or the smaller number of audits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still look at returns,'' said Laurie Ruffino, a spokesman  
for an IRS regional office in Buffalo, N.Y. ``If you're doing 
things that are going to raise some issues, it's going to get 
looked at. You may not get called, but it'll get looked at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the trend of fewer audits is placing richer  
taxpayers and larger corporations on an honor system, since many of 
their sources of income are not subject to the same level of 
reporting required from employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fewer traffic policemen you have, the more chances people  
are going to take,'' said Donald C. Alexander, a Washington tax 
lawyer who was commissioner of the IRS during the Nixon 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chairman of the House subcommittee that  
oversees IRS spending, said he was concerned that the IRS would 
jeopardize its law enforcement power if it keeps cutting back on 
audits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because they're auditing doesn't mean they can't also be  
polite and customer friendly,'' Kolbe said. ``My concern is that we 
not have the pendulum swing so far that we are failing to do the 
legitimate law enforcement function.''

<HEADLINE> Capitol Statues May Be Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kansas gave the nation Dwight David Eisenhower  
and Amelia Earhart, two of the 20th century's most celebrated 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	But it will take an act of Congress to get them -- actually,  
their likenesses -- into the U.S. Capitol because only Congress can 
evict two now-obscure Kansans blocking their way. 
</P>
<P>
	No state has gotten permission to replace a statue in the  
135-year-old National Statuary Hall Collection. The Kansas 
Legislature, hoping to become the first, sent Congress a resolution 
last month urging that the statues of former U.S. Sen. John James 
Ingalls and former Gov. George Washington Glick be removed to make 
room for Earhart and Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to the stately Statuary Hall is strewn with obstacles.  
</P>
<P>
	First, Congress will have to decide whether exchanges are  
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has never happened in the history of the collection,''  
said Barbara Wolanin, the curator in the Capitol architect's 
office. ``The law says each state can give two statues. There just 
is no provision, no precedent at this point. There would have to be 
a legally valid system worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Rep. Jim Ryun: ``We're blazing a trail here.'' The  
Republican's district includes aviator Earhart's hometown of 
Atchison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls, a Republican senator from 1873 to 1891, also was a  
newspaper editor who championed anti-slavery forces and worked to 
bring Kansas into the union as a free state. Glick was elected the 
state's first Democratic governor, serving from 1883 to 1885. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the architect's office, a statue given to the  
collection becomes the property of the federal government upon its 
unveiling. Forty-six states have contributed two statues each; 
Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming each are eligible to 
donate one more. 
</P>
<P>
	Statuary Hall showcases 38 from the collection; the others are  
located throughout the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes well-known founding fathers and civil  
war heroes, including Virginia's George Washington and Confederate 
Gen. Robert E. Lee; Massachusetts' Samuel Adams and Confederate 
President Jefferson Davis of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also such beloved figures as Oklahoma's Will Rogers --  
visitors rub his bronze toes for luck -- and golden-cloaked King 
Kamehameha I of Hawaii. The most recent addition is Colorado's John 
L. Swigert, the late astronaut on the Apollo 13 flight who coolly 
uttered, ``Houston, we have a problem'' when an explosion ripped 
apart an oxygen tank 200,000 miles away from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas matter now rests with the House Committee on  
Administration, which likely will seek advice from the Capitol 
architect's office on structural and space questions and on other 
implications of potential swaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress ignored a 1971 plea from Kansas to replace the likeness  
of Glick, a Democrat, with a sculpture of Eisenhower, although 
today's GOP-led Congress might be more friendly to a former 
Republican president. Earhart would become the seventh woman 
represented in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the effort is Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., who wants the  
swap tied to a planned World War II veterans memorial on the 
National Mall. He said it is fitting to honor Eisenhower, the war 
hero-turned-president. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiahrt plans to raise private money to pay for casting or  
chiseling new statues, moving them to Washington and bringing the 
others home to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the World War II memorial and an  
Eisenhower statue in the Capitol would be ``a nice tie-in,'' said 
J. Carter Brown, chairman of Washington's Fine Arts Commission. But 
he cautioned about setting a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Congress has to weigh whether it means this constant  
revisionism going on, and that gets very political,'' he said. 
``Perhaps it's better to leave things where they are, even if 
they're not ideal, by virtue of what you are opening up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing states to alter the collection might result in a hall  
of presidents, said George Gurney, the National Gallery of Art's 
curator of sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might have Ronald Reagan turning up,'' Gurney said.  
(California's statues -- of orator Thomas Starr King and Spanish 
missionary Father Junipero Serra -- were given in 1931). 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gurney does not necessarily see harm in allowing  
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a gamble, but as far as I'm concerned, I  
think the states probably ought to have some control over what's 
there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Favors Bonds' Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds' first wife didn't sign a  
prenuptial agreement voluntarily and is entitled to a community 
property share of his baseball earnings from their marriage, a 
state appeals court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, if it survives further appeals, would give Sun Bonds  
half of the money and property her ex-husband accumulated during 
their marriage -- from 1988, when he was a young outfielder with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates who had earned $106,000 the previous year, to 
1994, when he was an $8 million-a-year player for the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in May 1994 and divorced seven months  
later. Sun Bonds was given custody of their two children, $20,000 a 
month in child support and $10,000 a month in alimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Bonds, a Swedish immigrant who had met Barry Bonds in  
Montreal in 1987, signed an agreement with him the day before their 
wedding in February 1988 that allowed all earnings to be held 
separately and relinquished the right to community property. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled 2-1 that the  
agreement was invalid because the evidence showed that Mrs. Bonds' 
action was not truly voluntary. The ruling sets standards for 
challenges to other premarital agreements in California -- and could 
invalidate thousands of them, the dissenting justice warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had previously discussed plans to keep their earnings  
separate, but when the agreement was presented, Bonds was 
accompanied by two lawyers and a financial adviser, while his 
future wife, who spoke limited English, was accompanied only by a 
Swedish friend, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Bonds' lawyers told her she might want her own attorney,  
but no one mentioned any reason she would need an attorney, such as 
the potentially conflicting interests in the agreement, the court 
said. It said the agreement was poorly written, filled with 
typographical errors and difficult for a non-lawyer to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering the law office, Sun was told by Barry's agent  
that there would be no wedding the next day unless she signed the 
agreement, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts must ``strictly scrutinize'' prenuptial agreements in  
which one side has no lawyer and no meaningful opportunity to get 
one, said the opinion by Justice James Lambden. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bonds' lawyers ``devised the agreement and played a  
confusing and misleading role when explaining the agreement.'' Mrs. 
Bonds had ``unequal bargaining power,'' lacked time to review the 
papers, and ``felt pressured to sign'' an agreement that had severe 
economic consequences, Lambden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding Justice J. Anthony Kline agreed. But dissenting  
Justice Ignazio Ruvolo said the court should not second-guess 
findings of voluntariness by the trial judge, who heard from both 
parties, and should not create obstacles to the enforcement of 
valid agreements.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Monica Lewinsky scandal inspired three  
Pulitzer Prize-winning entries, while The Oregonian was honored 
Monday for using the story of a local french fry business to 
illustrate an overseas economic meltdown. The Associated Press, The 
New York Times and The Wall Street Journal each won two of 
journalism's most prestigious awards.

disclosed the sale of American technology to China with U.S. 
government approval despite the risk to national security. The 
series prompted investigations and changes in U.S. policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for international reporting went to The Journal for  
coverage of the Russian financial crisis. The Journal's Angelo 
Henderson also won for feature writing category for his portrait of 
a Detroit pharmacist driven to violence by his encounters with 
armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``God is so good,'' Henderson said. ``This is just amazing ...  
You hear all your life, in journalism -- Pulitzer. And it's 
something in your heart you always aspire to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment provided ample material for yet another winner:  
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's David Horsey, who won for 
editorial cartooning. One cartoon, ``Beltway Apocalypse,'' shows 
``Mount Monica'' erupting in a chaotic capitol. Another had Clinton 
asking his beleaguered wife and daughter if it would be helpful for 
him to say he could feel their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Read's series in The Oregonian of Portland, which won  
for explanatory reporting, followed a load of frozen french fries 
from a field in the Northwest to a McDonald's in Indonesia. By 
chronicling the fate of one load of fries, the series illuminated 
the causes and effects of Asia's economic woes and the layoffs, 
stock market gyrations and financial uncertainty that followed in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A brass band played as the newspaper's 350 staffers used  
champagne to wash down hundreds of orders of McDonald's french 
fries to celebrate the honor.

<P>
	The AP swept both photo categories for the second time --  
something no other organization has done. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the AP's winning feature photos, shot by Susan Walsh,  
showed a grimacing Clinton vowing to stay in office while his wife, 
poised and resolute, stood behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier or more proud,'' said Louis D.  
Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming. It's just a tremendous tribute to the  
staff,'' said Vin Alabiso, AP vice president and executive photo 
editor. ``We are definitely getting out the champagne!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including the 1999 awards, the AP has won a total of 45  
Pulitzers, including 27 for photos. The New York Times has won 79, 
The Washington Post 32, and the Los Angeles Times 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post won the public service award for a series on reckless  
gunplay by city police officers who had little training or 
supervision. Leonard Downie Jr., the paper's executive editor, said 
the staff was ``particularly pleased because this is the kind of 
the journalism that we're all in this business for -- journalism 
that really matters, it makes a difference in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for breaking news reporting was awarded to The  
Hartford Courant in Connecticut for coverage of a shooting rampage 
in which a lottery worker killed four supervisors and himself. The 
paper's publisher, Marty Petty, told his staff: ``The winning of 
this award really validates what we all knew: This is the best 
newsroom in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald won for investigative reporting for exposing  
pervasive voter fraud in the city's mayoral election. The 
computer-assisted reporting led to the election results being 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald's projects editor, Judy Miller, held back tears as  
she thanked everyone who worked on the project. ``Everyone involved 
was simply a beat reporter who stepped up in a big way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for beat reporting was awarded to Chuck Philips and  
Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times for stories on corruption 
in the entertainment industry, including illegal detoxification 
programs for wealthy celebrities and a resurgence of payoffs to 
disk jockeys for promoting certain songs. ``My God, the Pulitzer. I 
mean, who would have imagined anyone even read it?'' Philips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for criticism went to Blair Kamin of the Chicago  
Tribune for his coverage of architecture, including a series on the 
development of Chicago's lakefront. Kamin's entry was moved to beat 
reporting by the Pulitzer jury, but was returned to criticism by 
the Pulitzer board, which makes the final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The award for editorial writing went to the Daily News of New  
York for its campaign to rescue Harlem's Apollo Theatre from 
financial mismanagement that threatened the landmark's survival. 
``This is very special because we feel like the Apollo Theatre 
deserves better treatment than it's getting,'' said the News' 
editorial page editor, Michael Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first year that online exhibits were permitted in  
the public service category, so long as they were accompanied by 
exhibits representing traditional print stories. One finalist, The 
Philadelphia Inquirer, included in its submission an online entry 
dealing with the police manipulation of crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulitzer Prizes were also awarded for literature, drama and  
music. Michael Cunningham's ``The Hours,'' a complex novel related 
to Virginia Woolf's ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' won the award for fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Edson, an Atlanta kindergarten teacher, won the drama  
award for her play ``Wit,'' which portrays a woman's battle with 
ovarian cancer. But she said she would never leave teaching: 
``We're in the middle of studying insects and nothing can take me 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The history prize was given to ``Gotham: A History of New York  
City to 1898'' by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, which grew out 
of a project the two history professors worked on as graduate 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The biography prize went to ``Lindbergh,'' A. Scott Berg's book  
about the aviator Charles Lindbergh. The poetry prize was given to 
former U.S. poet laureate Mark Strand for ``Blizzard of One.'' The 
general nonfiction prize was awarded to John McPhee for ``Annals of 
the Former World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Wagner won the music prize for her composition  
``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pulitzers, the most prestigious awards given for journalism,  
are presented annually by Columbia University. The awards carry a 
prize of $5,000, except for public service. The organization that 
wins in that category gets a gold medal.

	Serbs Claim 9 Killed on Train  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavian reports say nine people  
were killed and 16 injured today when a NATO missile struck a 
passenger train, flinging cars off the track and setting them 
afire. NATO confirmed a rail bridge was hit by bombs from allied 
aircraft and that a train was nearby at the time of the airstrike. 
Yugoslavia's army press center said rescue workers were at the 
scene, 180 miles south of the Yugoslav capital, pulling charred 
bodies from the wreck. NATO says it has taken ``extraordinary 
measures to avoid collateral casualties'' during the bombing 
campaign.

	Cohen: Ground Troops Not Needed

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen says U.S.  
commanders tell him there is no need for ground troops at this 
point of NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia. Cohen said there is no 
consensus in the United States, the Congress or NATO for 
introduction of ground forces. However, calls increased in Congress 
for just such an option as members began returning to town after a 
two-week spring recess. The Clinton administration and military 
officials say Milosevic has backed himself into a corner where loss 
of power and trial as a war criminal may be inevitable.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal was found innocent of  
obstructing Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation and the judge 
declared a mistrial today on the other two charges against her. The 
charges stemmed from Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury 
questions about the truthfulness of President Clinton's testimony

on his unsecured personal computer at home after he stepped down as 
the nation's top spy, a department official said today. But the 
department recently sent the case back to the CIA for possible 
disciplinary action, the official said. Newsweek magazine disclosed 
that in late 1996, CIA technicians found 31 secret files on 
Deutch's home computer. The CIA spent a year weighing the case 
before sending it to the Justice Department and the department 
spent another year reaching its decision, the magazine said.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third day in a row, Air  
Force controllers worked feverishly today to try to rescue a $250 
million missile-warning satellite that's stranded in a useless 
orbit. If the Defense Support Program satellite cannot be salvaged, 
the failed mission will have cost taxpayers $682 million, including 
the rocket cost. The satellite was launched Friday aboard an Air 
Force Titan rocket. It was the first flight of a Titan IV since a 
much more expensive spy satellite was destroyed in a $1 billion 
explosion shortly after liftoff last August.

	Continental's Fare Hike Collapses

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines' weekend attempt to increase  
its air fares proved unsuccessful after American Airlines, 
Northwest Airlines and other major carriers failed to follow suit. 
Continental said Friday it would bump up ticket prices by 3 percent 
for leisure travel and 1 percent for business-class. But when 
competiors like American and Northwest failed to implement higher 
prices, most ticket prices were returned to pre-hike levels. 
Airlines have already increased fares twice this year, bringing 
leisure fares 7 percent higher and business fares 3 percent higher.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets placed All-Stars Mike Piazza  
and Rick Reed on the disabled list today, but say both should be 
back when they are eligible to return. Reed, a 16-game winner last 
season, was put on the 15-day DL because of a torn calf muscle. 
General manager Steve Phillips said Reed probably will be ready to 
return in about two weeks. Piazza, the slugging catcher, is also on 
the DL after spraining the medial collateral ligament in his right 
knee. New York filled the roster spots by recalling left-hander 
Rigo Beltran and outfielder Terrence Long from the minors.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavian authorities say a NATO  
airstrike hit a passenger train in southeastern Serbia today, 
killing at least nine people and injuring 16. NATO said it did not 
deliberately target the train but acknowledged it may have hit it. 
Yugoslavia's media agency says rescue workers were pulling charred 
bodies from the wreckage. NATO said it had hit a rail bridge it 
considered an important military supply line and that ``incoming 
military reports indicate there was a train on or near the bridge 
at the time of the strike.'' Yugoslav officials say 300 civilians 
have been killed and 3,000 injured during NATO's nearly 3-week-old

	`60 Minutes' Apologizes for Memo

	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in four months, CBS-TV's

report about drug smuggling, this time for citing a memo that 
turned out to be bogus. The apology was part of a settlement 
reached with a customs official who had filed a lawsuit against the 
newsmagazine, a spokesman said. In December, ``60 Minutes'' founder 
Don Hewitt apologized for airing a June 1997 story based on a

the documentary producers had faked locations and paid actors to

<HEADLINE> CBS Invests in Two Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is exchanging $200 million worth of  
advertising and promotion for stakes in two Web sites, continuing a 
strategy that has already paid off handsomely with two other 
startup companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company announced the acquisition Monday of a  
Dallas-area TV station for $485 million in stock. With the purchase 
of KTVT from Gaylord Entertainment Co., CBS will own 15 stations 
across the country, reaching 34 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of deals comes less than two weeks after CBS  
announced the purchase of leading television syndicator King World 
Productions Inc. for $2.5 billion in stock, the latest effort in a 
drive by incoming president Mel Karmazin to remake what has been 
seen as a stodgy old media company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Internet deals, CBS is capitalizing on its ability to  
deliver access to large numbers of viewers and listeners in 
exchange for ownership stakes in small Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the strategy has reaped huge rewards. The value of CBS's  
combined stake in its two earlier Internet partners, CBS 
Marketwatch.com and SportsLine USA Inc., has soared to more than 
$500 million thanks to successful stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals announced Monday give CBS sizable stakes in two more  
Web companies in exchange for promoting them. CBS will also provide 
some entertainment content to one of the sites and lend its 
powerful brand name to the other, making its investment in each 
worth $100 million. No cash or stock will change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will get 35 percent of hollywood.com, a Web site that  
provides information and listings for movies as well as interviews 
with stars. The rest of the site will be owned by Big Entertainment 
Inc., a Boca Raton, Fla.-based company whose founders also started 
the Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other deal, CBS will get a 50 percent ownership stake in  
storeRunner.com, a year-old site that scans other locations on the 
Internet for good deals for shoppers. CBS will also lend its brand 
name to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have been positive about CBS's strategy, which involves  
little risk or expense for the company. The potential rewards are 
high if the companies succeed and sell shares to the public, taking 
advantage of investors' seemingly insatiable appetite for Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great way for them to increase their exposure to the  
Internet,'' said Paul Sweeney, broadcasting analyst with Salomon 
Smith Barney. ``Like other broadcasters, CBS has a very valuable 
asset -- the ability to deliver a wide number of viewers. It's a 
low-risk way for CBS to become a major player on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other broadcasters have also been expanding into the online  
world. General Electric Co.'s NBC has an investment in the Snap! 
Internet portal and a minority stake in ValueVision, the third 
largest home-shopping cable network. Walt Disney Co.'s ABC network 
has stakes in the Infoseek portal and the Go Network.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Clinton Contempt Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Judge Susan Webber Wright's order holding  
President Clinton in contempt: 
</P>
<P>
	``On two separate occasions, this court ruled in clear and  
reasonably specific terms that plaintiff was entitled to 
information regarding any individuals with whom the president had 
sexual relations or proposed or sought to have sexual relations and 
who were during the relevant time frame state or federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding these orders, the record demonstrates by clear  
and convincing evidence that the president responded to plaintiff's 
questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were 
designed to obstruct the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to construe the president's sworn statements  
in this civil lawsuit concerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky 
as anything other than a willful refusal to obey this court's 
discovery orders. Given the president's admission that he was 
misleading with regard to the questions being posed to him and the 
clarity with which his falsehoods are revealed by the record, there 
is no need to engage in an extended analysis of the president's 
sworn statements in this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding  
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally 
false, and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in 
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally 
false, notwithstanding tortured definitions and interpretations of 
the term 'sexual relations.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``... it simply is not acceptable to employ deceptions and  
falsehoods in an attempt to obstruct the judicial process, 
understandable as his aggravation with the plaintiff's lawsuit may 
have been. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``In sum, the record leaves no doubt that the president violated  
this court's discovery orders regarding disclosure of information 
deemed by this court to be relevant to plaintiff's lawsuit. The 
court therefore adjudges the president to be in civil contempt of 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this  
nation's president in contempt of court and is acutely aware, as 
was the Supreme Court, that the president 'occupies a unique office 
with powers and responsibilities so vast and important that the 
public interest demands that he devote his undivided time and 
attention his public duties.' 
</P>
<P>
	``... however, this court has attempted throughout this case to  
apply the law to the president in the same manner as it would apply 
the law to any other litigant, keeping in mind the duties and 
status of the presidency and the 'high respect' that is to be 
accorded his office. In that regard, there simply is no escaping 
the fact that the president deliberately violated this court's 
discovery orders and thereby undermined the integrity of the 
judicial system.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even without the anticipated Tiger Woods-David  
Duval matchup, more people watched this year's Masters than in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS' final round coverage posted a 10.7 overnight rating and 21  
share, an increase of 8 percent from a 9.9/27 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second-highest rated final day of the decade,  
trailing only Woods' record-setting performance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day overnight average was 8.6, even with last year and  
tied for second since 1986. CBS recorded a 12.8/27 in 1997, the 
highest in Masters history. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's third round had a 5.9/15.  
</P>
<P>
	CBS did not have overnight ratings, which measure the top 44  
markets in the country, available from before 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each network point represents 994,000 
homes. The share is the percentage tuned to a program among those

<HEADLINE> Colts Release Warren, Bailey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Aaron Bailey, who nearly caught a  
desperation pass that could have sent the Indianapolis Colts to the 
Super Bowl, was released by the team on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts also released running back Lamont Warren.  
</P>
<P>
	Warren, a sixth-round draft pick in 1994, was used mainly as a  
backup to Marshall Faulk during his five-year NFL career. He 
started two of 12 games last season and rushed 25 times for 61 
yards and one touchdown, and he also returned eight kickoffs for an 
average of 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, who signed with the Colts as a free agent in 1994, did  
not catch a pass last season but had 67 receptions for 1,040 yards 
and six TDs during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hold the franchise record with 3,501 career kickoff  
return yards. But he is perhaps best known for nearly catching Jim 
Harbaugh's end zone pass in Pittsburgh on the last play of the 1996 
AFC title game.

	Michael Cunningham received the fiction prize for his novel  
``The Hours'' and Melinda Wagner won the music prize for her 
composition ``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion.'' Other 
winners included the acclaimed essayist John McPhee, who won in the 
general nonfiction category for ``Annals of the Former World,'' and 
former poet laureate Mark Strand, for his collection ``Blizzard of 
One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the sort of thing one anticipates,'' said Strand, 65,  
known for his stoic, spare poems. ``I don't even know when these 
prizes are given out. I don't receive the paper every day and when 
I do I generally turn to the obituaries or the sports pages.''

	The history prize was given to ``Gotham: A History of New York  
City to 1898'' by two 56-year-old history professors, Edwin G. 
Burrows of Brooklyn College and Mike Wallace of John Jay College. 
</P>
<P>
	``People keep telling me that this book is entertaining,''  
Wallace said. ``That to me is more important than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biography prize went to ``Lindbergh,'' A. Scott Berg's book  
about the aviator Charles Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting day since Anne Morrow gave me  
permission to write the book,'' exclaimed Berg, 49, who lives in 
Los Angeles and is the author of two other biographies. The author 
said it took him a year to persuade Charles Lindbergh's widow to 
agree to the project and another nine years to write it. 
</P>
<P>
	A special music citation was given posthumously to Ellington on  
the centennial of his birth. The Pulitzer board said the award was 
given ``in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked 
aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of 
jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It just shows that Duke Ellington's music is timeless and  
still lives in the present,'' said jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. 
``Even though it was awarded posthumously, his music is still very 
alive and vibrant and meaningful today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hours,'' which won the PEN/Faulkner Award and was a  
runner-up for the National Book Critics Circle prize, begins in the 
1920s and imagines Virginia Woolf as she worked on her acclaimed 
novel ``Mrs. Dalloway.'' Parts of ``The Hours'' take place decades 
later, in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiction prize is awarded for a book ``preferably dealing  
with American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, 46, who teaches creative writing at Columbia  
University, said he was so surprised he hadn't even thought about 
how to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``My partner, Ken Korbett, is my mentor and muse and first and  
most important reader. He's a clinical psychologist, and he's with 
a patient right now, and when he's done, we'll have a good cry and 
figure out what to do next,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wagner, 42, who lives in Ridgewood, N.J., is taking a break  
from teaching college courses in composition and music theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel humbled, really, by the company of people who have  
already won this award,'' she said. ``I don't feel comfortable yet 
being in that company.''

<HEADLINE> Masters Winner Olazabel Is Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- From one two-time Masters champion to  
another, Seve Ballesteros was among the first to congratulate 
fellow Spaniard Jose Maria on Sunday's victory at Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	King Juan Carlos and Prime Minster Jose Maria Aznar also got in  
on the action by praising Olazabal's second Masters victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won with authority from beginning to the end,'' said  
Ballesteros in a statement released by his brother, Baldomero. 
``This triumph will compensate him, in part, for some of the bad 
moments that destiny wanted him to face with courage. I 
congratulate him with all my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who also won the Masters in 1994 and was subsequently  
sidelined for 18 months with a career-threatening back injury that 
made walking nearly impossible, was the toast of Spain on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Olazabal's '94 victory, the king received the 33-year-old  
Basque in the royal Zarzuela palace, though it was not clear if the 
reception would be repeated.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Difference in Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Men with some forms of advanced congestive heart  
failure are twice as likely as women to die within 18 months of 
being diagnosed with the disease, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is not that men and women receive different  
treatment, as some experts had suspected. Researchers said the 
cause is more likely a biological difference between the sexes: 
Women's heart muscles respond better to some types of heart 
disease, such as high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A growing body of evidence points to fundamental  
gender-related differences in the nature and extent of heart 
failure,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Kirkwood Adams Jr., a 
professor of medicine and radiology at the University of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding challenges earlier work suggesting women's survival  
advantage might come from differences in the types of treatment 
women and men receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of flies in the face of where our thinking had  
been,'' said Dr. Charles Francis, a specialist in women's heart 
disease at Drew University in Madison, N.J. ``I think it's a very 
important study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4.6 million Americans have congestive heart  
failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to 
meet the body's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The study reported Monday in Circulation, a journal of the  
American Heart Association, focused on patients with advanced heart 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared survival data on 331 men and 99 women and  
grouped them by age, race, weight, duration of heart failure and 
blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Men with ischemic heart disease -- the kind caused by clogged  
vessels and resulting in a lack of blood supply to the heart -- were 
about 1.5 times more likely to die in the first 18 months after 
being diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Men with nonischemic heart disease -- caused by high blood  
pressure or other factors that can weaken the heart muscle -- were 
three times more likely than women to die during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, men whose congestive heart failure was caused by high  
blood pressure or other factors were twice as likely to die as 
their female counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers cautioned that larger studies are needed.

<HEADLINE> NATO Hits Serbian Industrial Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO struck at Serbia's industrial  
heartland today, returning to sites already hard hit in the allied 
air campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to 
accept a peace agreement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO foreign ministers convened in Belgium for their first  
meeting since airstrikes began nearly three weeks ago, the Yugoslav 
parliament overwhelmingly approved a plan to join an alliance with 
Russia and Belarus -- an apparent move to try to draw Russia into 
the fighting. Russia has said it will not get militarily involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials, meanwhile, expressed deep concern over the  
more than half-million ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled or 
been driven out of the province, and hundreds of thousands of 
others displaced within Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said 3,300 refugees were flown out of  
Macedonia on Sunday to temporary haven in Norway, Germany, Turkey 
and Poland, with nearly 1,300 others to be flown out today. 
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic flooded with 120,000 
refugees, is trying to arrange for most to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Yugoslav-Albanian frontier, the worst border clashes  
in weeks between Yugoslav troops and Kosovo rebels left two people 
dead and nine others wounded, international monitors said, and 
Yugoslav officials accused NATO and Albania of aiding the rebel 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says the bombing will continue until Milosevic withdraws  
Yugoslav and Serb units sent to Kosovo province in southern Serbia 
as part of his crackdown on the Kosovo Liberation Army separatist 
rebels. Serb forces are also accused of terrorizing ethnic Albanian 
civilians, driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance acknowledged today that poor weather was still  
hampering its air campaign. Some aircraft came back from their 
latest missions still carrying bombs, but NATO refused to say how 
many. All returned safely, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the industrial town of Pancevo just across the Danube from  
Belgrade, wind-whipped orange flames leaped into the night sky as 
fire engulfed one of Yugoslavia's biggest oil refineries early 
today. NATO confirmed the hit, also reported by Serb media. 
</P>
<P>
	The factory that makes Yugo cars -- housed in a complex that also  
makes weapons -- was hammered again early today, Yugoslavia's 
state-run Tanjug news agency said. The Zastava complex in 
Kragujevac, 45 miles southwest of Belgrade, was badly damaged last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO spokesman confirmed the car plant was targeted, saying it  
also makes military vehicles. Tanjug said three dozen workers in 
the complex were hurt in today's attacks, and quoted its manager as 
saying damage to the facility now totaled $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Batajnica, site of a military airfield, was also hit,  
Serb media said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest wave of strikes also hit Serbia's second-largest  
city, Novi Sad, where two major bridges had already been destroyed 
early in the air campaign. Tanjug said a missile struck a 
residential area Sunday evening, but NATO said there were 
surface-to-air missile production and storage facilities in the 
area targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the central Serbian town of Krusevac, a heating plant was  
destroyed and a heavy-machinery plant -- the biggest in the Balkans 
-- was targeted, Tanjug said, in strikes that touched off huge 
fireballs. Both it and Serbian TV said civilians were wounded, but 
did not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, which took the brunt of strikes on Sunday -- Orthodox  
Easter -- was hit again today in attacks that went on well into the 
daylight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug said an empty military barracks in Pristina was hit at  
mid-morning. Sunday night, British Harrier jets struck a fuel 
storage depot, the British military said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slatina airport outside Pristina, whose terminal was reported  
wrecked in strikes late Saturday and early Sunday, came under new 
attack overnight, Tanjug said. It said the region southeast of the 
capital was also targeted, with cluster bombs dropped in the 
southern municipality of Lipljani. 
</P>
<P>
	The urgent session of the Yugoslav federal parliament today  
opened with a minute of silence for victims of ``NATO's 
aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic later addressed both chambers  
of the assembly, and proposed that parliament accept the decision 
to join because it ``creates a condition for the peoples of Russia, 
Belarus and Yugoslavia to join forces and protect their vital state 
and national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the lower house, out of 115 deputies present, 110 supported  
the motion, while five abstained. At the upper house, of the 27 
delegates present, 26 were in favor and one abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement the chairmen called the proposal ``a  
historic step of great importance to Yugoslavia's people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Seleznyov, Russia's Communist parliament speaker and a  
political foe of President Boris Yeltsin, had raised the idea of an 
alliance during a meeting last week with Milosevic. The Russians 
and Serbs, both Slavs and Orthodox Christians, share cultural and 
historical ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid growing Western concern about conditions inside the  
southern province, NATO officials showed aerial photographs Sunday 
of what was described as a possible mass grave in Pusto Selo 
outside Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Jamie Shea said Sunday the ground appeared to be  
freshly dug and the pictures resembled those of mass graves seen 
during the war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	First-hand information from inside Kosovo is hard to come by,  
but British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook estimated Sunday about 
400,000 ethnic Albanians are hiding from Serb forces in the forests 
and mountains of Kosovo. He came up with the figure after talking 
by telephone to Hashim Thaci, an ethnic Albanian leader in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials also said some 100,000 ethnic Albanian men  
were believed missing, based on the low number of males among the 
refugees crossing into Macedonia and Albania. The estimate revived 
speculation the men had either been massacred by Serbs, joined the 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, or were being held hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Yugoslavia's tense southern border, conflict spilled over  
again into Albania. In the border town of Tropoja, heavy mortar 
fire hit border police headquarters and a residential neighborhood 
Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, said Andrea Angeli, 
spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, which monitors the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	More fighting at the Padesh border station, near Tropoja,  
wounded three KLA fighters and a French journalist, Angeli later 
reported. No further details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army officer on the border told Serb TV on Sunday  
large numbers of KLA fighters were trying to infiltrate Kosovo from 
Albania. The officer accused NATO of supporting the KLA and 
pressing its fighters to cross over into Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Mascot Under Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Demonstrators at Jacobs Field on Monday burned  
a wooden sculpture of Chief Wahoo in a coffin, demanding that the 
Cleveland Indians get rid of their mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 people protested before the home opener against Kansas  
City to denounce the mascot as a racist caricature of American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say goodbye to this big-toothed Wahoo,'' protester Michael  
Haney said as flames consumed the carving. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators were buoyed by a new lawsuit against the city  
of Cleveland and several police officers, and by a federal ruling 
against the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	A trademark panel revoked the Redskins' federal trademark  
protection, saying the NFL team's name may disparage American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans strolled into Jacobs Field, some protesters pounded a  
drum and chanted ``Hey! Ho! Racist symbol's got to go'' as the 
sculpture burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Others held signs, including one that read ``These honor who?''  
and showed versions of Chief Wahoo with the faces of highly 
stereotyped black, Asian and Hispanic men. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the fans wore the Wahoo logo on jackets and sweatshirts,  
and a few fans booed the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was arrested, unlike previous demonstrations that  
prompted the new lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Five protesters who were arrested last year sued the city and  
police officers on Friday, contending their civil rights were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
	Their claim involves protests dating to 1997. During the World  
Series that year, three people were arrested for burning a straw 
effigy of Chief Wahoo. A municipal judge dismissed the case April 
7, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after the judge's ruling, demonstrators burned  
another effigy and were arrested. They were jailed for about a day 
and released without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can burn a flag, you can burn a Wahoo,'' said Terry  
Gilbert, a lawyer for the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit asks for an injunction preventing the city from  
interfering or arresting protesters outside Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokesman referred questions to city officials, who had  
no immediate comment. The Cleveland Indians, who are not named as 
defendants, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Teters, a plaintiff in the Cleveland lawsuit and vice  
president of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the 
Media, senses progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average person has an awareness of this issue they didn't  
have before,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teters, who campaigns against Indians mascots across the  
country, said other communities that have Indian logos for sports 
teams generally regard Cleveland's as the most derogatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say to us `At least we don't have that little red Sambo  
like they do in Cleveland,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Won't Go to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Reliever Mark Wohlers has notified Atlanta  
general manager John Schuerholz that he will not accept his 
assignment to Class AAA Richmond, apparently ending his career with 
the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves had given him the assignment with the hope he would  
regain the form that made him one of the premier closers in 
baseball from 1995 to 1997, saving the final game of the 1995 World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who suffered a relapse in his comeback attempt in his  
first two outings of the season (six walks in two-thirds of an 
inning), had seemed eager to accept the assignment when informed 
Friday by manager Bobby Cox and Schuerholz. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz said Sunday after Wohlers told him of his decision  
that he wasn't completely surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he first indicated he was very optimistic and interested  
in accepting the asignment, he obviously decided, either on his own 
or after talking to someone, that he was not going to accept the 
assignment,'' Schuerholz said. ``That's his right under the Basic 
Agreement. I'm disappointed that the whole process didn't work, for 
Mark's sake and the team's sake. It would have been the perfect 
ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers could have accepted the assignment, refused it, or  
declared for free agency. Since he refused it, the Braves are still 
responsible for his $5.2 million salary unless they trade him by 
Thursday, April 22. They will release him if a deal can't be worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Among teams believed to be interested in Wohlers are the  
Pittsburgh Pirates and the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of whom would 
pay a portion of Wohlers' salary, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz said some clubs had expressed interest in Wohlers  
over the winter and early spring, but he would not say which ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he expressed regret that Wohlers refused the  
assignment, Schuerholz stood by the decision he made on Friday 
after a Thursday night outing against the Phillies in which Wohlers 
threw only one of 10 pitches for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously Mark was a big part of our success,'' he said. ``He  
showed in spring training he has a chance to recapture some of his 
outstanding major league capabilities. We were hopeful he'd do it 
with us. As everybody who watched our team the other night 
realized, we had no choice but to make a move. Our bullpen was not 
going to survive.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Need To Improve Pitching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Will Clark sat in front of his locker, a bulky  
ice pack on his left knee and a strained look on his face. He 
glanced at the food in the middle of the clubhouse, which to him 
appeared as worthless as his .478 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark contributed at least one hit in each of his first six  
games in Baltimore, capping his opening week Sunday with a homer 
and two RBIs. Yet the Orioles blew a 4-0 lead against the Toronto 
Blue Jays and finished their opening homestand 2-4 and in the AL 
East cellar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd trade the hits and homers for wins,'' said Clark, who  
signed a two-year, $11 million contract in December. ``The food 
tastes a lot better when you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the Orioles improve their pitching, Clark will savor few  
hearty meals this summer. His production ahead of Albert Belle -- 
who's hitting .409 with five RBIs -- has been wasted because 
Baltimore's pitching staff owns a 6.00 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is going to score some runs, but not five or six  
every day,'' manager Ray Miller said. ``So we're just going to have 
to pitch better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Mussina owns both Oriole wins, closer Mike Timlin has two  
saves and Heathcliff Slocumb has yet to yield a run. That pretty 
much covers the list of Baltimore pitchers who have been effective 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``But as bad as it's gone, it can turn around quickly,'' Clark  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles plummeted after a 10-3 start last season, staggering  
to the finish in fourth place with a 79-83 record. At this point 
they've got nowhere to go but up -- and to Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day off Monday, Baltimore begins an 11-game road trip  
Tuesday with three games against the defending world champion 
Yankees. The key game is Thursday's finale, when Mussina faces 
Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles went 0-6 at Yankee Stadium last year in a  
controversial series that included a questionable call by an umpire 
and the fastball from Armando Benitez that hit Tino Martinez in the 
back and started a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have little chance to win if they performed as they  
did Sunday, when a botched rundown and a shoddy performance by the 
bullpen produced a shower of jeers from the soggy, chilled crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to go up there and play good baseball,'' Clark  
said. ``You don't do that, you don't win.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines' Fare Increase Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Most of the nation's airlines dropped out of a  
Continental Airlines-led overall fare increase Monday, opting 
instead to raise scattered prices in selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say it won't be long before those higher  
fares drop back to last week's prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental announced Friday an across-the-board 3 percent fare  
increase for leisure travel and 1 percent boost for walk-up 
tickets. The move quickly was matched by United Airlines, Delta Air 
Lines and America West. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday, the fare increase collapsed when some other major  
carriers, including Northwest Airlines and American Airlines, 
failed to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all advance ticket prices rolled back to their  
Thursday rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 21-day advance ticket retreated, Continental and  
others let stand increases for some three-, seven- and 14-day 
advance fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it was rescinded, part of it remains in effect,''  
spokesman Dave Messing of Houston-based Continental said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chiames, spokesman for AMR Corp., parent company of  
American, said any recent fare increases have been on a selected 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fares might be changing, but I couldn't tell you which ones,''  
Chiames said. ``There was no across-the-board fare increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American upset passengers in February when its pilots held a  
``sickout,'' forcing the airline to cancel flights for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no common rule to which fares are higher and which  
lower, meaning consumers will need to work hard to find the lowest 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Parsons, who operates the Internet air fare site  
www.bestfares.com, says it appears Continental and other carriers 
grew weary of offering what he calls ``junk fares'' -- tickets lower 
than a 21-day advance price. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the new fare increases will roll back within the  
next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``History shows that the guys with the higher fares blink,''  
Parsons said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the airline industry, prices shift quickly as carriers try to  
hedge their bets on what the consumer will pay. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, most carriers offer as many as 12 different fares  
for the same 14-day advance ticket. When a set number of seats are 
sold at the lowest price, the airline begins selling at a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, operator of the Internet travel site  
www.onetravel.com, said most major carriers held onto increases of 
as much as $40 in certain markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a 14-day advance, Houston-to-Richmond flight on  
Continental cost $214 or $274 roundtrip on Thursday, depending on 
the day of departure, Trippler said. 
</P>
<P>
	That same flight purchased Monday costs $254 or $314.  
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines' 14-day advance Detroit-to-Raleigh, N.C.,  
flight was $210 roundtrip on Thursday. Monday it was $250, Trippler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those benchmark fares did not go up but they played with other  
fares,'' he said. ``The consumer is going to pay more (Monday) than 
they did on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as fares fluctuated throughout the day, Parsons said two  
airlines appeared to keep fares lower overall -- TWA and Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't last, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The other guys are not going to let Northwest and TWA have the  
cheapest,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Navy To Use Game To Train Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A flight student who had never flown a  
plane learned so much from a common computer game that the Navy 
plans to save money by using the software to train other fledgling 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensign Herb Lacy, 24, bought Microsoft's Flight Simulator while  
he was in preflight training at Pensacola Naval Air Station. The 
combat version of the game sells for around $50. 
</P>
<P>
	He customized the program to mimic the look and controls of a  
T-34C Turbo Mentor, which the Navy uses for primary flight 
training. The student from Bowie, Md., logged 50 hours of flight 
time on his personal computer before ever climbing into a real 
T-34C. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is one of the top students in his class at Corpus Christi  
Naval Air Station, Texas, Navy officials told the Pensacola News 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy also made about 20 copies of his customized program for  
fellow flight students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of a single person who has tried it and had  
anything negative to say,'' Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month, the Navy will begin operating six makeshift T-34C  
simulators running on Flight Simulator at Corpus Christi, the 
newspaper reported Monday. Each one, consisting of a box made to 
resemble a cockpit, aircraft controls, a personal computer and a 
21-inch monitor, will cost $6,000 compared to millions for 
conventional simulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just flabbergasted,'' said Rear Adm. Mike Bucchi, chief of  
the Naval Air Training Command at Corpus Christi.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Howard Out For Six Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards forward Juwan Howard will  
miss at least six games with a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard was placed on the injured list Monday and will be  
sidelined 10 days to two weeks, according to a team spokesman. 
Forward Tracy Murray, who has missed six games with a sprained toe, 
was activated to take Howard's spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard was injured early in the fourth quarter when his left  
foot landed on teammate Ben Wallace's left foot as the two were 
contesting a layup Sunday by Philadelphia's Allen Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is averaging 19 points for the Wizards, who have lost  
five of six to fall out of the playoff picture in the Eastern 
Conference.

                           *BoxCar Willie    	
</P>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- BoxCar Willie, whose gentle country voice  
and songs of life on the road evoked memories of a time when hobos 
watched America pass by from the door of a freight car, died Monday 
of leukemia. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie was not only a Branson performer but one of the  
music town's elder statesmen. He did six or more shows a week nine 
months of the year until his health began to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Lecil Martin, BoxCar Willie was the son of a railroad man  
who used to play his fiddle on the porch while his son sat in on 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	By his teens BoxCar Willie had graduated to playing in jamborees  
all over the state, but then he gave up show business to enlist in 
the Air Force. He spent 22 years there, logging some 10,000 hours 
as a flier. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from the service he returned to performing, and  
by the 1970s he had developed the singing hobo persona, complete 
with overalls, a battered old hat, worn suit jacket and two days' 
growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he never had a hit single, his albums sold well over  
the years and he built a loyal following that would later make him 
one of the most popular performers in Branson, where he operated a 
motel and train museum as well as his theater. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he took the BoxCar Willie look, as well as the name,  
after seeing a freight train pass him by one day in Lincoln, Neb., 
as he was stuck in traffic.

<P>
	CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Robert V. Cox, who won a Pulitzer Prize  
in 1967 for his vivid deadline reporting of a mountain manhunt that 
ended with the killing of a deranged sniper, died Monday. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of his death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Cox graduated from high school in 1945 and went on to work at  
The Public Opinion of Chambersburg, where he won the 1967 Pulitzer 
Prize in the category of local general spot news reporting. He 
retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He also published two books, ``Deadly Pursuit'' and ``Missing  
Person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, five daughters, a son, 13  
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

	FRANKLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Ed Hamlyn, a former Dayton television  
anchorman, died Friday after a long illness. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamlyn began his broadcasting career in radio in Pennsylvania  
and Cincinnati. He joined WDTN-TV in Dayton in 1956 and spent 26 
years at the station, serving as news director, news anchor and 
community services director. He retired in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a sister, two sons and a daughter.

</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Gary Hurford, who spent the past 13 years as  
president of Hunt Oil Co., died Monday of a heart attack. He was 
62. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurford, who also served as a member of the company's board of  
directors, was named president in 1986. He was the first non-Hunt 
family member to serve as president of the company founded by 
legendary oilman H.L. Hunt in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurford began his 37-year- career at Hunt as an oil field worker  
and rose through the ranks. His time at the helm was characterized 
by aggressive international exploration, including oil and gas 
discoveries in Yemen and construction of a crude oil pipeline and 
marine export system there in the 1980s.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- ``Brownie Mary'' Rathbun, the grandmotherly  
activist whose arrests for distributing pot brownies to AIDS 
patients built momentum for the medicinal marijuana movement, died 
Saturday. She was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jane Rathbun became a fixture at San Francisco General  
Hospital in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, preparing and 
delivering marijuana-laced baked goods to sick people to relieve 
their nausea and pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she made 134 dozen a month during the heyday, 1984 to  
1990. All in her little old kitchen in her subsidized apartment. 
And you could smell it all through her building. The old ladies 
there were all cool about it. Hey, it's San Francisco,'' said 
Dennis Peron, who with Ms. Rathbun founded the now-defunct San 
Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and twice agreed to perform  
hundreds of hours of community service, spending the time with AIDS 
patients, Peron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests helped build support for San Francisco's Proposition  
P and, later, the 1996 state initiative that made growing and using 
marijuana with a doctor's permission legal under California law.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Maury White, an award-winning sports  
columnist for The Des Moines Register whose folksy-style made him a 
favorite with readers for a quarter century, died Friday of a 
stroke. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	White's career at the Register began in 1940. He started  
full-time with the paper after his discharge from the Navy in 1946 
after World War II. He became the paper's sports columnist in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	White retired in 1989. Recently, he had been an occasional  
contributor the Register's sports pages and served as curator of 
the newspaper's Sports Hall of Fame. 
</P>

	During his career, White covered the World Series, major  
football bowl games, NCAA championships and the Olympics. In 1971, 
he was named national sports writer of the year.

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Former Boeing chairman and chief executive  
officer Thornton Arnold ``T'' Wilson, credited with developing and 
producing the Boeing 757 and 767 jetliners, was found dead 
Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death was not known.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined Boeing in 1943 as an engineer. He became company  
president in 1968, chief executive officer in 1969 and chairman in 
1972. He retired as CEO until 1986 and as board chairman in 1987, 
though he served as board chairman emeritus until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wilson's leadership, Boeing introduced the 747 and  
subsequently developed and produced the 757 and 767, establishing 
the company as the world's leading supplier of commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson first made his mark with Boeing on the B-47 swept-wing

<HEADLINE> Free Lunches Offered for Tattoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some people will do anything for a free  
burrito. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mexican restaurant offered a lifetime of free lunches to  
anyone willing to get a tattoo of its logo, Jimmy the Corn Man, a 
sombrero-wearing mariachi boy riding a blazing corncob. Just show 
the cashier the tattoo -- any size, on any part of the body -- and 
get a free meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since word of the promotion got out six months ago, 39 people  
have braved the tattoo needle for a permanent coupon at Casa 
Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people do it for the love of the art. I'm doing it for  
the beer and the taco,'' said starving art student Thomas Judd, 31, 
pacing nervously Monday before getting the tattoo -- his first -- on 
his right calf. 
</P>
<P>
	A much-tattooed Guido Brenner has a coaster-size Corn Man  
emblazoned under his right armpit, the only open space he had left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually everybody's dug it, even my mom,'' he said. ``She  
looked at me kind of funny and then I took her there for lunch. She 
was like, `Wow, this restaurant is really good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Sanchez, whose grandfather founded Casa Sanchez in 1927,  
came up with the idea while testing a color computer printer. She 
taped a sign to the window with the restaurant's logo that read, 
``Tattoo me on yourself and get free lunch for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister and brothers thought the idea was strange and kept  
taking the sign down. She kept putting it back up. Two nightclub 
employees who learned the promotion was no joke took the plunge and 
spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribcages, calves, legs, arms and even buttocks have been prime  
sites for the logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy said, `I want to get it on my stomach because that's  
where my food is going to go,''' said Barnaby Williams, the owner 
of Mom's Body Shop who created about 30 of the Casa Sanchez 
tattoos. ``I think people have gotten much stupider tattoos for 
much stupider reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An $80 tattoo pays for itself after about a dozen lunches (a  
$4.50 super burrito with sour cream, cheese and guacamole, and a 
$1.75 Mexican beer). And given the restaurant's long history and 
success (its chips and salsa are considered among the city's best), 
few are worried that they will ever lose their free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	The family estimates it gives away only two meals a week, and  
the tattooed who do come back feel a bit guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get embarrassed about the not paying, so they always  
leave big tips,'' Ms. Sanchez said.

<HEADLINE> NBC Cancels 'Another World' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Another World,'' the longest-running soap  
opera in NBC history, will end the drama come June. The network is 
killing it off at age 35. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most dramatic of several changes NBC announced to its  
morning and daytime schedule on Monday. The network is adding a 
daytime talk show with ``Weekend Today'' anchor Jodi Applegate as 
host and a 4:30 a.m. EDT business news show for early risers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' will be replaced by ``Passions,'' a serial  
created by the former head writer of ``Days of Our Lives,'' which 
is remaining on NBC's schedule. NBC is also renewing its 
two-year-old soap, ``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's daytime schedule has included ``Another World'' since its  
premiere on May 4, 1964. It was the first soap opera expanded to 
one hour, and was even briefly broadcast for 90 minutes. It was 
also the first daytime drama with spinoff series, the short-lived 
``Somerset'' and ``Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tonight Show'' is the only NBC entertainment show to be on  
the air longer than ``Another World,'' which will end with a final 
broadcast on June 25. CBS's ``Guiding Light,'' on the air since 
1952, is the longest-running serial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank all the people working on `Another World' for an  
incredible job at giving their audience an amazing 35-year run. It 
was a very tough decision,'' said Scott Sassa, NBC entertainment 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' was hurt by the increasing desire of networks  
to own and control the profits of the shows they air. ``Another 
World'' is owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' and the new ``Passions'' 
will be owned by NBC. The network also has a partial stake in 
``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also said it wanted to air ``Days of Our Lives'' and  
``Passions'' back-to-back on its schedule. Currently, NBC 
affiliates choose when they want to air ``Another World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive editor of ``Soap Opera Digest'' said she was  
surprised by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Sunset Beach'' is promising, ``I don't think viewers  
have as much an attachment to it as the viewers for `Another 
World,''' Carolyn Hinsey said. ``Soap fans, the reason they watch 
soaps is because they hate change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate's new show, ``Later Today,'' will air directly after  
the ``Today'' show. It will replace ``Leeza'' starting in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is canceling its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' series and giving  
its affiliates the chance to program local news from 5 a.m. to 7 
a.m. EDT. These early morning news broadcasts are growing in 
popularity and profitability for local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early Today,'' the new business-oriented network news show to  
air at 4:30 a.m., will be produced by the business cable network 
CNBC.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Gas Prices Up 14 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Less than two months ago, consumers were  
enjoying gasolines prices averaging under $1 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	But a combination of seasonal demand, OPEC cuts in crude oil  
production and fires at California refineries has since pushed 
prices more than 20 cents higher -- with no relief in sight, an 
industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three weeks alone, pump prices have jumped 14 cents  
per gallon. In California over that same period, the average jumped 
43.11 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices jumped, leaped, exploded -- your pick,'' said analyst  
Trilby Lundberg, who runs the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas 
stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average price for all grades and services on Friday  
was $1.2281 -- a 14.12 cent hike from the last survey three weeks 
ago. On Feb. 21, the average price was only 99.8 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's cheapest gas was in Atlanta, where self-serve  
regular unleaded was going for 95.30 cents, Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardest hit were motorists in California, where the average  
price for regular unleaded was $1.6390. Explosions at two 
refineries -- including one at a Tosco Avon refinery Feb. 23 that 
left four workers dead -- have helped send prices soaring in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorist Geoff Leonard, of San Francisco, groused about the  
price hike while filling the tank of his Volvo station wagon at a 
Chevron station on Sunday. The price tag: $18.68 for 10 1/2 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' said Leonard, 42. ``It's the largest increase  
I've seen since the early '80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though refinery problems should disappear soon and the supply  
picture is normalizing, Ms. Lundberg saw no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big picture is that even if prices in California and the  
nation should peak soon, we are unlikely to see those ultra-low 
1998 price levels any time soon,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> American Snaps Mast in Sailing Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) -- The only American skipper left in an  
around-the-world sailing race snapped his mast in choppy South 
American seas and limped back toward port on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Van Liew, 31, of Santa Monica, Calif., had been in a tight  
race for second place in Class II of the Around Alone regatta when 
his mast broke Sunday afternoon -- early in the fourth and final leg 
to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was around 100 miles out of Punta del Este in steep and  
very uncomfortable seas. Without any warning the mast just went,'' 
race director Mark Schrader said from the port of Punta del Este, 
Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Liew and eight other solo sailors left Punta del Este on  
Saturday to begin the last leg of the globe-circling race that 
began last September in Charleston, South Carolina, and is to end 
there in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad's on his way back now,'' said Schrader. ``He obviously  
was very, very discouraged and his campaign doesn't have an 
unlimited budget, so he's not sure if he's going to be able to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race is a 27,000-nautical mile adventure that has taken  
sailors from South Carolina to South Africa, then on to New Zealand 
and Uruguay. Saturday marked the start of the final dash back to 
the southern U.S. seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The last leg to Charleston, about 5,750 nautical miles, is the  
shortest of the four. But it is potentially tricky because of 
fickle air currents off Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Italian sailor Giovanni Soldini continues to lead the  
main Class I competition with an overall lead of 89 days and 5 
hours -- a daunting 12-day advantage over competitor Mark Thiercelin 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
	In Class II, Jean Pierre Mouligne of France commanded a hefty  
lead with 99 days and 14 hours accumulated after three legs. But 
the race for second place had been extremely close until Van Liew's 
dismasting on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows To Win Air War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, La. (AP) -- Despite growing support in  
Congress for using ground troops, President Clinton expressed 
resolve Monday to win the air war against Yugoslavia and said 
President Slobodan Milosevic ``should be under no illusions that we 
will end it from weariness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, defense officials said that to boost the drive to  
oust Milosevic's forces from Kosovo, the Pentagon is preparing to 
approve a NATO request for ``several hundred'' more U.S. warplanes 
for the airstrikes again Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	That would add to the 500 U.S. aircraft already part of the  
700-plane NATO force. The additional planes would include 
ground-attack jets, radar-jamming planes to disrupt Serb air 
defenses and refueling tankers to allow allied pilots to stay aloft 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, requested the  
reinforcements, and Defense Secretary Wiliam Cohen was expected to 
quickly approve it, said one official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to increase NATO's ability to attack to Yugoslav  
army and security forces in Kosovo,'' the official said. 
``Secretary Cohen has already said he is going to approve any 
request from General Clark for additional assets. I would 
anticipate that the request will be approved expeditiously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this home for B-52 bombers and A-10 attack planes, Clinton  
met with crews who have flown strikes against Yugoslavia and will 
be heading back overseas soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined to continue on this mission, and we will  
prevail because of you and people like you,'' the president said in 
a speech near the flight line. He said the United States and its 
allies ``would like to nip this conflict in the bud before it 
destabilizes all of Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the military personnel and their families that  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was meeting with NATO 
ministers in Brussels, Belgium, to reaffirm ``our common commitment 
to do what is necessary to prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration continued to resist sending ground forces  
while saying NATO has that option if the need arises. ``We do not 
believe it is necessary,'' Cohen said. ``The president has 
indicated he has no plans or intent to use ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has assigned 500 planes to the air operations  
over Yugoslavia, part of an allied force of close to 700 planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bombing entered its 20th day, Cohen said, ``President  
Clinton knew -- all of us knew -- that this struggle was not going to 
be quick or easy or neat. But we understood that we're going to 
prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a four-hour visit, Clinton returned to Washington for an  
evening meeting with the five top leaders of Congress. Back in town 
after a two-week Easter recess, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 
and House Speaker Dennis Hastert said there would be no floor vote 
this week on the U.S. involvement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too early to have that debate,'' Hastert, R-Ill.,  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., said the administration would ask Congress this  
week for money to pay for the operation in Kosovo. Administration 
and congressional officials said the supplemental spending request 
could be as high as $2.5 billion to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, 50 to 60 House and Senate members will go to the  
White House to talk with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike are becoming increasingly  
restive and hawkish on Kosovo, probably reflecting a shift in 
public opinion polls in favor of introducing ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly, more and more key members of both parties are  
criticizing Clinton's decision to count solely on air power to win 
the conflict. ``You don't want to preclude a legitimate option,'' 
said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., back from a weekend tour of a 
refugee camp in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the issue, Lott said he didn't think it was helpful  
to be second-guessing strategy. But he added, ``I don't think we 
should preclude anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., one of the most outspoken critics of  
the administration's planning, is pressing for the Senate to take 
up a resolution this week to authorize the president to use 
``whatever force is necessary'' to resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in it; let's win it,'' Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said  
in a warm-up speech for Clinton. Her comments reflect a sentiment 
spreading through the rank-and-file in Congress for ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 11 members of Congress that Cohen took to Europe  
last week to visit NATO military planners and troops in Italy and 
Germany later wrote Clinton urging him to support planning for 
ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, meeting with reporters at Barksdale, said airstrikes are  
taking a toll on Serb forces, lowering morale and prompting some to 
desert. ``NATO forces are making significant military progress,'' 
the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, military officers said that allied attacks have  
cut off 100 percent of Serbia's fuel production capacity, although 
stockpiled fuel remains available, and that Serb tanks and other 
armor are now ``hunkering down'' in and around buildings in Kosovo, 
either to avoid getting bombed or because of fuel shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for  
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that if weather 
conditions permit, the full contingent of 24 Army Apache attack 
helicopters and their support structure will be in Albania as early 
as next week. Officials as recently as last weekend had said it 
might be another month before the Apache contingent was fully 
operational. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton underscored the message of NATO unity and resolve.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who didn't think that an alliance of  
19 countries could do what we have done,'' he said, ``and could 
stay together as we have stayed together, would have the patience 
to endure the inevitable progress'' to deal with bad weather and 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States seeks no territorial gain or political  
advantage in Kosovo: ``This is America at its best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Milosevic must agree to withdraw his troops, allow  
the return of refugees, accept the presence of an international 
peacekeeping force and permit self-government in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can end it tomorrow,'' the president said. ``But until he  
does, he should be under no illusions that we will end it from 
weariness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are determined to continue on this mission, and we will  
prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced a temporary reprieve in the April 15  
income tax filing deadline for service members taking part in the 
NATO mission -- a traditional move during combat operations. Clinton 
said relief workers, accredited journalists and some civilian 
personnel would be covered by his executive order. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that most or all of the pay of American military  
personnel serving in a combat zone or supporting combat efforts 
would be tax free. ``With our citizens working so hard to protect 
the citizens of Kosovo, they shouldn't have to worry about their 
taxes,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced disaster assistance for Bossier Parish, La.,  
which was hit by tornadoes and flooding this month.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns; GOP Seeks Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During the winter, it was the impeachment  
trial of President Clinton. Now, the war in Yugoslavia threatens to 
drown out the Republican campaign for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans returning from Congress' spring break Monday  
were determined to highlight their tax relief agenda this week with 
Americans facing a midnight Thursday deadline for filing income tax 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``America also wants us to try and do the business of the  
country in a professional manner,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of 
Oklahoma, the No. 4 House Republican leader. ``Part of that is 
doing what the American people want us to do, and part of that is 
cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But numerous opinion polls indicate that the booming economy,  
coupled with several middle-class tax cuts that took effect in 
1998, has taken the steam out of public clamor for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is feeling pretty flush and successful,'' said  
Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. ``They don't identify tax cuts as a very high 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Republicans who control Congress believe this is  
the one week when most Americans are thinking about their taxes, 
and that deep down people want a big chunk of projected budget 
surpluses to go for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it needs 290 votes and has no chance of passing, the  
House is scheduled to vote Thursday for the fifth year in a row on 
a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds 
vote in Congress to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we do the vote on April 15th is that people's  
attention is focused on their taxes,'' said the main sponsor, Rep. 
Joe Barton, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have ironed out relatively minor differences between  
the House and Senate budget resolutions for fiscal 2000, which 
include $800 billion in unspecified tax cuts over the next decade. 
Votes on that compromise resolution, which sets overall spending 
and tax targets that are filled in later, are expected in the two 
houses as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the tax talk this week will come from Internal Revenue  
Service Commissioner Charles Rossotti, who testified Monday before 
the Senate Small Business Committee in the first of his four 
congressional hearings -- many of them looking at how the IRS is 
implementing sweeping agency reforms enacted last year and at the 
complexity of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti told the small business panel that the IRS is committed  
to becoming a less belligerent, more service-oriented agency, but 
that it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole objective is to make the whole thing work better for  
everybody,'' Rossotti said. ``We're making a lot of changes. We 
don't always get it right the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of governors will appear before a House panel Wednesday  
and Thursday to describe how tax reform has worked in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-tax rallies and events are also scheduled,  
including one planned for today by House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, in which a mock time capsule from 1964 was being 
opened to dramatize the bigger bite now taken by income taxes.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Business Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The government of China has set up an Internet  
site where Chinese companies can advertise themselves and their 
products to American corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, www.meetchina.com, which was announced today, is  
operated by U.S. Business Network Inc., a San Francisco-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government will help U.S. Business Network solicit  
companies that will pay $1,500 to $3,000 to participate in the 
site, and receive help developing American contacts, with 20 
percent of the proceeds going to the Chinese government, Ken 
Leonard, the company's chief executive, told The New York Times for 
a story published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard lobbied the Chinese government for a year before  
receiving the go-ahead on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, Chinese companies were not allowed to make  
direct contact with foreign companies, but instead were required to 
first seek export licenses from the government, Leonard said. China 
has become more liberal in issuing such licenses, particularly for 
smaller companies, and dealing directly with Western businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The project ``fits perfectly'' from China's perspective, said  
Patrick Meehan, research director for the Gartner Group, a 
technology consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of open, but not all the way. It's part of the  
'great firewall of China' strategy, where they have a way to funnel 
information in and out of the country,'' he told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Missing Sightseers Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Calif. (AP) -- A mother and daughter slain during a trip  
to Yosemite National Park were remembered in this rainy coastal 
town with both laughter and sobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people crowded into Sacred Heart Church on Sunday,  
spilling outside where television monitors broadcast the 
2 1/2-hour-long memorial service for Carole Sund and her 15-year-old 
daughter Julie. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were killed, along with 16-year-old Argentine exchange  
student Silvina Pelosso, in case that has continued to baffle 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked at the altar by a pastel portrait of his daughter and  
granddaughter, flowers from Mrs. Sund's garden and Julie's purple 
and silver cheerleading pom-poms, Francis Carrington said he would 
let the authorities focus on circumstances of their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't let hate or revenge or despair enter our minds,'' he  
said. ``I think we'll look to the future as Carole and Julie would 
want us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jens Sund sat between his three adopted children as his wife and  
daughter were remembered in pictures, poems, prayers and songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where we move on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, was remembered as a devoted mother, competent  
businesswoman and tireless volunteer for neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie was recalled as an accomplished musician and a fiercely  
loyal friend with a ``smile that lasted all day long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trio were last seen alive Feb. 15, starting a massive  
search. Last month, Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's bodies were found in 
the trunk of their burned rental car. Julie's body was found a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last people to speak Sunday was 13-year-old Gina  
Sund, who left the crowd weeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although having the two most important people in my life taken  
away from me is the hardest thing I will ever have to overcome, 
don't look at me with frowns and sadness,'' she said, fighting back 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think of my mother laughing in a chair, and her smile and  
happiness.''

<HEADLINE> Worker Rescued From Atlanta Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A construction worker trapped on top of a  
swaying, 250-foot crane above a raging fire for more than an hour 
was rescued Monday by a firefighter dangling perilously from a 
helicopter cable. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames were licking at the cable as firefighter Matt Mosely  
climbed onto the crane and scrambled to the end, where Ivers Sims 
was waiting anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosely strapped Sims into a harness and held on tightly as both  
were lowered by the helicopter to the grass nearby. Sims, 49, 
walked to a stretcher, and spectators applauded as he was wheeled 
to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in stable condition Monday night after being treated for  
smoke inhalation and heat exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosely, 30, said he tried to joke with Sims because the flames  
were so hot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him his boss sent me up so he could knock off early,''  
Mosely said. ``That helped lighten things up a little bit. He was 
pretty much calm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mosely said that as he dangled above the fire, he thought only  
one thing: ``I hope the rope doesn't break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Rogers, who was in the helicopter to guide the pilot and  
the cable, said the flames were intensely hot even 80 feet above 
the cable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to put my visor down,'' he said. ``The heat was pretty  
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boyd Clines, the pilot of the state-owned helicopter used for  
fighting forest fires, said the flight was very turbulent because 
of the flames and wind. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was trying to fly quickly because ``the crane was on  
fire. It was kind of a time limit. We didn't have all day to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clines, a former Army pilot, has worked for the state's  
Department of Natural Resources for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say, `You seem to be really calm,' but when you've been  
training for this, you just do it -- it's your job,'' he said. ``I 
used to pluck Special Forces teams out of Laos and Cambodia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had engulfed an old five-story mill that was being  
converted to loft apartments in east Atlanta. It spread to at least 
two houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames gutted one home as neighbors used garden hoses to douse  
their closely clustered, wood-frame houses to keep the fire from 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were embers just raining down everywhere,'' said Rodney  
Bowman, who said he stomped out several small fires in his back 
yard. ``If it hadn't have been for the people who live here, a lot 
more houses would've burned down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims, of Woodland, Ala., was taken to Atlanta Medical Center. He  
was not admitted but spent the night with family members in its 
guest quarters because he was ``still overwhelmed,'' said hospital 
spokeswoman Lillian Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Benford Stellmacher, associated pastor of Antioch East Baptist  
Church, said he met briefly with Sims and his family at the 
hospital. Sims didn't say much other than ``I know God was with me 
up there,'' Stellmacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims had crawled onto a concrete counterweight on the end of the  
crane's horizontal arm to get away from the black smoke and flames 
rising from the red brick building. He seemed calm and alert as he 
lay on his belly, waiting to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke and flames could be seen at the center of the crane, about  
20 feet from where Sims waited to be rescued. The crane was swaying 
in winds that gusted to more than 20 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other person was believed injured in the fire.  
There was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.

<HEADLINE> Wondertross Uncertain for Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Wondertross, who ran sixth as the favorite  
in Saturday's Blue Grass Stakes, was being treated for colic Monday 
and his Kentucky Derby status remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be improving,'' trainer Nick Zito said, adding  
that the veterinarian treating the colt at a Lexington equine 
hospital ``likes what he sees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito said Wondertross apparently flipped his palate during  
Saturday's race, which could have caused stress that brought on the 
colic. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer said Wondertross, owned by William Condren and New  
York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, could be back in his barn 
at Keeneland as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he said, he would be able to evaluate the horse's chances  
of running in the May 1 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Wondertross would be Zito's third horse in the Derby. He also  
plans to run Wood Memorial winner Adonis and Stephen Got Even, 
winner of the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes.

<HEADLINE> Indians Put Rincon on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians placed left-handed reliever Ricky  
Rincon on the 15-day disabled list with a swollen left elbow on 
Monday and purchased the contract of Mark Langston, signed last 
week by the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Rincon, acquired during the offseason in a trade with  
Pittsburgh, was bothered by tightness in his left elbow over the 
weekend in Minnesota. He was examined Monday morning by Indians 
team doctors before being placed on the DL retroactive to April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a concern,'' Indians manager Mike  
Hargrove said before Cleveland won its home opener 5-2 in 10 
innings over the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Rincon, who appeared in two games for the Indians this season,  
is going on the DL for the second time in his career. He was 
sidelined with a strained groin for two weeks with the Pirates last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians general manager John Hart said an MRI performed Monday  
revealed no irregularities and Rincon may be able to begin throwing 
in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston took a flight to Cleveland Sunday night and made his  
debut in the seventh inning Monday, getting the first batter he 
faced to ground into an inning-ending double play with the Indians 
trailing 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the Red Sox-Devil Rays game yesterday (in Tampa) and  
got a call to go to the airport,'' Langston said. ``I rushed home, 
got my baseball stuff and was on a 7:50 flight. It felt good to 
come in and contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came in I was like, `Wow, that was quick,''' said  
Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar. ``We didn't even get to go over the 
signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians signed Langston to a minor-league deal on April 4.  
Hargrove said he plans to use the 38-year-old as both a long 
reliever and in late-game, setup situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston, who was on Triple-A Buffalo's roster, appeared in 22  
games for the San Diego Padres last season, posting a 4-6 record 
with a 5.86 ERA. He pitched four innings of a simulated game during 
extended spring training on Saturday, allowing three hits and 
striking out six.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's Main Stock Index Falls / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks plunged 2.1 percent today after a  
warning Friday by Compaq Computer that its earnings will fall 
sparked heavy selling of Tokyo technology shares. The dollar fell 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.36 yen in late afternoon, down 0.60 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late Friday level of 
120.98 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 348.23 points,  
or 2.07 percent, closing the session at 16,507.40. Before today's 
loss, the Nikkei index had gained 3.5 percent, or 565.44 points 
last week, including Friday's 8.94-point gain, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing weaker demand and severe price competition, Compaq  
Computer warned Friday in the United States that first-quarter 
earnings would fall below analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The announcement Friday points to severe fundamental economic  
conditions, especially at manufacturers,'' said Masatoshi Sato, 
manager of the investment information department at Kankaku 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning raised worries that earnings at Japanese technology  
companies may also be lower than forecast, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Losers included high-technology and blue-chip shares such as  
Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Hitach Ltd. amid worries about 
earnings outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 603.64  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 1.24 billion shares. 
Decliners outnumbered advancers 851 to 359, with 117 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 26.71 points, or 2.00 percent, to 1,316.20. 
The TOPIX fell 2.16 points, or 0.16 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range in the  
absence of major market-moving news in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors reacted little to the results of Sunday's  
Tokyo gubernatorial election, in which Shintaro Ishihara, a former 
transport minister and controversial author known for his hawkish, 
nationalist views, was elected into office.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Pub Pays Taxes on Wallpaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Tax time at McGuire's Irish Pub and  
Brewery has the restaurant's accountant climbing the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Accountant Jim Akin stood on a small ladder Monday as he began  
the annual inventory of dollar bills that customers have signed and 
stapled to the walls and ceiling over the past 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's 15,000 square feet and there's dollar bills on every bit  
of that ceiling and quite a bit of the walls,'' said owner William 
``McGuire'' Martin. ``We count it every year and we pay taxes on 
the growth in it. We treat it as an asset and we borrow against it 
and so forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated the count will reach $175,000 this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely gives a new meaning to doing the paperwork for  
tax season,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	It usually takes about three days to finish the tally. The  
filing deadline is Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tradition began in 1977 shortly after Martin and his wife,  
Molly, opened the business and a customer tipped her a dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had never waited on tables before, and she came to me and  
asked, `What should I do with this?''' Martin recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to tack it up behind the bar.  
</P>
<P>
	``The next day somebody came in and he said, `Let me sign this  
and put a dollar up also,''' Martin said. And a tradition was born. 
</P>
<P>
	With each dollar tacked up, bells and sirens sound and the  
customer receives an official Irishman card. The dollars have 
created an appropriately green wallpaper for the Irish pub. 
</P>
<P>
	The temptation of so much money within such easy reach has been  
too much for some people. The thieves have included a couple of 
California men who said they were collecting souvenirs, a Coast 
Guard officer who blamed too much alcohol and college students from 
Louisiana who tried to buy $75 worth of pizza with the signed 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A young lady was reported to authorities after she tried to use  
the bills to pay the cover charge at a nightclub, and last year an 
employee was fined and put on probation after being charged with 
pulling down an estimated $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people do steal this they tend to go to car washes and  
they change them for quarters,'' Martin said. ``Then the people who 
own the car wash call us up because they're very angry because 
they've lost all their quarters.''

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A brawl that drew the attention of the  
players on the field broke out at Veterans Stadium on Monday during 
the Phillies' home opener against the Atlanta Braves.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Acquitted on One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal thwarted Kenneth Starr  
once again Monday as a jury acquitted her of obstructing the 
independent counsel's Whitewater inquiry and deadlocked on two 
other charges, causing a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little numb,'' a jubilant Mrs. McDougal said  
outside the courthouse. ``I've been indicted since 1993, and this 
is the first day I haven't been indicted in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was ``pleased to learn'' that his former  
Whitewater business partner was acquitted of obstruction of 
justice, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He wishes all 
the best for her and her family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's legal troubles may not be over, however.  
Prosecutor Mark Barrett said Starr anticipated making a decision 
this week on whether to seek a retrial of the two criminal contempt 
charges stemming from her refusal to answer grand jury questions in 
1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a notorious case of someone basically being warned  
time and again and simply not answering questions,'' said Barrett. 
``I make no apologies for bringing this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt  
counts. Barrett said prosecutors would ask the court for permission 
to interview jurors about their reasoning. One juror told reporters 
that Mrs. McDougal's state of mind -- she said she feared 
prosecutors -- was the key to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-week trial featured an unusual lineup of witnesses:  
three grand jurors, three Whitewater prosecutors, another woman 
charged with obstructing Starr's investigation and videotaped 
testimony from Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense,  
answering some of the same questions she refused to address in 
front of the grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyers attempted to put Starr's tactics on  
trial, arguing that her refusal to give grand jury testimony was 
based on justifiable fear that she would be charged with perjury 
unless she falsely implicated the president and first lady in 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said her defense attorneys proved that Starr ``was  
not seeking the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After eight hours and 45 minutes of deliberations, spread over  
three days, the jurors sent out a note at midday Monday saying they 
were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. polled the jurors, and  
nine said it would be a waste of time to continue deliberating. ``I 
don't believe in arm-twisting,'' Howard said before declaring a 
mistrial on those two counts and allowing the jury to announce its 
verdict on obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos challenged prosecutors to try his  
client again, saying, ``They don't have the guts to retry this case 
again because now we know where the bodies are buried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later he added of Starr: ``This guy is out of control. Put him  
out of his misery. Put the country out of its misery and get rid of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said that if there is a retrial on the two criminal  
contempt counts, it's unlikely Mrs. McDougal would be allowed to 
again inject her allegations that Starr wanted her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's accusation was allowed into the trial only as a  
defense to the obstruction charge, under which prosecutors were 
required to show that Mrs. McDougal had acted with corrupt intent 
when she refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was instructed not to consider her allegation that  
prosecutors wanted her to lie in regard to the contempt counts. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, insisted Starr's office ``was not on 
trial here, only Mrs. McDougal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She honestly believed that she could be held for a false  
statement'' and that explained why she didn't talk, said Nance, who 
came close to being thrown off the jury Friday when he brought a 
law book to the deliberations. Nance said he brought in the book in 
an effort to get guidance on state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard concluded that Nance hadn't been influenced by the law  
book, which had belonged to a former Arkansas Supreme Court 
justice, John I. Purtle, who is acquainted with the Clintons and 
the McDougals. Purtle apparently left the book behind when he sold 
his house to Nance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already had served 18 months in jail for civil  
contempt based on her refusal to answer grand jury questions. She 
also served two months of a two-year term on four felony 
convictions in her 1996 trial. Howard released her from prison 
because of a back problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent so many months in jail thinking that someday I'll get  
to tell the people the truth,'' Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the witness stand at her trial last month, the Clintons'  
former Whitewater partner said that as far as she knew, Clinton 
told the truth at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton swore that he never borrowed money from the McDougals'  
savings and loan. But prosecutors produced a cashier's check from 
the McDougals' S&AMP;L payable to ``Bill Clinton'' and handwritten 
notes from the files of the financial institution refer to a loan 
to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal helped pay off the Clinton loan, writing a $5,081  
check in 1983. She said she didn't remember the check.

<HEADLINE> Love III Masters Forgotten Man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Davis Love III is a Masters footnote. Again.  
</P>
<P>
	While Jose Maria Olazabal was winning another green jacket and  
Greg Norman was enduring another gut-wrenching failure, Love was 
stuck in the middle Sunday. He finished two shots behind Olazabal 
and one ahead of Norman, a runner-up for the second time at Augusta 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed,'' Love said. ``But it's another step in the  
right direction. There's four or five guys who will say they could 
have won very easily, and I'm one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love is no longer hounded by questions about his lack of a major  
title -- a rainbow-inspired victory at the 1997 PGA Championship 
took care of that. But he's become a mini-version of Norman at 
Augusta: two seconds and two other top 10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy for Jose,'' said Love, who closed with a  
1-under-par 71 in the brutally difficult conditions. ``I know how 
much he loves this place after winning it before'' in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Love finished just one shot behind Ben Crenshaw,  
but everyone remembers Gentle Ben tapping in his bogey putt at 18, 
then breaking down in tears and dedicating the victory to his 
beloved teacher, Harvey Penick, who died a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, at least, Love provided a shot that won't be  
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Olazabal by two strokes as he came to the par-3 16th,  
Love struck his tee shot into the rough that borders the left side 
of the deeply sloping green, behind the hole. Needing to get up and 
down to have any chance, he pitched his ball about 10 feet wide of 
the flag and some 20 feet past the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, the ball did a U-turn and headed slowly down a ridge  
toward the cup, finally dropping in after several tantalizing 
seconds for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of signature shot that always seems to accompany  
a Masters champion. Love pumped his fists while the gallery roared 
in admiration and amazement, certainly loud enough for Olazabal and 
Norman to hear, playing just behind in the final group. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that went in, I ran up the hill toward the 17th tee and  
everyone was screaming,'' Love said. ``They were all excited and 
shocked, and I wanted them to keep screaming so the people behind 
would know that something great had happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Love, he didn't have another great shot in his  
repertoire. He felt fortunate to escape 17 with a par, knowing a 
birdie was practically impossible -- only two were made all day -- 
because of the rock-hard greens and tortuous pin placement. 
</P>
<P>
	At 18, Love landed his second shot about 20 feet right of the  
hole, giving himself a chance to put the pressure on Olazabal with 
a birdie. But the putt, similar to the one Mark O'Meara made a year 
ago to win the green jacket, slid by the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Love settled for par and knew he had squandered his final chance  
to catch the Spaniard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit the putt a little too hard and pushed it,'' he said. ``I  
felt like I had to make the putt at 18 to give me a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love was born a day after his late father finished tied for 31st  
at the 1964 Masters, and it's apparent that no other tournament 
stirs his emotions quite the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	In his eyes, the most exciting -- and terrifying -- steps in golf  
are through Amen Corner on a Sunday afternoon in April, the wind 
whipping through the pine trees as if the ghost of Bobby Jones 
wants to ensure no one gets the best of his golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	During that three-hole stretch in the far reaches of the course,  
Love hit the one shot he would like to have back. Grabbing a 3-wood 
out of his bag at 13, he snap-hooked his tee shot into the creek 
that runs along the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to take a drop and managed to scramble for a par with a  
25-foot putt. But that was a hole where three of the day's five 
eagles were made, along with 23 birdies, so Love knew he had let 
one or two shots get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bad swing at the wrong time on this course will kill you,''  
he moaned. ``It's disappointing, but I will build on it.''

<HEADLINE> Education Dept. Reviews Test Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A much-heralded gain in children's reading may  
have been overstated. Federal officials are trying to determine if 
1998 improvements on scores in some states occurred simply because 
those states excluded higher numbers of students with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no evidence of wrongdoing, said Pascal D. Forgione Jr.,  
chief of the Education Department's statistical branch. Indeed, new 
federal rules led the states to exclude more students. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue, which the department is investigating, is whether the  
excluded students, if they had taken the test, would have performed 
poorly, thus negating much of the gain. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in a decade, many states participating in the  
voluntary national test in 1998 showed significant increases in the 
reading scores of fourth-grade students, the only grade level 
available for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 scores drew particular attention because low-ranking  
states, many of which suffered political fallout over previous poor 
showings, also made gains. The achievements were celebrated last 
month by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Further review found that some states with high gains also left  
out more students from the testing sample. Kentucky pulled out 10 
percent of students selected for its 1998 sample, compared with 4 
percent in 1994. Louisiana pulled 13 percent in 1998, up from 6 
percent in 1994. And Connecticut, the nation's highest-scoring 
state, removed 10 percent of the students selected to participate, 
compared with 6 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics in some states say it's the exclusions, not better  
student performance, that led to the gains. The theory is that a 
state could raise overall scores by excluding high portions of 
students with disabilities, who often make poorer scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Since there are no scores for excluded students, no one can say  
for sure, Kent Orlander of the Lexington-based Family Foundation, 
which has questioned Kentucky's reform efforts, admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said, the increase is troubling: ``If you're  
taking out so many more students who are judged as less likely to 
achieve well on the test, how can you confidently assert that you 
are in fact improving?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Parks, spokesman for Kentucky's Department of Education,  
said critics can't assume the excluded children would have dragged 
down scores: ``Nobody knows what those students would have scored 
if they had taken the test,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, called the National Assessment of Educational  
Progress, is administered by a nationwide group established by 
Congress. The test is given roughly every two years to a nationwide 
sample of children in three grade levels in core subjects like math 
and reading. 
</P>
<P>
	It is generally the only way to compare student progress  
nationwide, because states' tests vary. States are not required to 
participate in national testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason why some states excluded more children in 1998 is  
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, the national test does not offer special  
consideration to students with special needs, such as reading a 
test to a blind student. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, state-sponsored tests often give such special help in an  
effort to test such children fairly and compare their results with 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous years, 1992 and 1994, the compromise on the national  
test was to have special students take it -- without special help -- 
if they spent at least half their time in a mainstream classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation changed for the 1998 test. A federal law began  
requiring that special-needs students get special help on any test 
comparing their results with others. The governing board of the 
National Assessment of Educational Progress responded by requiring 
that those students be excluded from the national test sample, 
regardless of whether they were in mainstream classes. Some states 
already had been excluding children with special-needs from taking 
the NAEP test. Thus, the percentage of children excluded in those 
states stayed the same or actually dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall nationwide, the percentage of students excluded did not  
change: thus, Education Department officials say the overall 
national test results for 1998, which showed a slight gain, would 
not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states also exclude children with limited English, but  
those percentages changed less than for special-education children 
and thus are believed to have less impact on test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department study, to be done by the nonprofit  
Educational Testing Service, will use a model to compare test 
scores of included students with the estimated performance of the 
types of students who were excluded, Forgione said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, scheduled for release in May, could lead officials  
to change policies, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Dolphins' Martin Faces Drug Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Martin insists he'll be able to play for  
the Miami Dolphins this season, even with a trial on charges of 
laundering drug money awaiting him in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt in my mind I'll be ready to go Sept. 13 in the  
opening game, where we need to kill the Broncos,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins introduced Martin at a news conference Monday. The  
33-year-old wide receiver smiled and joked, sounding cocky and 
carefree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in myself, and I believe in the Lord,'' he said.  
``He's not going to let anything happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Miami will determine  
whether Martin can play this season. The Dolphins signed him Friday 
to a four-year, $14.2 million contract, and he'll receive only 
$100,000 if he's unavailable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Martin wrote checks to lease luxury cars and pay  
legal fees for Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years in prison 
for 1980s drug convictions. Martin has said he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	After being indicted in February, Martin was released by the NFC  
champion Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed in a way, because I didn't understand  
why,'' he said. ``But I was happy because it gave me a chance to 
test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson didn't attend the news conference but  
issued a statement supporting Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding player, and I've always been impressed  
with him personally,'' Johnson said. ``There's no question he 
answers a need and strengthens our receiving corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins are counting on Martin to provide the deep threat  
they've been missing for several seasons. His average of 15.3 yards 
per catch ranks fifth among active receivers with at least 400 
receptions. Miami's O.J. McDuffie led the NFL last year with 90 
catches but averaged only 11.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins figure the threat of Dan Marino throwing long to  
Martin will loosen defenses and help their dismal running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fulfill the need the Dolphins have,'' Martin  
said. ``I'm going to stretch the defense, and I'm going to make the 
big plays. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Miami native and a converted small-college quarterback, Martin  
also played for the Dolphins from 1990 to 1993 but averaged just 27 
catches and two touchdowns a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young, and I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``I  
was a slow starter, and I didn't pick up the system well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami traded him for a fourth-round draft pick to San Diego,  
where he blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin enjoyed one of his best seasons in 1998 for Atlanta,  
making 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns. The federal 
investigation that led to the indictment didn't seem to affect his 
play. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Dolphins' Martin Faces Drug Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Martin insists he'll be able to play for  
the Miami Dolphins this season, even with a trial on charges of 
laundering drug money awaiting him in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt in my mind I'll be ready to go Sept. 13 in the  
opening game, where we need to kill the Broncos,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins introduced Martin at a news conference Monday. The  
33-year-old wide receiver smiled and joked, sounding cocky and 
carefree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in myself, and I believe in the Lord,'' he said.  
``He's not going to let anything happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial scheduled to begin Aug. 2 in Miami will determine  
whether Martin can play this season. The Dolphins signed him Friday 
to a four-year, $14.2 million contract, and he'll receive only 
$100,000 if he's unavailable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Martin wrote checks to lease luxury cars and pay  
legal fees for Rickey Brownlee, who served seven years in prison 
for 1980s drug convictions. Martin has said he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	After being indicted in February, Martin was released by the NFC  
champion Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed in a way, because I didn't understand  
why,'' he said. ``But I was happy because it gave me a chance to 
test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson didn't attend the news conference but  
issued a statement supporting Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an outstanding player, and I've always been impressed  
with him personally,'' Johnson said. ``There's no question he 
answers a need and strengthens our receiving corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins are counting on Martin to provide the deep threat  
they've been missing for several seasons. His average of 15.3 yards 
per catch ranks fifth among active receivers with at least 400 
receptions. Miami's O.J. McDuffie led the NFL last year with 90 
catches but averaged only 11.7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins figure the threat of Dan Marino throwing long to  
Martin will loosen defenses and help their dismal running game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fulfill the need the Dolphins have,'' Martin  
said. ``I'm going to stretch the defense, and I'm going to make the 
big plays. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Miami native and a converted small-college quarterback, Martin  
also played for the Dolphins from 1990 to 1993 but averaged just 27 
catches and two touchdowns a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was young, and I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``I  
was a slow starter, and I didn't pick up the system well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami traded him for a fourth-round draft pick to San Diego,  
where he blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin enjoyed one of his best seasons in 1998 for Atlanta,  
making 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns. The federal 
investigation that led to the indictment didn't seem to affect his 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've got a profession, you can't let things distract  
you,'' he said. ``My job is to go out there and catch passes on 
Sunday, no matter what is going on around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin beat the Dolphins on a 35-yard touchdown reception in the  
final regular-season game last year. Following the game, Martin 
said, Marino and McDuffie told him they wished he could play for 
the Dolphins.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Ready for Home Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mark Portugal warmed up on the mound, a lawn mower  
hummed in center field and workers painted last touches of Fenway 
green on the backstop Monday as the Red Sox prepared for Tuesday's 
home opener against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston will enter the game with a 5-1 record after its first  
loss, 5-4 to Tampa Bay on Sunday. The last time the Red Sox started 
the season with five consecutive wins was in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Red Sox have managed to get more than half of those wins  
without the help of shortstop standout Nomar Garciaparra. Until his 
pinch-hitting appearance in the ninth inning Sunday, Garciaparra, 
who strained his left hamstring last Wednesday in Kansas City, had 
not played in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the shortstop received ice and massage treatment for  
his injury and said he did not know how long he will be out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to play it safe and give myself a while,''  
Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said the team will decide  
within the next couple of days whether Garciaparra will go on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Donnie Sadler has played well at shortstop and,  
to the pleasure of Boston manager Jimy Williams, the rest of the 
players have also picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing so far is that every one of our players has  
played,'' Williams said. ``All 25 have been in the game, and that's 
what they're there for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams cited the strong offensive work of Jose Offerman, who  
will enter home opener with a .483 batting average and a six-game 
streak in which he has had two or more hits. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Offerman has proved himself worthy of the four year, $26  
million contract he signed in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette, who was criticized for signing an infielder with a  
.278 career batting average to such a rich deal, said he was not 
surprised by Offerman's success this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy's a good hitter,'' Duquette said. ``It's in the  
books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong start, however, the Red Sox have batted just  
.244 with batters in scoring position in the first six games. And 
Boston has left 54 runners on base, including 14 in the loss 
against Tampa Bay on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're leaving too many people in scoring position,'' said  
hitting coach Jim Rice. ``But we haven't been (criticized) because 
we're 5-1. If we had left a lot of guys on base and we're 0-6, then 
it's a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder Brian Daubach agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been that big of a deal because we're winning,'' he  
said. ``But sooner or later, you leave that many guys on base and 
it'll catch up to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Daubach was not so concerned about the team's collective  
hitting as he sat in the clubhouse and read the local sports pages 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 27-year-old who had his first major league debut on  
Friday night when he went 2-for-5 against Tampa Bay, was more 
focused on his first game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing in the minor leagues eight or nine years and  
even those games make me nervous,'' Daubach said. ``You've just got 
to get through them.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines' Fare Increase Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Most of the nation's airlines dropped out of a  
Continental Airlines-led overall fare increase Monday, opting 
instead to raise scattered prices in selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates say it won't be long before those higher  
fares drop back to last week's prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental announced Friday an across-the-board 3 percent fare  
increase for leisure travel and 1 percent boost for walk-up 
tickets. The move quickly was matched by United Airlines, Delta Air 
Lines and America West. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday, the fare increase collapsed when some other major  
carriers, including Northwest Airlines and American Airlines, 
failed to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all advance ticket prices rolled back to their  
Thursday rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 21-day advance ticket retreated, Continental and  
others let stand increases for some three-, seven- and 14-day 
advance fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it was rescinded, part of it remains in effect,''  
spokesman Dave Messing of Houston-based Continental said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Chiames, spokesman for AMR Corp., parent company of  
American, said any recent fare increases have been on a selected 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fares might be changing, but I couldn't tell you which ones,''  
Chiames said. ``There was no across-the-board fare increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American upset passengers in February when its pilots held a  
``sickout,'' forcing the airline to cancel flights for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no common rule to which fares are higher and which  
lower, meaning consumers will need to work hard to find the lowest 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Parsons, who operates the Internet air fare site  
www.bestfares.com, says it appears Continental and other carriers 
grew weary of offering what he calls ``junk fares'' -- tickets lower 
than a 21-day advance price. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted the new fare increases will roll back within the  
next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``History shows that the guys with the higher fares blink,''  
Parsons said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the airline industry, prices shift quickly as carriers try to  
hedge their bets on what the consumer will pay. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, most carriers offer as many as 12 different fares  
for the same 14-day advance ticket. When a set number of seats are 
sold at the lowest price, the airline begins selling at a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, operator of the Internet travel site  
www.onetravel.com, said most major carriers held onto increases of 
as much as $40 in certain markets. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a 14-day advance, Houston-to-Richmond flight on  
Continental cost $214 or $274 roundtrip on Thursday, depending on 
the day of departure, Trippler said. 
</P>
<P>
	That same flight purchased Monday costs $254 or $314.  
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines' 14-day advance Detroit-to-Raleigh, N.C.,  
flight was $210 roundtrip on Thursday. Monday it was $250, Trippler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those benchmark fares did not go up but they played with other  
fares,'' he said. ``The consumer is going to pay more (Monday) than 
they did on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as fares fluctuated throughout the day, Parsons said two  
airlines appeared to keep fares lower overall -- TWA and Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't last, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The other guys are not going to let Northwest and TWA have the  
cheapest,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Angelos Considers Redskins Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos is  
considering a $625 million bid for the Washington Redskins now that 
a bid supported by the estate of late Redskins owner Jack Kent 
Cooke has been turned down by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reviewing the matter,'' Angelos told The Washington  
Post. ``We'll make a decision shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls Monday by The Associated Press to Angelos' office were not  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has put off a decision on the sale of the Redskins  
after team owners were unwilling to support a bid by a group led by 
businessman Howard Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein withdrew his group's $800 million bid last week when it  
became clear he would not receive the necessary 24 votes from 31 
NFL teams. Several owners expressed a preference for Cooke's son, 
team president John Kent Cooke, to own the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos dropped out of the bidding with an offer that topped  
$600 million, sources told the Post. NFL officials have said the 
league's cross-ownership rules would prevent Angelos from owning 
the Orioles and the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said Angelos might be willing to increase his bid or  
merge with another group. During the first round, Angelos indicated 
a willingness to join with the younger Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the sale is the new Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in  
Landover, Md.

<HEADLINE> Nomo Wins in Shaky Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Hideo Nomo allowed three earned runs and  
six hits in five innings, struggling early as the Iowa Cubs beat 
the Salt Lake Buzz 10-5 today in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo got the win in his first start since signing with the  
Chicago Cubs on April 1. Sunday's game was his first in nearly 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as making this step toward the major leagues, of course  
I'm grateful to the Cubs for giving me a chance to get back, and 
hopefully I'll get back soon,'' Nomo said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thought I had stepping onto the mound was just being  
really conscious of my control and trying to get the ball in the 
strike zone,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year, was released by the Mets  
after struggling during spring training. He allowed a single and a 
double to his first two batters and gave up two runs in the first 
inning. Jacque Jones, his second batter, lined a breaking ball off 
the top of the center-field wall, missing a home run by inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo gave up a solo homer to David Ortiz leading off the third,  
then retired nine of his last 10 batters, striking out three. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early innings I was a bit too conscious of my  
control,'' Nomo said. ``Maybe that's why I let too many pitches 
over the plate. That's probably why they got hit. As the game 
progressed, I thought I started to get more life on my fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo will start two more games for Iowa, and Chicago then will  
decide whether to bring him up or to release him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really say if I'm on track, but each game I have to go  
out there and do the best that I can,'' Nomo said. ``Every game, 
it's not about taking a step. You almost have to pitch it almost 
like it's your last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo won 45 games for the Los Angeles Dodgers, but struggled  
last season and was traded to the New York Mets in June. He went 
4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was ineffective 
this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets gave up on Nomo on March 24, sending him outright to  
Class AAA Norfolk and then putting him on unconditional release 
waivers two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs signed Nomo two days later to what could be a $2.8  
million contract if the Cubs elect to keep him. His major-league 
salary calls for an $800,000 base with $1 million in bonuses for 
games started and innings pitched and another $1 million in bonuses 
if he is on the active roster at four preset dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to get a free look with no strings attached,  
we had to give him some things that were reasonable, in my 
opinion,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said last week. ``He 
wanted the right after three starts in Triple-A, or a month, that 
either he comes to the big leagues or we release him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus, one of the things that was a concern to him was if he  
goes out and has a huge year for us, he would like the opportunity 
out on the free-agent market if we are not able to agree to an 
extension. So we agreed we sign him to an extension at the end of 
the year or give him his unconditional release.''

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilot union, held in contempt  
over a February sickout that canceled thousands of flights and cost 
millions of dollars, was due back in court today as a judge 
considers the amount of the union's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered the Allied Pilots  
Association to make a $10 million down payment, about 25 percent of 
the union's worth, toward a fine levied for the three days pilots 
defied his back-to-work order in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between the union and the air carrier reached a  
fever point over American's decision late last year to buy Reno 
Air. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated into 
American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
effected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Their inability to reach an agreement led to a massive sickout  
of about 2,500 pilots over 10 days, resulting in the cancellation 
of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,  
estimates the work stoppage cost more than $50 million. The APA 
contends that the sickout was within the union's rights, saying the 
company had violated the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	As the union contends with the dispute with its company, as well  
as the contempt fine before the court, APA also is dealing with 
several civil lawsuits. Several passengers have filed lawsuits 
against the union because their flights were disrupted by the 
sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, which have all been moved to federal court in  
Dallas, seek damages of more than $200 million. Attorneys expect 
the complaints will be consolidated into a single class-action 
lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while the pilots brawled with the company over the Reno Air  
purchase, flight attendants were able to reach agreement with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Professional Flight Attendants and AMR  
reached a settlement last week on how to absorb the low-cost 
carrier. They did not disclose details. AMR also has announced it 
has reached agreement with the Transport Workers Union, which 
represents American's 28,000 aviation maintenance technicians and 
fleet workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, American will begin training Reno airport and  
reservations agents to join the airline. The integration is 
expected to be completed by August.

<HEADLINE> CBS Invests in Two Web Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is exchanging $200 million worth of  
advertising and promotion for stakes in two Web sites, continuing a 
strategy that has already paid off handsomely with two other 
startup companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company announced the acquisition Monday of a  
Dallas-area TV station for $485 million in stock. With the purchase 
of KTVT from Gaylord Entertainment Co., CBS will own 15 stations 
across the country, reaching 34 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of deals comes less than two weeks after CBS  
announced the purchase of leading television syndicator King World 
Productions Inc. for $2.5 billion in stock, the latest effort in a 
drive by incoming president Mel Karmazin to remake what has been 
seen as a stodgy old media company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Internet deals, CBS is capitalizing on its ability to  
deliver access to large numbers of viewers and listeners in 
exchange for ownership stakes in small Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the strategy has reaped huge rewards. The value of CBS's  
combined stake in its two earlier Internet partners, CBS 
Marketwatch.com and SportsLine USA Inc., has soared to more than 
$500 million thanks to successful stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals announced Monday give CBS sizable stakes in two more  
Web companies in exchange for promoting them. CBS will also provide 
some entertainment content to one of the sites and lend its 
powerful brand name to the other, making its investment in each 
worth $100 million. No cash or stock will change hands. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will get 35 percent of hollywood.com, a Web site that  
provides information and listings for movies as well as interviews 
with stars. The rest of the site will be owned by Big Entertainment 
Inc., a Boca Raton, Fla.-based company whose founders also started 
the Sci-Fi Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other deal, CBS will get a 50 percent ownership stake in  
storeRunner.com, a year-old site that scans other locations on the 
Internet for good deals for shoppers. CBS will also lend its brand 
name to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have been positive about CBS's strategy, which involves  
little risk or expense for the company. The potential rewards are 
high if the companies succeed and sell shares to the public, taking 
advantage of investors' seemingly insatiable appetite for Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great way for them to increase their exposure to the  
Internet,'' said Paul Sweeney, broadcasting analyst with Salomon 
Smith Barney. ``Like other broadcasters, CBS has a very valuable 
asset -- the ability to deliver a wide number of viewers. It's a 
low-risk way for CBS to become a major player on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other broadcasters have also been expanding into the online  
world. General Electric Co.'s NBC has an investment in the Snap! 
Internet portal and a minority stake in ValueVision, the third 
largest home-shopping cable network. Walt Disney Co.'s ABC network 
has stakes in the Infoseek portal and the Go Network.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Eyes Staying in Bronx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a lot of talk about moving, the New York  
Yankees might be staying in the Bronx for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	With the team's lease expiring in 2002, principal owner George  
Steinbrenner said in Crain's New York Business magazine Monday that 
he might exercise an option and remain at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some options on that lease. ... We can extend it at  
least five years,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner has repeatedly delayed a decision on whether the  
World Series champions would remain at their hallowed ballpark, 
move to the West Side of Manhattan or to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has no deal from New Jersey and would face  
considerable opposition if he wanted to go forward with the West 
Side plan. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest position, the magazine said, is that he would be more  
likely to stay if the politicians agree to upgrade the area around 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to improve the schools, improve the living  
conditions for the people, then I may want to stay there and 
help,'' Steinbrenner said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Show Girls in Calif. Follies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- On stage, 86-year-old Maryetta Evans  
has fallen and she can't get up. 
</P>
<P>
	So two tuxedoed men gently lift her from a perfectly executed  
scissors-split and deposit her in a wheelchair, from which she 
resumes tap dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Evans doesn't really need the chair. It's just a prop in a  
hilarious dance number involving walkers, canes and crutches. She 
did need help, though, getting off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Palm Springs Follies -- an aging chorus line of  
former show girls and male hoofers that is part shtick, part 
extravaganza and part minor miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	It has attracted a white-haired following not seen since Mitch  
Miller. Nearly every show sells out. Annual gross ticket sales top 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Emcee, director and producer Riff Markowitz, 60, covets the  
spotlight and sometimes laughs longer at his jokes than the 
audience. His stuff is decidedly politically incorrect. He tells 
ethnic jokes, bathroom jokes, old people jokes and talks a great 
deal about his prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is the 11 ``Long-legged Lovelies'' who truly own the  
show, a geriatric Florenz Ziegfeld-meets-Busby Berkeley revue now 
in its eighth season, replete with feather dances, towering 
headdresses and bulging breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dancers must be at least 50. Most of the women are in their  
60s and 70s, with shapely gams, statuesque posture -- and liver 
spots and wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
	One is a former Rockette, several appeared on Broadway, another  
was a June Taylor dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most were retired or on their way there when they heard about  
auditions for the Follies in Palm Springs, the desert resort that's 
been home to celebrities, former presidents and so many retirees 
it's also called God's Waiting Room. 
</P>
<P>
	Phyllis Sherwood, 64, auditioned two years ago at the insistence  
of a former classmate from New York's High School of Performing 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	She had already done Broadway, and played Vegas for years with  
husband and bandleader Bobby Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't any different than when I was young. In the  
dressing rooms we were catty, we laughed all the time,'' said Leila 
Burgess, 62, Sherwood's former classmate. 
</P>
<P>
	These women are bawdy, loud and grandmothers. While trying to  
grab a meal between shows, the air is decidedly blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sherwood is recounting what ``Mr. M.'' -- the director  
Markowitz -- asked when they met. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you walk like a show girl?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Honey,'' replied the well-endowed Ms. Sherwood, ``I can walk  
any way you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They do 232 shows per year, most twice a day. Each performance  
is three hours, with some 20 costume changes, almost as many wigs, 
a dog show, a ventriloquist and guest stars including 
song-and-dance men Donald O'Connor and Howard Keel. 
</P>
<P>
	Markowitz, a former television producer, had just retired in  
Palm Springs when a group of city officials asked him to save 
downtown's 800-seat Plaza Theatre, built in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous live shows hadn't fared well, Markowitz said. But a  
chance to revisit the past -- via the music of Irving Berlin and 
Johnny Mercer -- and the inspiration of seeing women their age pull 
their legs past their heads drew aging crowds willing to pay up to 
$65 for an orchestra seat. 
</P>
<P>
	They come in buses from Arizona, San Diego and points between,  
arriving in wheelchairs, pushing walkers and leaning on canes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the show, the audience stands during the last scene, an  
extravaganza that runs a patriotic gamut from the Battle Hymn of 
the Republic to the Star Spangled Banner. It applauds wildly for 
Bob Moore and His Amazing Mongrels, all saved from the pound and 
trained to jump through hoops, walk tightropes, and bark at 
earsplitting levels. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an audience that knows every word of ``Paper Doll'' and  
sings along with 84-year-old Donald Mills, the last survivor of the 
Mills Brothers, who looks a bit unsteady and thankful for the help. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, backstage, 75-year-old Dorothy Kloss becomes serious amid  
the dancers' ribald laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	After years away from the spotlight, ``we didn't feel glamorous  
anymore,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we've all dropped 15 years just being in the  
Follies. All of a sudden we started going shopping and doing 
something with our hair.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Woman Survives 8 Days in Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- An 83-year-old woman who got lost on a  
drive home from the post office spent eight days without food and 
water before she was found in a remote valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Joann Beebe, who was discovered in her car Sunday by a group of  
target hunters, was hospitalized in serious condition recovering 
from hypothermia, dehydration and frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing,'' Diane Beebe said of her mother-in-law. ``She  
is so happy to see us. She is still a bit confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family members reported her missing April 3. She had failed to  
return home to the rural community of Wimer after driving to the 
post office to mail some letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Pemberton, who works with Beebe's son, Dick, was out target  
shooting with his sons when they spotted Beebe's red car. 
</P>
<P>
	They heard Beebe's Pomeranian barking, looked inside and found  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is quite a miracle that she survived,'' Pemberton said.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union was back in court  
Monday to explain to a judge why it shouldn't have to pay millions 
of dollars in fines over the pilot sickout last February. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall began hearing testimony about  
damages for a contempt of court decision against the Allied Pilots 
Association for not encouraging its members to return to their 
cockpits. About 2,500 pilots called in sick over 10 days, resulting 
in the cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Kendall ordered the union to make a $10 million  
down payment, about 25 percent of the union's worth, toward a fine 
levied for the three days pilots defied his back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing Monday, union attorneys argued that only the 233  
pilots who called in after the judge's order should be considered 
when damages are being calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was unimpressed with that argument.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I said in that order was, the harm caused here wasn't  
just the people who called in but the hundreds and hundreds who 
failed to clear themselves off the sick list,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also denied a motion asking for a jury and said the  
case will stay before him. Kendall recessed the hearing late Monday 
afternoon and said it would resume Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	American's parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,  
estimates the flight cancellations cost about $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Expert witnesses for the union testified, however, that the  
company's estimated loss was between $1.4 million and $4.7 million, 
depending on the time period the judge set. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst for the sickout was an inability by the union and  
American to agree on the assimilation of the recently purchased 
Reno Air. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated 
into American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
affected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	As the union contends with the dispute with its company, as well  
as the contempt fine before the court, APA also is dealing with 
civil lawsuits. Several passengers have filed lawsuits against the 
union because their flights were disrupted by the sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits, which have all been moved to federal court in  
Dallas, seek damages of more than $200 million. Attorneys expect 
the complaints will be consolidated into a single class-action 
lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while the pilots brawled with the company over the Reno Air  
purchase, other employee groups, representing flight attendants and 
aviation maintenance technicians and fleet workers, have reached an 
agreement with American.

<HEADLINE> Ex-East German Sports Medic Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A former East German medical official has been  
given the heaviest fine to date in trials dealing with the 
systematic doping program of athletes in the communist state. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietrich Hannemann, former chief of the state-run Sports  
Medicine Service, was convicted of accessory to causing bodily harm 
in 109 cases and fined $25,000, a Berlin district court said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hannemann, 64, ran the medical service between 1977 and 1989 and  
was responsible for giving performance-enhancing drugs to swimmers 
and track and field athletes, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 109 athletes who were given drugs suffered health problems  
as a result, the statement said. Twenty-five of them had pressed 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Four physicians and two former East German coaches have been  
fined so far for giving drugs to athletes, many of them 
unsuspecting teen-age athletic prodigies. 
</P>
<P>
	More trials are expected to follow in upcoming months.

<HEADLINE>  Olazabal Isn't Forgotten Golfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Until he slipped on the same green jacket he  
wore five years ago, Jose Maria Olazabal had become the forgotten 
Spaniard, caught between the past and the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Fading into the twilight was Seve Ballesteros and his five major  
championships, two of them at Augusta National in which he 
conquered the treacherous greens with a majestic short game. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63rd Masters was the debut of the heir apparent to  
Ballesteros -- Sergio Garcia, a cocky kid who won the British 
Amateur last summer at 18 and became the first European to take low 
amateur honors at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was lucky to be playing again. He spent 18 months out  
of golf with a lower back problem that left him unable to walk. He 
returned in 1997 and won the Turespana Masters, but made the Ryder 
Cup only as a captain's pick. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the forefront Sunday with a dynamic display of  
pressure golf on the back nine of Augusta, and suddenly he was the 
toast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros, who missed the cut and returned home, sent his  
congratulations by fax and released a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won with authority from beginning to the end,'' Ballesteros  
said. ``This triumph will compensate him, in part, for some of the 
bad moments that destiny wanted him to face with courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar also  
offered congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory of faith,'' the Spanish sports newspaper Marca wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper El Pais added: ``Spanish golf is at the top  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Greg Norman for as long as it took him to line up a  
20-foot birdie putt on the 13th, Olazabal put three strokes between 
them over the next three holes and won by two strokes over Davis 
Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal became the only player to win two Masters in the 1990s,  
and the 11th European to win in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one, I'm pretty sure I'm going to enjoy much more than  
the one I had before, for several reasons,'' Olazabal said, tugging 
at the lapel of his green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important one is the problems I went through to be  
here,'' he said. ``And also because it's my second major. I won my 
first one ... you might say, 'OK, it might have been a lucky week.' 
But when you win two -- especially the way I did it -- means a lot 
more to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way Olazabal won is the how the Masters is almost always  
decided. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew that after his 66 in the second round gave him the lead  
going into the weekend. He knew after he made three straight bogeys 
early in the final round that knocked him out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked down the steep slope toward the sixth tee, turned to  
caddie Brenden McCartain and said, ``We still can make a few pars, 
make a birdie or two, and I think we have a chance to win the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the alterations at Augusta, one thing never changes  
-- the Masters doesn't begin until the 10th tee has the sun begins 
to drop behind the Georgia pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal played those final nine holes better than anyone. He  
became only the fourth champion since 1981 to go without a bogey on 
the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner is not going to be the one who makes the most  
birdies, but the one who makes the fewest mistakes,'' Colin 
Montgomerie predicted after the first round, alluding to the rough, 
the extra length on the 17th hole and the newly raised green on No. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal did a little of both. Augusta required no less.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time he and Greg Norman walked to the 10th tee, five  
players were tied for the lead at 5-under -- those two, along with 
Davis Love III, Steve Pate and Bob Estes. David Duval and Lee 
Janzen were another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, they dropped from the top.  
</P>
<P>
	Pate, who made a Masters-record seven consecutive birdies on  
Saturday, made 10 straight pars on Sunday. That might have sufficed 
on a most difficult day at Augusta when no one broke 70 in the 
final round for the first time since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pate finally buckled at the 11th with a bogey, and then fell  
out of contention for good with bogeys on the 16th and 17th. Estes 
dropped only one shot, also at No. 11, but never could get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the only other player among the contenders who didn't  
make a bogey, but even his unforgettable chip-in on No. 16 -- he 
played the shot 25 feet left the flag and let it catch the slope 
into the hole -- wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal took care of that, and he also took care of Norman.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Spaniard knew the green jacket he wore Sunday  
was the same he was given in 1994 because his name on the inside 
was misspelled -- Olazabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many knew about him in 1994, and not many cared about him  
this time. The cheers were for Tom Lehman then, and they were even 
more raucous for Norman on Sunday, everyone pulling for him to end 
a career of misery at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman didn't collapse like he did in 1996. He didn't get burned  
by a miracle shot like the one Larry Mize pulled off in 1987. He 
didn't make a blunder on the 18th hole like 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't play the kind of golf Olazabal produced, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a heartbreak,'' said Norman, who finished third after  
playing in the final group at a major for the eighth time. ``Look 
at that leaderboard. There's probably a lot of other guys here who 
can sit here and say they're heartbroken, too.''

</P>
<P>
	Despite all the alterations at Augusta, one thing never changes  
-- the Masters doesn't begin until the 10th tee has the sun begins 
to drop behind the Georgia pines. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal played those final nine holes better than anyone. He  
became only the fourth champion since 1981 to go without a bogey on 
the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner is not going to be the one who makes the most  
birdies, but the one who makes the fewest mistakes,'' Colin 
Montgomerie predicted after the first round, alluding to the rough, 
the extra length on the 17th hole and the newly raised green on No. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal did a little of both. Augusta required no less.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time he and Greg Norman walked to the 10th tee, five  
players were tied for the lead at 5-under -- those two, along with 
Davis Love III, Steve Pate and Bob Estes. David Duval and Lee 
Janzen were another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, they dropped from the top.  
</P>
<P>
	Pate, who made a Masters-record seven consecutive birdies on  
Saturday, made 10 straight pars on Sunday. That might have sufficed 
on a most difficult day at Augusta when no one broke 70 in the 
final round for the first time since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pate finally buckled at the 11th with a bogey, and then fell  
out of contention for good with bogeys on the 16th and 17th. Estes 
dropped only one shot, also at No. 11, but never could get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the only other player among the contenders who didn't  
make a bogey, but even his unforgettable chip-in on No. 16 -- he 
played the shot 25 feet left the flag and let it catch the slope 
into the hole -- wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal took care of that, and he also took care of Norman.  
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Spaniard knew the green jacket he wore Sunday  
was the same he was given in 1994 because his name on the inside 
was misspelled -- Olazabel. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many knew about him in 1994, and not many cared about him  
this time. The cheers were for Tom Lehman then, and they were even 
more raucous for Norman on Sunday, everyone pulling for him to end 
a career of misery at Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman didn't collapse like he did in 1996. He didn't get burned  
by a miracle shot like the one Larry Mize pulled off in 1987. He 
didn't make a blunder on the 18th hole like 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't play the kind of golf Olazabal produced, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a heartbreak,'' said Norman, who finished third after  
playing in the final group at a major for the eighth time. ``Look 
at that leaderboard. There's probably a lot of other guys here who 
can sit here and say they're heartbroken, too.''

<HEADLINE> Progress Slow on Visitors' Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional turf fights are holding up  
action on a $160 million Capitol visitors center given impetus last 
summer when a gunman burst into the building and killed two police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are no closer to completion of this facility today than  
when these two officers were gunned down,'' Sen. Harry Reid, 
D-Nev., complained recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have created a bureaucratic nightmare,'' said Reid, who  
served as a Capitol Hill police officer while working his way 
through law school in the 1960s and has been a leading advocate of 
the new visitors' center. 
</P>
<P>
	But others stress the need to move carefully in considering what  
experts say would be the biggest construction project since the 
House and Senate wings were added in the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has spent a decade considering the idea of an  
underground center on the east side of the Capitol Building that 
would give as many as 18,000 tourists a day access to historical 
displays, bathrooms and food while they wait to begin tours, and 
free them from long lines outside in the winter cold and summer 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol doctors are treating a dozen visitors a week during the  
summer for heat-related illnesses, Secretary of the Senate Gary 
Cisco said at a recent hearing. ``Entry to the Capitol should not 
have to be an endurance test,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1991, Republican opposition to the cost, then estimated  
at $71 million, put the plan on hold, and it was revived only with 
last year's attack when the lone gunman shot his way into the 
office of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, before he was 
stopped. The gunman, Russell Weston, Jr. , is being held in federal 
prison pending further psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders, backed by Capitol Hill police, said the  
center would move security screening away from the Capitol 
Building, better protecting those within. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 budget includes $100 million for the project, but  
allows spending only after all the involved committees in the House 
and Senate agree to the plan. And that agreement so far has been 
hard to get. Senate committees have just approved a first step 
toward that, granting up to $2.8 million for planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert Franklin of the Architect of the Capitol's office said  
they are now revising a 1995 plan, and, if everyone signs off, 
could be ready to begin the design and engineering phase by this 
fall. But ``with four or five different committees there is no way 
of predicting how many months will be consumed'' before approval is 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Architect's Office, well aware of the vagaries of the  
legislative process, puts the completion date for the project at 
anywhere between 2004 and 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin said his office is hoping the House and Senate will  
create a bicameral commission that would oversee the project and 
reduce lines of authority. Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., a member of the 
House Administration Committee that oversees House security, has 
pushed that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Mica's spokesman said he had urged House Speaker Dennis Hastert  
to identify clearly who is in charge of the project. Hastert and 
his Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Trent Lott, have been 
largely silent on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Somerville, staff director of the Senate Rules and  
Administration Committee said the chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, 
R-Ky., planned a hearing on the issue this spring and was 
interested in moving ahead with the project. She noted that ``there 
will be a gigantic hole in the ground for a few years so we need to 
do this correctly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is some concern about uprooting some very old trees during  
construction and the Supreme Court and Library of Congress, located 
across the street from the proposed center, have suggested that 
they be linked by tunnels to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Also still undecided is how to pay for the center, which Cisco  
estimated would cost around $159 million. He said efforts are under 
way to raise up to $70 million in private funds to augment the $100 
million in public money approved last year, but Reid and others 
oppose using private funding for this major addition to the 
nation's Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Tomato Nutrient May Fight Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors are aiming a surprisingly powerful  
new weapon at cancer -- the tomato. 
</P>
<P>
	Many studies have shown that men who eat lots of tomato-rich  
food, such as pasta sauce, are less likely to get prostate cancer. 
New research takes this a step further, showing for the first time 
that a tomato extract actually seems to shrink prostate tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new findings pan out in larger studies, they suggest that  
the lowly tomato may offer a way to both prevent cancer and treat 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows exactly how tomatoes might ward off cancer, but  
many suspect it's lycopene, the stuff that makes tomatoes red and 
already one of the trendiest of nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, most of the support for tomatoes has come from  
studies that follow the eating habits of large groups of people 
over time. In an analysis published in February, Dr. Edward 
Giovannucci of Harvard Medical School reviewed 72 studies that 
looked for a link between cancer risk and food made with tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 57 linked tomato intake with a reduced risk, and in 35  
of those, the association was strong enough to be considered 
statistically meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
	The data were most compelling for cancers of the prostate, lung  
and stomach. They also suggest links between tomatoes and lower 
levels of several other tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, 
esophageal, oral, breast and cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest work attempted to see if lycopene is truly the key  
ingredient. Doctors tested lycopene extracted from tomatoes on men 
who were about to undergo prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit tested  
33 men who were randomly assigned to take lycopene or nothing for 
30 days before their operations. Before surgery, the volunteers 
showed no obvious signs that their cancer had spread. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery, the doctors found that cancer tissue was less  
likely to extend clear to the edges of the lycopene users' prostate 
glands, a sign that the operation may have halted cancer. And 
pre-cancerous cells in their prostates were less abnormal-looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that lycopene results in a decrease of the tumor  
size and makes the cancer less aggressive,'' said Dr. Omar Kucuk, 
who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among American  
men. The American Cancer Society estimates that 179,300 men will be 
diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and 37,000 will die from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucuk presented his findings in Philadelphia on Monday at a  
meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. He noted 
that his study is small and cautioned against routine use of 
lycopene supplements without further evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycopene pills are widely available. In the study, financed by  
the Karmanos institute, volunteers were given two daily 
15-milligram capsules of Lyc-O-Mato, a lycopene extract made by 
LycoRed Natural Products of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Kucuk said this is the amount of lycopene found in about a pound  
of tomatoes; since lycopene is not easily absorbed from raw 
tomatoes, it might take two or three pounds to actually raise blood 
levels as high as were seen in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are significant,'' said Dr. Frank Rauscher of the  
Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. ``It's remarkable that lycopene 
may have both therapeutic and preventative value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the study's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Cancer had spread to the very edge of the prostate gland or  
beyond in seven of the 21 men on lycopene, compared with nine of 
the 12 in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Levels of PSA -- prostate specific antigen, a measure of tumor  
activity -- fell 20 percent between the start of treatment and 
surgery in the lycopene patients. They were unchanged in the 
comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pre-cancerous but worrisome tissue in the lycopene patients  
was also less abnormal-looking.

<HEADLINE> Writers Guild OKs Strike Vs. CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Writers Guild of America voted Monday to  
authorize its bargaining committee to call a strike against CBS 
television and radio news operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The guild said 94 percent of its members in New York,  
Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles voted to authorize the 
committee to call a strike. The current contract expires Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The guild, which represents news writers, editors, graphic  
artists, desk assistants and others at CBS, said in a statement the 
network ``has proposed a series of rollbacks to the contract 
including the elimination of a traditional pension program, 
allowing non-guild members to perform writing assignments, a 
reduction in compensatory days off and the elimination of paid 
lunch periods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS said it would not have any comment on the negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	The guild last struck CBS in 1987. The walkout lasted six weeks.

<HEADLINE> More Firms Boost Workers' Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More and more, U.S. companies are teaching  
workers their ABCs and 123s on the job, according to a new study by 
the American Management Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a tight labor market and a rising need for  
better-skilled applicants, companies are offering remedial lessons 
to workers who lack basic math and reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as easy to walk into a K-Mart, Sears or Burger King  
and get a job now, considering the higher level of skills needed to 
deal with inventory or computers,'' said Eric Rolfe Greenberg, 
director of management studies at the New York-based nonprofit 
management-education group. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization's January survey of 1,054 member companies,  
released Monday, found that nearly 15 percent of companies offer 
basic skills programs, about the same as a year ago. Nine percent 
even hire applicants who lack basic skills and then enter them in 
remedial training programs, up from 5 percent two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	First Chicago, now merging with Bank One, began blending basic  
skills into its regular training programs four years ago with a 
grant from the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	In one class about processing checks, new hires ``were taught  
parts of a check, but never dealt with the mathematics of it, and 
errors were made,'' said Tamara Baloun, vice president and regional 
staffing manager for Bank One, First Chicago's merger partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the bank's class for check processors includes work in  
reading and writing large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In another class, trainers teach workers in detail how to cope  
with written directions, she said. ``Before, you'd assume they 
could skim and scan and prioritize. ... Today you make sure they 
know how,'' said Ms. Baloun. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more job applicants are lacking basic skills, the  
American Management Association study found. Nearly 36 percent of 
applicants lack the reading and math skills they need to do the job 
they seek, up from 23 percent in 1997, the management group found. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that's partly becuase higher levels of skills are  
demanded today, it's also true that many Americans can't read or do 
simple math well. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 federal survey found that 40 million to 44 million  
American adults had problems reading, writing and doing math -- the 
skills considered necessary for functioning in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	Until three years ago, Boeing didn't give hourly workers any  
basic skills assessments. Nowadays, many of those workers volunteer 
for the reading and math classes offered by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people came into the company through an application  
and interview process that wouldn't have discovered'' their lack of 
skills, said Charles Wetmore, an administrator of Boeing's Quality 
Through Training Program for hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, meanwhile, is implementing its testing programs at  
First Chicago to screen out applicants who might get hired, then 
fail in training, said Ms. Baloun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so hard to get qualified applicants, and we're dipping  
lower. We need to know they have the skills,'' said Ms. Baloun. ``A 
high school education isn't an indication of a skill level 
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Memorials Draw Parallels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Most people know the 82-year-old Jewish  
cabinetmaker by the name Morris Shulman. But he has another 
identity tattooed on his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	It reads ``124234,'' a number given to him by the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
	Shulman, who was liberated from the Buchenwald concentration  
camp, joined other Holocaust survivors Sunday to commemorate Yom 
Hashoah or Holocaust Day, which honors victims of the genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freed 54 years ago exactly. April 11, 1945, at about 1  
o'clock. I weighed 72 pounds,'' he said, pausing to smile. ``It's a 
joyful day. My second birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 350 others attended the event at the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center and Museum of Tolerance, near a 15-foot marble menorah and a 
memorial etched with the names of European cities whose Jewish 
populations were decimated during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Consul General Yoram Ben Ze'ev said the ceremony should  
remind Jews that they have a responsibility to aid Kosovo Albanian 
refugees who are suffering similar persecution by Yugoslavian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not allowed to be quiet,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York, some of the 2,000 who gathered at a Manhattan  
synagogue to commemorate Holocaust Day also noted that ethnic 
persecution continues in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak,'' said  
Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering of Jewish 
Holocaust Survivors. ``It can happen to anyone, to any group of 
people. The slaughter of Kosovo and in other places must be brought 
to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton sent a message that read in part: ``As we seek  
to learn from these tragic lessons of the past, let us resolve to 
work together to build a future where peace, tolerance and 
understanding drive away the shadows of violence, prejudice and 
ignorance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering in Los Angeles served to open an exhibit  
chronicling the life and work of 90-year-old Simon Wiesenthal, the 
famed Nazi hunter who spent 53 years tracking nearly 1,100 German 
war criminals around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York memorial was dedicated to the SS St. Louis, a ship  
that set sail from Europe 60 years ago and was denied entry by both 
Cuba and the United States. Most of the 937 refugees on board were 
Jews; they were sent back to Europe and only 240 survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	One survivor, Judith Steel, was taken in by a French family that  
protected her for the rest of the war, but she never saw her 
parents again. 
</P>
<P>
	She said news accounts of Kosovar Albanian families being  
separated ``bring back a lot of bad stuff, a lot of sadness. It's 
unbelievable that something so atrocious could be happening almost 
at the turn of the century.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns; GOP Seeks Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just days before the income tax filing  
deadline, Republicans in Congress returned Monday from spring break 
trying to highlight their tax-cutting agenda with hearings on the 
IRS and symbolic debate on a constitutional amendment to limit tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet just as the Monica Lewinsky affair and President Clinton's  
impeachment trial dominated the winter news, the GOP must again 
fight for a share of public attention -- this time with the war in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``America also wants us to try and do the business of the  
country in a professional manner,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts of 
Oklahoma, the No. 4 House Republican leader. ``Part of that is 
doing what the American people want us to do, and part of that is 
cutting taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But numerous opinion polls indicate that the booming economy,  
coupled with several middle-class tax cuts that took effect in 
1998, has taken the steam out of public clamor for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is feeling pretty flush and successful,'' said  
Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at the Deloitte &AMP; Touche 
accounting firm. ``They don't identify tax cuts as a very high 
priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Republicans who control Congress believe this is  
the one week when most Americans are thinking about their taxes, 
and that deep down people want a big chunk of projected budget 
surpluses to go for tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has no chance of passing, the House is scheduled to  
vote Thursday -- midnight that night is the tax return filing 
deadline -- for the fifth year in a row on a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we do the vote on April 15th is that people's  
attention is focused on their taxes,'' said the main sponsor, Rep. 
Joe Barton, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also plan to iron out relatively minor differences  
between the House and Senate budget resolutions for fiscal 2000, 
which include $800 billion in unspecified tax cuts over the next 
decade. Votes on that resolution, which sets overall spending and 
tax targets that are filled in later, are expected as early as 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the tax talk this week will come from Internal Revenue  
Service Commissioner Charles Rossotti, who testified Monday before 
the Senate Small Business Committee in the first of his four 
congressional hearings -- many of them looking at how IRS is 
implementing sweeping agency reforms enacted last year and at the 
complexity of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti told the small business panel that the IRS is committed  
to becoming a less belligerent, more service-oriented agency, but 
that it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole objective is to make the whole thing work better for  
everybody,'' Rossotti said. ``We're making a lot of changes. We 
don't always get it right the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A parade of governors will appear before a House panel Wednesday  
and Thursday to describe how tax reform has worked in their states. 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-tax rallies and events are also scheduled,  
including one planned Tuesday by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, in which a mock time capsule from 1964 will be opened to 
dramatize the bigger bite now taken by income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In other congressional action planned this week:  
</P>
<P>
	--House Democrats plan to circulate a petition demanding a vote  
on legislation revamping campaign finance laws by limiting 
expenditures. It will take the signatures of 218 representatives -- 
a bare House majority -- to force the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	--Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, whose investigation of  
Clinton led to his impeachment, will testify Wednesday before the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on renewal of the independent 
counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House will debate a bill that would let local officials  
challenge census counts before they become final. Democrats say the 
measure could cause endless delays in the 2000 count.

</P>
<P>
	1998: Those orange helmets, dawg bones and brown jerseys were  
still packed away last April. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Just about everywhere. Browns have overall No. 1  
pick and 14 overall. WR a priority because they found little help 
there in expansion draft and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: OL With bookend Browns -- Lomas and Orlando -- at  
tackle, Jim Pyne at center, and Ben Cavil and Scott Rehberg at 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Blunder was Art Modell moving Browns in  
the first place. Brilliance was reestablishing the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Chris Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: Tim Couch, QB, Kentucky; Akili Smith, QB,  
Oregon; Ricky Williams, RB, Texas. Saints have offered all their 
picks for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Browns play NFL's softest schedule. Cleveland's new  
stadium and fans who've waited three years between home games will 
make it tough for visitors.

	1998: Finally got a solid offensive lineman in T Tra Thomas  
after years of failing. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Offense was by far the worst in the league last  
season. QB a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Secondary is team's one bright spot. DL OK  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Brilliance came in the '80s when Clyde  
Simmons and Seth Joyner were picked late. Lately blunder, 
particularly first-round OLs. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Personnel director Tom Modrak, who joined team day  
after draft last season. Coach Andy Reid and owner Jeff Lurie will 
have input. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: Couch, Williams, Smith, Donovan McNabb, QB,  
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: It's a long road back.  

</P>
<P>
                       	3, CINCINNATI (3-13)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: LB Takeo Spikes, top pick, had outstanding season. Rest of  
draft was so-so. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: General manager. Since Paul Brown died in 1991,  
team has gone 39-89 under his son, Mike. Mike Brown projected David 
Klingler as a great quarterback and Dave Shula as a great coach. 
After the team went 3-13 for the fourth time under Mike's 
direction, he said coaching was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	On field, need CBs, DLS, OLs and QB.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: LB (Spikes and Brian Simmons give them hope), RB  
(Corey Dillon). Stadium. New one under construction to open in 
2000, Brown's only accomplishment as GM). 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Only one player drafted since 1991 has  
made the Pro Bowl as a Bengal -- Carl Pickens, second-rounder in 
1992. Do well with second-round picks, getting Darnay Scott in 1994 
and Dillon in 1997. Four of last six top picks haven't paid off: 
Klingler, DT Dan Wilkinson, RB Ki-Jana Carter and DE-LB Reinard 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Smith or Couch if they're there. Donovan McNabb,  
QB, Syracuse; Champ Bailey, CB-WR, Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Should be better than 3-13 with easier schedule. But  
typically, they'll lose more than they gain through free agency and 
have a chance to clinch title of worst team of the '90s. 

</P>
<P>
                      	4, INDIANAPOLIS (3-13)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Peyton Manning, No. 1 overall pick, set NFL rookie records  
for attempts, completions, yards passing, TD passes and consecutive 
games with at least one TD pass. WR Jerome Pathon (2) and G Steve 
McKinney (4) started. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Overall defense. Colts have signed four free agents  
-- DEs Chad Bratzke and Shawn King, LB Cornelius Bennett, and S Chad 
Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB is set with Manning and Marshall Faulk had great  
year at RB. If Colts feel Ricky Williams is too good to pass up, 
Faulk could be traded. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Recent top picks solid, including  
Manning, WR Marvin Harrison (1996), DT Ellis Johnson (1995) and 
Faulk (1994). Before that, problems, (Jeff George, Quentin Coryatt, 
Sean Dawkins) or injuries(Steve Emtman, Trev Alberts). 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Bill Polian, who took over as president last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Williams, Bailey; Chris Claiborne, LB, Southern  
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Improving, but tough division.  

</P>
<P>
                       	5, WASHINGTON (6-10)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998-- No first, but got contributors at two and three in TE  
Stephen Alexander and RB Skip Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED -- CB, where Cris Dishman got old, even though he's  
six years younger than 39-year-old Darrell Green. OT, DE, owner 
(team remains in limbo until ownership situation is resolved). 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: DT,G.   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER -- With the exception of Kenard Lang in  
1997, every first-round pick this decade has been less than 
expected -- Bobby Wilson, Desmond Howard, Tom Carter, Heath Shuler, 
Michael Westbrook and Andre Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY -- GM Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS -- Bailey unless Williams is available. Trade down  
for CB Chris McAlister, CB. Edgerrin James, RB, Miami 
</P>
<P>
	1999-- Lost LB Marvcus Patton, WR Leslie Shepherd and QB Trent  
Green and gave up three draft picks, including No. 11 overall this 
year, to get Brad Johnson from Minnesota. Prospects for improvement 
not good. 

</P>
<P>
                        	6, ST. LOUIS (4-12)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: DE Grant Wistrom, undersized at 270 pounds, was good pass  
rusher. He'll start this year. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: RB, OL.   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Secondary. Trent Green, new QB, had first good year  
but remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: No winning seasons in the '90s. Traded  
up to No. 1 two years ago to take OT Orlando Pace. DE Kevin Carter 
(1995) is a talent but Lawrence Phillips (1996) a total bust. WR 
Eddie Kennison had a brilliant rookie year, faded, and was traded 
to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Dick Vermeil, 9-23 his first two seasons, is  
under the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: James unless Williams drops. Chris Claiborne,  
LB, Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: In four years, Rams have regressed from seven wins to six,  
five, four. May improve but a long way to go. 

</P>
<P>
                         	7, CHICAGO (4-12   	
</P>
<P>
	1999: Just as No. 1, RB Curtis Enis, was coming along, he tore  
up knee, typical misfortune for a team with no Pro Bowlers since 
1994. S Tony Parrish, No. 2, started and was productive. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Everything. Coach Dave Wannstedt was fired, then  
president Mike McCaskey was fired by his mother, George Halas' 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: DT, CB   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Under McCaskey, no one was clearly in  
charge and it showed. Ultimate goof was calling press conference to 
introduce Dave McGinnis as Wannstedt's successor, then have 
McGinnis pull out. Dick Jauron now the coach. WR Bobby Engram 
(second round, '96), DT Jim Flanigan (third round, '94) and Curtis 
Conway (first round, 1993) have all proven their worth. But for 
each one of them, there's a Rashaan Salaam, Rick Mirer or Alonzo 
Spellman. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Personnel director Mark Hatley, who may do better  
without six people whispering in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE FIRST PICK: McNabb, Claiborne; Jevon Kearse, DE-LB,  
Florida. QBs Cade McNown, UCLA; Daunte Culpepper, Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Not much better but changes may mean future improvement.  

</P>
<P>
	8, 21 ARIZONA (8th from San Diego in Ryan Leaf deal). DE Andre  
Wadsworth reported late but showed signs of greatness; DBs Corey 
Chavous (2) and Pat Tillman (7) also contributed to Cards' first 
playoff season since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: OL, weakened by defection of Lomas Brown to  
Cleveland. RB, FB. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB, with Jake Plummer; DL, which may be best in  
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Owner Bill Bidwill may finally have  
learned to stay away. Have done well recently with Bob Ferguson and 
Rod Graves in charge of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Ferguson with help from coach Vince Tobin.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE FIRST PICKS: John Tait, OT, BYU, Torry Holt, WR, NC  
State, then one of many OLS available at 21. 

</P>
<P>
	9, DETROIT (5-11)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Found quarterback in second round, Charlie Batch. No. 1  
Terry Fair returned two kickoffs for TDs and came on at corner and 
Germane Crowell, No. 3, provided size at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: OT, pass rusher.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB (Barry Sanders) WR )(Herman Moore, Johnnie  
Morton and Crowell. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: QB Andre Ware was bust in 1990. But  
every first-rounder since is starting other than 1996's Reggie 
Brown, whose career was ended by a neck injury. Batch, taken 60th 
overall, was far better than Ryan Leaf, No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Bobby Ross with input from personnel  
director Ron Hughes, who pushed strongly for Batch. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible picks: Tait; OTs L.J. Shelton, Eastern Michigan, Aaron  
Gibson, Wisconsin. Claiborne, Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Still fourth best team in division.  

</P>
<P>
	10, BALTIMORE (6-10)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: CB Duane Starks, No. 1, started. WR Pat Johnson, 2,  
unpolished but fast. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: DL, DB, RB and long-term QB.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: LB with Ray Lewis and Peter Boulware.  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Excellent lately -- OT Jonathan Ogden,  
Ray Lewis and WR Jermaine Lewis in 1996; Boulware, LB Jamie Sharper 
and S Kim Herring 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Newsome and new coach Brian Billick with owner Art  
Modell getting last word. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Holt, Culpepper, McAlister.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: If things go right, could contend for playoffs. But a lot  
rides with Scott Mitchell, the new QB. 

</P>
<P>
                          	11, Minnesota 	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Grabbed WR Randy Moss after Moss' off-field conduct caused  
him to slip to 21. Moss had 17 TD catches, was All-Pro and rookie 
of the year. LB Kailee Wong (2) and CB Ramos McDonald (3) could 
start this year. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: CB and DE. John Randle needs help and Vikings lost  
free agent CB Corey Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Offense. An NFL-record 541 points in '98 although  
offensive coordinator Brian Billick left to coach Ravens and 
successor Chip Myers died of heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE and BLUNDER: Moss and LB Dwayne Rudd in '97 were  
steals. But not pass rushers Derrick Alexander and Duane Clemons in 
previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Dennis Green.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: McAlister, Kearse. Later pick depends -- they  
like DEs Patrick Kerney, Virginia or Lamar King, Saginaw Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Despite shock in NFC title game, may be NFC favorite,  
although probably won't be 15-1 again. 

</P>
<P>
                       *12, NEW ORLEANS (6-10)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Kyle Turley, No. 1, started 15 game at four OL positions.  
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: RB, QB. Coach Mike Ditka has offered entire draft  
for Ricky Williams but also need a QB -- the incumbents are the 
Billy Joes, Hobert and Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Overall defense, although Saints need a safety to  
replace Chad Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER -- Uneven. Notables include William Roaf,  
Rickey Jackson, Wayne Martin and Pat Swilling. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Ditka.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Assuming no deal for Williams, look for Holt;  
Kearse; WR David Boston, Ohio State; DT Leon McFarland, LSU, or a 
trade down. Might take QB if there. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Ditka's intensity helps, but hard to win without top-notch  
QB and RB. 

</P>
<P>
                       	13, PITTSBURGH (7-9)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: G Alan Faneca, first rounder, started and did well. DE  
Jeremy Staat (2) was bust. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Coming off first losing record in Bill Cowher's  
seven seasons. Free agent losses are telling. Biggest are at WR, 
where they haven't replaced Charles Johnson, Yancey Thigpen, Ernie 
Mills and Andre Hastings. OT also is priority since RT Justin 
Strzelczyk may be out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	 *NONE NEEDED: RB, DL, LB   	
</P>
<P>
	 *BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Emphasize draft over free agency, but  
the last three have been as much bust (Staat, Paul Wiggins, Steve 
Conley, Mike Vrabel) as boom (fourth-round steal Earl Holmes, Chad 
Scott). 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Vice-president Tom Donahoe has the title, Cowher  
has the power with owner Dan Rooney as arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Tait, Shelton, Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: For first time under Cowher, there will be serious  
questions after losing last five and missing playoffs for first 
time. 

</P>
<P>
                       	14, KANSAS CITY (7-9)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: OT Victor Riley, No. 1, started. Wait and see on the rest,  
with CB Robert Williams (5th the most promising. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: CB, with defection of Dale Carter and aging of  
James Hasty; RB, OT. QB. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Overall defense other than CB.  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: In GM Carl Peterson's 11 years, Chiefs  
have yet to develop offensive skill player. But they've done well 
with OLs like Gs Will Shields and Dave Szott. The 1995 draft 
produced safeties Jerome Woods and Reggie Tongue with the first two 
picks and LB Donnie Edwards with the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Peterson.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Shelton; Gibson, Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	 *1999: Defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham replaces Marty  
Schottenheimer, who quit after first losing season in 15 years as a 
coach. Should be competitive, but a lot of ifs. 

</P>
<P>
                        	15, TAMPA BAY (8-8)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Traded out of first round and got WR Jacquez Green and DB  
Brian Kelly, both good. LB Jamie Duncan (3) was pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: QB, OL,   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB, where Bucs have enough trouble distributing  
carries between Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: After decade of awful picks that left  
them at bottom of standings every year, they've been good. Dunn, 
Alstott, Warren Sapp, Derrick Brooks and Donnie Abraham all 
excellent. Regan Upshaw and Marcus Jones are not. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: GM Rich McKay. Coach Tony Dungy has input.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS. One of the top five QBs if they slip. If not,  
Gibson, Tait, Shelton or Boston. 

</P>
<P>
                        	16, TENNESSEE (8-8)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: They could have had Randy Moss. But WR Kevin Dyson, No. 1,  
took a while but is good long-term prospect. S Perry Phenix, a free 
agent, was a find. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: Pass rusher; OL.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB, where Eddie George is one of league's best.  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Have been solid lately, with George and  
QB Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: GM Floyd Reese, coach Jeff Fisher with owner Bud  
Adams holding veto power (a mistake.) 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Kearse if they move up. DE Ebenezer Ekuban,  
North Carolina. McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Maybe changing name from Oilers to Titans and moving into  
new stadium will get team off 8-8 record it's had the last three 
years. 

</P>
<P>
                         	17, SEATTLE (8-8)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: The Seahawks like top four - LBs Anthony Simmons and  
DeShone Myles, RB Ahman Green and OT Todd Weiner. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: WR to complement Joey Galloway, CB, QB, DE, OT  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB, with Ricky Watters; DT, LB, S.  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Drafted QB Rick Mirer with second pick  
in 1993. DT Cortez Kennedy, Galloway and CB Shawn Springs were 
great No. 1s. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Mike Holmgren, who left Green Bay at the end of  
the season to become coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Boston; Troy Edwards, WR, Louisiana Tech.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: Holmgren liked talent he inherited and did little to  
enhance it during the offseason. If QB Jon Kitna comes through, 
have a good shot at playoffs. 

</P>
<P>
                         	18, OAKLAND(8-8)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: CB Charles Woodson, fourth overall, was defensive rookie  
of the year. Traded up to choose OT Mo Collins late in the first 
round and he was instant starter. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: LB, WR, Big RB, perhaps QB.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: DL is solid with Darrell Russell developing into  
dominant inside player. Secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Traded up to take TE Rickey Dudley in  
the first round two years ago, but he drops too many passes. Got 
three starters out of top three picks last season. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Al Davis' team, and he doesn't let anyone forget  
it. Coach Jon Gruden has input. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Andy Katzenmoyer, LB, Ohio State; Edwards; Kevin  
Johnson, WR Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Raiders improved by four games last season and Gruden  
hopes Rich Gannon is better fit than Jeff George at QB. Still 
improving. 

</P>
<P>
                      	19, NEW YORK GIANTS (8-8)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998 -- S Shaun Williams should start this year. Giants think WRs  
Joe Jurevicius and Brian Alford have great upside. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: OL; RB, LB, DE depth.  
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Secondary, loaded at CBs with Jason Sehorn, Conrad  
Hamilton and Phillippi Sparks and S with Sam Garnes, Percy 
Ellsworth and Williams) 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Take away first round and the Giants are  
brilliant -- DE Mike Strahan (2-'93), Sehorn (2-'94), FB Charles Way 
(6-'95), LB Jessie Armstead (8-'93), Garnes (D5-'97). RB Rodney 
Hampton in 1990 was last great No. 1. The last two are OK -- WR Ike 
Hilliard and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: The system. Giants rank, test and grade and go s  
by the numbers. Coach Jim Fassel and personnel director Marv 
Sunderland seek consensus. GM Ernie Accorsi breaks ties. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Gibson, Damien Woody, OL, Boston College; RB Rob  
Konrad, Syracuse; Jon Jansen OT Michigan (trade down). Longshot: 
Jimmy Kleinsasser, TE, North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	1999-- Defense is talented enough to get Giants to playoffs, but  
QBs Kent Graham and Kerry Collins not good enough to get them deep. 

</P>
<P>
             	20, 29 NEW ENGLAND (second for Bill Parcells) 	
</P>
<P>
	1998: RB Robert Edwards had productive season, but devastating  
knee injury in post-season beach flag game may have ended his 
career. Second No. 1, Tebucky Jones, still learning to play CB. WR 
Tony Simmons, a second-rounder,showed deep-threat ability. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: RB, OL, LB, TE   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB, DB, WR. Drew Bledsoe remains one of the  
league's leading quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER -- First draft under coach Pete Carroll in  
1997 was a bust -- first-round CB Chris Canty and third-round RB 
back Sedrick Shaw have struggled. DE Greg Spires, third rounder 
last season, looks like pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Player personnel chief Bobby Grier and Carroll  
share in the decision-making, but owner Bob Kraft's right there. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Woody. Might try move up for James. Konrad. Use  
second on Kevin Faulk, RB, LSU or James Johnson, RB, Mississippi 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: The loss of Edwards and C Dave Wohlabaugh hurt. Playoff  
team if they avoid injuries of last year, but not much more. 

</P>
<P>
                         	22, DALLAS (10-6)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: DE Greg Ellis, No. 1 pick started every game. OL Flozell  
Adams, No. 2, looks like a long-term starter. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: DB, LB, WR   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB, where Troy Aikman still going strong. Might  
look lower for future QB. OL, pretty much set for future. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDERS: Taking All-Pro offensive lineman Larry  
Allen in the first round. Making a first round pick out of 
defensive lineman Shante Carver who is no longer playing football. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: No question: owner Jerry Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICK: Antoine Winfield, CB, Ohio State; Fernando Bryan,  
CB, Alabama; Katzenmoyer, Johnson or Edwards if there. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: After bouncing back from 6-10 to 10-6 to win NFC East,  
aging team remains playoff contender. Will battle Cards and Giants 
in NFC East. 

</P>
<P>
                         *23,BUFFALO (10-6)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Gave up first pick for QB Rob Johnson. He got hurt, and  
never got job back from Doug Flutie. LB Sam Cowart, second-rounder, 
played like a No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: TE, WR, DL   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB, LB, OL.   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Bills drafted as well as any team in the  
NFL over the last decade despite picking low. RB Antowain Smith 
still looks like Thurman Thomas' successor. Eric Moulds, No. 1 in 
1996, emerged as one of NFL's best last year. All-timers include QB 
Jim Kelly in 1983, Bruce Smith and Andre Reed in '85, Thomas 
(second round) in '88; DE Phil Hansen (No. 2 in '91); G Ruben Brown 
in '95. LB John Holocek, fifth-rounder in '95. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: GM John Butler, who gets credit for most of good  
picks, and coach Wade Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Winfield, Johnson, Edwards, Bryant, Kleinsasser;  
Patrick Kerney, DE, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Will contend in tough AFC East.  

</P>
<P>
                         	24, MIAMI (10-6)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: RB John Avery, No. 1, failed to make impact coach Jimmy  
Johnson expected. CB Patrick Surtain, DE Kenny Mixon and DE Lorenzo 
Bromell provided depth. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: RB. Karim Abdul-Jabbar was only 8-for-15 on third  
and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: Defense. Dolphins allowed fewest points in the NFL  
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Nine of Miami's 22 starters were drafted  
by Johnson since arrival in 1996. But only two are on offense -- 
Abdul-Jabbar and FB Stanley Pritchett. Avery and injury-plagued WR 
Yatil Green, top picks the past two years, have been 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: JJ.   	
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Cecil Collins was kicked off team at LSU and  
McNeese State after being arrested on battery charges, but may be 
best RB available. Peerless Price, WR, Tennessee. QB is 
possibility. Best here will be Joe Germaine, Ohio State, and Shaun 
King, Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Dolphins need major upgrade to join NFL's elite. But  
Johnson failed to make big splash in free agency, and most 
significant acquisition, WR Tony Martin, may be unavailable because 
of a pending trial on charges of laundering drug money. 

</P>
<P>
                        	25, GREEN BAY (11-5)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Packers moved up to No. 19 and got DE Vonnie Holliday, who  
was on way to rookie sack record before injury. Third-round DE 
Jonathan Brown will get shot and so will WR Corey Bradford and S 
Scott McGarrahan. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: CB, WR, with Robert Brooks' bad back threatening  
his career and Antonio Freeman a possible holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: QB, where Brett Favre is one of few top QBs under  
30. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDERS: Few mistakes since Ron Wolf took over  
as GM in 1991, the worst perhaps OT John Michels in 1996. Best was 
first move -- trading a No. 1 for Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Wolf.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Winfield, Bryant; Price, Woody. Packers own 12  
picks, so Wolf could go for quality and move up or quantity with 
new coach Ray Rhodes' willingness to play rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: The Packers are now the chaser rather than the chasee in  
the NFC Central. With Favre, they remain a playoff team and with 
luck a Super Bowl contender. 

</P>
<P>
                      	26, JACKSONVILLE (11-5)   	
</P>
<P>
	LAST SEASON: Traded up to No. 9 and selected RB Fred Taylor, who  
would have been offensive rookie of the year if not for Randy Moss. 
Other first-rounder was solid S Donovin Darius. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: CB, DL. Even if Tony Brackens gets healthy, Jaguars  
need help and free agent Gary Walker isn't enough.. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB with Taylor and James Stewart. WRs Keenan  
McCardell and Jimmy Smith. QB Mark Brunell, but keep the trainer 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Making OT Tony Boselli first pick in  
team history looks better every day. Others from inaugural season 
were so-so: Stewart (plagued by injuries); OL Brian DeMarco (exiled 
to Cincinnati and LB Bryan Schwartz (knee injury). 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Tom Coughlin. And don't you forget it. Not  
that he'll let you. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Kerney, Bryant, King, McFarland. Reggie McGrew,  
DT, Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	1999 OUTLOOK: Entire offense is in prime or getting there soon.  
Should be Super Bowl contender if defense, under new coordinator 
Dom Capers, improves. 

</P>
<P>
                      	27, SAN FRANCISCO (12-4)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Took CB R.W. McQuarters, who struggled and finished as a  
reserve. OL Jeremy Newberry, second-rounder, was lost for most of 
the season because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Help Wanted: QB. Steve Young will be 38, backup Ty Detmer was  
traded and Jim Druckenmiller, No. 1 two years ago, isn't the 
answer. CB, DL, OT. 
</P>
<P>
	None needed: WR, with Jerry Rice, J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens.  
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: None of top picks in past three drafts  
is starter. Passed on Jake Plummer for Druckenmiller, whose style 
appear ill-suited for the 49ers' scheme, which stresses mobility. 
DE Israel Ifeanyi, top pick in 1996, was released in 1997 but 
Owens, third-rounder that year, has supplanted Rice as the team's 
go-to receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Bill Walsh, whose 1986 draft is one of best ever.  
He was brought back as GM while suspended co-owner Eddie DeBartolo 
and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, battle over business empire. 
Input from coach Steve Mariucci and player personnel director Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Joe Germaine, QB, Ohio State. Jansen; Fred  
Vinson, CB, Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: As long as Young plays, the dynasty continues, at least as  
a contender. But they need to groom a replacement now. 
</P>
<P>
                        	 30, ATLANTA(14-2)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: LB Keith Brooking, No. 1, will start this year. WR-KR Tim  
Dwight, No. 4, was pleasant surprise and No. 7, OT Ephraim Salaam 
was starter on Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: WR, DE. WR Chris Calloway, who replaces Tony  
Martin, isn't deep threat. DL depth is negligible. 
</P>
<P>
	 *NONE NEEDED: QB Chris Chandler is brittle, but Danny Kanell is  
an improvement over Steve DeBerg as backup. RB, as long as Jamal 
Anderson is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	 *BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Brilliant picks rare for Falcons, who  
got majority of their NFC title team through trade or free agency. 
Anderson a seventh-rounder in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY:@ Dan Reeves, who does everything except cut the  
grass. 
</P>
<P>
	 *POSSIBLE PICKS:* Price, Kerney if he lasts; McGrew, Jansen.  
</P>
<P>
	 *1999:* Another 14-2 record unlikely, as does a return to the  
Super Bowl. Schedule is tougher and a lot of things went right for 
the Falcons in '98. But Reeves has solid foundation. If Chandler 
and Anderson remain healthy, anything less than the playoffs would 
be disappointment. 

</P>
<P>
                         	31, DENVER (14-2)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: No. 1, WR Marcus Nash, played little. But Eric Brown, No.  
2, was starter at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: DE, S, LB, WR   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB, QB (if John Elway comes back). CB with addition  
of free agent Dale Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Terrell Davis, NFL's best running back,  
was a sixth-round draft choice in 1995; Pro Bowl C Tom Nalen was a 
seventh-rounder in 1994; TE Shannon Sharpe was a seventh-rounder in 
1990. That makes up for previous first-round disasters like Ted 
Gregory in 1988 and Tommy Maddox in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Coach Mike Shanahan is the final authority,  
although some insist Elway has input. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Kerney, King, move up.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: Elway's decision whether or not to retire makes huge  
difference, although Shanahan has expressed confidence in going 
with Bubby Brister. Even without Elway, the Broncos should be Super 
Bowl contender. 

</P>
<P>
           	38, CAROLINA 4-12) (traded first for Sean Gilbert 	
</P>
<P>
	1998: DT Jason Peter, No. 1, was a holdout and will start over  
under George Seifert. No other picks contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: OL, DL. Many of Carolina's defensive linemen are  
approaching the end of their career. 
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: RB, WR, TE.   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Ten of 11 players the Panthers took in  
their first draft in 1995 are no longer with the team. Tshimanga 
Biakabutuka, Carolina's No. 1 pick in 1996, has 955 yards rushing 
in three seasons. S Mike Minter, second-round pick in 1997, and 
Peter both look like keepers. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Owner Jerry Richardson, with plenty of input from  
Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Too late to say.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: Rebuilding season. Enough talent for some improvement.  

</P>
<P>
                      	59, NEW YORK JETS (12-4)   	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Fourth-rounder Jason Fabini, started from beginning of  
training camp at ORT and was solid. Had no No. 1 and took DE Dorian 
Boose in second round. He barely played. Third-rounder Kevin 
Williams started for a month at safety, then was benched. They like 
LB Casey Dailey (fifth round), who spent season on IR. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: OL, DL.   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: WR, RB, LB.   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: Not trading up to get Brett Favre in  
1991 and settling for Browning Nagle; Blair Thomas; Roger Vick, 
Dave Cadigan. Nice moves in getting Mo Lewis (third round 1991); 
Aaron Glenn and Keyshawn Johnson as first-rounders, and WR Wayne 
Chrebet as free agent, all before Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: Tuna, Tuna, Tuna.  
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: With no first-rounder, will seek behemoths in  
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	1999: Super Bowl contender if Vinny Testaverde can reprise last  
season. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                           first round. 	
</P>
<P>
	1998: Chargers paid ransom to Arizona to move up and make QB  
Ryan Leaf second overall pick, then watched embarrassing 
performances on and off field that sent him to bench after nine 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	HELP WANTED: DE, CB, TE, FB.   	
</P>
<P>
	NONE NEEDED: LB, S   	
</P>
<P>
	BRILLIANCE AND BLUNDER: GM Bobby Beathard made his Chargers  
debut by taking Junior Seau in 1990. Since, he's dealt away six 
future No. 1's on draft day. Scored big with RB Natrone Means in 
the second round in 1993, but WR Bryan Still, taken with a 
second-rounder in 1996 at the expense of 1997's first-rounder, has 
been a bust. Held onto 1998 first-rounder, which he used in huge 
trade with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	ULTIMATE SAY: In Bobby We Trust still applies with the Spanos  
family, which gave 62-year-old surfer a two-year contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	POSSIBLE PICKS: Too late to tell.  
</P>
<P>
	1999: Interim coach June Jones went to Hawaii rather than stay  
on. New coach Mike Riley's sunny disposition has cleared tension of 
Kevin Gilbride's 6-16 reign. Chargers hope QB Jim Harbaugh, 
one-time ``Captain Comeback,'' can lead them and mentor Leaf.

<HEADLINE> Pettite Ready To Rejoin Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Andy Pettitte appears ready to rejoin the  
New York Yankees, and hopes to pitch Saturday at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander, on the disabled list because of a strained  
muscle in his elbow, struck out eight in five shutout innings in a 
Class A game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recommendation would be he is ready,'' Yankees director of  
player personnel Billy Connors said. ``He hit 89 (miles an hour) 
tonight and his pitches were real crisp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for the Tampa Yankees against the Sarasota Red Sox in  
the Florida State League, Pettitte gave up four hits and walked 
two. He threw 81 pitches, 53 for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel like I'm ready,'' Pettitte said. ``I felt good with  
everything tonight and that was really want I was looking for. 
Everything was real sharp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston first baseman Reggie Jefferson, on a minor league rehab  
stint, went 1-for-2 against Pettitte. Jefferson struck out in the 
first inning and hit an opposite-field double in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte reported no problems with his elbow or right ankle,  
which he slightly sprained on April 6 during an agility drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte worked just one inning against major leaguers during  
spring training, departing his debut on March 7 after seven 
pitches. In his last three starts in spring training minor league 
or simulated games, Pettitte threw 8 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three seasons, Pettitte has an American League-best  
55 wins, one behind Atlanta's John Smoltz for most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Darryl Strawberry returned to the Yankees' minor league  
facility in Tampa on Monday to continue his comeback from colon 
cancer surgery and lingering knee problems. Both Strawberry and 
Pettitte were at Yankee Stadium on Sunday to receive their World 
Series rings. Strawberry, who took batting practice and went 
through agility drills, will start taking fly balls later this 
week. ``In a couple weeks I should be ready to go,'' Strawberry 
said. He is scheduled to join Triple-A Columbus after completing 
his Florida workouts. ... Jefferson is scheduled to join Triple-A 
Pawtucket on Tuesday after playing three games with Sarasota. A 
back injury limited Jefferson to just 62 games last season ... 
Yankees minor league catcher Jaime Torres, who underwent thyroid 
cancer surgery last month, has resumed full on-the-field workouts.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed for 1981 Ark. Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A man who murdered five people after  
entering the federal witness-protection program was executed Monday 
night for the 1981 slaying of a convenience store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion Albert Pruett, 49, asked God and his victims for  
forgiveness, then closed his eyes as he was injected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would also like to ask all the people that I ever hurt, and  
their family members, to forgive me for all the pain,'' he said. 
``And I forgive everybody for what's about to happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett was sent to death row for the October 1981 killing of an  
Arkansas convenience store clerk -- one of three people he killed 
that week. 
</P>
<P>
	While serving time in Georgia for bank robbery, he testified  
against another inmate in the slaying of his cellmate and was 
released in 1979 and placed in the protection program. He later 
said he committed the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett killed three people in a weeklong streak of terror that  
led him to dub himself a ``mad-dog killer.'' Earlier in 1981, 
Pruett had killed his wife in New Mexico, and a Mississippi bank 
loan officer. Four days after killing the first convenience store 
clerk, Pruett killed two other store workers in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	He received life sentences in the four killings outside  
Arkansas. At his New Mexico trial, he said he was driven by a 
cocaine habit that reached $4,000 a week. Pruett killed his wife 
with a ball peen hammer. The others were shot.

	Key events in Paula Jones' sexual harassment case against  
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	1994:   	
</P>
<P>
	May 6: Mrs. Jones files a civil lawsuit against Clinton in U.S.  
District Court in Little Rock, Ark. She seeks $700,000 in damages 
for ``willful, outrageous and malicious conduct'' at the Excelsior 
Hotel in Little Rock on May 8, 1991. Her court papers accuse 
Clinton of ``sexually harassing and assaulting'' her, then defaming 
her with denials. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 10: Clinton files a motion to dismiss Mrs. Jones' lawsuit  
on grounds of presidential immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 28: U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright rules that a  
trial cannot take place until Clinton leaves office. But she also

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17: Mrs. Jones asks the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
in St. Louis to reverse the decision postponing a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sept. 14: A three-judge appeals court panel hears Clinton's  
lawyers argue that allowing Mrs. Jones' case to proceed while the 
president is in office would distract him from more important 
matters. Mrs. Jones' lawyers argue she should have the same rights 
as anyone else bringing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	1996:   	
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 9: The appeals panel rules 2-1 that Mrs. Jones' lawsuit can  
go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	May 15: Clinton asks the Supreme Court to delay Mrs. Jones' case  
until he leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	June 24: The Supreme Court agrees to consider whether Mrs.  
Jones' lawsuit should be delayed until Clinton leaves office. The

</P>
<P>
	May 27: The Supreme Court rules the lawsuit can move ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 22: Judge Wright sets a May 27, 1998, trial date but  
dismisses the claim that Clinton defamed Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 8: Mrs. Jones reduces the damages sought to $525,000 and  
drops defamation claims against Clinton's codefendant, former 
bodyguard Danny Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
	1998:   	
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 7: Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky signs an  
affidavit for Mrs. Jones' attorneys in which she says she never had 
a sexual relationship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 16: Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr gets  
permission from a three-judge federal panel to expand his 
investigation of Clinton to include whether he tried to suborn a 
false statement from Ms. Lewinsky. His investigation eventually 
results in a referral to the House of possibly impeachable 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 17: Clinton is questioned by Mrs. Jones' attorneys for six  
hours and denies having ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	April 1: In Little Rock, Judge Wright throws out Mrs. Jones'  
lawsuit. 
</P>

lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Oct. 31: Mrs. Jones accepts a conditional $1 million offer from

with no apology or admission. 
</P>
<P>
	1999:   	
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 12: Clinton sends $850,000 settlement check, including  
$375,000 from his family funds and the remainder from an insurance 
policy.

his testimony in the Jones' lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Dragging Death Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- A judge Monday rejected John William King's  
appeal of his murder conviction in the dragging death of a black 
man last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	King's lawyers had asked for a new trial, claiming that a  
witness was threatened, a law enforcement official had improper 
contact with the jury and King's mail was illegally diverted. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Joe Bob Golden, who presided over King's  
trial earlier this year, overruled the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, was sentenced to death for the slaying of James Byrd  
Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was beaten, tied with a chain to 
the rear of a pickup truck and dragged to his death. Two other 
defendants have yet to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	King's lawyers have said that even if their appeal for a new  
trial was rejected, it would still serve the purpose of making 
King's allegations part of the court record for later appeals.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Work Out Budget Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate and House Republican congressional  
leaders worked out a compromise Monday on a $1.7 trillion federal 
budget for fiscal 2000, and plan to push the measure through 
Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We resolved everything,'' said Senate Budget Committee  
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending plan, designed to highlight the GOP's political  
message, would pave the way for about $800 billion in tax cuts over 
the next decade while setting aside Social Security surpluses and 
heeding spending limits enacted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed far smaller tax reductions and  
has said the Republican plan does not set aside enough money to 
buttress Medicare for the looming retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	The blueprint sets overall limits for spending and taxes for the  
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and does not require Clinton's 
signature. It leaves details about which taxes to cut and how to 
trim spending to obey budget limits for later legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two GOP-written budgets the House and Senate approved last  
month were very similar. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the bigger questions, the two chambers agreed to not  
decide until later this year what to do with any additional federal 
surpluses that are estimated this summer. Many conservatives wanted 
the extra money set aside for a bigger tax cut, but others 
preferred that the money be used to further reduce the national 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici and others say they now expect this summer's updated

<HEADLINE> Cotton Farmers Seek Rain / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- During the darkest moments of last year's  
devastating drought, many cotton farmers said if the spring brought 
no relief from the skies they would cut their losses and not even 
plant a crop in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone-dry winter gave little reason to be optimistic, but  
several thunderstorms last week and predictions of more storm 
systems headed to the area have given farmers in the heart of 
cotton country the faith they need to plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Planting season begins next week for most farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to get enough rain to stick this one  
out,'' said Philip Thomas, a cotton farmer near Lubbock. ``We've 
had some good rain and if we can just keep it going for a few more 
days that will set the stage for a wet ground, ripe for planting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers count on spring rains to soften the ground so they can  
plant cotton seeds. Without rain, planting is difficult and in some 
cases, impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Lubbock, some areas have received almost two inches of rain  
over the last three weeks -- more than the entire region received 
through the winter. A new storm system is expected to douse the 
area later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south, areas near San Angelo and Big Spring received  
nearly two inches in March and are also expected to receive rain 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see scattered showers that could bring nearly two  
inches to some areas,'' said Matt Groh, a National Weather Service 
meteorologist in San Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the showers will be scattered and spotty, some areas may  
not receive any rain, it will really be luck of the draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the rains, heading back out into the field after  
last year's agriculture losses -- which totaled $2.4 billion for the 
state -- is a tremendous act of courage on the part of some farmers, 
said Joe Rankin, former president of the Texas Farmer's Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people that are still trying to figure out  
whether they have the ability to go back out and try again,'' 
Rankin said. ``We depend upon hope and farmers have to have a lot 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas A&AMP;M agricultural researcher Carl Anderson said the rains  
keep alive the possibility that this year's cotton crop could be 
successful, but he was quick to note that if the rain doesn't 
continue to fall throughout the early summer months the season 
could still be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking at is a situation that could be something  
similar to the depression era, where we had widespread 
foreclosures,'' Anderson said. ``We will have to see a major 
restructuring of agriculture if we don't have a good season.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Piazza, Reed on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Rick Reed didn't injure his Achilles'  
tendon, the New York Mets pitcher did tear a muscle in his left 
calf and will spend the next two weeks on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess you could say it's good news,'' Reed said after an MRI  
diagnosed the injury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 16-11 with a 3.48 ERA last season, hurt his left leg  
trying to stretch his game-tying RBI single into a double during 
Sunday's 6-3 win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets placed Reed and catcher Mike Piazza on the 15-day  
disabled list before beating Florida 8-1 Monday in their home 
opener. New York filled the roster spots by recalling left-hander 
Rigo Beltran and outfielder Terrence Long from Norfolk of the 
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza sprained his knee during a rundown Friday at Montreal.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Mike got hurt, there was a lot of talk in the  
clubhouse,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ``A lot of it started 
with Bobby Bonilla. He said, `This isn't a one-man show. We've got 
a lot of good players.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said Allen Watson would take Reed's turn in the  
rotation against Philadelphia this weekend and that Todd Pratt 
would be the everyday catcher until Piazza returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt was 1-for-4 with an RBI Monday and has two RBIs in 16  
at-bats this season. Piazza has eight RBIs, one behind team-leader 
Robin Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss a big cog, but we're going to be able to  
play,'' Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Gives Awards to Mir Crews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin presented state medals  
Monday to Russian cosmonauts -- but the nation's space chief warned 
that no money had yet been found to keep the Mir space station 
aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin hailed the Mir's achievements in a brief speech during a  
Kremlin ceremony on Monday, Cosmonauts' Day, then pinned medals for 
service to the motherland on the chests of several dozen cosmonauts 
and space officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The holiday is set to mark the flight of Yuri Gagarin, who  
became the first man in space on April 12, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian space program has seen a steady decay after the 1991  
Soviet collapse, when generous state funding abruptly came to a 
near-halt. The government now can't afford $250 million in annual 
fees to maintain the Mir -- the last symbol of Russia's fading space 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Space officials have said Mir could stay in orbit for three more  
years, but may be discarded as early as August if no private funds 
are raised. 
</P>
<P>
	The station, which was originally intended to run for only five  
years, has been running relatively trouble-free since a series of 
breakdowns and accidents in 1997, including a fire and a near-fatal 
collision with a cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. space agency NASA has long urged the Russian government  
to abandon the Mir and concentrate its meager resources on the 
International Space Station, a 16-nation project that is more than 
a year behind schedule because of Russia's failure to build a key 
segment on time. 
</P>
<P>
	On an ironic note, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev  
presented a model of the new space station to Yeltsin during the 
award-giving ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``But shall we keep the Mir aloft?'' the somewhat-stunned  
Yeltsin asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we shall,'' Koptev answered with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
	But he sounded far less certain when speaking to reporters after  
the award ceremony, saying that private investors have yet to come 
up with funds to pay for the Mir's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitaly Sevastyanov, a former Soviet cosmonaut-turned-Communist  
lawmaker, called Monday on all Russians to contribute to a charity 
aimed at keeping the Mir in orbit.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Refuses Move to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Wohlers' career with the Atlanta Braves  
appeared to end Monday after the former relief ace, unable to solve 
his control trouble, refused to accept assignment to Triple-A 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't pitch any more for the Braves,'' manager Bobby Cox  
said after Atlanta beat Philadelphia 8-6 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will sign with someone else, which should be good for him.  
He might go to the American League,'' he said. ``I really hope 
things work out for him. I wish him the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, saved 97 games for the Braves from 1995-97,  
including the final game of the 1995 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers could have accepted the assignment, refused it or  
declared for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he refused, the Braves are still responsible for his $6  
million salary unless they trade him by April 22. They will release 
him if a deal can't be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been enough interest shown that I think a trade is  
possible,'' general manager John Schuerholz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were struggling in the bullpen even before Wohlers'  
problems. Kerry Ligtenberg, who had 30 saves last year as a rookie, 
will miss the season because of an injured right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers looked like he might make a comeback in spring training  
but flopped in two relief appearances in Atlanta's first four 
games. The Braves decided Friday -- after a Thursday outing against 
the Phillies in which Wohlers threw only one strike in 10 pitches -- 
to send him to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In spring training, he threw the ball like he did when he was  
at the top of his game. It was just vintage Wohlers,'' Schuerholz 
said. ``We were hopeful of seeing that happen up here, but it 
didn't and we just couldn't wait any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers could not be reached for comment Monday. His agent, Seth  
Levinson of New York, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was just as befuddled as anyone with Wohlers precipitous  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know what happened,'' Cox said. ``I have no idea  
what went wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz said Wohlers had seemed eager to accept the  
assignment when informed of it Friday by Cox and Schuerholz. 
</P>
<P>
	But the general manager said he wasn't completely surprised when  
Wohlers changed his mind Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he first indicated he was very optimistic and interested  
in accepting the assignment, he obviously decided, either on his 
own or after talking to someone, that he was not going to accept 
the assignment,'' Schuerholz said. ``That's his right under the 
Basic Agreement. I'm disappointed that the whole process didn't 
work, for Mark's sake and the team's sake. It would have been the 
perfect ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say which teams had shown interest.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Pittsburgh  
Pirates and the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of whom would pay a 
portion of Wohlers' salary, were among those looking at the 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz said Wohlers believes he can perform better for  
another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching here it Atlanta in front of these fans at the major  
league level was the most challenging of all tests,'' he said. ``I 
still think he can do it. Mark's feeling is he thinks he could more 
easily do it elsewhere with a clean, fresh start.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Would KO Felons as Promoters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawmaker wants to stop anyone with a  
felony conviction -- and that includes Don King -- from promoting 
boxing matches in New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Dean Skelos of Long Island filed the bill in response  
to the disputed heavyweight title fight between Evander Holyfield 
and Lennox Lewis on March 13 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not aimed primarily at (King),'' he said. ``It is aimed  
at cleaning up fighting, period. ... We are trying, whether you 
like fighting or don't like fighting, to restore it to where it was 
respected a number of years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Skelos' director of legislation, Tracy Lloyd: ``If it  
involves Don King, fine. If it involves others, fine, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's felony provision would not apply to boxers  
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	King spokesman Greg Fritz said fight fans would suffer if King  
cannot promote bouts in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they did that, all they would be doing is denying boxing  
fans and sports fans the chance to watch great fights,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the measure passes, Fritz said, ``there are other places that  
would be happy to have Don King-promoted fights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King was convicted of second-degree murder Feb. 23, 1967. The  
charge was reduced to manslaughter and he served nearly four years 
in an Ohio prison. King had shot and killed a man in 1954 and the 
crime was later ruled justifiable homicide after King had served 
the prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would prohibit anyone convicted of a felony in New  
York, or the equivalent of a felony under state law in other 
jurisdictions, from promoting, judging or holding any other 
``supervisory or controlling position'' at a boxing match in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it would bar anyone from judging or refereeing a  
match if he is affiliated with promoters or boxing's sanctioning 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Skelos is the deputy majority leader in the  
Republican-controlled Senate. His bill has yet to find a Democratic 
sponsor in the Democrat-controlled state Assembly, a usual 
prerequisite to passage in that chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations by state or local authorities are being  
conducted into the judging of the Holyfield-Lewis fight.

<HEADLINE> No Complaint Vs. Skating Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For weeks, there were whispers and rumors swirling in the  
skating community that Richard Callaghan was about to be accused of 
sexual misconduct by a former skater and colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ominous stuff. This, after all, was Callaghan, the  
premier American coach who took Tara Lipinski from 15th in the 
world to the Olympic gold medal in two years. And the allegations 
were tawdry, the kind that can destroy a career. 
</P>
<P>
	When the story finally broke over the weekend, Craig Maurizi  
alleged in several interviews that he and Callaghan had an 
inappropriate relationship -- including sexual activity -- beginning 
when he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
	So now what? Callaghan emphatically denies the accusations.  
Maurizi said he planned to file complaints with the U.S. Figure 
Skating Association and the Professional Skaters Association, but 
neither had received one as of late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi did not return several phone calls to his home by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be no reaction until there's a formal  
document or accusation that's acceptable,'' said Jim Disbrow, 
president of the USFSA. ``As the U.S. Figure Skating Association, 
we are very, very, very steadfast to the fact we're not going to 
react to every rumor. There's a lot of gab and a lot of talking, 
but there's nothing formal with definite accusations, timely 
accusations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If a complaint was filed with either organization, it would  
first go to the chair of the grievance committee, who would decide 
if it had enough merit to be considered by a grievance panel. If it 
does, the panel would hear evidence from both sides before issuing 
a ruling and, if warranted, a punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no knee-jerk reaction,'' Disbrow said. ``That's  
in fairness to everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Groulx, Callaghan's attorney, would not comment on the  
possibility of grievances. He also refused to say whether Callaghan 
is considering any legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to discuss anything along those lines at this  
time,'' Groulx said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi's allegations were first published Sunday in the New  
York Times. The 36-year-old alleged the inappropriate sexual 
contact with Callaghan began when he was 15 and Callaghan his 
coach. It progressed into a full sexual relationship after Maurizi 
turned 18, and continued until he was 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story also contained allegations from two other former  
students, who say Callaghan made inappropriate remarks or gestures 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to pray that ultimately people in the skating community  
are going to believe me because this rumor was prevalent for years 
and years,'' Maurizi, who until last year was Callaghan's assistant 
at the Detroit Skating Club, told the Detroit Free Press. ``Why the 
heck would I want to lie about something like this? I'm dragging 
myself through the mud as much as him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that by doing this I can help the sport, believe it  
or not. This is my profession, and it's an honorable profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there may have been rumors about Callaghan, there are  
rumors about just about everyone, said Claire Ferguson, former 
USFSA president. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are rumors in this sport, like rumors everywhere,'' she  
said. ``I have heard all kinds of rumors about everyone -- including 
myself. Of course, I'm not deaf to conversations, but I'm also used 
to people passing on bad information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no one, including Maurizi, has ever filed a complaint  
against Callaghan, legal or otherwise. The USFSA has never had a 
complaint against Callaghan, Disbrow said. A routine background 
check was done on Callaghan when he joined the Detroit Skating 
Club, and that didn't turn up anything, either, said Jo Anne Berry, 
a board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan resigned as the club's director of skating last month,  
but Groulx said it had nothing to do with Maurizi's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had anything filed against Richard in any way,  
shape nor form,'' Berry said. ``Both Richard and Craig are highly 
respected here at the skating club. Richard has brought great 
success to the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi got his start in coaching with Callaghan, working as his  
assistant in San Diego and then in Detroit. He was Callaghan's 
assistant when he coached Lipinski to gold at Nagano, but the two 
split last year when Lipinski decided after the Olympics she wanted 
to work with Maurizi. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan also coached Todd Eldredge to five national titles and  
a world championship. When Nicole Bobek and Eldredge won national 
titles in 1995, he became the first coach in 45 years to train the 
men's and ladies' champions in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his strict discipline, colleagues describe Callaghan  
as a complete professional. Jerry Lane, president of the PSA, said 
he never saw any evidence of impropriety when he and his wife 
coached with Callaghan on weekends in Buffalo, N.Y., in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking sides on the issue,'' Lane said. ``We taught  
with Richard and we never witnessed this kind of behavior. The 
drinking and the stuff with skaters that Craig is alluding to. Not 
to say it didn't happen, but we never witnessed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this stuff isn't true,'' he said, ``but I'm certain it  
will be investigated.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition to Circumcision Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tim Shane has grown used to parents at baby fairs making snide  
comments as they pass his booth, or recoiling from his pamphlets as 
though they might be subversive. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, his is no ordinary crusade. For years Shane has been  
fighting something American society takes for granted: 
circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents have routinely circumcised their sons in the United  
States since the 1940s, motivated by deeply rooted medical, 
religious and social beliefs. By 1970, more than 90 percent of 
newborn boys were circumcised. 
</P>
<P>
	But things are changing.  
</P>
<P>
	Today about 65 percent of infant males are circumcised in the  
United States, the only industrialized nation where it remains 
routine. Scientists are churning out new research on penile 
sensitivity, hygiene and pain, and for the first time parents are 
asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Shane says, so many people have been visiting  
his booth at baby fairs that he has had to recruit more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is right,'' said Shane, who lives in Morganton, N.C.  
``More and more men are realizing the losses they've suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest boost for the anti-circumcision movement came last  
month when the influential American Academy of Pediatrics said it 
no longer recommends circumcision as a routine procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The position is similar to the AAP's first on circumcision, in  
1971. However, the academy shifted its stance in 1989, saying the 
practice had worthwhile medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	It now says any potential benefits are insignificant and sees  
medical and anecdotal evidence that circumcised men have less 
penile sensitivity. At the same time, it says research on the 
negative aspects of circumcision is inconclusive and much of it 
anecdotal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a dozen anti-circumcision groups have cropped up in the  
last decade. Some disseminate medical research, others legal 
advice. One group teaches men how to stretch their penile skin to 
re-create a foreskin. 
</P>
<P>
	They have Web sites, mailing lists, bumper stickers and  
T-shirts, international symposiums, and chapters here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane runs the southwestern North Carolina chapter of NOCIRC --  
the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource 
Centers, which has opened six chapters in the past year in his 
state alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane, 58, said he has always been troubled by circumcision.  
``This has been important to me since I realized something had been 
taken from me that made me different -- a lot of people I grew up 
with were not (circumcised),'' he said. ``It's like being born 
blind -- how do you know what color is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has seven adopted sons, two of whom have  
circumcision-related medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers are available around the country to try cases in which  
parents didn't give consent or the surgery was bungled. Advocates 
have tried, unsuccessfully, to have circumcision outlawed in North 
Dakota. Doctors are researching such aspects as the composition of 
the foreskin and the effect of circumcision on female sexual 
arousal. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio shock jock Howard Stern has taken to railing publicly  
against his circumcision. And last summer Men's Health, a major 
men's magazine, floored readers with this cover story: ``Did 
circumcision ruin your sex life?'' It said the story got more 
letters than any in its history, most opposing circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Gerald Chirnomas, who estimates he has done more than  
11,000 ``brises,'' or Jewish ritual circumcisions, says he has been 
getting more ``not too complimentary'' mail in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beginning to affect the Jewish community, especially in  
California. I get reports from people who have kids in that area. 
All of a sudden they don't want to have a bris because of this,'' 
said Chirnomas, of Boonton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Jews have been circumcising their sons for thousands of  
years, the practice is associated with Judaism. However, most 
American boys who are circumcised are non-Jews, and their parents 
agree to the surgery, doctors say, because they believe it has 
medical and social benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish ritual circumcisers say the medical debate is irrelevant,  
because the bris is a sacred covenant with God, commanded in 
Genesis. ``Nothing enters into it like, `Is this something to do or 
is it bad for the baby?' Ritually it's not a choice and it's not 
about the risks and benefits,'' said Dr. Alan Altman, a ``mohel,'' 
or ritual circumciser, from Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Optional or not, Chirnomas says opposition is heating up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they're on the level of anti-abortionists, but  
it's definitely having an effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some activists stand outside hospitals holding mockups of babies  
strapped to circumcision boards and playing recordings of infant 
screams. On the steps of the Capitol this month, five people 
demonstrated with banners that said ``stop infant circumcision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But mainstream opponents distance themselves from those tactics.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel protesting makes one look as a fringe lunatic rather  
than as a serious person, and everyone I've met is a serious human 
being, educated, and believes that this is wrong,'' said David J. 
Llewellyn, director of the Atlanta Circumcision Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Many campaigners believe deeply rooted attitudes about gender  
and maleness have led to a notion that circumcision is a rite of 
passage reserved for boys. Some argue that a 1996 law passed by 
Congress to outlaw genital mutilation of females younger than 18, a 
jarring cultural practice among immigrants from some African and 
Muslim nations, violates the federal equal protection clause 
because it protects only girls from circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawyers, including the Berkeley, Calif.-based group  
Attorneys for the Rights of the Child, are working on a challenge 
to the 1996 law, arguing it violates the federal equal protection 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Pediatricians on the AAP panel that assessed circumcision say  
that while the foreskin clearly does have nerve endings, the effect 
of circumcision on sexual satisfaction is difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have are people who have personal beliefs and are  
attempting to back that with what they call research -- unscientific 
research,'' said Alan Fleischman, a pediatrician at the New York 
Academy of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Milos, the midwife who started NOCIRC in 1985, is  
considered the mother of the modern movement. Her bumper sticker 
says ``Circumcision is a phallusy.'' But she knows there are 
hurdles to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``What man wants to admit he's lost tens of thousands of nerve  
endings?'' she says. ``What mother wants to admit her baby suffered 
needlessly?''

<HEADLINE> NBC Cancels 'Another World' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viewers of ``Another World,'' the  
longest-running soap opera in NBC history, will no longer be 
staying tuned for another episode come June, the network said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is being canceled after 35 years, a victim of NBC's  
decision to revamp its morning and daytime schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the changes: The network is adding a daytime talk show  
with ``Weekend Today'' anchor Jodi Applegate as host and a 4:30 
a.m. ET business news show for people who like to get a really 
early start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' will be replaced by ``Passions,'' a serial  
created by the former head writer of NBC's daytime hit, ``Days of 
Our Lives,'' which is remaining on the schedule. NBC is also 
renewing its two-year-old soap, ``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank all the people working on `Another World' for an  
incredible job at giving their audience an amazing 35-year run. It 
was a very tough decision,'' said Scott Sassa, NBC entertainment 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Committed to adding ``Passions'' and to not increasing the hours  
of soap operas it airs, NBC essentially chose between ``Another 
World'' and ``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' has been on NBC's daytime schedule since May  
4, 1964. It was the first soap opera expanded to one hour, and was 
even briefly broadcast for 90 minutes. It was also the first 
daytime drama to give birth to spinoff series, the short-lived 
``Somerset'' and ``Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tonight Show'' is the only NBC entertainment show to be on  
the air longer than ``Another World,'' which will end with a final 
broadcast on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guiding Light'' and ``As the World Turns'' both on CBS, have  
been on since 1952 and 1956, respectively. ``Guiding Light'' 
actually began as a radio serial in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another World'' was hurt by the increasing desire of networks  
to own and control the profits of the shows they air. ``Another 
World'' is owned by Procter &AMP; Gamble,'' and the new ``Passions'' 
will be owned by NBC. The network also has a partial stake in 
``Sunset Beach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC also said it wanted to air ``Days of Our Lives'' and  
``Passions'' back-to-back on its schedule. Currently, NBC 
affiliates choose when they want to air ``Another World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The executive editor of ``Soap Opera Digest'' said she was  
surprised by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Sunset Beach'' is promising, ``I don't think viewers  
have as much an attachment to it as the viewers for `Another 
World,''' Carolyn Hinsey said. ``Soap fans, the reason they watch 
soaps is because they hate change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate's new show, ``Later Today,'' will air at 9 a.m. ET,  
directly after the ``Today'' show. It will replace ``Leeza'' 
starting in September. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC is canceling its ``NBC News at Sunrise'' series and giving  
its affiliates the chance to program two hours of local news from 5 
to 7 a.m. ET. These early morning news broadcasts are growing in 
popularity and profitability for local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early Today,'' the new business-oriented network news show to  
air at 4:30 a.m., will be produced by the business cable network 
CNBC.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Campaign on Home Stretch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,  
campaigning for re-election, handed out sweets in a Jerusalem 
pediatric ward, stroked young faces and chatted with mothers 
cuddling newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters pushed closer, aiming microphones at the candidate,  
and Netanyahu signaled he was ready for questions. But the buzz of 
excitement quickly dissipated. Journalists realized they had little 
to ask. In the end, they politely inquired about sectarian violence 
in biblical Nazareth and PLO activities in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	As the five-month race for the May 17 election enters the final  
stretch, Netanyahu and his challengers are still struggling to set 
an agenda and rouse the nation from its lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
	The natural focus of the campaign would have been how to resolve  
the conflict with the Palestinians -- an issue that will shape 
Israel's character and final borders. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 election, it dominated the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time incumbent Shimon Peres ran as the architect of the  
interim land-for-peace agreements with the Palestinians and had no 
choice but to debate their merits with his hard-line challenger, 
Netanyahu, who claimed Peres was endangering Israel's security. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Netanyahu is going to the voters as a leader who  
himself has handed West Bank land to the Palestinians and can no 
longer badmouth the peace accords. At the same time, his key rival, 
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, has been able to remain nebulous 
about what he would offer the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	The more dovish Barak is silent because, with the race tied, he  
and Netanyahu are competing for the same tiny fraction of the 
electorate of about 4 million -- several thousand undecided voters 
who support peace talks, but don't want to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extreme center, that's what this election is about,'' said  
Asher Arian, a political scientist at the Graduate Center of the 
City University of New York who surveys voters in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign could be electrified if Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat decides, against the advice of world leaders, to declare 
statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4. However, Arafat 
has signaled that he'll wait until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	With ideological differences among the candidates blurred, their  
personalities are being scrutinized more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	However, early attempts by Barak to portray Netanyahu as a  
habitual liar have fizzled. Barak, in turn, deprived his rivals of 
mud to sling when he was cleared last month of allegations that, as 
chief of staff in 1992, he abandoned wounded soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign muddle is becoming even murkier because of the  
proliferation of small parties representing special interest groups 
-- such as gamblers, pot smokers, environmentalists, taxi drivers, 
men refusing to pay alimony and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The body politic is becoming more fragmented,'' said Uzi  
Landau, a legislator from Netanyahu's Likud Party. ``This does not 
help people focus on what the issues are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A record 33 parties are competing for 120 seats in parliament --  
a result of an electoral reform that allows separate votes for 
prime minister and party instead of one ballot only for a party. 
</P>
<P>
	A wild card in 1999 will be the second round of voting -- for  
prime minister only -- on June 1. A runoff is nearly certain because 
none of the five candidates for prime minister are expected to win 
50 percent on May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	A runoff is a first in Israeli politics, and political  
strategists admit they are entering unknown territory. 
</P>
<P>
	They wonder, for example, whether large voter blocs such as  
Israeli Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews will turn out for a runoff 
after their representation in parliament has already been decided 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer could well determine who will be Israel's next prime  
minister. Barak could be hurt by a low second-round turnout among 
Israeli Arabs, while Netanyahu could lose if not enough strictly 
observant Jews cast ballots June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some speculation that the three also-rans for prime  
minister will cut political deals in exchange for pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate Azmi Bishara, an Israeli Arab legislator, has already  
said he is waiting for offers from Barak or Yitzhak Mordechai, a 
moderate former defense minister who is running third in the polls. 
Bishara wants to win specific pledges that a moderate government 
will do more for the 1 million-strong Arab minority. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I achieve what I want before the first round, why not''  
drop out, Bishara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai insists he will overtake Barak and make it into the  
second round where polls suggest he would have a better chance than 
the Labor Party leader of defeating Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Mordechai has only won the backing of about 20 percent  
of the voters since he took the helm of the new Centrist Party last 
month. There is speculation he may eventually defer to Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	On the right of the spectrum, Netanyahu competes against Benny  
Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin. A hard-line 
ideologue, Begin is not expected to win more than 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	With uncertainty and confusion coloring the campaign, each camp  
claims it has a good chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak says he has been successful in breaking the 50-50 voter  
split by bringing traditional Likud supporters, including Sephardi 
Jews of Middle Eastern origin, closer to Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's chief strategist, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, is  
courting Russian immigrants who make up one-sixth of the 
electorate. Hoping to please the immigrants, Sharon has been 
cultivating closer ties with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two-third of the Russians are for Bibi (Netanyahu) now,''  
Sharon was quoted as saying. ``If I can get that up over 70 
percent, that's it.''

<HEADLINE> Recounting Lincoln's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the most chilling moment of his crowded  
evening, correspondent Lawrence Gobright walked into the 
flag-draped box at Ford's Theatre and took charge of the pistol 
used by John Wilkes Booth to shoot Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``A man standing by picked up Booth's pistol from the ground,''  
Gobright recalled. ``I exclaimed to the crowd below that the weapon 
had been found and placed in my possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy officer demanded it. Gobright refused and held the .44  
caliber, silver-mounted derringer for the police. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter examined the carpeted presidential box, observed  
the darkening blood on the buttoned back of Lincoln's rocking 
chair, noted the rip in the Treasury flag that draped the railing. 
Later investigation showed it had been made by Booth's spur as he 
leaped to the stage and escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes before, Gobright had been alone at the office of  
The Associated Press on Pennsylvania Avenue, leafing through a 
newspaper. An excited friend burst through the door shouting ``that 
the president had been assassinated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story tumbled out. The friend had been in the audience at  
Ford's. A gunshot was heard over the roar of a laugh line in the 
third act of the comedy, ``Our American Cousin.'' The president 
slumped forward. Mary Lincoln screamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gobright got the gist of the story, ran into the telegraph  
office and filed ``a short special'' that is still quoted as a 
model of terse story-telling. 
</P>
<P>
	``WASHINGTON, Friday, April 14, 1865. The President was shot in  
a theater to-night, and is perhaps mortally wounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pennsylvania native, Lawrence Agustus Gobright took his first  
Washington newspaper job in 1834 during Andrew Jackson's 
administration. The AP hired him shortly after its founding in 
1848. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Civil War, Gobright reported the maneuvers of the  
politicians and the ``gunpowder news'' of battles. He had wrestled 
with the official censor, once having to water down an account of a 
Confederate invasion of Maryland even though his story was clearly 
no news to the invaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But early in the war, other reporters complained that the censor  
waved Gobright's stories through while spiking theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Summoned before the House Judiciary Committee, Gobright gave  
what has been called one of the first descriptions of objective 
news writing. He volunteered that the news service's practical 
determination to be factual, non-political and impartial might have 
given it an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dispatches are merely dry matters of fact and detail,''  
Gobright testified. ``Some special correspondents may write to suit 
the temper of their own organs. ... I try to write without regard 
to men or politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over four years Gobright had come to know Lincoln well.  
</P>
<P>
	He had often witnessed the president's determination never to be  
bested in the telling of a funny story. But he had also seen an 
agitated Lincoln in the Army telegraph office, his face ``ghastly'' 
in the gas light, his hands and legs shaking, his mournful voice 
repeating, ``bad news, bad news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the second week of April 1865 was jubilation time. Lee  
surrendered his army to Grant on Sunday the 9th. Lincoln had been 
thronged by freed slaves while visiting Richmond. Gobright had seen 
him at the White House on the 10th proposing the band play the 
Confederacy's ``Dixie'' because ``we have lawfully captured it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Lincoln lay lengthwise on a boarding house bed across 10th  
Street from the theater, unconscious, his breath labored, doctors 
shaking their heads at the somber Cabinet members crowding the 
small room. Gobright sped around town, also picking up details of 
the attempted assassination of Secretary of State William H. 
Seward, and returned to his office to tell the fuller story. 
</P>
<P>
	``With trembling and nervous fingers,'' he began to write, in  
chronological order as dictated by the style of the day. He did not 
mention the gunshot until the second sentence of the third 
paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, sentence after sentence, it was all business: the mortal  
wound in the back of the president's head, the flight of the 
still-unknown assassin, the attack on Seward, the ``wild 
excitement,'' the evidence of ``a preconcerted plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afterwards surprised that I had succeeded in  
approximating so closely all the facts in those dark 
transactions,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gillette Wages War on Rival Norelco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- They didn't seem like a big deal at the time: ads  
for a Norelco electric razor that depicted traditional wet razors 
as ferocious creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Gillette Co., the television spots became the basis for a  
legal crusade with a simple message: Nobody badmouths wet shaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``They blatantly equated the experience of wet shaving to ...  
being bitten in the face by a snake, stung by a swarm of bees or 
burned by a flame-thrower,'' said Eric Kraus, a spokesman for the 
Boston-based Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal care giant filed a lawsuit against Norelco Consumer  
Products in October 1996, claiming the ads were false and 
disparaging. After 2 1/2 years of legal maneuvering and delays, the 
case went to trial in federal court in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have rested, and a judge is expected to issue a  
decision in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads -- which had titles such as ``Fire Breathing Razor'' and  
``Twin Blade Serpent'' -- have since stopped airing, but Norelco 
would not say when or why the company pulled the campaign. Though 
they never mentioned Gillette by name, Gillette alleges the 
commercials maligned the entire category of wet, or non-electric, 
razors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ads were false and disparaging to wet shaving,'' Kraus  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette is seeking a permanent injunction against Norelco that  
would bar the company from ever producing ads that cast aspersions 
on wet shaving, Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to discuss whether money damages also were being  
sought and said it was ``difficult to quantify'' whether the 
Norelco ad campaign hurt Gillette's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	To be granted injunctive relief, plaintiffs generally must prove  
they've suffered irreparable harm, loss or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette said the ads were also deceptive because they implied  
that an electric razor was automatically pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Reginald Lindsay agreed in a December 1996 ruling on  
Gillette's request for a preliminary injunction, when he ordered 
Norelco to add a disclaimer to ads for its electric Reflex Action 
Razor, warning consumers they are likely to need a 21-day 
acclimation period before getting the best shave from the electric 
razor. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the preliminary injunction, Lindsay noted at the time  
that Norelco's ads may have had a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a matter of common sense,'' Lindsay wrote, ``stroking one's  
face with the blade of a razor is to some degree, however small, a 
dangerous activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay must still rule on Gillette's request for a permanent  
injunction. He is expected to issue a decision after receiving 
briefs from both sides, which are due by May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Norelco, based in Stamford, Conn., is a division of Philips  
Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands. The company declined to 
discuss the case, saying it doesn't comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1998 sales of about $10.1 billion, Gillette controls 70  
percent of the men's shaving products market and 50 percent of the 
women's market. 
</P>
<P>
	While it may seem like a time-consuming fight for such an  
established company, such lawsuits are not uncommon in fiercely 
competitive markets, said David White-Lief, a Boston lawyer and 
chairman of the Massachusetts Bar Association's civil litigation 
section. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way for a company to protect its jealously guarded  
customer base from the forces of the marketplace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legally, it's something they can do,'' he added. ``Whether it  
gains them anything in the marketplace or the eyes of consumers is 
another thing.''

<HEADLINE> Group Says US Waterways Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Snake River in southeastern Washington  
state is the most endangered river in the nation because four dams 
have brought salmon runs to the brink of extinction, an 
environmental group says. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement today by American Rivers marks the second  
consecutive year that a Washington river tops the environmental 
group's annual list, now in its 14th year. A 51-mile undisturbed 
stretch of the Columbia River known as the Hanford Reach topped the 
group's list last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snake receives the most attention because of the Ice Harbor,  
Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite dams. Fish 
populations have dropped nearly 90 percent since the four dams were 
completed in the early 1970s, the environmentalists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A terrible hoax is being perpetrated on the American  
taxpayers,'' said Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers. 
``Every year we spend millions more on bizarre schemes to try to 
save these fish and every year fewer and fewer fish return to 
spawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say at least half of the money the Army Corps  
of Engineers proposes to spend at the dams next year to help fish 
will be wasted, because the technical fixes won't work or would be 
better tried at Columbia River dams. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps is expected to complete a study next year on whether  
breaching the Snake dams is the best way to help salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	While environmentalists say that removing the earthen portions  
of the four dams would allow water and salmon to flow freely past 
them, industry groups complain the move would also render the dams 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaching the dams would increase power rates by $150 million  
per year and force exporters to seek other ways to ship about $400 
million of goods per year that now travels by barge, said Bruce 
Lovelin, executive director of the Columbia River Alliance, which 
represents shippers, utilities, farmers and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious that this is simply kind of a political drive by  
these groups to raise some attention,'' Lovelin said of American 
Rivers' list. ``The fact is ... we have improved the way these dams 
are operated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon survival is improving because of spillways and other  
methods to help the salmon get past the dams, Lovelin said. Much of 
the salmon problems are due to increased water temperatures in the 
ocean, not the dams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Rivers said many of the rivers on its annual list  
suffer from problems related to urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is growing so swiftly that water managers have proposed  
building and modifying dams on the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, 
which threaten marine life in the rivers and prompted a No. 3 
ranking for the Coosa-Tallapoosa-Alabama River system, American 
Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in Sierra Vista, Ariz., is partly to blame for taking  
water from an acquifer faster than it can be replenished, thus 
threatening the No. 4-ranked San Pedro River. The Cedar River near 
Seattle is the No. 6 endangered river because sprawl may destroy 
fish runs, the group said. And wasteful water practices in Salt 
Lake City are reducing flows in the Bear River and damaging a bird 
refuge, earning it 10th place on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest-growing county in California, Monterey County, is  
threatening wildlife and habitat by increasingly taking water from 
the Carmel River, listed as eighth, to serve the population growth, 
the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rivers on the list are the Missouri, ranked second; the  
Yellowstone, fifth; the Fox in Illinois and Wisconsin, seventh; and 
the Coal River in West Virginia, ninth.

<HEADLINE> McDougal May Testify on Counsel Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats hope Susan McDougal will be  
the star witness at a hearing next month on whether Congress should 
renew the Watergate-inspired law that gave Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans so far aren't standing in the way.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, the Clintons' former Whitewater partner, has been  
outspoken in her contempt of Starr and his efforts to get her to 
testify against the first couple regarding their land dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that she will testify,'' said Rep. William  
Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the House Judiciary's subcommittee 
on commercial and administrative law. ``Obviously, she gives a 
perspective that we haven't heard from yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal spent 18 months in prison for refusing to testify,  
saying her decision was based on a fear that she would be charged 
with perjury unless she falsely implicated President Clinton and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury acquitted her Monday of obstruction of justice, but  
deadlocked on two criminal contempt charges stemming from her 
refusal to obey a federal judge's order to testify before a grand 
jury in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony is keenly sought by Democrats who attacked Starr  
during last year's impeachment hearings for his tactics during five 
years of investigating Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey Dearnley, a spokeswoman for subcommittee Chairman George  
Gekas, R-Pa., said Mrs. McDougal's testimony would not be ``a 
roadblock'' to a hearing on abuses of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's fiance, lawyer Pat Harris, said the subcommittee  
wanted her view ``of how this particular independent counsel had 
run this investigation and whether or not she feels she has been 
treated fairly.'' Harris said she was invited to testify and was 
willing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the subcommittee have requested that one hearing be  
devoted to purported abuses of the 1978 law and are also 
considering calling former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, among 
other officials, Delahunt said. Espy was acquitted in December of 
30 charges brought by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz that he 
accepted gifts and entertainment from companies or organizations 
regulated by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also have discussed calling Monica Lewinsky, but  
believe Starr's restrictions against the former White House 
intern's public comments would prevent her from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Mrs. McDougal would be the star witness in a hearing  
that could open as soon as May, said Democratic counsel Julian 
Epstein. But he cautioned that no decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under active consideration but no final decisions have  
been made,'' said Epstein, who talked earlier this month with Mrs. 
McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's acquittal was another in a series of blows to  
Starr, who saw the Senate acquit Clinton in February and is being 
investigated by the Justice Department on charges of illegally 
leaking grand jury information. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, and the three-judge panel that appointed him, is to  
testify Wednesday on the future of the independent counsel law 
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Profits of Newspaper Publishers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three major U.S. newspaper companies reported strong  
first-quarter profit gains Monday. USA Today publisher Gannett Co. 
posted an increase of 12 percent; Wall Street Journal publisher Dow 
Jones &AMP; Co. rose nearly 4 percent, and The E.W. Scripps Co.'s 
profits rose 28 percent. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Gannett Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Gannett Co.'s first-quarter profits increased 12 percent,  
largely on record operating results from its newspaper holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arlington, Va.-based media company earned $178.9 million, or  
64 cents per share, compared to $159.2 million, or 56 cents per 
share, in the same period last year. The year-ago results did not 
include a one-time gain of $183.6 million from the sale of several 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three months ending March 28 were $1.25  
billion, up 4 percent from $1.20 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper advertising accounted for $721 million in revenue, a  
7.5 percent increase from the same period last year. At USA Today, 
the company's flagship newspaper, paid advertising pages increased 
11 percent and advertising revenues grew 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Television broadcasting revenues edged up 0.3 percent to $161.2  
million. Gannett's first-quarter 1998 profits were boosted by 
broadcasts of the Super Bowl on its NBC-affiliated stations and the 
Winter Olympics on its CBS stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett is the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher in  
terms of daily papers, trailing only Community Newspaper Holdings 
Inc., which has expanded rapidly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett publishes 74 daily papers, compared to 96 now published  
by Community Newspaper, which is based in Birmingham, Ala. Gannett 
also has 21 television stations and cable television systems in 
five states. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gannett's  
stock rose $1.50 or 2.4 percent to $64.68 3/4. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Dow Jones &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, posted  
first-quarter earnings that were ahead of expectations, sending its 
stock higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting one-time gains and losses or revenues from its  
former Telerate subsidiary, Dow Jones earned $40.9 million, an 
increase of 3.7 percent over $39.5 million in the same quarter a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Per-share earnings rose to 44 cents per share from 40 cents per  
share. The results beat analyst expectations, helping send the 
company's stock up $2.56 1/4 or 5 percent to $50.68 3/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues rose 2.7 percent to $462.1 million from  
$450 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal,  
Dow Jones also publishes Barron's, SmartMoney magazine and Dow 
Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones also compiles numerous stock market indicators,  
including the widely-known Dow Jones industrial average of 30 top 
U.S. industrial companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *The E.W. Scripps Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter profits at The E.W. Scripps Co. rose 28 percent  
thanks to higher revenues from newspaper advertising and the 
company's cable television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based media company earned $32 million, or 40  
cents per share, compared with $25.1 million, or 31 cents per 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7.7 percent to $373.4 million from $343 million in  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsprint costs increased 3.9 percent from the prior year,  
reflecting increased advertising lineage in several markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps operates 19 daily newspapers including the Rocky  
Mountain News in Denver and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. It 
also has nine network-affiliated television stations, two cable TV 
channels -- Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Network -- United 
Media, which syndicates and licenses news features and comics, and 
the Scripps Howard News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps' stock was up 25 cents at $43.75 in afternoon trading on  
the NYSE.

	NATO Hits Yugoslavian Train; 9 Die  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A new wave of NATO attacks today  
targeted fuel depots and heavy industry, and an allied hit turned a 
Yugoslav passenger train into a heap of burning wreckage, killing 
at least nine people and injuring 16. NATO said the bridge the 
train was crossing was the intended target. Even as NATO expressed 
regret over loss of civilian life, alliance foreign ministers vowed 
to press ahead, saying the Kosovo crisis ``represents a fundamental 
challenge to the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of 
law.'' Yugoslavia's parliament, meanwhile, voted to join an 
alliance with Russia and Belarus. Russia has said it will not get 
militarily involved in the Kosovo conflict. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Mulls Kosovo Protectorate  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
and NATO allies today considered establishing a protectorate to 
shield Kosovo from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
Such a protectorate would allow the ethnic Albanians, who numbered 
1.8 million before exodus and execution, ``to live with a high 
degree of self-government without the threats and terror that they 
have been living under,'' Albright said.

	McDougal Innocent of Obstruction  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal was found innocent of  
obstructing Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation and the judge 
declared a mistrial today on the other two charges against her. The 
charges stemmed from Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury 
questions about the truthfulness of President Clinton's testimony 
in a 1996 Whitewater trial. She said she thought Starr was ``out to 
get'' Clinton.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press, The New York Times and The  
Wall Street Journal each won two Pulitzer Prizes. The AP won the 
two photography awards, the first time any news organization had 
swept the categories. The Times' prizes were for Maureen Dowd's 
columns on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, and for 
staff-reported series that disclosed the sale of American 
technology to China. The Wall Street Journal won for coverage of 
the Russian financial crisis, and writer Angelo Henderson's 
portrait of a druggist driven to violence.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An Avianca twin-engine passenger plane  
was apparently hijacked on a domestic Colombian flight today and 
forced to land on a remote airstrip. Its passengers and crew were 
believed hustled away by leftist rebels. Pilots who flew over the 
landing strip in Simiti said they saw people dressed in green 
escorting the 46 passengers and crew into wooden boats on the 
adjacent Magdalena River. The last communication with Flight 9463 
occurred two minutes after takeoff this morning from Palonegro 
airport in Bucaramanga.

	Congress Embraces Land Conservation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A billion-dollar land rush is under way in  
Congress, with both political parties offering plans to preserve 
open spaces and protect wildlife. Environmentalists and their 
Democratic allies want the bulk of funds to go for new parkland, 
suburban green spaces and wildlife protection. Most Republicans are 
backing a proposal to funnel money into coastal states with 
offshore oil drilling. Measures introduced in both the House and 
Senate far exceed even the $1.1 billion ``land legacy'' initiative 
unveiled by President Clinton in February.

set Thursday. The average of 30 blue-chip stocks is now up 12.6

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,339.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks shattered records today, charging back  
from an early drubbing tied to a stunning earnings warning from 
Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down 77 points in early  
trading, finished with a gain of 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, at 
10,339.51, its first close above both 10,200 and 10,300. The 
previous high of 10,197.70 was set Thursday. The average of 30 
blue-chip stocks is now up 12.6 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes also ended in record territory after shaking off  
early losses. The Nasdaq composite, despite its heavy weighting in 
hard-hit computer stocks, rose 5.70 to 2,598.75. The S&AMP;P 500 index 
closed at 1,358.64, up 10.29. Both indexes beat records set Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bears are saying, `I give up,' ... and the bulls are  
saying, `I can't wait any more; I've got to buy,' '' said Larry 
Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq was a trouble spot all day, down 6 13/16 points at the  
close, or 22 percent, at 24 1/8 as the most active issue on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Compaq said after markets closed Friday that 
it expected earnings would come to 15 cents a share for the first 
quarter, less than half analysts' average estimates of 31 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq in part blamed industrywide personal-computer price cuts,  
and that caused general concerns today about computer makers' 
earnings. Dow component IBM fell 2 13/16 to 183 1/2. Dell shed 1 3/4 to 
41 13/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	An analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens &AMP; Co., Dan Niles,  
added to the concerns by lowering his estimate of PC revenue growth 
to 3 percent this year from an earlier forecast of 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But worries about Compaq's troubles were for the most part  
confined to computer-related stocks. Rather than touching off an 
all-out selling spree, Compaq's warning and the weakness in 
technology issues prompted investors to seek shares in other 
sectors that may have been undervalued, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	William Meehan, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said  
such a ``rotation'' showed up in strength today among consumer 
issues, some economically sensitive shares and financial stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of big Dow stocks were higher, including International  
Paper, up 2 3/8 at 46 5/8, and Caterpillar, up 2 7/8 at 51 5/8. Merrill Lynch 
upgraded its rating for Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in economically sensitive stocks reflects a  
broadening economic recovery worldwide, said Jack Shaughnessy, 
market strategist at Advest Corp. in Hartford, Conn. Shaughnessy 
said Western Europe, for example, should benefit from last week's 
cut in European interest rates. And, he said, the picture brightens 
almost daily in Asia and is at least not worsening in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is broadening because worldwide economic activity  
is broadening,'' Shaughnessy said. He was buying paper stocks, for 
example, ``because we can see pulp and paper prices improving, and 
Asia is a major consumer of these products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also said the broadening of leadership beyond technology  
shares was a sign that the market could continue to go higher. 
Technicians, market analysts who examine things like the ratio of 
advancing issues to decliners, have been worried since early 
October that while the Dow and even the Nasdaq and S&AMP;P 500 continue 
to make new highs, the advances have been confined to too few 
high-flying technology names to be sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was different, Wachtel said. ``Not only does the Dow  
recover, but the breadth recovers, the Russell 2000 recovers, the 
whole shooting match recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of small- and medium-sized companies was  
up 6.20 points, or 1.53 percent, at 412.06, although it is still 
down 2.35 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
NYSE, with 1,629 up, 1,365 down and 564 unchanged. Volume on the 
Big Board improved to 806.83 million shares as of 4 p.m. EDT, vs. 
707.25 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 6.54 to 633.13, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 7.82 to 735.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 2.07 percent in  
anticipation of a selloff on Wall Street. In Europe, the DAX index 
in Frankfurt rose 0.68 percent, but the FT-SE 100 index in London 
fell 0.5 percent and the CAC in Paris slipped 0.19 percent.

<HEADLINE> Saints Ask Browns To Trade Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints have approached the  
Cleveland Browns about making a trade for the No. 1 pick in 
Saturday's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns director of football operations Dwight Clark confirmed  
that he took a call from Saints president Bill Kuharich before 
Cleveland's front office watched quarterback Tim Couch work out in 
Kentucky on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich was asking about a trade that would allow New Orleans  
to move up in the draft and take Texas running back and Heisman 
Trophy winner Ricky Williams with the top pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to know if we would be interested in trading the  
pick and I told him we would be,'' Clark said. ``He said that he 
knew our feelings might change after we worked out Tim, and he said 
he'd call me this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark hadn't heard back from Kuharich as of Monday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Saints coach Mike Ditka has said he's willing to trade all six  
of his 1999 draft picks to Cleveland for a chance at selecting 
Williams. New Orleans appears to have sweetened that possible deal 
with some future draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns president Carmen Policy said the offer is intriguing.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get that blockbuster trade that gives you a  
combination of picks, presently and in the future, that can really 
set you up for the next 12 years, I think that we'd be very, very 
foolish not to give serious consideration to that alternative,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If they keep the top draft choice, the Browns say they haven't  
decided whether to take to take Couch, Williams or Oregon 
quarterback Akili Smith.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Awaits Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's nine years outside  
the boundaries of conventional medicine during his assisted-suicide 
crusade may end with him sentenced Tuesday to the confines of a 
prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted last month of second-degree murder for  
giving a lethal injection to a man with Lou Gehrig's disease and 
putting it on videotape to goad prosecutors into charging him. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will ask a judge to send the retired pathologist to  
prison for a minimum of 10 to 25 years. The maximum is life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's lawyers will tell Judge Jessica Cooper that the case  
shouldn't be treated as any other murder and doesn't require 
sending a 70-year-old man to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge can go outside the state's sentencing guidelines for a  
``compelling'' reason and let Kevorkian off with probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was found guilty March 26 in the death of 52-year-old  
Thomas Youk. Kevorkian taped Youk's death on Sept. 17 and gave the 
video to CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' which aired the footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's previous trials, all on assisted-suicide charges,  
had resulted in three acquittals and one mistrial. He has admitted 
helping 130 people commit suicide; this was the first time he stood 
trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison -- a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted-suicide advocates have said they were dismayed at  
Kevorkian's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Ed Pierce, who led a failed effort to legalize assisted  
suicide in Michigan last year, said Kevorkian's tactics in recent 
years have not helped the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on the whole he's been a pioneer in bringing the issue  
to our attention. But I don't think he can go on like he's been 
doing in the past,'' Pierce said Monday, adding that Kevorkian has 
been known to help people who weren't terminally ill, something 
most assisted-suicide advocates oppose.

<HEADLINE> Judge Finds Clinton in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled President Clinton  
in contempt of court Monday for giving ``intentionally false'' 
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during 
questioning in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's finding, a civil rather than criminal ruling, orders  
Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones ``any reasonable expenses including 
attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to obey this court's 
discovery orders.'' Presumably, the president's legal defense fund, 
which has raised $4.5 million, would pay the sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said she would delay  
enforcement for 30 days to give Clinton an opportunity to ask for a 
hearing or file a notice of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as minimal since the 
judge had the option of citing the president for criminal contempt. 
But the lawyers were keeping options open until they learn how 
large a monetary penalty Mrs. Jones might receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, a public reminder of the Lewinsky controversy at a  
time that national interest has turned to Kosovo and other matters, 
came nearly three months after the Senate voted to acquit Clinton 
of impeachment charges that grew out of the relationship and his 
denials of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said her decision to dismiss the Jones case a year ago  
would not have changed, even if the president had been ``truthful 
with respect to his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal, but then she and Clinton  
agreed to settle, with him paying $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said in her ruling, ``The record demonstrates by clear  
and convincing evidence that the president responded to plaintiff's 
questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were 
designed to obstruct the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this  
nation's president in contempt of court,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Mrs. Jones was entitled to information regarding any  
state or federal employee with whom the president had or proposed 
to have sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton said: ``I have  
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the president's DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms.  
Lewinsky, he acknowledged an ``inappropriate intimate 
relationship'' with her before a federal grand jury last Aug. 17 -- 
and again in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
said Monday there would be no comment until the president's 
personal attorney in the case, Robert Bennett, had an opportunity 
to review the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, a Republican appointed by President Bush, is a former  
law student of Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	She also is the judge who sent Susan McDougal to jail for 18  
months for Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury questions 
in Kenneth Starr's Whitewater inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright first raised the contempt issue in a footnote to a Sept.  
1, 1998, ruling in which she released Clinton's testimony in the 
Jones case. In that footnote, Wright said she had concerns about 
the president's deposition but made no findings as to possible 
contempt at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	In her decision Monday, the judge wrote, ``It is difficult to  
construe the president's sworn statements ... as anything other 
than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding  
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally 
false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in 
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally 
false,'' said the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	She directed Mrs. Jones' lawyers to submit a statement of their  
expenses and fees within 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton decides not respond, the court will enter an order  
setting out the time and manner by which Clinton has to comply with 
the sanctions, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the payment to Mrs. Jones, Clinton must reimburse  
to the court $1,202 to cover the judge's travel expenses in going 
to Washington at Clinton's request to preside over ``his tainted 
deposition'' on Jan. 17, 1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she will refer the matter to the Arkansas  
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct to review any 
disciplinary action it thinks is appropriate. She referred to the 
Model Rules of Professional Conduct that say that it is misconduct 
for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving ``dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit or misrepresentation.'' Clinton is a lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Editor Seeks Scoops on Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Shigeo Makino waits quietly in the dead of night.  
</P>
<P>
	Through an infrared scope, he watches his prey come into view.  
It is still just a speck in his finder, but he has telescopic 
lenses and the best snooping equipment money can buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Makino's target is Japan's auto industry. With a network of  
agents around the world and a reputation for accuracy, he is one of 
Japan's most successful spies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car manufacturers hate us,'' Makino said. ``They hate me,  
they hate my staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But like 300,000 other readers each month, they can't get enough  
of Makino's Magazine X, one of the country's hottest auto magazines 
and the only one featuring cars that are months, sometimes years, 
away from their official debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all read it,'' confessed Shiro Nakamura, general manager  
for design at Isuzu Motors. ``No one wants their own designs in 
there. But peeping into other people's houses -- that's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With profits spiraling ever downward as Japan struggles through  
its worst recession since World War II, Japan's big automakers are 
increasingly calling on designers to create innovative and 
distinctive models that will put tight-fisted consumers in the mood 
to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	That, of course, makes secrecy all the more crucial. Or, from  
Makino's standpoint, scoops all the sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always watching,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Magazine X, founded 14 years ago, is among dozens of auto  
magazines published in car-crazy Japan, home to Toyota Motor Corp., 
Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Its scoops don't necessarily sound all that momentous. Most  
involve minute design details -- the length of the hood, the type of 
rear suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Some can be whoppers, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Makino's favorite is the one he got on Honda's S-2000 Roadster.  
After obtaining several photographs and a complete set of specs, he 
featured a detailed description of the car in his September 1997 
issue -- a full year before Honda unveiled the car as part of its 
50th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	To get their scoops, Makino, who is chief editor, and his staff  
of six have compiled a secret list of places where automakers 
typically test cars. They lurk around the sites, peering at 
unreleased models through infrared night scopes and snapping 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in their tiny downtown Tokyo office, computer imaging helps  
the staff fill in fuzzy details. There staff also gets tips from a 
network of sources and a toll-free hotline. Makino is willing to 
pay for information, but he says he tries not to break laws. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's as much as Makino will reveal about his spy tactics.  
To further questions, he replies, ``It's a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers typically go to great lengths to protect their design  
secrets. New models are tested at night and cloaked with black 
fabric during the day. Unauthorized employees are banned from the 
design rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies even test their new models overseas, but that  
doesn't stop Magazine X. With about 50 contracted photographers 
working for him worldwide, Makino has gotten scoops as far away as 
Arizona and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Makino said leaks are also common.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes designers want to show off,'' he said. ``Or  
companies want to create a buzz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and automakers agree the magazine's information is  
surprisingly accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mistakes are inevitable, Makino admitted, especially  
since automakers often continue making design changes until right 
before release. 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't help that Magazine X's reporters aren't welcome  
at official news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Keisuke Egashira, sales chairman of Chrysler Japan, said that  
while some of his employees may read Magazine X out of curiosity, 
Makino and his staff are not privy to the company's press 
conferences, news releases, or product launches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not even on our invitation list,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Angelos May Bid for Redskins Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos is  
considering a new bid of at least $625 million to buy the 
Washington Redskins, The Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reviewing the matter,'' Angelos told the newspaper.  
``We'll make a decision shortly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos could not be reached for comment today.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has put off a decision on the sale of the Redskins after  
team owners were unwilling to support a winning bid selected by the 
estate of late Redskins Owner Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective bidders are awaiting word on a second auction.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard Milstein withdrew his group's $800 million bid last week  
when it became clear he would not receive the necessary 24 votes 
from 31 NFL teams. Several owners expressed a preference for 
Cooke's son, team president John Kent Cooke, to own the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos dropped out of the bidding in the early first round,  
with a bid that topped $600 million, sources told the Post. NFL 
officials said the league's cross-ownership rules would prevent 
Angelos from owning the Orioles and the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said Angelos might be willing to increase his bid or  
merge with another group. During the first round, Angelos indicated 
a willingness to join with the younger Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the sale is the new Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in  
Landover.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Icon's Mom Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When 83-year-old Carolyn Goodman was arrested  
for protesting the police killing of Amadou Diallo, the young 
African immigrant wasn't the only victim on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's death in a hail of gunfire by four white New York  
police officers reminded Mrs. Goodman of a more personal pain -- 
that of her activist son's slaying 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Goodman left Manhattan for the South in 1964 hoping to  
bring about change by registering black Mississippians to vote. He 
disappeared the day he arrived and was found buried in an earthen 
dam six weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goodman said in an interview that both Diallo, a  
22-year-old Guinean street vendor, and her son, a 20-year-old 
Jewish New Yorker, were outsiders in unfamiliar territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goodman still lives by the beliefs she taught her son,  
whose death alongside two fellow activists was one of the most 
notorious killings of the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	So she didn't hesitate when an acquaintance called to ask if she  
was willing to be arrested at a rally against the Diallo killing, 
which had sparked two months of angry demonstrations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't tolerate it,'' she explained, saying she felt  
compelled to back up her frustration with action. ``I'm older, 
sure, but I can still go on doing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police officers, who said they thought Diallo was about to  
turn a weapon on them on that February night, have since been 
indicted on second-degree murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goodman and 211 others were arrested on disorderly conduct  
charges two weeks ago and put in plastic handcuffs -- ``We got out 
of them so easily,'' she laughed -- and were kept in custody for six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge later dismissed the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Going to jail to call attention to what many see as a pattern of  
police harassment of New York City minorities was in keeping with 
Mrs. Goodman's lifetime of liberal activism. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped organize upstate dairy farmers as a Cornell  
University undergraduate in the 1930s, raised money for 
anti-fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War, and fought for 
civil rights and against American involvement in Vietnam during the 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
	But she grew nervous as Andrew packed his duffel bag with  
bandages and antiseptics, anticipating beatings from Ku Klux Klan 
members during the so-called Freedom Summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would be a mother if I didn't have mixed  
feelings about his going,'' she said. ``If we denied Andy the right 
to go down there, our whole life would have been a sham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one was ever charged with murder in the slaying of Andrew or  
his two companions, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney. Seven 
Klansmen, including a sheriff's deputy, were convicted on federal 
conspiracy charges, but none served more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Photos and paintings of her handsome, dark-haired son hang on  
the walls of Mrs. Goodman's apartment and she works long hours 
encouraging other young people to find causes to support. 
</P>
<P>
	She speaks frequently to youth groups as head of the Andrew  
Goodman Foundation, which she founded to support causes her son 
felt strongly about. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Mrs. Goodman still grieves for her son and the two  
husbands she has outlived, her activist heart refuses to remain in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I had these really great losses, I felt and I still feel  
I've been lucky in my life,'' she said. ``My life is devoted to the 
future.''

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Difference in Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Men with some forms of advanced congestive heart  
failure are twice as likely as women to die within 18 months of 
being diagnosed with the disease, according to a study released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is not that men and women receive different  
treatment, as some experts had suspected. Researchers said the 
cause is more likely a biological difference between the sexes: 
Women's heart muscles respond better to some types of heart 
disease, such as high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A growing body of evidence points to fundamental  
gender-related differences in the nature and extent of heart 
failure,'' said the lead researcher, Dr. Kirkwood F. Adams Jr., a 
professor of medicine and radiology at the University of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding challenges earlier work suggesting women's survival  
advantage might come from differences in the types of treatment 
women and men receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of flies in the face of where our thinking had  
been,'' said Dr. Charles Francis, a specialist in women's heart 
disease at Drew University in Madison, N.J. ``I think it's a very 
important study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4.6 million Americans have congestive heart  
failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to 
meet the body's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, reported in Circulation, a journal of the American  
Heart Association, focused on patients with advanced heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared survival data on 331 men and 99 women and  
grouped them by age, race, weight, duration of heart failure and 
blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Men with ischemic heart disease -- the kind caused by clogged  
vessels and resulting in a lack of blood supply to the heart -- were 
about 1.5 times more likely to die in the first 18 months after 
being diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Men with nonischemic heart disease -- caused by high blood  
pressure or other factors that can weaken the heart muscle -- were 
three times more likely than women to die during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, men whose congestive heart failure was caused by high  
blood pressure or other factors were twice as likely to die as 
their female counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers cautioned that larger studies are needed.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Early Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies on  
fears of a stock market meltdown Monday and was unable to fully 
recover even as stocks reversed course and rose to unprecedented 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0820, up  
from $1.0790 late Friday. The dollar was worth 120.19 Japanese yen, 
down from 120.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's foreign exchange markets were primed by Friday's late  
report from Compaq Computer that its first-quarter earnings would 
be 15 cents a share, less than half analysts' average estimates of 
31 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asian and European trading, the dollar fell on fears that  
Compaq's warning would depress U.S. stock markets. Stock markets 
overseas slipped as well, led by the Nikkei index in Tokyo, which 
tumbled 2.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange investors in New York sold off their dollars as  
they anticipated the Dow would crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we came in, the dollar was on its lows'' against the yen  
and euro, said Dennis Heidt, chief currency dealer at Banque 
Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors ultimately decided the problem was unique to  
Compaq. By noon, the Dow was on its way to a record close, 
rocketing 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,339.51. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Dow went positive, everybody bought their dollars  
back,'' Heidt said. But ``we didn't fully retrace'' the dollar's 
route to its Friday levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4843 Swiss francs, up from 1.4829,  
and 1.4935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4999. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6129, up from $1.6103. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8077 
German marks, down from 1.8112; 6.0643 French francs, down from 
6.0793; and 1,788.91 Italian lire, down from 1,794.50.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Preps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It was when trainer Dallas Keen watched Valhol run fourth in the  
Louisiana Derby that he knew the colt was not a plodder as he had 
first suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Valhol won the first race of his career in only his  
third start, all this year -- a surprising 4 1/2-length victory in the 
Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park. It was that was worth a winning 
mutuel return of $62.80. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had watched him in the Louisiana Derby, they wouldn't  
have been (shocked),'' Keen said. ``Naturally, you want to throw a 
maiden to the wolves. This colt showed us so much talent, we 
thought we'd take shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shot in the Arkansas Derby earned Valhol a shot in the  
Kentucky Derby on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kentucky Derby is the crown jewel of all of them,'' said  
owner James D. Jackson, who owns mostly claiming horses. ``This is 
fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol beat Certain, with Torrid Sand third, in a seven-horse  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other important Derby preps, Menifee ($17.40) won the  
Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, and Adonis ($8.40) took the Wood 
Memorial at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee's 1 1/4-length victory over Cat Thief, with Florida Derby  
winner Vicar third, in the eight-horse field, enabled Pat Day to 
avoid a lot of second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Day elected to ride Menifee, winning for the fourth time in five  
starts after finishing second in the Tampa Bay Derby. Day could 
have ridden Cat Thief or Answer Lively, fifth in the Arkansas 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it was all said and done, we thought this horse had a lot  
of room for improvement,'' Day said of his decision.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Apologizes for Memo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time in four months, ``60  
Minutes'' apologized on the air over a report on drug smuggling, 
acknowledging that a memo cited by the newsmagazine had turned out 
to be bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology was part of a settlement reached with a customs  
official who had sued CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' issued the apology Sunday night over a report on  
April 20, 1997, about drugs flowing across the U.S.-Mexico border 
at San Diego. Correspondent Lesley Stahl, who made the apology, 
emphasized that CBS stuck by the underlying theme of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, ``60 Minutes'' founder Don Hewitt apologized for  
airing a June 1997 story based on a British documentary about 
smugglers swallowing heroin in latex gloves to get past 
authorities. An investigative panel later found that the 
documentary producers had faked locations and paid actors to 
portray drug couriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on smuggling along the Mexican border cited a memo  
supposedly written by Rudy Camacho, the San Diego district director 
of the Customs Service, calling for customs agents to quickly 
process trucks owned by a company linked to Mexican drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service in Washington investigated the memo and  
found that it was fake and that no preferential treatment was 
offered, Stahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' reported in February 1998 that the memo was  
declared bogus. But Camacho sued the newsmagazine, which launched 
its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concluded that we were deceived, and ultimately so  
were you, our viewers,'' Stahl said. ``Under the circumstances, we 
regret that any reference to that memo or to Mr. Camacho's 
connection with it was included in our original report and 
apologize for any harm to Mr. Camacho's professional reputation and 
any distress caused to him and his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said that CBS and Camacho ``have  
come to an amicable settlement.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Holds China Espionage Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intelligence officer told a Senate panel  
Monday that the acting energy secretary last year kept him from 
briefing Congress on an alleged case of Chinese espionage because 
she said it would harm the administration's China policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The former official strongly denied the charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Notra Trulock, a senior Energy Department intelligence adviser,  
said he had been blocked from answering a July 1998 request from 
the House Intelligence Committee for a briefing on an alleged case 
of spying at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Elizabeth  
Moler, then the acting secretary, ignored a memo he sent her on the 
request and then, when he approached her personally, rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, he said, told him that the House Intelligence Committee  
``was only interested in harming the president on his China 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moler said she had never seen Trulock's memo and had never  
denied a request from the intelligence officer to brief the House 
panel. Any suggestions that she had refused to confront security 
problems ``because of negative repercussions for our China 
policy,'' she said, ``are absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held numerous closed hearings exploring charges  
that the Energy Department and the national labs were lax in 
guarding the nation's nuclear weapons secrets and were slow in 
responding to the Los Alamos case. The Senate hearing was the first 
to openly air the positions of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., criticized Moler before  
the hearing for working to block and then trying to water down 
security reforms at the labs he sought in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Moler, deputy secretary from July 1997 and acting secretary in  
1998 until Bill Richardson took over the department, insisted she 
was ``an enthusiastic supporter of taking aggressive action to 
protect our nation's most important secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock said he was also thwarted by Energy Department officials  
in 1997 when he recommended changes in counterintelligence 
policies. ``They were ignored, they were minimized and occasionally 
even ridiculed,'' he told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials urged him to bury the Los Alamos case, arguing  
that it was of historical interest only and would harm the 
credibility of the labs. A Taiwan-born American is suspected, but 
has not been charged, in the passing of nuclear weapons technology 
to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the case became public earlier this year, Richardson has  
imposed new security measures on the weapons labs and has said he 
has ordered an internal investigation into Trulock's charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the panel said the FBI, which is in charge of the  
criminal investigation at Los Alamos, and other intelligence 
agencies had briefed Congress 19 times on the case, and questioned 
GOP attempts to find fault with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine congressional committees are looking into the Chinese  
espionage issue, said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. ``There's an 
appearance or a perception that we've got a piling-on here by the 
Congress,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Raymond F. ``Bud'' Harvison, who spent  
42 years as a newsman for The Associated Press, died Saturday. He 
was 71 and had been in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
	A Seattle native, Harvison joined the AP there in 1947 after a  
short time with The Seattle Times. In 1950 Harvison was named AP 
correspondent in Tacoma, Wash., and four years later transferred to 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in 1954 he transferred to the Kansas City bureau, and  
moved to Chicago as filer of what was known as the interbureau wire 
when it was inaugurated in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960 he moved to New York, working at AP headquarters on the  
general news desk. He remained there six years in a variety of 
assignments, and was designated by Wes Gallagher, then the AP 
president and general manager, as the AP's first enterprise editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvison was named correspondent in charge of the AP's Topeka  
bureau in 1966. He later transferred to Kansas City for the second 
time, and continued to work there until retirement in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife and a son.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jerold C. Hoffberger, former owner of the  
Baltimore Orioles baseball team whose philanthropy benefited 
Maryland universities and hospitals, died Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hoffberger owned the team, the Orioles made it to five  
World Series between 1965 and 1979. He also ran the National 
Brewing Co. for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Town &AMP; Country magazine described Hoffberger as one of  
the nation's ``most generous living Americans'' and said he had 
donated more than $10 million to charity at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, Hoffberger, who was born in Baltimore, assumed the  
principal ownership of the Orioles, but in 1977 made clear that all 
was not well financially with the team. Two years later, he sold 
the team to Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams for $12 
million.

                        *Brother John Sellers    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brother John Sellers, a blues and gospel singer  
who started his climb to fame at age 5, died March 27. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers performed regularly in the early 1960s at Folk City, a  
Greenwich Village nightclub where musicians including Bob Dylan, 
Paul Simon and Joan Baez sang early in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers was born in Clarksville, Miss., where he was inspired by  
street performers like Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson. By 
age 5, Sellers had begun singing, dancing and playing the 
tambourine in church-organized tent shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later gospel singer Mahalia Jackson saw Sellers  
perform, and brought the boy, whose parents had abandoned him, to 
Chicago with her. As Jackson's fame grew, they sometimes sang 
together, and Sellers occasionally filled in for her at concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers made two recordings for Vanguard Records' new jazz line  
in the mid-1950s, teaming up with musicians like Sonny Terry, 
Johnny Johns and Jo Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during a Folk City performance in 1961 that choreographer  
Alvin Ailey noticed him. The two later collaborated on Ailey's 
``Blues Suite'' and ``Revelations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers' final performance with the well-known Ailey company was  
in 1997. At his death, Sellers was involved in litigation with the 
troupe over royalties and the copyright to ``Revelations,'' one of 
Ailey's most famous compositions.

</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Robert Widman, a retired reporter with The  
Plain Dealer, died Friday of cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Widman worked at The Plain Dealer from 1967 to 1987. His work  
included a series of stories on the abusive treatment of prison 
inmates and coverage of a 1970 state loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked at The (Elyria) Chronicle-Telegram and The (Upper  
Sandusky) Daily Chief-Union before joining The Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	He became an antiques dealer when he retired.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, four sons, two daughters, 14  
grandchildren, a great-grandchild and a brother.

<HEADLINE> Olazabal Unshakable Despite Norman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Greg Norman's eagle putt on No. 13 would  
have shaken most competitors. Not Jose Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	After his curling 25-foot putt sent Amen Corner into an uproar  
Sunday and gave Norman a one-stroke lead, Olazabal calmly answered 
the Australian with a 21-foot birdie putt of his own to make it 
co-leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman bogeyed the next hole and began his slide out of the  
picture as Olazabal won his second green jacket with Davis Love III 
finishing second by two strokes and Norman another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never doubted Ollie would make his,'' Norman said of the  
putts on the par-5. ``That putt there and the putt he made on 17 
won him the golf tournament. Both were crucial putts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the putt at No. 13 both players gestured to each other.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always do that with Jose, saying `Well done,''' Norman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal's 7-foot putt on 17 saved par and gave him the  
opportunity to play No. 18 without pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman's eagle was the result of three masterful shots on the  
485-yard, par-5. His 3-wood tee shot put him in perfect position 
and he hit a 198-yard 4-iron to the green before he made the 
downhill putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 4-iron was one of the best shots I've hit in a long  
time,'' Norman said. ``I felt I could make that putt. In fact, I've 
made it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal figured he would have to make his putt after hitting  
the green with his third shot, a 115-yard sand wedge over Rae's 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg hit hit a wonderful putt and while that ball was rolling  
I said to myself `You need to make yours,''' Olazabal said. '' 
Making that putt was an important boost to myself. I didn't want to 
go one shot down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Olazabal made his putt, he and Norman exchanged greetings.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the relationship we have,'' Olazabal said. ``When one  
of us hits a great shot we talk to each other. I enjoyed the roar 
when he made his putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he made that putt and I made mine we both understood. I  
pointed at him and he pointed at me. Those were truly great putts. 
For me, it was a very crucial hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal went on to make a birdie putt at 16 and then holed the  
crucial par putt on 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I made that putt on 16 and I was dying to  
make my putt on No. 17,'' Olazabal said. ``I knew when I made that 
one the jacket was mine. I needed that 4 to have a two-shot leading 
going to 18.''

<HEADLINE> Columbus Mayor Race a Real Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Columbus' campaign for mayor was shaping  
up as predictable for an office that has been held for the past 28 
years by three Republican men. Then on Dec. 1, Mayor Greg Lashutka 
announced he wanted to do something else with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up a lively, history-making campaign that will give  
Columbus its first female or black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Dorothy Teater and Democrats Michael Coleman and Ben  
Espy face off in a nonpartisan primary on May 4 that will produce 
the two candidates for the Nov. 2 election. Coleman and Espy are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is the most hotly contested since 1975, when the  
mayor at the time defeated five candidates. In a mail poll by The 
Columbus Dispatch, Ms. Teater led with 39 percent to 32 percent for 
Coleman and 24 percent for Espy. The poll of 2,693 registered 
voters was conducted March 26 through April 1 and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long after Lashutka decided not to seek a third  
four-year term before others jumped into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been an ambition for a long time, but I never thought I  
would realize it. I just assumed that Greg Lashutka would run 
again,'' said Ms. Teater, a county commissioner for 16 years. Ms. 
Teater, 67, sought the office in 1991 but bowed out when Lashutka 
won the party's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy, 55, began his career on City Council in 1982 and lost to  
Lashutka in the general election in 1991. He has been a state 
senator since 1992 and Senate minority leader since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 44, is City Council president and ran unsuccessfully  
last year for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for new leadership to address the issues,'' Coleman  
said. ``I'm already doing it. That's something my opponents cannot 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city of more than 680,000 people is just under one-fourth  
black. Blacks occupy three of the seven City Council seats. The 
police chief, school superintendent and city attorney are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters (though  
most voters don't declare a party affiliation) and six City Council 
members are Democrats. But the voters of Columbus keep electing GOP 
mayors. The city hasn't had a Democratic mayor since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens some way, in their wisdom, want balance,'' Ms.  
Teater said. ``I'm using that argument a little bit at 
fund-raisers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Teater said a fund-raiser kept her away from the first  
debate of the race last month on the city's predominantly black 
east side. Black leaders said she stayed away because she had 
little hope of winning black votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never shied away from going to the black community,''  
she said. ``At that period of time, it was pretty important to 
start raising money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most contentious issue so far has been the council's vote  
last year to offer health benefits to the gay or heterosexual 
partners of city employees. The council quietly passed the plan 
with Lashutka's support, then dropped it after opponents began 
pushing for a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Espy and Ms. Teater opposed the plan. Coleman said he supported  
dropping it because it had become divisive.

<HEADLINE> Rothschild Art Collection Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In the sumptuous surroundings of auctioneers  
Christie's, the portraits by Dutch master Frans Hals, the richly 
illustrated 16th-century religious manuscripts and lavish furniture 
built for King Louis XVI look quite at home. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind them lies the tale of a famous family brought low by  
Nazi persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's is selling 250 artworks from the collection put  
together last century by Barons Albert and Nathaniel von 
Rothschild, scions of the Austrian arm of the 250-year-old banking 
dynasty and both avid collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of annexing Austria in March 1938, the Nazis seized  
the Rothschilds' beloved artworks and it was only in February that 
the Austrian government agreed to return them. But the Rothschilds 
can no longer afford such luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the war, the palace in which this collection was exhibited  
was reduced to rubble, and so were their investments, factories and 
their wealth-producing powers,'' Christie's chairman Lord Hindlip 
said at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rothschilds ... really have no alternative but to sell,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale on July 8 is expected to realize more than $40 million.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the war, American soldiers discovered the  
Rothschild collection hidden in a ski resort in the Austrian Tyrol. 
From 1947, it went on display in leading museums, including 
Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum and the Austrian Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer granted  
permission for the works to be exported, saying she wanted to 
overturn the ``immoral decisions'' taken at war's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It breaks my heart to see these things being sold: they are  
the last of my childhood,'' Albert's granddaughter, Baroness 
Bettina der Rothschild, said in a recent interview with The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindlip called the collection ``the most exciting I have seen in  
my 36-odd years at Christie's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the highlights of the 31 paintings to be sold are three  
Hals portraits, including one of the Amsterdam merchant Tieleman 
Roosterman, splendid in black suit with white ruff and cuffs. It 
alone is expected to fetch up to $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The furniture collection includes a lavishly worked wooden  
commode built by cabinetmaker Jean-Henri Riesener for Louis XVI's 
Fontainebleau palace in 1778 but later moved to Versailles. It 
carries an estimate of $2.4 million to $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Killer Seeks Jury's Mercy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Convicted serial killer Charles Ng was  
abused as a child and ``is a person of value'' who should be 
spared, a defense attorney told jurors today. 
</P>
<P>
	The emigre from Hong Kong was beaten with chains by his father  
and spent so much time being ordered around that he became 
dependent on others to tell him what to do, Deputy Public Defender 
William Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney addressed the jury as the defense began its case in  
the penalty phase of Ng's trial. In February, the jury convicted Ng 
of 11 murders committed in Northern California in the mid-1980s. Ng 
now faces either the death penalty or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't know how to be assertive because they don't teach  
you that in Hong Kong,'' Kelley told the panel. ``He wanted to be 
told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said that was why Ng joined the Marine Corps when he came  
to the United States and why he formed an attachment to Leonard 
Lake, a survivalist blamed for engineering a series of torture 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mental health witnesses will show jurors that Ng is ``a  
dependent personality'' and that his actions were formed by that 
tendency, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of this, he said, Ng accomplished positive things  
during the 14 years he spent in jail before being convicted, and 
promised that another inmate will testify how Ng turned the man's 
life around by his caring advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will realize that he is a person of value and he should be  
saved,'' the attorney declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley called as his first witness Dr. Stuart Grassian, a  
psychiatrist who has studied the effects of stringent conditions of 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, 38, was convicted Feb. 24 of killing six men, three women  
and two baby boys in a spree of kidnapping, bondage and sadism from 
1984-85. The penalty phase began last month and resumed after a 
three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng and Lake incriminated themselves with videotapes they made  
while threatening and tormenting women they held as sex slaves 
before their killings in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them was Kathy Allen, 18, seen in April 1985 wearing  
handcuffs and being threatened on a videotape made by her captors 
at Lake's rural house in Wilseyville, about 150 miles east of San 
Francisco. Another woman, Brenda O'Connor, was seen pleading in 
vain for the lives of her husband and baby as Ng cut off her shirt 
and bra in view of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-woman, three-man Orange County jury saw the scenes  
repeatedly during the guilt portion of the trial, which began Oct. 
26. Dian Allen, younger sister of the slain woman, rushed from the 
courtroom in tears at the sight of her sister being brutalized on 
television monitors. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Shock Vest May Aid in Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patients waiting for heart transplants are  
testing a vest that could prolong the lives of cardiac arrest 
victims by automatically jump-starting the heart anywhere at 
anytime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liken it to an emergency room on your chest,'' said Douglas  
Zipes, vice president of the American College of Cardiology. ``It 
acts like an emergency room that monitors the heartbeat and 
responds appropriately, much like a doctor would in an ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the device, which looks much like a women's bra with  
small electric shock paddles inside the straps, can jolt a heart 
into beating again and eliminate the need for patients to have 
defibrillators implanted during open chest surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Drug Administration approved the study at clinics  
around the country and 150 to 300 patients are expected to enroll 
over the next year or so, according to clinics sponsoring the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Eisen, principal investigator for the 6-month-old study  
at Temple University, said the vest is working well for his 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	It operates by using sensing electrodes to continuously monitor  
a patient's heart beat. If a potentially fatal rapid heart beat is 
detected, the vest gives a sequence of warning alarms. If the 
patient fails to shut it off in 20 seconds, an electrically 
conductive gel is ejected onto the patient's chest and back, and a 
shock is delivered to restore normal heart rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rhythm is not restored, it will repeat this process up to  
five times in 30-second intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, 350,000 Americans collapse and die of cardiac arrest  
-- their hearts just suddenly stop beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Ricafort, who suffers from a virus that has weakened his  
heart, has been wearing the device about 23 hours a day for the 
last three weeks. The device is barely noticeable underneath his 
clothes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to know I can still have peace of mind of knowing  
that if something goes haywire with me, I have a security 
blanket,'' the 35-year-old former jewelry repairman said.

<P>
	On April 13, 1743, the third president of the United States,  
Thomas Jefferson, was born in present-day Albemarle County, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:

<HEADLINE> Blazers, Lakers Ready to Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It says a lot that the only NBA player  
whose picture is on the side of a Portland building is Kobe Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in their own town, the Trail Blazers are overshadowed by  
the glitzy, unpredictable traveling circus that is the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, they seem to be the barometer of the  
league,'' Blazers point guard Damon Stoudamire said at practice 
Monday. ``Everybody has to play well to beat the Lakers, to be put 
up there with the elite teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland has the NBA's best record (28-8), but there's a vibe  
around the league that the Blazers won't seem like real title 
contenders until they beat the Lakers (25-14). 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers lead the Lakers by 4 1/2 games in the Pacific Division,  
and the two teams play their long-awaited first game against each 
other Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The same scheduling quirk that kept the teams from playing each  
other the first two months of the season could have a dramatic 
effect on the Western Conference playoff race. Portland and Los 
Angeles meet three times in the final 15 days of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you play everybody in the league, you don't know where  
you stand or where you stack up,'' said Blazers coach Mike 
Dunleavy, whose team also must play San Antonio three times in 
addition to Houston and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stretch we're getting ready to go into right now should be  
not only a big test for us, but a big preparation as far as playoff 
basketball,'' Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers and Lakers didn't exactly enter their showdown with  
a head of steam. Portland got outscored by the miserable L.A. 
Clippers 12-0 in the final 2:12 Sunday night to lose 89-83. 
Portland's lead over the Jazz for the best mark in the Western 
Conference fell to just a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Lakers faltered in the final few minutes against  
Seattle to lose 113-109, their fifth loss in nine home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't found our game yet,'' Bryant said after the loss.  
``I think that the important thing with us is that we need to find 
some consistency as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers haven't fulfilled the potential that came with the  
acquisition of Glen Rice and Dennis Rodman. Coach Kurt Rambis has 
spent much of his time answering questions about Rodman, who has 
played well despite occasionally skipping practice and refusing to 
go into games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to put it together,'' Rodman said. ``We have no choice  
but to go up. Right now we are down. We can get beat in the first 
round if we don't put it together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the skepticism of the Blazers is their recent  
track record in the playoffs. They were eliminated in the first 
round the past six years, including the last two times by the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In those two brief series, Portland's 7-foot-3 Arvydas Sabonis  
was brushed aside by the Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal. Dunleavy 
said the Blazers must find a way to cover Shaq without leaving Rice 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Bryant was asked by a radio reporter whether the  
Blazers had too big a lead on the Lakers in the standings. ``Nah, 
we'll catch 'em,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk is talk,'' Stoudamire said. ``A lot of it's going on, but  
now the game is finally here, so we can put all that to rest.''

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Memorials Draw Parallels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Most people know the 82-year-old Jewish  
cabinetmaker by the name Morris Shulman. But he has another 
identity tattooed on his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
	It reads ``124234,'' a number given to him by the Nazis.  
</P>
<P>
	Shulman, who was liberated from the Buchenwald concentration  
camp, joined other Holocaust survivors Sunday to commemorate Yom 
Hashoah or Holocaust Day, which honors victims of the genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was freed 54 years ago exactly. April 11, 1945, at about 1  
o'clock. I weighed 72 pounds,'' he said, pausing to smile. ``It's a 
joyful day. My second birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 350 others attended the event at the Simon Wiesenthal  
Center and Museum of Tolerance, near a 15-foot marble menorah and a 
memorial etched with the names of European cities whose Jewish 
populations were decimated during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Consul General Yoram Ben Ze'ev said the ceremony should  
remind Jews that they have a responsibility to aid Kosovo Albanian 
refugees who are suffering similar persecution by Yugoslavian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not allowed to be quiet,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York, some of the 2,000 who gathered at a Manhattan  
synagogue to commemorate Holocaust Day also noted that ethnic 
persecution continues in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethnic cleansing, genocide, is happening as I speak,'' said  
Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering of Jewish 
Holocaust Survivors. ``It can happen to anyone, to any group of 
people. The slaughter of Kosovo and in other places must be brought 
to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton sent a message that read in part: ``As we seek  
to learn from these tragic lessons of the past, let us resolve to 
work together to build a future where peace, tolerance and 
understanding drive away the shadows of violence, prejudice and 
ignorance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering in Los Angeles served to open an exhibit  
chronicling the life and work of 90-year-old Simon Wiesenthal, the 
famed Nazi hunter who spent 53 years tracking nearly 1,100 German 
war criminals around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York memorial was dedicated to the SS St. Louis, a ship  
that set sail from Europe 60 years ago and was denied entry by both 
Cuba and the United States. Most of the 937 refugees on board were 
Jews; they were sent back to Europe and only 240 survived the war. 
</P>
<P>
	One survivor, Judith Steel, was taken in by a French family that  
protected her for the rest of the war, but she never saw her 
parents again. 
</P>
<P>
	She said news accounts of Kosovar Albanian families being  
separated ``bring back a lot of bad stuff, a lot of sadness. It's 
unbelievable that something so atrocious could be happening almost 
at the turn of the century.''

<HEADLINE> Metal Grabbing Algae Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Algae that make metal-grabbing protein show  
promise for cleaning up toxic sediments, one of the most persistent 
problems in the Great Lakes, researchers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Batches of the single-celled ``Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' are  
being grown and genetically altered at Ohio State University, where 
scientists have successfully extracted copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, 
mercury, nickel and other metals from contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
	At another laboratory in Thunder Bay, Ontario, research is under  
way into methods for encapsulating the engineered algae for use in 
larger-scale tests and in gold mining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to give anybody the idea that we're ready to go  
out and clean everything up. ... The feasibility in the real world 
has not been proven yet,'' said Richard Sayre, the lead researcher. 
``Practical application is probably a year away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The algae at center stage in the research is cheap and common,  
Sayre said. ``It's everywhere. It grows in Antarctica, it grows in 
the ocean. It naturally grows in soils in the back yard. It's 
called the cockroach of the algae world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sayre's team, using funding from the Ohio Sea Grant marine  
research program, found that the genetically altered algae could be 
turned into heavy metal sponges, either living or freeze-dried. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, under way for the past three years, indicates that  
some metals bind to the altered algae, while other nontoxic metals 
remain in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The material will sequester 20 percent of its weight as metal,  
and there's very little interference by nontoxic metals,'' Sayre 
said. In particular, the studies found that calcium and potassium, 
which scientists want to remain in any cleaned-up waters, did not 
interfere with attempts to get cadmium to bind to the algae. 
</P>
<P>
	What might make the whole process more attractive in the  
marketplace is an ability to reverse the process. Sayre and his 
team changed the acidity level of the medium holding metal-laden 
algae, and the metal came off. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make recycling possible for metals now considered  
contaminants suitable only for disposal. It also could offer a new 
way to get at desirable metals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some discussions with gold mining companies for  
biomining gold out of ore,'' Sayre said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his collaborators, Lada Malek of Lakehead University in  
Ontario, has been working on the algae's prospects for the mining 
industry and testing whether the devices designed to move the algae 
through sediments have any impact on metal-binding capacity.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Prepares To Take Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- With Jenny Jones awaiting her turn on the  
witness stand, a counselor who treats former talk show guests 
testified today that ``The Jenny Jones Show'' refused his services 
before one guest killed another. 
</P>
<P>
	James Huysman testified in the third week of a lawsuit against  
Ms. Jones' show by the family of Scott Amedure, fatally shot by 
Jonathan Schmitz in March 1995, three days after admitting his 
crush on Schmitz when they both participated in a taping of the 
show. Their episode, on same-sex secret crushes, never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she was called as a witness, Ms. Jones is not a  
defendant in the lawsuit which names the show, its producer and 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure family attorney Geoffrey Fieger has maintained that  
``The Jenny Jones Show'' tricked the mentally troubled Schmitz into 
appearing on the episode, then negligently failed to contact him 
afterward to assess the show's effect on his emotional well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman took that a step further, suggesting that a prescreening  
before Schmitz's appearance might have detected the potential 
emotional fallout. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger asked if Schmitz was identifiable as a person ``you would  
want to screen out'' as a potential guest, and Huysman replied: 
``Clearly. There was nothing ambivalent about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And given Schmitz's mental history, Huysman added, ``I don't  
think he should have been on the air, regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was known to have been depressed and had attempted  
suicide four times since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman's Florida-based Aftercare service is meant to ensure  
that talk show guests get the guidance, counseling or 
hospitalization they may need after their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people on stage unfortunately aren't prepared for anything  
they're about to get. And worse yet, they're pretty much dropped 
afterward,'' Huysman testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Huysman testified that when he approached Ms. Jones about the  
potential need for his services, she ``was really sweet and nice'' 
but directed him to two of her show's producers. He said he never 
heard back from any of them. 
</P>
<P>
	When she testified in Schmitz's 1996 criminal trial, Ms. Jones  
denied knowing whether Schmitz had been deceived about the topic of 
the show they taped. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure's family alleges that the show was responsible for  
Amedure's death by tricking Schmitz into appearing, leading him to 
believe his admirer was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	During her 1996 testimony, Ms. Jones said she typically didn't  
know the topic of each day's show until she got a script and other 
information the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	She insisted there was no deception by not mentioning that  
Amedure and the show's other admirers were gay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The premise of the show was that it was a surprise,'' she said  
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder, but his  
conviction later was overturned because of an error in jury 
selection. His retrial is scheduled for Aug. 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Shanghai GM, General Motors Corp.'s joint  
venture with a Chinese automaker, said it began regular production 
of Buick sedans Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp.  
is the biggest foreign joint venture in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will produce about 20,000 Buicks this year  
and gradually increase annual production to 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Production through August already has been sold, Shanghai GM  
vice president Philip Murtaugh said in a prepared statement. He 
said orders had been generally in line with expectations, though 
the company got more private orders than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Private companies and individuals had been expected to account  
for 40 percent of sales, with the rest going to joint ventures, 
state companies and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanghai GM did not release detailed sales figures.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chiquita Exec Wants Case Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge is considering a request by a former  
lawyer for Chiquita to have all charges against him dismissed in 
the investigation of voice-mail theft at the banana company. 
</P>
<P>
	George Ventura filed a motion Friday in Hamilton County Common  
Pleas Court that claims prosecutors unfairly targeted him while 
ignoring other suspects and that the methods they used violated his 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, now an attorney in Salt Lake City, is accused of  
stealing voice mail from Chiquita Brands International Inc. for a 
newspaper investigation of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Ann Marie Tracey did not say when she will rule on  
Ventura's motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has pleaded innocent to five counts of unlawful  
interception of communications and five counts of unauthorized 
access to computer systems. He could get 12 1/2 years in prison if 
convicted. His trial date is scheduled for April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter relied on the  
voice mail messages in a package of stories last May by The 
Cincinnati Enquirer that accused Cincinnati-based Chiquita of 
improper dealings in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Enquirer fired Gallagher, apologized on its front  
page to Chiquita and paid the company more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to felony charges and is  
awaiting sentencing that could range from 2 1/2 years in prison to 
probation. At a court hearing last week, Gallagher identified 
Ventura as one of his confidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
	McWhirter has not been charged and now works for The Detroit  
News, another newspaper owned by Gannett Co. Inc. McWhirter has 
said he did not gain access to Chiquita's system, but got codes 
from a source and gave them to Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura argues in his motion that Gallagher and McWhirter were  
spared serious charges because they signed cooperation agreements 
with prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Fernandez On Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins right-hander Alex Fernandez, who  
has made two starts in his comeback from rotator cuff surgery, was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday because of inflammation 
in his pitching shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was examined in Birmingham, Ala., by Dr. James  
Andrews, who performed the surgery in October 1997 to repair the 
shoulder. Fernandez is expected to begin light throwing in three to 
four days and resume throwing off a mound in about a week, the 
Marlins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews indicated the setback is not unusual for a pitcher  
coming back from rotator cuff surgery, general manager Dave 
Dombrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt it was very normal,'' Dombrowski said. ``The doctor  
said there's no more structural damage. We'll wait and see, but it 
doesn't sound like it's anything of major consequence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, 29, made his second start of the season Sunday,  
allowing six hits and two runs in 4 2-3 innings in a 2-1 loss to 
Philadelphia. He won on opening day, his first game in 18 months, 
and is 1-1 with a 2.79 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than accompany the team to New York on Monday, Fernandez  
flew to Birmingham to see Andrews because of stiffness in his 
shoulder. The doctor found no damage to the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez received a cortisone shot and remained in Birmingham  
for further examination Tuesday. The Marlins are hoping he'll be 
able to rejoin the rotation when he's eligible to be activated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really won't know until he starts throwing again,''  
Dombrowski said.

<HEADLINE> 'The Hours' Wins Pulitzer Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Cunningham won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize  
for fiction on Monday for his novel ``The Hours,'' while Margaret 
Edson, a kindergarten teacher, won the drama award for her play 
``Wit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The history prize was given to ``Gotham: A History of New York  
City to 1898'' by two history professors, Edwin G. Burrows of 
Brooklyn College and Mike Wallace of John Jay College in New York. 
The biography prize went to ``Lindbergh,'' A. Scott Berg's book 
about the aviator Charles Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	The poetry prize was given to Mark Strand, a former U.S. poet  
laureate, for ``Blizzard of One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The general nonfiction prize was awarded to John McPhee for  
``Annals of the Former World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melinda Wagner won the music prize for her composition  
``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A special music citation was given posthumously to Duke  
Ellington on the centennial of his birth. The Pulitzer board said 
the award was given ``in recognition of his musical genius, which 
evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium 
of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hours,'' Cunningham's third novel, is set in New York and  
tells a complex story based on Virginia Woolf's classic ``Mrs. 
Dalloway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't expected to be celebrating,'' said Cunningham, who  
teaches creative writing at Columbia University. ``My partner, Ken 
Korbett, is my mentor and muse and first and most important reader. 
He's a clinical psychologist, and he's with a patient right now, 
and when he's done, we'll have a good cry and figure out what to do 
next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wit'' is a deliberately unsentimental look at a woman's fight  
with ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson, 37, was cleaning her kindergarten classroom at Atlanta's  
Centennial Park Elementary School when she found out she had won 
the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this play speaks to people it's because there's one thing I  
wanted to say. I wanted to say that knowledge is very good. But 
knowledge without love is a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she has no plans to leave teaching to further pursue  
playwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the middle of studying insects and nothing can take  
me away,'' she said. ``I will continue teaching. I enjoy it.''

<HEADLINE> Insurers Paid $1.85B in 1Q Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. insurance industry paid an estimated  
$1.85 billion to homeowners and businesses for losses to insured 
properties caused by five storms in the first quarter of this year, 
a trade group reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was up from the $1.1 billion paid for damages caused by 10  
storms and other catastrophic events in the first quarter of 1998, 
according to the Property Claim Services unit of the Insurance 
Services Office Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The group tracks insurance payments for catastrophes, which it  
defines as events that cause $25 million or more in insured 
property losses to a large number of policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Four winter storms in January resulted in payment of $1.8  
billion for property losses from nearly 800,000 claims. That made 
it the third-costliest January since the Property Claim Services 
unit began keeping statistics in 1949, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth storm in the Pacific Northwest in March added an  
additional $50 million in insured property losses, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	A January 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif., that caused an  
estimated $12.5 billion in damage to insured property was the most 
expensive first-quarter catastrophe ever reported by the group. The 
second most-expensive January was in 1996, when five storms and 
tornadoes caused $1.9 billion in claims.

<HEADLINE> McCall Wants To Return to the Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Former WBC heavyweight champion Oliver McCall  
wants to get back in the ring when he completes a one-year jail 
sentence for a battery and assault conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't hide from the past, I have to accept what I have been  
through and learn from my mistakes to move forward with my life,'' 
said McCall, who is scheduled to be released from a jail in 
Martinsville, Va. about May 1. ``I am resolved to the fact I have a 
great deal of work ahead of me to earn back the respect and trust 
of promoters, fighters, the athletic commissions and boxing fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued through Las Vegas-based Rogich  
Communications Group, which represents McCall's promoter, Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall knocked out Lennox Lewis for the WBC title in September  
1994, then defended the title against Larry Holmes in 1995. He lost 
the title to Frank Bruno in a 12-round decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He met Lewis again in February 1997, but stopped throwing  
punches in the middle of the third round. Referee Mills Lane halted 
the fight in the fifth round, awarding the win to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	McCall was suspended and fined by the Nevada State Athletic  
Commission for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted Oct. 14, 1997, on battery and assault charges  
involving a police officer.

<P>
	The 1999 Pulitzer Prizes for Journalism:  
</P>
<P>
	PUBLIC SERVICE   	
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper identified and analyzed patterns of reckless  
gunplay by Washington police officers who had little training or 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	In a five-day series entitled ``Deadly Force: An Investigation  
of D.C. Police Shootings,'' a team of nine reporters, editors and 
researchers showed that the police department in the nation's 
capital had shot and killed more people per resident in the 1990s 
than any other large American police force. 
</P>
<P>
	The series prompted action by city and federal officials.  
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Ramsey asked the Justice Department to  
probe a decade of police shootings to try to restore public 
confidence, and announced a sweeping retraining program for the 
entire force. 
</P>
<P>
	BREAKING NEWS REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Staff of The Hartford Courant  
</P>
<P>
	A day after a shooting rampage in which a state lottery worker  
killed four supervisors and himself, The Courant printed 13 stories 
along with 13 photographs, two diagrams, two chronologies and three 
information boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to the Pulitzer judges, Editor Brian Toolan said  
there is no ``first-day story'' anymore. When a big story breaks, 
he said, the immediate coverage should be ``deep and wide,'' while 
hitting the basic facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, he said, the newspaper recreated the panicked scene  
of the killings with a powerful front page and sharp writing. 
Readers also got personal profiles of the victims and the gunman, 
who had talked to a reporter months earlier and left a telephone 
message the day before the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Staff of The Miami Herald  
</P>
<P>
	Reporters exposed pervasive voter fraud in a mayoral election  
that was later overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive Editor Douglas Clifton said the computer-assisted  
probe is ``what newspapers are supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper documented hundreds of phony, tainted or illegal  
ballots by computer analysis and old-fashioned reporting, tracing a 
web of conspirators and linking them to a victorious mayoral 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the courts overturned the election and appointed the  
defeated candidate mayor of Miami. In addition, 26 people have been 
arrested and officials cracked down on loopholes in voting rules 
while increasing punishments for vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In its entry, the newspaper said it was following ``the most  
idealistic journalistic notion: Publish the truth, despite the 
obstacles, and society wins.'' In this case, the obstacles were a 
hostile city administration, a public campaign accusing the paper 
of ethnic bias and attempted intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	EXPLANATORY REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Richard Read, The Oregonian, in Portland, Ore.  
</P>
<P>
	In his reporting, Read vividly illustrated the domestic impact  
of the Asian economic crisis by profiling the local industry that 
exports frozen french fries. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject, while it has worldwide impact, was complex and  
often inaccessible to readers. The challenge was to explain how the 
crisis started and spread from country to country, and how it 
affected the trade network that reaches deep into the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Read decided to focus on what Oregonian Managing Editor Jack  
Hart called ``an important Northwest product that was interesting 
to the average reader and at the same time revealed the dimensions 
of Asian economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, Read wrote in a story titled ``The French Fry  
Connection,'' the lowly potato product ``targeted Asia's new middle 
class'' and was ``a surprisingly accurate yardstick of economic 
health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BEAT REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Philips and Michael Hiltzik, the Los Angeles Times  
</P>
<P>
	In stories about corruption in the entertainment industry, the  
Times reporters focused on a charity sham sponsored by the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, illegal detoxification 
programs for wealthy celebrities and a resurgence of radio payola. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times' editors said the dark side of America's most  
influential industry receives little scrutiny, even though its 
conglomerates touch every culture on every continent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times' business reporters examined the industry's richest  
awards program, the Grammys, showing that its vaunted charities 
spent far less than the stated goals toward helping struggling 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to drug use among celebrities, Philips and Hiltzik  
showed that Hollywood relied on untested therapies aimed at 
gratifying the patients' tastes and need for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the reporters probed radio conglomerates that force  
performers into free appearances and ``commissions'' to keep 
playing their music. 
</P>
<P>
	NATIONAL REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Staff of The New York Times, notably Jeff Gerth  
</P>
<P>
	A series of articles on the corporate sale of American  
technology to China, despite national security risks, disclosed 
U.S. government approval that later prompted investigations and 
significant changes in policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The first story in April 1998, by Gerth and Raymond Bonner, said  
a federal grand jury was investigating whether two aerospace 
companies had improperly shared with China crucial expertise needed 
to build better nuclear missiles. President Clinton, they said, had 
undermined the case by approving subsequent technology transfers 
over the objections of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of articles, The Times then documented how the  
Democratic Party's newest financial backers -- high-tech 
entrepreneurs -- had lobbied the administration to change the rules. 
The news prompted Congress to hold hearings, rewrite export laws 
and impose tighter controls on technology sales to China. 
</P>
<P>
	INTERNATIONAL REPORTING   	
</P>
<P>
	Staff of The Wall Street Journal  
</P>
<P>
	The Journal offered in-depth, analytical coverage of the Russian  
financial crisis, by a team of reporters in Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, when Russia was teetering at the edge of financial ruin,  
the Journal's Steve Liesman detailed the forces that would later 
push the country over the brink, including a rickety debt structure 
and an antiquated barter system. Later in the year, Moscow Bureau 
Chief Andrew Higgins outlined the economic rot that had hobbled the 
country's free-market experiment -- paradoxes such as warehouses 
full of grain alongside the threat of food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins teamed up with Liesman to reconstruct critical moments  
in Russia's seven-year transition from Marx to a market economy. 
And from Washington, correspondent Carla Anne Robbins joined 
Higgins to show how Russian's economic woes had driven its nuclear 
barons into a desperate sales drive abroad, with global security 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	FEATURE WRITING   	
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Henderson, The Wall Street Journal  
</P>
<P>
	When Detroit pharmacist Dennis Grehl shot and killed an armed  
robber who tried to hold up his shop, it was just a brief story in 
a local paper. Henderson, a senior special writer based in Detroit, 
took a closer look. He wanted to understand Grehl's act -- the 
druggist had been held up at gunpoint once before -- and trace its 
impact on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened so quickly, he was just trying to protect himself  
and his co-worker,'' Henderson said. ``It was nothing about malice 
or hatred, but afterward realizing what you've done is tough. ... I 
tried to tell the story of how these two lives collided, and how 
their lives both changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson interviewed Grehl and his drugstore colleagues and  
spent a year researching the life of the man he killed. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COMMENTARY   	
</P>
<P>
	Maureen Dowd, The New York Times  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dowd's commentary on the impact of President Clinton's  
affair with Monica Lewinsky was ``fresh and insightful,'' the 
Pulitzer judges said. Her witty, acerbic columns spared no 
participant in the impeachment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the mountain of evidence Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
delivered to Congress, Ms. Dowd wrote: ``These are not grounds for 
impeachment. These are grounds for divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of her prize, she said she was ``so grateful to  
President Clinton that he never spoke the words, `Young lady, pull 
down that jacket and get back to the typing pool.''' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the award vindicated reporters who stayed with the  
impeachment story even when the public grew tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three branches of government were brought to a screeching  
halt, so it was hard to ignore that,'' she said. ``The Pulitzers 
kind of sent a message to presidents and politicians that if 
there's a damaging incident and they say they're going to put out 
the truth ... that they ignore doing that at their own peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CRITICISM   	
</P>
<P>
	Blair Kamin, the Chicago Tribune  
</P>
<P>
	Kamin produced ``lucid coverage'' of Chicago's architecture,  
particularly in a six-part series on the development of the city's 
lakefront area, the Pulitzer judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reinventing the Lakefront'' described the city's failure to  
explore the area's potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were beaches that were allowed to disappear beneath the  
waves, mile after mile of crumbling sea walls, and -- most troubling 
-- a shameful disparity between the lakefront for affluent whites 
and the lakefront for poor blacks,'' Tribune Managing Editor Ann 
Marie Lipinski wrote in a nominating letter. 
</P>
<P>
	After Kamin's series ran, the Chicago Park District began work  
on a development plan for six miles of shoreline and promised to do 
more. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	EDITORIAL WRITING   	
</P>
<P>
	Editorial board of the Daily News, in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper campaigned to rescue the landmark Apollo Theatre  
in Harlem from mismanagement that threatened its survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apollo once showcased artists like Pearl Bailey, Ella  
Fitzgerald, James Brown, Sarah Vaughan, Gladys Knight and the 
Jackson Five. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first of 14 editorials that ran in 1998, the Daily News  
wrote: ``Today the Apollo's grand legacy has been reduced to a 
faded mural in the lobby. The 1,400-seat auditorium is empty 
virtually six nights out of seven. ... Luck has not smiled on the 
Apollo in decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pieces lambasted a lucrative contract for the television  
program ``It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' which was given to a 
friend of the theater's board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	After the editorials began running, the state attorney general  
sued, seeking the removal of the Apollo's board of directors; the 
investigation is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	EDITORIAL CARTOONING   	
</P>
<P>
	David Horsey, Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
</P>
<P>
	Horsey submitted 20 cartoons covering a range of topics, but wry  
reflections on President Clinton's personal problems dominated the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	One cartoon, ``Beltway Apocalypse,'' shows ``Mount Monica''  
erupting in a chaotic capital. Another, on the 1998 elections, 
depicts Clinton as Peter Pan -- ``Maybe I really do never have to 
grow up!'' -- with Newt Gingrich as an exasperated Captain Hook and 
Ms. Lewinsky as Tinkerbell. Yet another had Clinton asking his wife 
and daughter if it would help if he said he could feel their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a year every cartoonist in the country did great  
cartoons because it was so easy,'' Horsey said. ``The 
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal produced instant laughs for everybody, and 
so I think the trick was to ... do something that had a little more 
profundity to it, a little sharper and a little deeper, beyond the 
obvious jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPOT NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY   	
</P>
<P>
	The staff of The Associated Press  
</P>
<P>
	The AP's portfolio of photographs on the embassy bombings in  
Kenya and Tanzania illustrated ``both the horror and the humanity 
triggered by the event,'' the Pulitzer judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Marc Bouju's winning image showed horrified Kenyans filing  
through the Nairobi city morgue trying to identify the bodies of

	Michael Cunningham, ``The Hours.''  
</P>
<P>
	Author of four novels, Cunningham, 46, won for his book inspired  
partly by Virginia Woolf and her modernist classic ``Mrs. 
Dalloway.'' Cunningham moves across place and time to imagine the 
lives of Woolf in 1920s London, a pregnant woman in 1940s Los 
Angeles and a woman in contemporary New York who knows a poet dying 
of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham grew up in Los Angeles and wanted to be a painter  
before taking up writing at Stanford University. He received a 
master's degree from the University of Iowa's prestigious writers' 
workshop. He teaches creative writing at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham is no fan of his first novel, ``Golden State,'' which  
was published in 1984 but isn't even listed on the inside jacket of 
``The Hours.'' His other two novels are ``A Home at the End of the 
World'' and ``Flesh and Blood.''

	SPECIAL CITATION   	
</P>
<P>
	Duke Ellington  
</P>
<P>
	Edward Kennedy ``Duke'' Ellington was a composer, band leader,  
pianist and showman who created an extraordinary volume of music. 
His works included jazz and popular songs that became standards 
(``Sophisticated Lady,'' ``Mood Indigo''), sacred songs, a ballet 
score, the opera ``Queenie Pie'' and many orchestral tone poems. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellington was born in Washington, D.C., on April 29, 1899, and  
died in New York on May 24, 1974. He studied piano as a child and 
put together groups to play for dances during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the 1920s, '30s and '40s, he was a huge star,  
debuting major compositions at Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan 
Opera House in the 1940s and '50s. With ``Anatomy of a Murder'' in 
1959, he became the first black composer to write and receive a 
credit for a soundtrack for a major Hollywood film. He also 
composed for television. 
</P>
<P>
	His orchestra still tours, led by his grandson, Paul Ellington.

<P>
	The acclaimed author spent two years on the road with  
geologists, studying the landscape of North America from 1978-79 
for his book. 
</P>
<P>
	McPhee, 68, thought he could write the book all at once, but the  
project became too mammoth. He began writing the first of five 
segments in 1980 and put them together by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Friend and former student Jim Kelly, deputy managing editor of  
Time magazine, said McPhee ``wrote about the earth though the 
characters who studied it. He tells the story through them.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Set To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ready or not, Larry Walker is coming off the  
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, still troubled by a strained rib muscle, took live  
batting practice for the first time in two weeks Monday and planned 
to return to the Colorado Rockies' lineup Wednesday against the San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he had six batting practice homers, Walker's body  
language indicated the muscle still ached. He dodged direct 
questions about lingering pain but admitted he doesn't know what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I could make it worse,'' he said. ``I don't think  
going out there and playing is going to make it better. I don't 
know. If it gets worse or not, we'll find out. I'm going to go play 
and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the NL batting champion and 1997 league MVP, strained a  
muscle in his right rib cage while hitting a home run during 
batting practice on March 30. He is eligible to come off the 15-day 
disabled list Tuesday, but the Rockies have an off day. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has struggled offensively without Walker, scoring 22  
runs through the first six games and only 14 in the last five. 
</P>
<P>
	Because manager Jim Leyland likes to keep his lineup consistent,  
he filled Walker's No. 3 spot in the batting order with Lenny 
Harris, Pat Watkins and Angel Echevarria. The trio was 2-for-23 as 
starters before Monday.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Fla. Electrocution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An unlicensed electrician who installed lighting at  
a bus stop shelter where a 12-year-old boy was electrocuted was 
charged with manslaughter Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Garcia, 39, was charged with causing the death of Jorge  
Luis Cabrera, who was electrocuted when he stepped on an electrical 
conduit pipe at the bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Also charged with manslaughter was Eller Media Co., the Phoenix  
company that hired Garcia to install safety lighting at the bus 
stop, and Frederick Neville, Garcia's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the October death was the result of incorrect  
wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	But a defense lawyer said it is possible that a faulty light  
pole allowed wiring to become damaged during an electrical storm, 
causing a short-circuit.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A helicopter carrying a seven-member  
Ecuadorean military mapping team crashed in a stretch of Amazon

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The colonel who led Nicaragua's State  
Security Office under the leftist Sandinista administration is 
coming out of retirement to help the former rebels campaign in 
upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenin Cerna, 50, announced Sunday he would resume his work with  
the Sandinista National Liberation Front political party ahead of 
the 2001 presidential and congressional elections. He will also 
help with mayoral races in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerna had left political life after the Sandinistas lost power  
in 1990 elections. He retired from the Nicaraguan army last month. 
</P>
<P>
	During his term as president of the security office, Cerna was  
the target of several complaints of human rights violations. 
President Arnoldo Aleman said last month he was tortured by Cerna 
and other Sandinista leaders while imprisoned in the early 1980s.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican prosecutors  
on Monday ordered investigators to exhume the body of a television 
producer who died after undergoing cosmetic surgery at a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Television producer Isabel Vargas, 49, died April 3 after  
undergoing liposuction at the Bellas Artes clinic in Santo Domingo. 
Prosecutor Francisco Dominguez Brito said she was the fourth woman 
to die after operations by surgeon Edgar Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas' family initially failed to tell prosecutors about her  
death, saying it was a private matter. Vargas and Contreras were 
friends, and Vargas helped the doctor with his public relations 
campaign after the death of a U.S. patient, Dhelmalyz Rios Rivera, 
on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras' brother and partner in the clinic, Frank Contreras,  
was convicted in Puerto Rico on charges of practicing medicine 
there illegally and is a fugitive from a 14-year prison sentence.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de  
Soto vigorously criticized a top U.S. human rights official on 
Monday for accusing Colombia's military of having sponsored 
right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh used ``unfair terms''  
during a weekend conference on human rights in Medellin, the 
country's second-largest city, said Fernandez de Soto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unacceptable ... to describe the Colombian security  
forces as one more agent of the violence plaguing the country, 
putting them on an equal footing with the armed insurgency, 
paramilitary groups and drug traffickers,'' Fernandez de Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to the conference, Koh said government security  
forces had committed ``extrajudicial killings, disappearances and 
massive internal displacement in the name of combating 
paramilitaries and guerrillas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling a news conference several hours after the government  
issued its protest, Koh said he had met with angry defense 
officials on Monday and came away convinced that the military ``is 
now committed to ending human rights abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we're ready to move forward in a cooperative  
framework,'' Koh said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military aid to Colombia is restricted by law to  
anti-narcotics operations, in large part due to concerns about 
links between the army and violent paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's military leaders insist they have severed such ties.

<HEADLINE> Former Boeing CEO Wilson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Former Boeing chairman and chief executive  
officer Thornton Arnold ``T'' Wilson, credited with developing and 
producing the Boeing 757 and 767 jetliners, has died at his winter 
home in Palm Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 78, died in his sleep and was found by family members  
Saturday morning, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said Monday. The 
cause of his death was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened about the passing of a truly great  
business leader and a visionary human being,'' said current Boeing 
chairman and CEO Phil Condit. ``Few men were more closely linked to 
Boeing's success and the global aerospace industry than 'T' 
Wilson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson joined Boeing in 1943 as an engineer. He became company  
president in 1968, chief executive officer in 1969 and chairman in 
1972. He retired as CEO until 1986 and as board chairman in 1987, 
though he served as board chairman emeritus until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wilson's leadership, Boeing introduced the 747 and  
subsequently developed and produced the 757 and 767, establishing 
the company as the world's leading supplier of commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Sikeston, Mo., on Feb. 8, 1921, Wilson joined Boeing  
after earning a degree in aeronautical engineering at Iowa State. 
He earned his master's degree at California Institute of Technology 
in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson first made his mark with Boeing on the B-47 swept-wing  
bomber. He later was project engineer for the B-52 bomber program 
and then led the proposal team that won Boeing the Minuteman 
intercontinental ballistic missile program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson was elected company vice president in 1963 and in 1964  
was put in charge of operations and planning for corporate 
headquarters. Two years later, he was named executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his numerous awards was the Wright Brothers Trophy in 1979  
for ``significant public service of enduring value to aviation in 
the United States.'' He and Boeing won the 1982 Collier Trophy for 
the private development of the 757 and 767. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson won a place in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in  
1982, and was inducted into the National Business Hall of Fame in 
1989. He was a life member of the Corporation of Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, where he was a Sloan fellow in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is survived by his wife, Grace Miller Wilson; their three  
children, Thornton A. Wilson III, Daniel Wilson and Sarah 
Parkinson; and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson and his wife had long resided in Normandy Park, south of  
Seattle.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Andy Pettitte appears ready to rejoin the  
New York Yankees, and hopes to pitch Saturday at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander, on the disabled list because of a strained  
muscle in his elbow, struck out eight in five shutout innings in a 
Class A game Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recommendation would be he is ready,'' Yankees director of  
player personnel Billy Connors said. ``He hit 89 (miles an hour) 
tonight and his pitches were real crisp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for the Tampa Yankees against the Sarasota Red Sox in  
the Florida State League, Pettitte gave up four hits and walked 
two. He threw 81 pitches, 53 for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel like I'm ready,'' Pettitte said. ``I felt good with  
everything tonight and that was really want I was looking for. 
Everything was real sharp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston first baseman Reggie Jefferson, on a minor league rehab  
stint, went 1-for-2 against Pettitte. Jefferson struck out in the 
first inning and hit an opposite-field double in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte reported no problems with his elbow or right ankle,  
which he slightly sprained on April 6 during an agility drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte worked just one inning against major leaguers during  
spring training, departing his debut on March 7 after seven 
pitches. In his last three starts in spring training minor league 
or simulated games, Pettitte threw 8 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three seasons, Pettitte has an American League-best  
55 wins, one behind Atlanta's John Smoltz for most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Darryl Strawberry returned to the Yankees' minor league  
facility in Tampa on Monday to continue his comeback from colon 
cancer surgery and lingering knee problems. Both Strawberry and 
Pettitte were at Yankee Stadium on Sunday to receive their World 
Series rings. Strawberry, who took batting practice and went 
through agility drills, will start taking fly balls later this 
week. ``In a couple weeks I should be ready to go,'' Strawberry 
said. He is scheduled to join Triple-A Columbus after completing 
his Florida workouts. ... Jefferson is scheduled to join Triple-A 
Pawtucket on Tuesday after playing three games with Sarasota. A 
back injury limited Jefferson to just 62 games last season ... 
Yankees minor league catcher Jaime Torres, who underwent thyroid 
cancer surgery last month, has resumed full on-the-field workouts.

``Fiddler on the Roof,'' has left his personal archives to the New 
York Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
	The library's performing arts section at Lincoln Center will  
make the documents part of its dance collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins ``was one of the great American artists of the past half  
century. We are deeply honored to receive his collection,'' said 
library President Paul LeClerc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robbins collection includes books, photographs, videos and  
artwork, as well as manuscripts, scrapbooks, notes and scripts that 
offer a glimpse into the artist's creative mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins died in July at 79.

<HEADLINE> Justice, CIA Probe Ex-Chief Deutch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA technicians found 31 secret files in the  
unsecured personal computer at the home of the former Director John 
Deutch shortly after he stepped down as the nation's top spy, it 
was reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Intelligence Agency turned the case over to the  
Justice Department, which investigated for a year before deciding 
not to file charges, Newsweek magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department returned the case to the CIA, which  
Newsweek said was preparing a critical report and considering 
revocation of Deutch's security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency spokesman Bill Harlow said he was familiar with the  
Newsweek story but could not comment. The newsmagazine said Deutch 
would not comment, and a call to his Massachusetts home was not 
returned immediately Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting Justice Department sources, the magazine said Deutch's  
mishandling of classified material came to light shortly after he 
resigned in December 1996. He was to continue as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency technicians went to his home for a routine check to  
ensure CIA procedures were being followed to protect secrets, 
Newsweek said in its issue appearing on newsstands Monday. They 
found 31 classified national security documents on his personal 
computer, even though he had a secure agency computer at home, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Justice Department investigation, Deutch was  
reappointed to a federal panel that studies how to combat 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and was given top 
security clearances, Newsweek said.

<HEADLINE>  9 Killed in Train Bombing in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRDELICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The smell of burned flesh lingered  
Monday as rescue workers used fire hoses and axes to pull charred 
bodies from the crumpled skeleton of an incinerated train, the 
aftermath of what Yugoslav authorities said was a NATO airstike. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb officials said at least nine people aboard the passenger  
train were killed and 16 injured when a NATO warplane bombed it. 
The private news agency Beta said a 10th body was found later and 
that officials feared the toll would rise even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies said the train was not deliberately targeted, but  
acknowledged it may have been accidentally hit during an airstrike 
on a railway bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were moaning, screaming for help,'' the state news  
agency Tanjug quoted one of the first rescuers, Dr. Tomislav 
Cvetanovic, as saying. ``Those unharmed managed to climb out of the 
smashed train windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger train coming from Belgrade was bound for the town  
of Ristovac on the Greek border, on the main Belgrade-Salonika 
route, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the first bomb, I ducked for cover. Then there were  
three more,'' said Dragan Mladenovic, a witness who spoke to 
reporters bused to the scene by the Yugoslav army. ``I stood up, 
and I saw a man with his arm chopped off, and I saw ... a dead 
body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two coaches were on the track and two were off the track, all  
four smashed and burned. The partly wrecked engine remained on the 
track. The bridge itself was severely damaged, with rails torn up. 
</P>
<P>
	Police at the scene said one body was apparently swept away by  
the river below. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered body parts, including arms, were found 20 to 30 yards  
from the train. What appeared to be missile parts were mixed with 
other pieces of wreckage thrown 150 yards from the point of impact. 
Nearby houses were slightly damaged, with broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgium, NATO said it hit a rail bridge considered to be an  
important military supply line, adding that ``incoming military 
reports indicate there was a train on or near the bridge at the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Regrettably, we cannot exclude the possibility of casualties  
in this instance,'' a statment said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it had taken ``extraordinary measures to avoid  
collateral casualties'' during the air campaign to force Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a cease-fire in Kosovo and 
to curtail his expulsions of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and witnesses from the nearby village of Grdelica  
said the strike came shortly before noon, when the bridge was 
blasted by four missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Injured passengers told Associated Press Television News from  
their hospital beds that there was no time to react. ``It just 
flashed and we were hit, there is no chance that one can run for 
cover and hide,'' said a woman, her head bandaged and face bloody. 
</P>
<P>
	Mladenovic said it was the second NATO attack on the bridge.  
Four days ago, he heard booms and saw points of impact a few 
hundred yards away from Monday's target. 
</P>
<P>
	``With anger we open a new page in railway history, written with  
the blood of innocent people killed by NATO,'' said Svetolik 
Kostadinovic, Yugoslavia's railways director. ``They strike 
civilian passengers. ... They want to create panic and to 
discourage us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials have said 300 civilians have been killed and  
3,000 injured since NATO's bombing campaign began March 24. There 
was no way to independently verify the figures and no details on 
military casualties have been released.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Worker Trapped Above Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A construction worker was trapped Monday on top  
of a burning crane above a raging fire at an old mill that was 
being converted to apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters made a desperate appeal for aircraft to try to  
pluck him from his perilous position. At least one chopper tried to 
swoop in, but flew away when the flames got too close. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, who was not identified, crawled to the end of the  
crane's horizontal arm to get away from the black smoke and flames 
rising from the five-story red brick building. He seemed calm and 
alert as he lay on his belly, the crane swaying in winds that 
gusted above 20 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke and flame could be seen at the center of the crane, about  
20 feet from where he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters said they had no way of getting someone above him  
to rappel down and grab him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the (rappelling) equipment, we just need a helicopter  
to lift the guy off the crane,'' said Fire Department spokeswoman 
Connie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on how the fire started or what the  
man was doing on the crane. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters aimed hoses at the flames, but Ms. Smith said they  
were more concerned with rescuing the worker than with putting the 
fire out.

<HEADLINE> House Backs Air Insurance Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Monday to extend a program  
that provides insurance for commercial airlines flying into 
high-risk areas, such as countries at war. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial insurance companies often do not provide this type of  
insurance even though these types of flights sometimes are required 
to ``further the foreign policy or national security interests of 
the United States,'' said a statement released by the House 
Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, passed 349-44, the Federal Aviation  
Administration would continue to insure aircraft that are 
considered necessary to U.S. foreign policy interests when 
commercial insurance is unavailable at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the program, the government would have to buy aircraft,  
``which would cost the taxpayers million of dollars, if not 
billions,'' Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was used during the Persian Gulf War when commercial  
flights were used to carry troops and supplies to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a similar bill in March.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Child-Care Centers Found Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two in three child care facilities surveyed by  
a federal consumer safety agency had safety hazards that put 
children at risk. The problems ranged from playgrounds without 
proper padding to loops on window blind cords. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission surveyed 220 facilities,  
including centers run by the federal government, for-profit and 
nonprofit companies, along with private homes that provide child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was released Monday by first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who visited a local child care center to highlight 
parents' troubles with child care and to advocate more federal 
money to help parents pay for care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey looked for eight hazards that relate to the products  
regulated by the commission. States are responsible for regulating 
the safety of child care centers, and these particular hazards may 
not be barred by law in many states. But the commission hopes to 
alert parents and centers to the potential dangers, said spokesman 
Russ Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a 'gotcha' situation where we're saying these  
child care providers are bad,'' Rader said. ``We're simply pointing 
out some safety areas where even the best parents or child care 
providers may not be aware there's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission works with manufacturers to correct these  
problems but wants parents and child care providers to look for 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the facilities surveyed had at least one of the  
eight hazards. Specifically, the survey found: 
</P>
<P>
	--At four in 10 facilities, children were wearing clothing with  
drawstrings around their necks, which can catch on objects and 
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four centers had loops on window blind cords that can  
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four did not have safe playground surfacing, meaning if  
children fall off playground equipment they could be seriously 
injured when hitting a hard surface. Grass, for instance, is too 
hard a surface. Each year, there are 90,000 playground-related 
injuries each year to children under age 6, many of which involve 
falls, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in five facilities had cribs with soft bedding, which can  
suffocate infants. Each year, up to 900 babies who die from Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome may have suffocated on soft bedding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Child safety gates were not used where needed at 13 percent of  
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers surveyed were randomly selected but not necessarily  
reflective of the nation as a whole, Rader said.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Money Flowing Freely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The end of the world is coming: Y2K. Or maybe  
it's not coming; perhaps the year 2000 will be one long, 
bacchanalian blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, all major credit cards will be accepted.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the calendars turn from 1999 to 2000, countless cash  
registers will ring in the new year as America -- in the proud 
tradition of the Bicentennial and the Atlanta Olympics -- converts 
Y2K into Y2Ka-ching!!! 
</P>
<P>
	Who's getting a piece of the action?  
</P>
<P>
	--Survivalists: Make your own electricity with the Wingen 2000!  
Purchase your very own water purifier! Get a year's worth of TVP 
(textured vegetable protein) meals! The ``apocalypse soon'' crowd -- 
those who believe life as we know it will screech to a halt at 
12:01 a.m., Jan. 1, 2000 -- have a wide variety of products to 
sample. 
</P>
<P>
	--Entrepreneurs: The words ``Year 2000'' have been trademarked,  
along with the numbers ``01-01-00.'' Expect plenty of items 
festooned with both logos. The market is already filling with items 
from $6 key rings to $24.95 countdown clocks to $99 millennial 
champagne flutes to $250 bomber jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Publishers and producers: There are enough Y2K books to fill a  
small library, with a similar number of videotapes. Among the 
millennium's stars on tape: televangelists Pat Robertson and Jerry 
Falwell. 
</P>
<P>
	--Artists (or at least the Artist formerly known as Prince):  
Peeved that his former label, Warner Bros., would reap the 
financial benefits of his prescient ``1999,'' the Artist has redone 
the tune for his own label (and wallet). 
</P>
<P>
	Is there a market for this vast array of products, all linked by  
a single tick of the clock? Absolutely, says professor David 
Wachspress, head of the school of management at the New Jersey 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hype, and hype sells,'' Wachspress maintains.  
``People can make money, and people will capitalize... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the clock is tick, tick, ticking. Even the most ardent  
investors acknowledge that its stretches, at best, through December 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That, they hope, should be long enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the single largest event in our lives,''  
promises businessman Bob Guberman, who spent a small fortune 
purchasing the worldwide trademark for ``Year 2000.'' ``We will 
never go through anything like this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Guberman, we will not go through it without ``Year  
2000'' lapel pins, and baseball caps, and playing cards, and 
prepaid phone cards. His ``Year 2000'' casino chips will soon be 
arriving in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. He has more than 3.6 
million pieces of product now ready for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	He would rather not discuss sales figures. But if he doesn't  
turn a profit, he says, ``have me committed. You can visit me once 
a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his competitors, Kenneth H. Walker, says he expects to  
sell $60 million worth of stuff with the ``01-01-00'' logo. 
</P>
<P>
	The folks who brought you ``Monica's Story'' are grabbing a  
piece of the action, too. America's publishers have provided 
endless riffs on the impact of the approaching century. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Y2K-impaired: ``Mongo's Y2K Survival Plan for the  
Complete Idiot!'' Just $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fatalist: ``Y2K: It's Already Too Late.'' (So why spend  
$29.97 on this book?) 
</P>
<P>
	For the religious: ``Y2K Equals 666'' ($7.96 at amazon.com).  
Could this mean another sequel to ``The Omen''? 
</P>
<P>
	There's a Y2K poster-calendar ($3.95), and ``The Y2K Citizen's  
Action Guide'' ($4.95), and the understated, ``Panic Now! The Y2K 
Millennium Bug Will Affect You!'' ($17.95). 
</P>
<P>
	The panic mode is higher than you might think. Ace Hardware,  
with 5,100 stores nationwide, can't fill any more orders for 
gas-powered generators, according to a spokeswoman. Y2K products 
were expected to be the main topic at its annual May convention. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Y2K preparedness convention in Mesquite, Texas, a man  
selling 10-gallon buckets of grain to soccer moms for $50 a pop 
unloaded two tractor-trailers in an afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were packing those minivans,'' says Tim Wilson, publisher  
of the biweekly Y2K magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	What motivates such purchases? ``When people first hear the Y2K  
thing, they get a little crazy,'' Wilson explains. ``Our magazine 
encourages them to take a few deep breaths and count to 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Y2K trade comes from those who opt to act, not  
count. A Montana-based company, Supplies4Y2K, offers 12-month food 
packages ($1,299, includes the book ``Cookin' With Home Storage''); 
water purifiers ($345 for the PureFlow 2000); nonhybrid seeds ($60 
for 26 proven vegetable varieties); a Solar-Hand Crank 
Radio-Flashlight (currently available as part of a special $1,595 
survivalist package). 
</P>
<P>
	Folks are lining up around the block for a shot at this stuff,  
says Supplies4Y2K president Bo Mauiri. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauiri was working as a corporate headhunter when he decided to  
open his Internet business in April 1998. Within four months, he 
quit his job to peddle Y2K products exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, he received ``three or four calls a week,'' he  
recalls. ``Now it's hundreds every day.'' The Web site went from no 
more than 10 hits daily, to thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	How much money is Mauiri making? ``My goal is just to make  
enough to have my own food supply after Y2K,'' he says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	One clue about cash flow: Publisher Wilson cautions that  
potential buyers already face a six-month delivery delay due to 
back orders at many such companies. But that doesn't stop ads 
encouraging people to prepare immediately: 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Why not burn your money wisely?'' asks the Sonlight Candle  
Co., which offers a case of 12 long-burning candles for $68.15. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Is your family Y2K prepared?'' wonders the Long Life Food  
Depot of Richmond, Ind. Their specialty: MREs, or meals ready to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Free Shipping!'' promises Preparedness Plus which, besides  
the meat substitute TVP, offers lots of beans, apparently the 
official vegetable of Y2K: garbanzo, black-eyed, kidney, navy, soy 
and -- are you listening, kids? -- lima beans. 
</P>
<P>
	But the list of moneymakers on the edge of the apocalypse  
doesn't end there. 
</P>
<P>
	Propane gas dealers?  
</P>
<P>
	Ka-ching!  
</P>
<P>
	Computer programmers?  
</P>
<P>
	Ka-ching!  
</P>
<P>
	T-shirt makers?  
</P>
<P>
	Ka-ching!  
</P>
<P>
	Escaping the mania is no simple task. Sitting at his desk in  
Brooklyn, Arthur Barry, owner of Presto Galaxy Suction Cups Inc., 
answers the phone. It's another salesman, making another cold call, 
promising a remedy for all the ills possible from the arrival of 
Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suction Cup King is amused.  
</P>
<P>
	``What Y2K?'' he asks. ``I make suction cups.''

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Maury White, a national award-winning  
sports columnist for The Des Moines Register whose folksy-style

</P>
<P>
	White, who had a stroke on Friday, died Sunday at a Des Moines

</P>
<P>
	White had a national reputation as a gifted writer, but was  
always comfortable covering sports in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Columns that began with ``A Little Bit about a Lot of Things,''  
would be peppered with words of wisdom from My Neighbor Walt and 
``Argo B. Arlo, an acquaintance.'' Another popular feature was the 
recurring use of a photo with Toby Wing, an obscure blond B-movie 
actress from the 1930s.

	White's career at the Register began in 1940, when he was a star  
in football and baseball at Drake University and sports editor of 
the school paper. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Students Protest Diploma Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some soon-to-be graduates are complaining that  
their expected sheepskins are being replaced with cheapskins. 
</P>
<P>
	At this spring's graduation, Georgia State University won't be  
handing out the traditional large, professionally engraved diplomas 
on heavy parchment. Instead, graduates will get smaller diplomas 
printed on lighter linen paper, with some of the printing done on a 
laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to call it a diploma. It has the quality of a world's  
greatest golfer certificate,'' said William G. Esslinger, a 
third-year law student. 
</P>
<P>
	The old diplomas measured 14 by 17 inches and were  
professionally printed in raised, engraved letters. The new 
diplomas are 11 by 14, the graduates' names are smaller, the 
letters are lighter and fewer words are in raised ink. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not suitable for framing,'' Esslinger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Georgia State, a school of about 22,000 students in downtown  
Atlanta, isn't the only one changing diplomas to save money. About 
500 colleges and universities nationwide -- among the country's more 
than 2,000 -- have made similar changes in the past few years, 
according to Cincinnati-based Scrip-Safe, which markets software 
that schools can use to print their own diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's getting away from tradition at all. It's  
embracing more current technology,'' said Teri Childers of 
Scrip-Safe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, while the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
considered a similar change in 1995, it decided to stick with the 
so-called sheepskin quality diploma after students voiced strong 
dislike of a lighter-weight sample. Registrar David Lanier says he 
won't bring up the idea again, although it would save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not like the idea that it was not an engraved  
diploma,'' he said. ``On the day they pick it up, they want to be 
able to run their fingers across it and feel those engraved 
letters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia State officials said that under the old system they had  
to send out graduation information to a printer months in advance, 
leaving them unable to update the diplomas with honors recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the school was throwing away up to 40 percent of  
diplomas because many students eventually failed to meet graduation 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomas now come to Georgia State with partial engraving,  
on the seal, university name and most of the text. The student's 
name, college, degree information and honors are then added by 
computer and a laser printer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1,500 graduates of Georgia State received the new  
diplomas last December, said Evelyn Babey, assistant vice president 
of enrollment services. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only recently that hundreds of students -- mostly law  
school and graduate students -- began to protest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia State is reconsidering some of the changes, but it is  
sticking with the linen paper and overall design. It will decide 
this week whether to increase the size, which would mean buying 
additional equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another school, North Carolina State University, has received no  
complaints since switching to computer printing two years ago, said 
registrar Martha Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell (the difference) unless you put them side by  
side and get nitty gritty with details,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Should We Subsidize Ballparks? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Since 1989, taxpayers have poured $5.2 billion  
into subsidies for major league ballparks, stadiums and arenas, and 
if planned projects pan out they'll add $9 billion to the total. 
</P>
<P>
	It is among the more amazing, contrary and even contradictory  
traits of the times, when taxpayers otherwise are dutifully paring 
the welfare rolls and rebelling against new taxes of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
	For some reason, they make an exception to corporate welfare, as  
in building stadiums for well-to-do team owners who provide huge 
incomes to employees and regularly raise ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a way of looking at the situation, which is what Raymond  
Keating does in his just published report, ``Sports Pork: The 
Costly Relationship between Major League Sports and Government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While taxpayers are paying two-thirds of the expenses, says  
Keating, ``the lone beneficiaries of sports subsidies are team 
owners and players.'' Community benefits, he says, are nil. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, a fan, is also a professional economist -- he is chief  
economist of the Small Business Survival Committee, a 
small-business advocacy group -- and a fellow disconcerted by team 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	He observes that while owners and players benefit, the latter  
often by eight-digit annual incomes, taxpayers often receive little 
but increases in the price of tickets, food and drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is actually added to the area's economy,'' he says in  
his report, published by the free-market Cato Institute. Instead, 
he says, ``leisure spending is merely shifted around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This view, as you might understand, is vigorously countered by  
stadium advocates, who present analyses showing significant gains 
for the local economy. Experience, he says, shows differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he says, what quite likely can occur is higher taxes  
and government making decisions without marketplace restraints. 
And, perhaps, even higher ticket prices to pay higher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected officials and taxpayers contend that a major league team  
in any sport shines up the image of a city. Only big-time cities 
have big league teams. Big things happen in big league cities. 
</P>
<P>
	A big league team, it is argued, brings attention and publicity  
to a municipality that no amount of paid advertising could buy. And 
in various other ways it pays off in a stronger economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating not only disagrees but suggests it's the other way  
round. The municipality, he argues, provides the high-paying TV 
infrastructure and audience, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Why then are subsidized stadiums regularly provided? Rabid fans  
and politicians fascinated by the glitz, he says. Neither, he says, 
wants to look at the economic facts. 
</P>
<P>
	He maintains that when the public is allowed full voice on  
subsidies the feedback is mixed. He says that while proponents are 
often better organized than opponents, votes are generally close. 
</P>
<P>
	His conclusion: ``A step in the right direction would be a  
measure requiring voters to approve any government subsidy for 
professional sports.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Confident in Y2K Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Convair Three-Niner approaches the runway at  
Denver International Airport, and also an imaginary boundary: the 
dreaded start of Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	It is moments before midnight, in a crucial test of the Federal  
Aviation Administration's computer system. The clocks in the 
airport control center are about to turn from Dec. 31, 1999, to 
Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The controller calls out, ``Time is one minute prior to entering  
the new millennium in our test systems. How do you read this 
transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the Convair replies: ``Loud and clear, and if we  
disappear off the screen, it means we went into the next 
millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A minute later, after the clocks hit Jan. 1, 2000, and the plane  
remains a radar blip on approach to Runway 16, the controller calls 
back, ``You are now flying in the Year 2000 in our test system. How 
do you read this transmission?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reply: ``It's loud and clear. It went right through the  
sound barrier very nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So it went late Saturday and early Sunday, as the FAA tested its  
Y2K computer fixes. Checked were systems that control radar screens 
and radio transmissions, ground traffic, airport weather reports 
and the status of landing lights and remote radio beacons. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines also was on hand, testing its own Y2K fixes. The  
carrier, the nation's largest, beamed imaginary Year 2000 flight 
plans from its headquarters in Chicago to Gate B-41 at Denver 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials held a dress rehearsal March 27 and conducted  
lesser drills on three other occasions. But the weekend test was 
the first one open to reporters. It was intended to bolster public 
confidence in the nation's aviation system as the century crossover 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Official results will be released Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey, who stayed up well past 2 a.m. to  
watch the four-hour test, was pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite honestly, you had to watch the clock to be aware it was  
changing,'' Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Long, head of the FAA's Y2K program, told agency workers  
before the test: ``Our success will be gauged by the fact that 
nothing will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the way many older computers are programmed, some  
software interprets years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 
1999. The concern is that unless software is modified, computers in 
various industries will malfunction when the calendar changes from 
``99'' to ``00,'' which may be interpreted as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a special concern in aviation, where computers track  
airplanes from takeoff to landing. Some travelers have sworn off 
flying as Dec. 31, 1999, turns to Jan. 1, 2000, fearing planes may 
collide or fall out of the sky because of computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those on hand for this weekend's test was Kenneth Mead,  
inspector general of the Transportation Department. In the past, he 
has been critical about the FAA's preparation for the Year 2000 
changeover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to a year ago, I have a much higher confidence  
level,'' Mead said after the test. ``My guess is that a lot of 
attention will shift to airport readiness, international readiness, 
to smaller entities in the air carrier business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mead said he is concerned that parts of Eastern Europe, Africa  
and Asia are not adequately preparing their computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably fly on January 1 in U.S. airspace,'' Mead said,  
``but I'm not going to fly in foreign airspace where there are 
these unknowns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, the State Department is expected to release a list of  
countries it suggests avoiding around New Year's because of air 
control computer questions.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Acquitted on One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal thwarted Kenneth Starr  
once again Monday as a jury acquitted her of obstructing the 
independent counsel's Whitewater inquiry and deadlocked on two 
other charges, causing a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little numb,'' a jubilant Mrs. McDougal said  
outside the courthouse. ``I've been indicted since 1993, and this 
is the first day I haven't been indicted in years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was ``pleased to learn'' that his former  
Whitewater business partner was acquitted of obstruction of 
justice, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``He wishes all 
the best for her and her family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's legal troubles may not be over, however.  
Prosecutor Mark Barrett said Starr anticipated making a decision 
this week on whether to seek a retrial of the two criminal contempt 
charges stemming from her refusal to answer grand jury questions in 
1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a notorious case of someone basically being warned  
time and again and simply not answering questions,'' said Barrett. 
``I make no apologies for bringing this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deadlocked 7-5 in favor of acquittal on the contempt  
counts. Barrett said prosecutors would ask the court for permission 
to interview jurors about their reasoning. One juror told reporters 
that Mrs. McDougal's state of mind -- she said she feared 
prosecutors -- was the key to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-week trial featured an unusual lineup of witnesses:  
three grand jurors, three Whitewater prosecutors, another woman 
charged with obstructing Starr's investigation and videotaped 
testimony from Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal took the witness stand in her own defense,  
answering some of the same questions she refused to address in 
front of the grand juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyers attempted to put Starr's tactics on  
trial, arguing that her refusal to give grand jury testimony was 
based on justifiable fear that she would be charged with perjury 
unless she falsely implicated the president and first lady in 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said her defense attorneys proved that Starr ``was  
not seeking the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After eight hours and 45 minutes of deliberations, spread over  
three days, the jurors sent out a note at midday Monday saying they 
were ``hopelessly deadlocked'' on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. polled the jurors, and  
nine said it would be a waste of time to continue deliberating. ``I 
don't believe in arm-twisting,'' Howard said before declaring a 
mistrial on those two counts and allowing the jury to announce its 
verdict on obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos challenged prosecutors to try his  
client again, saying, ``They don't have the guts to retry this case 
again because now we know where the bodies are buried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later he added of Starr: ``This guy is out of control. Put him  
out of his misery. Put the country out of its misery and get rid of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said that if there is a retrial on the two criminal  
contempt counts, it's unlikely Mrs. McDougal would be allowed to 
again inject her allegations that Starr wanted her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's accusation was allowed into the trial only as a  
defense to the obstruction charge, under which prosecutors were 
required to show that Mrs. McDougal had acted with corrupt intent 
when she refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was instructed not to consider her allegation that  
prosecutors wanted her to lie in regard to the contempt counts. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the jurors who wanted to acquit Mrs. McDougal on all  
three counts, Michael Nance, insisted Starr's office ``was not on 
trial here, only Mrs. McDougal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She honestly believed that she could be held for a false  
statement'' and that explained why she didn't talk, said Nance, who 
came close to being thrown off the jury Friday when he brought a 
law book to the deliberations. Nance said he brought in the book in 
an effort to get guidance on state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard concluded that Nance hadn't been influenced by the law  
book, which had belonged to a former Arkansas Supreme Court 
justice, John I. Purtle, who is acquainted with the Clintons and 
the McDougals. Purtle apparently left the book behind when he sold 
his house to Nance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal already had served 18 months in jail for civil  
contempt based on her refusal to answer grand jury questions. She 
also served two months of a two-year term on four felony 
convictions in her 1996 trial. Howard released her from prison 
because of a back problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent so many months in jail thinking that someday I'll get  
to tell the people the truth,'' Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the witness stand at her trial last month, the Clintons'  
former Whitewater partner said that as far as she knew, Clinton 
told the truth at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton swore that he never borrowed money from the McDougals'  
savings and loan. But prosecutors produced a cashier's check from 
the McDougals' S&AMP;L payable to ``Bill Clinton'' and handwritten 
notes from the files of the financial institution refer to a loan 
to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal helped pay off the Clinton loan, writing a $5,081  
check in 1983. She said she didn't remember the check.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Drew Waiting To Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- J.D. Drew, the can't-miss kid, has been missing  
a lot lately. 
</P>
<P>
	He has stumbled out of the gate for the St. Louis Cardinals,  
going 2-for-18 with a pair of singles and seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seeing the pitches, but I'm not seeing them very good,''  
Drew said after taking an 0-for-3 collar in Sunday's 4-2 loss to 
the Reds. ``And I'm swinging at some bad ones, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He even talks like he's in a slump.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where you've got to get at-bats and go out  
and score runs as a team, and it's a situation where I'm just kind 
of in a situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew built great expectations with his sensational September  
last year, batting .417 with five homers, three doubles and 13 RBIs 
in a golden 14 games. He responded to booing in Cincinnati on his 
first road trip with a 438-foot home run. 
</P>
<P>
	That came on the heels of the four-year, $7 million contract he  
signed with the Cardinals, which followed a nasty, yearlong holdout 
from the Philadelphia Phillies that led many to brand him a spoiled 
player who wanted all the money before he had earned a penny of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Having won over skeptical teammates with a down-to-earth  
approach, he now rejects the notion he's in danger of being buried 
by his own hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have ups and downs, and I had a lot of them at Florida  
State,'' Drew said. ``If you take into account all the good little 
streaks you go through, there are going to be several 0-for-4s in 
there also if you add them all together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, Drew's getting a lot of his 0-fers out of  
the way now. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory went that Drew was almost guaranteed a setback-free  
rookie season because he bats ahead of 70-homer man Mark McGwire. 
It was supposed to be all strikes, all the time, because the 
opposition would be dreading the prospect of facing McGwire with 
men on base. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the best spot in baseball,'' Cardinals farm director  
Mike Jorgensen said during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't worked out that way, at least not yet, mostly because  
Drew hasn't shown enough discipline. Pitchers handcuffed him the 
first few games with a nonstop diet of breaking balls, and he 
started chasing pitches. He struck out on a ball in the dirt on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew struggled late in spring training and manager Tony La Russa  
said it carried over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident he'll get his stroke back and really help us,''  
La Russa said. ``He's professional enough where he won't press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting coach Mike Easler said Drew is still adjusting, probably  
trying to figure out whether a breaking ball or fastball is headed 
his way about halfway to the plate -- and that's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Easler said this is a common problem for young hitters. He also  
has no doubt Drew can overcome it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be there for him, be there every day,'' Easler  
said. ``One day it's going to click in and they'll have to start 
coming to daddy, and he's going to start being the hitter we know 
he can be.''

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed for Au Pair Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal agency is proposing stricter  
regulations for the au pair program in light of British nanny 
Louise Woodward's conviction of manslaughter in the death of a 
Massachusetts infant in her care. 
</P>
<P>
	Changes proposed by the U.S. Information Agency, to be published  
Tuesday in the Federal Register, are intended to strengthen 
oversight and accountability of the program and ``reduce potential 
risks of injury to program participants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USIA's mission is to promote understanding between the United  
States and other countries. It began in 1986 administering the au 
pair program, a cultural exchange that designates private agencies 
to bring over young Europeans to stay with U.S. families and 
provide child care. They earn $139.05 per week. 
</P>
<P>
	The main changes proposed by the agency would require:  
</P>
<P>
	--That au pairs have training before taking assignments to care  
for children with special needs, such as blindness, and that they 
do not provide medical care for such children. 
</P>
<P>
	--That host families interview prospective au pairs, even by  
telephone if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	--That au pair agencies' annual reports to USIA summarize  
complaints about au pairs or host families, of all situations 
resulting in more than one placement for an au pair and of surveys 
of all host families and au pairs on the program's strengths and 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--That host families and au pairs receive brochures written by  
USIA, designed to avoid misunderstandings about the program's 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The host family will not be receiving the message that, `Here  
is child care,' and the au pairs will not be receiving the message, 
`Here's fun and travel in the United States,''' said USIA 
spokeswoman Jimmye Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are to take effect after a 30-day public comment  
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other regulations will remain on the books. They include  
restrictions on placement of au pairs with children under 3 months 
and requirements that au pairs placed with children under 2 years 
old have 200 hours of infant-care experience and that au pairs work 
no more than 45 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	USIA has never had the manpower to conduct on-site inspections  
or enforcement, and that will not change. It will continue to rely 
on outside accountants to conduct yearly audits of au pair agencies 
and on so-called community coordinators hired by the agencies to 
monitor placements. 
</P>
<P>
	The program came under scrutiny after the October 1997 murder  
trial of Ms. Woodward, whose conviction on a second-degree murder 
charge in the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen of Newton, Mass., 
was reduced to manslaughter by a judge. Woodward was sentenced to 
the 279 days she had served since her arrest, then returned to 
England last year after the verdict reduction was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case spawned criticism of the boy's parents for leaving  
their infant in the care of a teen-ager and of the federal 
government for allowing the au pair program to turn into a source 
of cheap baby-sitters for American families. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, spokeswomen for the nation's two largest au pair  
agencies, EF Au Pair, based in Cambridge, Mass., which placed 
Woodward; and Au Pair in America, based in Greenwich, Conn., said 
they favor the new regulations, which should improve the program.

	Judge Rules Clinton in Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge today found President  
Clinton in contempt of court for giving ``false, misleading and 
evasive'' testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
Historians said they believed Clinton was the first president to 
face such a penalty. U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright 
imposed a civil rather than a criminal penalty for Clinton's 
testimony in the Jones case, ordering him to pay Mrs. Jones ``any 
reasonable expenses including attorneys' fees caused by his willful 
failure to obey this court's discovery orders.'' The judge also 
began a legal process that could strip Clinton of his Arkansas law 
license.

	NATO Attacks Pound Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A wave of NATO attacks late Monday  
targeted Yugoslav fuel depots and heavy industry. Heralding another 
night of NATO strikes, air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade, Nis, 
Kragujevac and Podgorica. Yugoslav anti-aircraft systems fired at 
NATO planes flying over Belgrade, state news reported. Strong 
detonations were heard at an oil refinery in Pancevo, just across 
the Danube River from Belgrade. Earlier, an allied strike targeted 
on a rail bridge was blamed for wrecking a Yugoslav passenger 
train. Serb officials said at least 10 people aboard the train were 
killed and 16 injured.

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers Strike Enters Week Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Robert Wimberly expects that when he  
turns 50 on April 28, he'll still be walking the picket line 
instead of working at Newport News Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelworkers strike against the shipyard, which builds the  
Navy's aircraft carriers, entered its second week Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no negotiations since the strike over wages,  
pension and insurance began, and none have been scheduled. Union 
members, whose contract expired at midnight April 4, said they are 
prepared for the strike to last a month -- or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been looked over, we have been walked over, we have  
been abused,'' said Wimberly, who was among about 40 people 
picketing Monday afternoon at the 38th Street gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers last week received their last paycheck until the  
strike is over. The union will begin paying strike benefits after 
the strike's third week, which start at about $100 weekly and will 
increase gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants an across-the-board hourly pay increase of $3.95  
over three years. The shipyard offered increases that it said would 
boost the average worker's pay $2.49 an hour, with automatic 
promotions based on experience and skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski said the shipyard continues  
to remain productive, with salaried workers working alongside an 
undisclosed number of hourly workers who crossed the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the  
Pentagon is expected to block General Dynamics Corp.'s $1.4 billion 
bid for Newport News, citing concerns over the increasing 
consolidation in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News had previously made a $470 million bid for Avondale  
Industries Inc. That merger is still pending, although analysts say 
the General Dynamics deal could scuttle it.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Fail to Reach Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA and players union met for three hours  
Monday without reaching a compromise on a new collective bargaining 
agreement dealing with minimum salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two sides will talk informally Tuesday, WNBA  
spokesman Mark Pray said no new formal meetings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	No details of the discussions Monday were disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are hammering out specific facts and ways they will be  
handled,'' said Pam Wheeler, director of operations of the Women's 
National Basketball Players Association. ``We haven't spoken to all 
the players, and we need to contact them first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league seeks to increase the minimum salary from $15,000 to  
$20,000. The WNBPA, which includes one player representative from 
each of the 10 established WNBA teams, has asked for a $45,000 
minimum salary over the three-month summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are closer on some issues than we were last Friday,'' said  
Dan Wasserman, a spokesman for the players union. ``There are still 
some things that need negotiating, and the players need to approve 
or disapprove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides have already agreed in principle on year-round health  
care coverage, guaranteed contracts and the creation of an advisory 
panel for player input into league operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Val Ackerman and three attorneys represented the  
WNBA at the talks, while players Coquese Washington, Sophia 
Witherspoon, Teresa Weatherspoon and Kym Hampton were among the 
union negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, Rebecca Lobo, Lynette Woodard, Tina Thompson and  
Bridgette Gordon were named Monday to the first WNBPA executive 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators also are debating the number of players from the  
defunct ABL who might join the 12-team league. The union wants two 
players per team, while the league wants four roster slots open to 
ex-ABL players and six slots for the expansion teams in Orlando and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA is scheduled to open its pre-draft camp on Thursday in  
Chicago, which means a labor agreement must be in place by 
Wednesday at the latest for the league to start on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA's third season is scheduled to begin June 10.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Trim Losses; Dow Down 14.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were trimming their losses at late  
morning Monday after a big opening drop tied to a stunning earnings 
warning from Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 14.43 at 10,159.41, after losing 23.86 points on Friday. The 
Dow dropped as low as 10,096.69 in the early going, down 77.15 
points, before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement Friday that it would fall far short of  
analysts' earnings estimates ``turned out to be much ado about 
nothing,'' said William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor 
Fitzgerald. Citing strength this morning in Internet-related 
stocks, consumer issues, some economically sensitive shares and 
financial stocks, Meehan said that rather an all-out selling spree, 
investors were shifting focus from one group to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares were down 6 5/8, or by 21 percent, at 24 5/16 by late  
morning. Compaq said after markets closed Friday that it expected 
earnings would come to 15 cents a share for the first quarter, less 
than half analysts' average estimates of 31 cents. The company in 
part blamed industrywide price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile computer stocks were sharply lower, with Dow  
component IBM off 4 5/16 at 182. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's announcement had the biggest impact on broader stock  
indexes, which are heavily weighted in technology shares, although 
those also were recovering from their opening lows. The Nasdaq 
composite index was down 15.91 at 2,577.14, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was down 5.30 at 1,343.05. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of big Dow stocks were higher, including International  
Paper, up 7/8 at 45 1/16, and Caterpillar, up 1 5/16 at 50 11/16. 
Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating for Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 2 to 1 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 247.69 million 
shares, up from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.07 percent in  
anticipation of a selloff on Wall Street. European stock markets 
were mixed in afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Opposition Asks for Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan opposition parties have  
appealed to the international community to help ensure democracy 
after President Hugo Chavez threatened to declare a state of 
emergency and rule by decree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chavez's attitude is not only against political parties but  
against the democratic system that defends the balance of power,'' 
Sen. Timoteo Zambrano of the opposition Democratic Action Party 
wrote in a letter to the Organization of American States and other 
international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zambrano was joined by other opposition voices protesting what  
they said was Chavez's disrespect for the checks and balances of a 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the former coup leader-turned-president has  
threatened to support the dissolution of Congress and declare a 
state of emergency if lawmakers failed to grant him sweeping new 
powers to manage Venezuela's recession-hit economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved such a bill on March 27, but Chavez vetoed it  
last week, saying it didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The president caused further alarm when he vowed Friday to  
extend his term from five to 10 years. In a military ceremony the 
following day, Chavez reinstated 37 cashiered soldiers who helped 
him stage a failed putsch in 1992, calling them ``patriots and 
anonymous heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, insists he is merely trying to shake up a corrupt  
political system and bring a ``social revolution'' to Venezuela. 
But his recent threats against both Congress and the Supreme Court 
are seen by many as harbingers of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why must he attack our institutions?'' Henrique Capriles,  
president of Venezuela's lower house of Congress, asked in a radio 
interview Monday. ``A state of alarm is being created.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's 40-year-old democracy is among the oldest in Latin  
America, but decades of official graft and patronage politics have 
impoverished most of the country's 23 million people -- even though 
Venezuela has more oil reserves than any nation outside the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that the economic model was shattered here, and  
still worse, the political model was shattered, and even worse, the 
moral model was shattered. Venezuela has been ripped into pieces,'' 
Chavez said in a speech Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who enjoys enormous popularity, has said he needs  
greater powers to fix an economy that has been devastated in recent 
months by a slump in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of his public statements have added to a climate of  
economic uncertainty in Venezuela, which has a $22 billion foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	If Chavez declares a state of emergency, suspending  
constitutional guarantees, ``who will want to invest in this 
country?'' asked Capriles. 
</P>
<P>
	Zambrano, who heads the senate's international affairs  
commission, said the OAS is supposed to intervene whenever 
democracy is threatened in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what kind of action the OAS could take, if any.  
An OAS spokesman in Caracas, Carlos Carbacho, said Monday that the 
organization had no immediate comment on the situation.

	Judge Rules Clinton in Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright  
today ruled President Clinton in contempt of court for giving 
``intentionally false'' testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky during questioning in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case. The judge's civil ruling orders Clinton to pay 
Jones ``any reasonable expenses including attorneys' fees caused by 
his willful failure to obey this court's discovery orders.'' 
Clinton also must reimburse to the court to cover the judge's 
travel expenses in going to Washington at Clinton's request to 
preside over ``his tainted deposition.'' Enforcement of the ruling 
was to be delayed 30 days to give Clinton an opportunity to appeal.

	NATO Hits Yugoslav Passenger Train  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb officials blamed NATO for  
hitting a Yugoslav passenger train and killing at least 10 people 
as a new wave of allied air attacks targeted fuel depots and heavy 
industry. Even as the alliance expressed regret over loss of 
civilian life, NATO foreign ministers vowed to press ahead with its 
mission to stop Slobodan Milosevic's forces in Kosovo. As darkness 
fell, air raid sirens went off in Belgrade, Nis, Kragujevac, 
Podgorica. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defense systems fired at NATO 
planes flying over Belgrade, state news reported. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Vows To Win Air War  
</P>
<P>
	BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, La. (AP) -- After visiting this home  
for B-52 bombers and A-10 attack planes and meeting with crews who 
have flown strikes against Yugoslavia, President Clinton headed 
back to Washington for an evening meeting with top leaders of 
Congress. Clinton expressed resolve to win the air war, but the 
administration continued to resist sending ground forces. Both 
Republicans and Democrats, however, are becoming increasingly 
hawkish on Kosovo, probably reflecting a shift in public opinion 
polls in favor of introducing ground troops.

	McDougal Acquitted on One Count  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal thwarted Kenneth Starr  
once again today as a jury acquitted her of obstructing the 
independent counsel's Whitewater inquiry. It deadlocked on two 
other charges, causing a mistrial. McDougal's lawyers attempted to 
put Starr's tactics on trial, arguing that her refusal to give 
grand jury testimony was based on justifiable fear that she would 
be charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated the president 
and first lady in wrongdoing. Prosecutor Mark Barrett said Starr 
anticipated making a decision this week on whether to seek a 
retrial. 

</P>
<P>
	Child-Care Centers Found Unsafe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two in three child care facilities surveyed by  
a federal consumer safety agency had safety hazards that put 
children at risk. The problems ranged from playgrounds without 
proper padding to loops on window blind cords. The Consumer Product 
Safety Commission surveyed 220 facilities, including centers run by 
the federal government, for-profit and nonprofit companies, along 
with private homes that provide child care. The survey was released 
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

shootout with Ohio police turned against his older brother Monday, 
testifying he bragged of killing an Arkansas family in a quest 
create a whites-only nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe avoided direct eye contact with Chevie Kehoe,  
glancing only sideways at him and gulping as testified against his 
older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevie Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., is charged along with  
Danny Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., with racketeering, conspiracy and 
murder in a plot to set up a whites-only nation in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe, 22, said he and his brother were touring the South  
with their families when Chevie Kehoe told him about killing gun 
dealer William Mueller, his wife Nancy and her 8-year-old daughter 
Sarah Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that Danny and him had decided to do a hit on the  
Muellers due to the fact that, for one thing, he thought that they 
were government informants and he knew that they had a large amount 
of gold and silver stored at their house,'' Cheyne Kehoe told 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by prosecutors about Chevie Kehoe's attitude about the  
killings, the younger brother replied: ``It was a braggart-type 
attitude -- a macho attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe said he continued traveling with his brother out of  
fear that he would be killed if he left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kehoes engaged in a shootout with Ohio law officers, which  
was taped by police video cameras and televised nationally. Both 
Chevie and Cheyne Kehoe were convicted in the February 1997 
shootout. Cheyne Kehoe was sentenced to 24 1/2 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge deferred Chevie Kehoe's sentencing until the Arkansas  
case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe, named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the  
federal case, testified against his brother and Lee under a grant 
of immunity.

<HEADLINE> Child-Care Centers Found Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two in three child care facilities surveyed by  
a federal consumer safety agency had safety hazards that put 
children at risk. The problems ranged from playgrounds without 
proper padding to loops on window blind cords. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission surveyed 220 facilities,  
including centers run by the federal government, for-profit and 
nonprofit companies, along with private homes that provide child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was released Monday by first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who visited a local child care center to highlight 
parents' troubles with child care and to advocate more federal 
money to help parents pay for care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey looked for eight hazards that relate to the products  
regulated by the commission. States are responsible for regulating 
the safety of child care centers, and these particular hazards may 
not be barred by law in many states. But the commission hopes to 
alert parents and centers to the potential dangers, said spokesman 
Russ Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a 'gotcha' situation where we're saying these  
child care providers are bad,'' Rader said. ``We're simply pointing 
out some safety areas where even the best parents or child care 
providers may not be aware there's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission works with manufacturers to correct these  
problems but wants parents and child care providers to look for 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the facilities surveyed had at least one of the  
eight hazards. Specifically, the survey found: 
</P>
<P>
	--At four in 10 facilities, children were wearing clothing with  
drawstrings around their necks, which can catch on objects and 
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four centers had loops on window blind cords that can  
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four did not have safe playground surfacing, meaning if  
children fall off playground equipment they could be seriously 
injured when hitting a hard surface. Grass, for instance, is too 
hard a surface. Each year, there are 90,000 playground-related 
injuries each year to children under age 6, many of which involve 
falls, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in five facilities had cribs with soft bedding, which can  
suffocate infants. Each year, up to 900 babies who die from Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome may have suffocated on soft bedding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Child safety gates were not used where needed at 13 percent of  
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers surveyed were randomly selected but not necessarily  
reflective of the nation as a whole, Rader said.

<HEADLINE> Banana Battle Holds No Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) -- It's the start of the rainy season in  
the mountainous, fertile island of St. Lucia -- a time when Ellis 
Rupert Gajadhar and fellow banana farmers should be happily looking 
forward to peak harvesting and profit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a season of uncertainty now on Caribbean islands  
heavily dependent on their bananas -- and a time of deep bitterness 
toward the United States, which won a key battle last week in its 
war against trade preferences that keep Europe buying the yellow 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	For America, the issue is U.S. firms' stake in the global  
economy. For Europe, it's partly a moral debt to people they 
enslaved. And for islanders, it's a humbling quest for a place in 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	On a farm just south of Castries, Gajadhar's eyes sparkle and  
voice softens as he speaks of bananas, his rough hands tenderly 
examining a leafy tree. ``Bananas are my life, and bananas are the 
region's lifeblood,'' says the silver-bearded owner of 16 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Gajadhar, 52, believes Caribbean bananas are the best -- ``a  
sweeter, better tasting fruit'' than those grown by U.S. giants 
like Chiquita Brands and Dole Food in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admits some problems. Substandard storage and transport  
make quality inconsistent. Absence of irrigation suppresses yield 
much of the year. And crop-obliterating hurricanes make supply 
forecasts unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bananas were introduced by British colonizers and developed  
after independence because they grow year-round and boast the high 
yield-to-land ratio important to tiny territories. 
</P>
<P>
	Bananas -- and more recently, tourism -- are credited for somewhat  
improved living standards. But the per capita income on many 
islands remains low -- about $3,000 a year in St. Lucia -- and their 
economies are dangerously dependent on one crop. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Windward Islands, the southern half of the eastern  
Caribbean chain, about a third of the labor force works in bananas, 
providing 35 percent of export earnings. Bananas are also key to 
larger Caribbean countries like Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the region's crop -- a mere 1 percent of the  
world's production -- goes to Europe. There, it's long been 
protected and now accounts for almost a tenth of the EU's banana 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A scheme established in 1993 gives preference in licensing to  
those who import bananas from former colonies in the Caribbean, 
Africa and the Pacific, and imposes tariffs on bananas from 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	This is seen by many in the Caribbean as an obligation to former  
colonies populated by descendants of Africans the Europeans 
enslaved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans recognize their moral obligation. They have a  
conscience,'' said Gajadhar. ``The Americans don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what's being called the ``banana war,'' American officials  
have charged that the preferences are unfair to U.S. companies that 
grow bananas in Central America, cost consumers billions, and are 
illegal and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ideal world (the Caribbean) had over many years, and  
everybody would want to live in that kind of thing,'' said D. Brent 
Hardt, chief of the political and economic section at the U.S. 
Embassy in Barbados. ``But it has stymied growth in what had been a 
rapidly growing market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardt insisted the United States was not opposed to the idea of  
preferences but to the way they are implemented, and that there are 
ways to ``both provide protection and meet (World Trade 
Organization) rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such fine points seem lost in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
	The WTO decision Tuesday to support the U.S. claims and  
authorize $191 million of punitive U.S. tariffs on EU goods sparked 
gloom and fears of imminent European capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything or anyone has to be sacrificed as a result of this  
ruling, the banana producing islands ... in the Caribbean will,'' 
The Voice newspaper said in an editorial. The ruling ``ought to 
send shivers down the spine of banana growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People on the street heartily agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is cursing the United States,'' said Moses Eugene,  
32. ``We need the banana money. When someone from down the street 
wants to buy your stuff and your neighbor interferes, it's not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many, it confirms that the United States has lost interest  
in the region because of its diminished strategic value in the 
post-Cold War world. U.S. aid levels to the English-speaking 
Caribbean are at a fraction of the former $200 million a year, they 
note. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are friendly little countries to the U.S., and that the  
U.S. would want to jeopardize their economic backbone is 
unbelievable!'' said Bernard Cornibert, head of the Windward 
Islands Banana Development and Exporting Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not have a regime that maintains access for our  
bananas in the EU, our banana industry would collapse,'' he said. 
``That means increasing unemployment, falling income, and all the 
social and political problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said some growers might turn to marijuana, or help the  
northbound transit of South American drugs. ``We're being pushed to 
retaliate in this kind of disgusting manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some government leaders agree. At a summit in Suriname last  
month, leaders angered by the U.S. banana challenge discussed 
suspending a 1997 treaty for Caribbean nations to cooperate in the 
U.S. war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gajadhar, meanwhile, is trying to come up with more constructive  
ideas, and he's less apocalyptic. 
</P>
<P>
	When his father started growing bananas, he remembers, ``they  
would walk 3 miles to Castries with bunches on their heads.'' He's 
since seen the advent of truck delivery, protective foam packing 
for the bushels and fungicides. 
</P>
<P>
	What the industry needs now is reliability -- and that means  
finding the money for expensive containers to protect bananas on 
their voyage to Europe, and for irrigation to eliminate 
over-dependence on the April-to-October rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers have the ability to adjust because of the fact  
that there is no alternative to bananas here. We're going to 
produce bananas!'' he said. ``It's a question of survival.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ruling Surprised Few </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge's decision Monday to hold President  
Clinton in contempt of court was met with little surprise, even 
among his Democratic supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a pretty good consensus he lied in the deposition,''  
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., one of the leading opponents of 
Clinton's impeachment in the House last December. 
</P>
<P>
	But Frank added that the president's false testimony about his  
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ``wasn't material'' to Paula Jones' 
sexual harassment lawsuit and therefore wasn't perjury that 
warranted his removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chief  
prosecutor at Clinton's impeachment trial, drew a parallel between 
two of Monday's major court decisions. Hyde said U.S. District 
Judge Susan Webber Wright's contempt ruling ``offsets the 
disappointing results'' in Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, a business partner of the president, was  
acquitted earlier Monday of obstruction of justice. The jury 
deadlocked on two charges of contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Another impeachment prosecutor, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,  
called the ruling ``a credible decision'' by a judge who was 
``nonpartisan and nonpolitical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former White House special counsel Lanny Davis played down the  
penalty imposed on his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a relatively minor fine, minor amount of money,''  
Davis said. ``And for the amount of effort here, for this judge to 
enter this motion on her own I think is rather questionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson praised  
Wright's action as ``a long-overdue victory for the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, not even the president of the United States, is above  
the law,'' Nicholson said in a statement. ``Perjury should not be 
ignored or condoned in America's courts.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Tight End Asher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles announced Monday  
that they have agreed to terms on a three-year contract with tight 
end Jamie Asher, a signing that could answer the team's lingering 
problems at that position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamie Asher is a very nice fit for this offense because he's  
got excellent hands, he runs really good routes, and is a very good 
receiving tight end,'' said Eagles director of football operations 
Tom Modrak. ``He certainly upgrades the tight end position and 
gives us quality depth there that we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tight end position, a vital component of the West Coast  
offense, has not been nearly as productive as the Eagles want. Team 
officials think Asher's strengths fit nicely into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, five tight ends combined to catch 33 passes for 287  
yards for the Eagles. Two, Jason Dunn and Kaseem Sinceno, ended the 
season on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Asher caught 28 passes for 294 yards while playing in only nine  
games for the Washington Redskins last season. He started seven 
games and was leading the team in receptions before a loose piece 
of cartilage in his knee gave him problems. Eventually, surgery was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	That, on top of the fact that months earlier he had undergone a  
graft to increase the amount of cartilage in his knee, put Asher in 
a questionable category from a health standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth-round draft pick by the Redskins in 1995, Asher caught  
14 passes as a rookie and then had 42 in 1996. The next season, 
Asher led the Redskins with 49 receptions. He became the first 
tight end since Jean Fugett in 1977 to lead Washington in 
receptions. Asher's 21 catches on third down led all NFL tight 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the knee) feels great. It feels better than it did before  
I had the two surgeries on it,'' Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also announced they have signed restricted free agent  
defensive tackle Steve Martin to a one-year contract. Martin joined 
the Eagles when they claimed him off waivers from Indianapolis on 
Oct. 21. He played in nine games with the Eagles and recorded 39 
tackles and one sack.

<HEADLINE> Brand May Leave Duke For NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand, the consensus national player  
of the year, will announce Wednesday that he will forgo his final 
two years at Duke and enter the NBA draft, The Associated Press has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Brand, speaking on the condition of anonymity,  
confirmed Monday that the 6-foot-8, 270-pound sophomore center 
would become the first Duke player to leave school early for a 
chance to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The school had said earlier Monday that Brand and associate head  
basketball coach Johnny Dawkins would hold a news conference 
Wednesday at the school to announce the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds last season,  
was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award, presented 
by the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and he was also honored this 
season by The AP, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States 
Basketball Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The student newspaper at Duke, The Chronicle, also reported  
Monday that sophomore point guard William Avery had decided to 
forgo the rest of his eligibility and apply for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has told me it is true,'' sports information director  
Mike Cragg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle, citing unnamed sources close to the basketball  
team, said Avery had decided to leave school. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts Monday to reach Brand, Avery and Dawkins were  
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source said freshman Corey Maggette remains undecided  
about his future, The Chronicle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery has met with coach Mike Krzyzewski, who is recovering from  
hip replacement surgery, The Chronicle reported. The newspaper said 
Krzyzewski is unaware of Avery's final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential loss of Brand and Avery, coupled with the  
graduation of seniors Trajan Langdon and Taymon Domzalski, would 
cost Duke much of the core of the 37-2 team that reached the NCAA 
championship, where the Blue Devils lost to Connecticut. However, 
the program has received national letters of intent from four high 
school seniors who were selected to McDonald's All-America team. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who have announced their intention to leave school early  
include junior guard Steve Francis of Maryland and junior forward 
Albert White of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 15 to announce their intentions.

<HEADLINE> Group Shelves Bid for IOC PR Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The group bidding to bring the 2008 Summer  
Olympics to Toronto dropped its plan to retain public relations 
giant Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc. because of a possible conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill &AMP; Knowlton has already been retained by the International  
Olympic Committee to help repair its scandal-battered image. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's edition of PRWeek magazine reported that Hill &AMP;  
Knowlton had been chosen over Edelman, GPC Canada and Grey 
Advertising subsidiaries GCI Group and APCO Associates, who pitched 
jointly for the business of lobbying the IOC on behalf of the 
Toronto group. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Evensen, coordinator of Toronto's bid, told the magazine  
that the bid committee had no reservations about a possible 
conflict of interest. And Hill &AMP; Knowlton said it didn't see any 
problems with competing for the Toronto account while representing 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But later Monday, the 2008 Toronto group issued a statement  
saying that Charles Dubin, the former judge retained as its ethics 
commissioner, advised ``there would be an appearance of a conflict 
of interest'' to retain Hill &AMP; Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is struggling to clean up its image in the aftermath of  
the bribery scandal involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Toronto, other cities seeking the 2008 Summer Games  
include Beijing; Paris; Osaka, Japan; and Seville, Spain. Others 
considering making a bid include Cairo; Istanbul; Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Early Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies on  
fears of a stock market meltdown Monday and was unable to fully 
recover even as stocks reversed course and rose to unprecedented 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0820, up  
from $1.0790 late Friday. The dollar was worth 120.19 Japanese yen, 
down from 120.98 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's foreign exchange markets were primed by Friday's late  
report from Compaq Computer that its first-quarter earnings would 
be 15 cents a share, less than half analysts' average estimates of 
31 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asian and European trading, the dollar fell on fears that  
Compaq's warning would depress U.S. stock markets. Stock markets 
overseas slipped as well, led by the Nikkei index in Tokyo, which 
tumbled 2.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange investors in New York sold off their dollars as  
they anticipated the Dow would crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we came in, the dollar was on its lows'' against the yen  
and euro, said Dennis Heidt, chief currency dealer at Banque 
Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors ultimately decided the problem was unique to  
Compaq. By noon, the Dow was on its way to a record close, 
rocketing 165.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,339.51. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Dow went positive, everybody bought their dollars  
back,'' Heidt said. But ``we didn't fully retrace'' the dollar's 
route to its Friday levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4843 Swiss francs, up from 1.4829,  
and 1.4935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4999. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6129, up from $1.6103. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8077 
German marks, down from 1.8112; 6.0643 French francs, down from 
6.0793; and 1,788.91 Italian lire, down from 1,794.50.

<HEADLINE> IBM, RealNetworks Team Up on Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is joining with a major Internet software  
company to create a way of delivering music over the Web that 
ensures record companies and artists don't get stiffed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday between IBM and RealNetworks is aimed  
at helping the record industry stop the growing availability of 
free or inexpensive music over the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing technologies have allowed artists to distribute their  
music over the Internet without help from record labels. And 
bootleggers are distributing pirated music, depriving artists and 
their labels of royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	While the industry says cheap Internet music is unfair,  
companies that send music via computers say the industry is merely 
trying to get a piece of the action and jack up the price of online 
music. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM said it would test a system in June that combines its  
technology with RealNetworks software, which already is used by 
more than 55 million people to play music, listen to radio and 
watch video clips over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM and RealNetworks said they haven't yet decided on a method  
to allow consumers to conveniently play back the music -- such as a 
Walkman-style gadget -- and they won't have a product on the market 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales represent just a tiny fraction of the $12  
billion music industry. But revenues are expected to grow 
dramatically as technology makes it easy for computer users to 
listen to music from Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem for the industry is that existing technology can be  
used by consumers to download music for free that they might 
otherwise have to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to worry about'' if you're a record company,''  
said Mark Mooradian, an industry analyst with Jupiter 
Communications. ``You can't let people gain the perception that ... 
it's a free thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A main target of the record industry effort is MP3, an  
increasingly popular technology allowing for rapid transfer of 
music over the Web. This format has helped fuel the popularity of 
the Rio, a Walkman-like device that plays MP3 music files.

	``By and large MP3 represents the largest threat to the music

</P>
<P>
	``The piracy issue is a red herring. Their biggest threat is if  
the artist talks directly to the consumer, they are cut out of the 
picture,'' Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Down in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.190 percent, down from 4.265 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.320 percent, down from 4.345 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Oct. 26, when the  
bills sold for 4.070 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest 
since Jan. 25, when the rate was 4.280. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.305 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,894.10 and 4.490 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,781.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.66 
percent last week from 4.72 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Banana Battle Holds No Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) -- It's the start of the rainy season in  
the mountainous, fertile island of St. Lucia -- a time when Ellis 
Rupert Gajadhar and fellow banana farmers should be happily looking 
forward to peak harvesting and profit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's a season of uncertainty now on Caribbean islands  
heavily dependent on their bananas -- and a time of deep bitterness 
toward the United States, which won a key battle last week in its 
war against trade preferences that keep Europe buying the yellow 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	For America, the issue is U.S. firms' stake in the global  
economy. For Europe, it's partly a moral debt to people they 
enslaved. And for islanders, it's a humbling quest for a place in 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	On a farm just south of Castries, Gajadhar's eyes sparkle and  
voice softens as he speaks of bananas, his rough hands tenderly 
examining a leafy tree. ``Bananas are my life, and bananas are the 
region's lifeblood,'' says the silver-bearded owner of 16 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Gajadhar, 52, believes Caribbean bananas are the best -- ``a  
sweeter, better tasting fruit'' than those grown by U.S. giants 
like Chiquita Brands and Dole Food in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admits some problems. Substandard storage and transport  
make quality inconsistent. Absence of irrigation suppresses yield 
much of the year. And crop-obliterating hurricanes make supply 
forecasts unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Bananas were introduced by British colonizers and developed  
after independence because they grow year-round and boast the high 
yield-to-land ratio important to tiny territories. 
</P>
<P>
	Bananas -- and more recently, tourism -- are credited for somewhat  
improved living standards. But the per capita income on many 
islands remains low -- about $3,000 a year in St. Lucia -- and their 
economies are dangerously dependent on one crop. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Windward Islands, the southern half of the eastern  
Caribbean chain, about a third of the labor force works in bananas, 
providing 35 percent of export earnings. Bananas are also key to 
larger Caribbean countries like Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the region's crop -- a mere 1 percent of the  
world's production -- goes to Europe. There, it's long been 
protected and now accounts for almost a tenth of the EU's banana 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A scheme established in 1993 gives preference in licensing to  
those who import bananas from former colonies in the Caribbean, 
Africa and the Pacific, and imposes tariffs on bananas from 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	This is seen by many in the Caribbean as an obligation to former  
colonies populated by descendants of Africans the Europeans 
enslaved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans recognize their moral obligation. They have a  
conscience,'' said Gajadhar. ``The Americans don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what's being called the ``banana war,'' American officials  
have charged that the preferences are unfair to U.S. companies that 
grow bananas in Central America, cost consumers billions, and are 
illegal and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ideal world (the Caribbean) had over many years, and  
everybody would want to live in that kind of thing,'' said D. Brent 
Hardt, chief of the political and economic section at the U.S. 
Embassy in Barbados. ``But it has stymied growth in what had been a 
rapidly growing market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardt insisted the United States was not opposed to the idea of  
preferences but to the way they are implemented, and that there are 
ways to ``both provide protection and meet (World Trade 
Organization) rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such fine points seem lost in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
	The WTO decision Tuesday to support the U.S. claims and  
authorize $191 million of punitive U.S. tariffs on EU goods sparked 
gloom and fears of imminent European capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything or anyone has to be sacrificed as a result of this  
ruling, the banana producing islands ... in the Caribbean will,'' 
The Voice newspaper said in an editorial. The ruling ``ought to 
send shivers down the spine of banana growers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People on the street heartily agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is cursing the United States,'' said Moses Eugene,  
32. ``We need the banana money. When someone from down the street 
wants to buy your stuff and your neighbor interferes, it's not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many, it confirms that the United States has lost interest  
in the region because of its diminished strategic value in the 
post-Cold War world. U.S. aid levels to the English-speaking 
Caribbean are at a fraction of the former $200 million a year, they 
note. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are friendly little countries to the U.S., and that the  
U.S. would want to jeopardize their economic backbone is 
unbelievable!'' said Bernard Cornibert, head of the Windward 
Islands Banana Development and Exporting Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not have a regime that maintains access for our  
bananas in the EU, our banana industry would collapse,'' he said. 
``That means increasing unemployment, falling income, and all the 
social and political problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said some growers might turn to marijuana, or help the  
northbound transit of South American drugs. ``We're being pushed to 
retaliate in this kind of disgusting manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some government leaders agree. At a summit in Suriname last  
month, leaders angered by the U.S. banana challenge discussed 
suspending a 1997 treaty for Caribbean nations to cooperate in the 
U.S. war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gajadhar, meanwhile, is trying to come up with more constructive  
ideas, and he's less apocalyptic. 
</P>
<P>
	When his father started growing bananas, he remembers, ``they  
would walk 3 miles to Castries with bunches on their heads.'' He's 
since seen the advent of truck delivery, protective foam packing 
for the bushels and fungicides. 
</P>
<P>
	What the industry needs now is reliability -- and that means  
finding the money for expensive containers to protect bananas on 
their voyage to Europe, and for irrigation to eliminate 
over-dependence on the April-to-October rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers have the ability to adjust because of the fact  
that there is no alternative to bananas here. We're going to 
produce bananas!'' he said. ``It's a question of survival.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Pitcher Tapani Hurts Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The last thing the Chicago Cubs' depleted  
pitching staff needed was another sore arm. Now, they've got one. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tapani, a 19-game winner last season, had to leave  
Monday's Wrigley Field opener against the Cincinnati Reds after 
three innings because of tightness in his right shoulder. The 
35-year-old right-hander doesn't know if he'll miss his next start. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs already are without NL rookie of the Year Kerry Wood,  
who will miss the season following elbow surgery, and reliever 
Terry Adams is also on the disabled list with an elbow sprain. 
Jeremi Gonzalez is working his way back from elbow surgery and is 
also on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani initially hurt the shoulder on a check-swing while  
batting last week in Houston and when the pain flared again Monday, 
he didn't want to take a chance this early in the season. He'll 
rest a couple of days, do some exercises, take medication and then 
evaluate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just grabbed on me,'' Tapani said. ``It's a little sore.  
It's muscle-type stuff and I need to build up my strength. I'm not 
looking at it as a major thing. I just can't let it alter the way I 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it's not too bad. It's a strain back there. It's  
early and why take a chance and have it linger all year?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani was the loser Monday during Cincinnati's 7-2 victory,  
just his fifth loss in 20 decisions at Wrigley Field with the Cubs. 
He's 29-13 overall since joining the team in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Black College Reunion Called Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- City officials played down the  
violence at this year's Black College Reunion, describing the two 
shootings and two stabbings as isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have a public safety disaster. We didn't have any  
violence in the streets. No law enforcement officers were injured 
and we also did a good job of protecting the property of Daytona 
Beach residents,'' Mayor Bud Asher said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died and three were hospitalized during the weekend's  
events, which drew as many as 100,000 people for cruising, partying 
and ogling members of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Police wrote 2,400 citations and made more than 300 arrests,  
including 12 for on charges of possession of firearms and related 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened about 4 a.m. Sunday outside the a hotel,  
apparently after an argument began when a drink was poured on a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Grover of Jacksonville was shot in the head died Sunday  
night at Halifax Medical Center, nursing supervisor Judith Dyke 
said. Ansie Pierre, 24, of Miami was found wounded in the abdomen 
at a nearby motel. He was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to get away from that kind of thing,'' said Bob  
Brown, 27, of Youngstown, Ohio, who was checking out of the Sea Dip 
hotel, near where the shooting happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Two stabbings were reported, one in Daytona Beach and the other  
in nearby Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Asher and Charles Cherry, president of the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Daytona Beach, 
said similar problems occur at other special events in Daytona 
Beach such as Bike Week and Spring Break. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a man was killed and four police officers were wounded  
in a shootout, 329 arrests were made and 926 citations were written 
over the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	Black College Reunion, started in 1984 as a gathering of  
Bethune-Cookman College and Florida A&AMP;M students and graduates, now 
competes with Atlanta's Freaknik as the place to go for a ``black 
spring break.''

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Casts Pall on Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Worsening conditions in Japan's labor market are  
casting a shadow over improvement in business sentiment, though 
overall the economy appears to be bottoming out, the Economic 
Planning Agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its April report, the EPA said that while conditions remain  
severe, the deterioration of the economy is slowing to a halt -- the 
same assessment it reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report released Tuesday, Japan's central bank  
noted improvement in corporate and consumer sentiment and echoed 
the EPA's view that the country's economic slide was drawing to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, accelerating corporate restructuring is leaving more and  
more people out of work amid Japan's worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate soared to a record high of 4.6 percent in  
February, the latest month for which data are available. That 
caused the agency to downgrade its view of the employment situation 
in its report. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya has warned that the jobless rate could  
rise well above 5 percent in coming months as companies shed 
redundant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increasing unemployment, Takashi Omori, director of  
the national economic division at the EPA's research bureau, said 
the possibility the overall economy may worsen further ``has 
receded for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now government spending was putting a floor under the  
economy and preventing it from worsening, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, said that corporate and consumer  
sentiment had stopped deteriorating as the government implements 
steps to stabilize the debt-laden financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	A halt in the decline of industrial production due to progress  
in inventory adjustment has also boosted confidence, the BOJ said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also expressed cautious optimism about other aspects of  
the economy, such as upgrading its assessment of housing investment 
and noting that companies seem more confident about their ability 
to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA noted there have been some signs of improvement since  
last month's report. The Bank of Japan's latest survey of business 
sentiment, released last week, showed that corporate sentiment 
improved across the board in the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that improvement was due to lower interest rates and  
easier credit conditions, as the effects of the central bank's 
loose monetary stance and steps taken to stabilize the financial 
system filtered through the economy, the EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said that lower interest rates are helping to  
spark a nascent recovery in housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Omori described the economy as remaining in a precarious state,  
saying that as long as the beneficial effects of policy steps last, 
sentiment could improve and lead to stronger economic activity. 
Conversely, however, he said the policy effects could wear off, 
thus pulling the rug out from under the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, both (scenarios) are possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed for Au Pair Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stricter rules for the nation's au pair  
program, which came under scrutiny after a British nanny's 1997 
manslaughter conviction in the death of a Massachusetts baby, are 
being proposed to help weed out problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Information Agency, in a proposed rule being published  
today in the Federal Register, said its goal is strengthening 
oversight and accountability and reducing ``potential risks of 
injury to program participants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	USIA, whose mission is to promote better understanding between  
the United States and other countries, began administering the au 
pair program in 1986. Billed as a cultural exchange, the program 
designates private agencies to bring over young Europeans to stay 
with U.S. families and provide child care. They earn $139.05 per 
week and are required to take six credit hours at an accredited 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Much au pair advertising directed at young Europeans promotes  
the program as an opportunity to explore life in the United States 
while glossing over the significant child care responsibilities, 
USIA said. Meanwhile, American families get the impression that 
it's a child care program. To avoid misunderstandings, the new 
rules require that potential au pairs and host families receive a 
USIA brochure. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will both realize this is an exchange program dealing  
with education,'' said Jimmye Walker, a USIA spokeswoman. ``The 
objective is not child care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help spot problems, au pair agencies will be required to  
provide more information about complaints, au pair placements and 
surveys about the program in their yearly reports to USIA. 
</P>
<P>
	USIA is also requiring telephone interviews between prospective  
au pairs and their host families. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules, which take effect after a 30-day public comment  
period, won't change the fact that USIA doesn't have the manpower 
for inspections or investigations. Monitoring is done mostly by 
community coordinators hired by the au pair agencies.

<HEADLINE> Zhu, Daley Say Trade Pact Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's has 375 restaurants in 38 Chinese  
cities. Motorola, a longtime supporter of China, is one of the 
country's biggest investors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not surprising then that executives from both companies --  
members in the Mid-America Committee for International Business and 
Government Cooperation -- greeted Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji with 
open arms at their group's luncheon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some went as far as supporting China's admission into the World  
Trade Organization -- something both Zhu and U.S. Commerce Secretary 
William Daley said could still happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu -- on a nine-day, six-city tour of the United States -- vowed  
China would open ``wider and wider to the outside world'' if it 
joins the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cautioned U.S. officials to step in before other Western  
countries lay claim to billions of dollars worth of business with 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you demand too much too soon, maybe you'll end up with  
nothing,'' Zhu, who spoke through an interpreter, said at a 
luncheon at a downtown Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said President Clinton would like to see China admitted  
into the WTO this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good for America. And it is good for world trade,''  
Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of talks in Washington last week deprived visiting  
Zhu of a potent weapon to push forward his sweeping free-market 
reforms that have cost millions of jobs in an attempt to turn 
around money-losing state industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After 13 years of on-again, off-again talks, China appeared  
increasingly intent in recent months on membership and showed new 
willingness to offer concessions. Daley said Monday that U.S. 
officials want to be more sure of China's willingness to open its 
markets to U.S. companies and imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the premier toured the currency trading floor of  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where harried traders briefly 
greeted him with applause. Zhu rang the exchange's bell and flashed 
the Chinese hand signal for ``good fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the applause, some traders said they had mixed feelings  
about Zhu's visit. One chuckling trader even held up two pieces of 
paper -- one reading ``Free'' and the other ``Tibet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu next heads to New York, part of a six-city tour that has  
already taken him to Los Angeles, Denver and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Chief Won't Be Prosecuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has declined to  
prosecute former CIA Director John Deutch for keeping secret files 
on his unsecured personal computer at home after he stepped down as 
the nation's top spy, a department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department recently sent the case back to the CIA for  
possible disciplinary action after it concluded Deutch's actions 
were reckless rather than criminal, this official said, requesting 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is preparing a critical report and considering  
revocation of the security clearances Deutch still has as a 
government consultant, Newsweek magazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek disclosed that in late 1996, CIA technicians found 31  
secret files on Deutch's home computer. The CIA spent a year 
weighing the case before sending it to the Justice Department and 
the department spent another year reaching its decision, the 
magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said he was familiar with the Newsweek  
story but could not comment. The newsmagazine said Deutch would not 
comment, and a call to his Massachusetts home was not returned. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Macedonia Claim Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RADUSA, Macedonia (AP) -- The ordeal of ethnic Albanians driven  
out of Kosovo is continuing in camps in Macedonia, where refugees 
and international monitors claim guards keep order with barbed wire 
and occasional clubbings and often harass women. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the 40,000 Kosovo Albanians in the tent cities will  
upset the country's political and ethnic balance, Macedonia is 
preventing many refugees from leaving the camps -- even if they say 
they have another place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia denies any mistreatment, and says it was overwhelmed  
by the arrival of 120,000 people in the space of a few days. 
Officials say keeping the Albanians in the camps will help keep 
track of them; already about 50,000 are staying in private Albanian 
homes, and a number have been airlifted to third countries. Nearly 
10,000 were shipped overnight out of a border area into Albania 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, the Kosovo mission chief of the Organization for  
Security and Cooperation in Europe, acknowledges that any country 
would have had trouble coping with such a sudden refugee influx. 
``I don't blame Macedonia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, complaints persist from Radusa, the most remote of the  
nine refugee centers that have been established, and the only one 
set up and run entirely by Macedonians. Outside aid agencies were 
admitted only Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker visited Radusa on Sunday and his spokesman likened the  
conditions to ``a concentration camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees say guards fire submachine guns in the air at night,  
pelt refugees' tents with stones and train their flashlights on 
women when they get up to go to the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an old woman so I don't worry, but what about my  
daughters?'' asked Fatime Podvorica, one of a group of refugee 
women who said their men were mostly in Kosovo, killed in fighting 
or taken away by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at better-tended camps nearer the capital, Skopje, police  
have bludgeoned refugees with truncheons in full view of 
international monitors, said Stephen Odum, a member of the Kosovo 
OSCE mission. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Stenkovic camp, run with the help of French NATO troops,  
Macedonian guards sit on an incline above the women's latrines, 
laughing as women relieve themselves, Odum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Odum said he complained to a French officer, who had tears in  
his eyes as he said he had no authority to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see what they've gone through and then see their dignity  
and freedom taken away again -- it's like, when will these people 
ever get a break?'' Odum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions at Radusa have improved markedly since aid agencies  
arrived. On Monday, aid workers installed a shower and distributed 
clean clothes, and the guards' guns were nowhere in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the improvements, refugees point to sickly, skinny  
babies and children with skin rashes and diarrhea -- the result of 
days of sleeping in mud without enough water and food and only six 
reeking toilets for more than 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very bad here,'' said Podvorica, the woman with three  
daughters. ``We are very afraid we are going to stay here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A poor country, Macedonia said it can accept only 20,000 of the  
refugees permanently. It's already well beyond that quota. 
</P>
<P>
	Many camp residents say they have family to stay with, but the  
government has refused to let them leave, fearing they would settle 
permanently and upset the nation's ethnic balance. Macedonia's 
one-fifth Albanian population already has been demanding more 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're in prison,'' said refugee Basri Jashari.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Radusa camp on Monday, authorities allowed Mevlude  
Shkodra to take out her 11-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, 
separated from her in Macedonian officials' rush to clear refugees 
from a border no-man's land last week. Their 75-year-old 
grandmother had been tending them. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter stood poised at the camp gate until guards opened  
it, then burst through and fell upon her mother, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are you going? Don't go!'' she wailed when her mother  
had to move aside for a truck. Reassured, the children walked away 
with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Grandmother Zahide Shkodra gave them a last hug, then opened the  
gate of the camp and walked back inside. She did not have 
permission to go.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No consensus for ground troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is no consensus in the United States,  
the Congress or NATO for introduction of ground troops into the 
fight against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``And there is no need, according to our commanding officers,''  
Cohen told reporters. ``So until such time as that changes ... we 
would not even consider it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, calls increased in Congress for just such an option as  
members began returning to town after a two-week spring recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to preclude a legitimate option,'' said Sen.  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., back from a weekend tour of a refugee 
camp in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would support a resolution in the Senate, which  
appeared to be gaining backing of key lawmakers, that would 
authorize ``whatever force is necessary'' to resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said he was not necessarily calling for ground troops but,  
``Everything should be left on the table.'' Ground forces ``should 
be a permissible option,'' Dodd said. He said it was important for 
Congress to speak with one voice, if possible. ``If we send divided 
messages in the next 48 to 72 hours, I think we extend this 
conflict,'' he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen made his assessment at Barksdale Air Force Base, La.,  
where he accompanied President Clinton on a trip to thank the 
service personnel who have been responsible for some of the B-52 
and A-10 bombing attacks against Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff, said the bombing campaign is showing results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are systematically choking off the Yugoslav army and  
security forces in Kosovo by cutting their supply lines,'' Cohen 
said. ``As we isolate and weaken the Serb forces in Kosovo, we are 
launching aggressive attacks against troops on the ground by 
hitting staging areas, headquarters and forces in the field. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO's campaign is showing results,'' Cohen continued. ``We're  
seeing decreasing military mobility and eroding morale'' among the 
Serbs, who are seeking to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration and military officials say Milosevic has  
backed himself into a corner where loss of power and trial as a war 
criminal may be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	That grim depiction of Milosevic's future came as an  
increasingly assertive Congress returns from two weeks off to 
debate whether to sanction the use of ground troops to drive 
Serbian forces out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his aides have emphasized they will not negotiate  
with Milosevic, and the only way he can stop the NATO airstrikes is 
to remove his troops from Kosovo, allow the refugees to return, 
give Kosovo autonomy and let in NATO peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, administration officials toughened that stance. White  
House chief of staff John Podesta said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' 
that Milosevic had started four wars in 10 years -- in Slovenia, 
Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and that Yugoslavia could not become a 
real member of the European community with him in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, ``for them to create a stable situation, it looks to  
me like they are going to need a new leader,'' Podesta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Brussels for NATO  
talks, said that with Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo, many elements of the peace settlement that the Kosovars 
accepted but Milosevic rejected last month ``have been overtaken by 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, on CBS' ``Face the  
Nation,'' said Milosevic would eventually be held responsible for 
his attacks on ethnic minorities. ``That means the International 
War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the United States could negotiate with someone it  
considers a war criminal, Talbott replied: ``We're not negotiating 
with Milosevic, we're bombing him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said that while he couldn't  
confirm reports of a mass grave in Kosovo, ``I suspect ... that we 
are going to find more and more evidence of mass graves, mass 
executions, some pretty horrific stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials said the bombing was beginning to take a  
serious toll on the troops that have persecuted Albanian Kosovars 
and keep Milosevic in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attack, degrade, disrupt and ultimately, if he  
doesn't comply to the demands of the international community, he is 
going to lose those forces.'' NATO's military commander, Army Gen. 
Wesley Clark, said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton told ABC that the airstrikes had already begun to drive  
apart elements of Yugoslavia's 3rd Army, which is leading the 
attacks in Kosovo. He said the military and police were being hurt 
``by the lack of fuel, the lack of ammunition, the lower morale as 
a result of now starting to be pounded by NATO air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that may not be enough for many members of Congress. Sens.  
Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John McCain, R-Ariz., agreed on NBC that 
Milosevic was a war criminal and that it was a mistake for the 
administration to state from the beginning that the use of ground 
troops in Kosovo was not an option. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who recently returned from a trip to the Balkans with  
Cohen, said he would seek a resolution giving the president the 
authority to use all means necessary, including ground troops, to 
achieve the stated goals in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not achieving our objectives; ... (Milosevic is)  
achieving his,'' said McCain, a Republican presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Hand Recipient Throws First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Now pitching in Veterans Stadium: The most  
famous left-hander since Steve Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Scott, the first person in the United States to receive  
a hand transplant, threw out the first ball Monday at the 
Philadelphia Phillies home opener against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch to Phillies reserve outfielder Rob Ducey about 25 feet  
from home plate was high and outside. But it was perfect enough for 
the 37-year-old Scott, decked out in a No. 13 Phillies jersey and 
red hat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw a `wishball,''' a beaming Scott said. ``I was really  
worried about muffing the throw, bouncing it, throwing it in the 
stands, or throwing it behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott threw the ball with a protective glove he wears every day  
as part of his recovery. His new hand cannot detect texture, such 
as the seams of the baseball, but it can feel the pressure he 
applies on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a thrill, an absolute thrill,'' said the lifelong  
Phillies fan, who lives in Absecon, N.J., about an hour from 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott had been using a prosthetic device since losing his hand  
in a 1985 fireworks accident. Doctors at Louisville Jewish Hospital 
in Kentucky attached the hand from an undisclosed donor after a 
15-hour operation Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials decided to give him the opportunity to throw out  
the first ball after hearing about the transplant. Scott had said 
he wanted to play catch with his children when he was healed. 
</P>
<P>
	So he began practicing in earnest.  
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had to start from the beginning,'' Scott said.  
``Every day for about 20 minutes to a half-hour day every day, we 
practiced the motion of throwing and then the hand grip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremonial pitch capped a dizzying pregame opening day  
ceremony. The ball was carried into the park by a man with a 
jet-propelled backpack rocketing to the upper level of the stadium. 
He handed it to a man who used a hang glider to fly down to the 
field, who finally gave the ball to Scott's 7-year-old son, Ian. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing the pitch, Scott raised his arms in triumph and  
pointed to the stands. He was greeted by hugs and handshakes in the 
Phillies dugout from family and team members, including pitcher 
Curt Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say Scott is progressing right on schedule and that his  
ability to throw a ball is another milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard for this,'' said physical therapist Ann  
Hodges, who traveled with Scott. ``He's progressing well and has 
been looking forward to this day for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flanked by an entourage of hospital officials from Louisville,  
Scott said throwing the first pitch was important to show the rest 
of the world that the operation worked. 
</P>
<P>
	It also went a long way in his goal to teach his son how to play  
baseball, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I was able to tell him and show things, but actually  
showing how to field a ground ball with two hands was more of an 
abstract discussion,'' he said. ``Now that I have the ability to do 
that, it will probably be a lot easier now.''

<HEADLINE> GM Board Finalizes Delphi Spinoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s board voted Monday to  
distribute the automaker's remaining stock in its big Delphi 
Automotive Systems Corp. parts unit to GM shareholders next month, 
completing the subsidiary's spinoff as an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	GM sold nearly 18 percent of Delphi in an initial public  
offering in February at $17 a share. The tax-free spinoff is 
expected to be completed with the distribution of 80 percent of 
Delphi shares worth $7.8 billion on May 28. The other 2 percent of 
shares are expected to fund a trust for retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi is the largest auto parts manufacturer in the world,  
followed by Ford Motor Co.'s Visteon Automotive Systems, and 
Johnson Controls Inc. The spinoff marks a drastic shift away from 
GM's history as a vertically integrated automaker that made its own 
parts and assembled them into cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	GM executives say the split will allow Delphi to expand its  
business and form relationships with other automakers that have 
been reluctant to work with a supplier owned by one of their 
competitors. GM is expected to remain Delphi's largest customer 
well into the next decade, but the spinoff will allow the world's 
largest automaker to turn to lower-cost, independent suppliers for 
more of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that both companies will become stronger and more  
competitive in our respective businesses,'' GM chairman Jack Smith 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's vote was expected, though GM had previously said only  
that the spinoff would occur before year's end. By spinning off the 
rest of Delphi before summer, executives expect GM will be 
better-positioned to negotiate a separate contract with its largest 
union, the United Auto Workers, in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But the timing is unlikely to please UAW leaders, who have  
publicly opposed the deal. The union represents 46,000 of Delphi's 
198,000 workers; they currently are under GM's national contract. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW president Stephen Yokich had urged GM to retain at least 51  
percent ownership of Delphi, fearing wages of Delphi workers will 
suffer once it is fully independent. The UAW is expected to push 
for Delphi's contract to be the same as what GM negotiates for its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also is worried about what an independent Delphi may  
do with its U.S. plants that it considers unprofitable or 
noncompetitive. UAW leaders have long argued that GM has not 
invested in those plants to make them competitive with independent 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have assured the leadership of the United Auto Workers, the  
International Union of Electrical Workers and our other unions that 
we are prepared to promptly enter into agreements to protect the 
interests of Delphi employees affected by the spinoff,'' Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW spokesman Roger Kerson said the UAW would have no comment on  
Monday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi employees would continue to receive their GM benefits and  
their pension plan would remain fully funded. If GM receives a 
favorable IRS tax ruling by May 14, it plans to contribute 2 
percent of its Delphi shares into a trust that can be used to fund 
benefits for hourly worker retirees. Otherwise, those shares will 
also be distributed to GM shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, earned $370 million  
on sales of $28.4 billion in 1998, which places it among America's 
largest corporations. It operates 168 manufacturing plants, 40 
joint ventures and 27 technical centers in 36 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Delphi fell 12 1/2 cents to $17.31 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' GM Tries To Rebuild Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- He was there before the beginning. When Dave  
Dombrowski joined the Florida Marlins in 1991, their first game was 
still 18 months away. 
</P>
<P>
	Dombrowski has since worked for two owners and hired four  
managers. He traded for Gary Sheffield, then traded him away five 
years later. He watched Charlie Hough throw the first pitch in 
franchise history, and he watched Alex Fernandez throw the first 
pitch on opening day last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Marlins' short, tumultuous history, Dombrowski has been  
part of every chapter. He built a World Series championship team 
from scratch in record time, then dismantled it on orders from the 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's trying to build a winner again.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have our work cut out for us,'' Dombrowski says with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one starter from the 1997 World Series team remains in the  
lineup. Manager Jim Leyland, owner Wayne Huizenga and even Muscle 
Boy are gone, and many were surprised when Dombrowski decided to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed up a chance last September to join the Los Angeles  
Dodgers and instead signed a five-year, $5 million contract to 
remain with the Marlins. The deal made Dombrowski the best-paid 
general manager in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the paycheck is nice, the payroll is a problem. The  
Marlins are spending only $19 million on player salaries this year, 
compared with $79 million by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're never going to be in a market that allows a $100 million  
payroll,'' Dombrowski says. ``Would I like to have the Dodgers' 
money to spend? Sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Dombrowski concluded that he bleeds Marlin teal rather than  
Dodger blue. Instead of guiding the Dodgers' spending spree this 
past winter, he chose to remain with a Florida franchise that has 
financial problems, few stars, an inadequate ballpark and little 
fan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't want to leave,'' he says. ``There's a part of  
me that feels like I'm a Marlin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before new owner John Henry completed his purchase of the  
team this winter, he persuaded Dombrowski to stay. The Marlins 
subsequently were able to keep most of their staff in scouting and 
player development, a group that built one of the best farm systems 
in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave was really the glue of this organization,'' Henry says.  
``No one in the front office had a contract at that point. If Dave 
had left, I believe very few of our baseball people would have 
stayed. We would have been decimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction throughout the organization when he re-signed  
indicated to me that was the best move the owner could make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the perception that Huizenga bought the World Series  
title, Dombrowski received little credit for building a champion. 
Then Huizenga ordered the payroll slashed, and Dombrowski was 
forced to trade Sheffield, Kevin Brown, Al Leiter, Robb Nen, Bobby 
Bonilla and Charles Johnson, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	He never complained.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of good players on that team,'' Dombrowski  
says. ``Few of them had career years, and yet we won the World 
Series. It was a young team. It was a club that had payroll 
predictability for the future. We had a lot of young players coming 
up from within the system, and we could have moved them in to keep 
some stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was ideally set up to be a good club for a lot of years,  
but it wasn't meant to be. When you look back and think about what 
could have been, it hurts. But you have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dombrowski thinks an abundance of young talent will allow the  
Marlins to steadily improve the next few years. Florida played a 
major-league record 27 rookies last season, and the farm system is 
filled with top prospects acquired for the World Series stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the cupboard was bare,'' manager John Boles says, ``our  
general manager wouldn't have stayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Marlins' bid to return to title contention hinges on  
finances. Their payroll, which ranks ahead of only Montreal's, will 
remain small unless Henry can increase revenue by building a new 
ballpark with taxpayer support. 
</P>
<P>
	That will take years, and Dombrowski is willing to be patient.  
At the start of his seventh season with the Marlins, he plans to 
hang around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only 42,'' he says. ``As long as there's some chance to  
compete in the future, that's fine by me. Life has a way of working 
out well if you work hard.''

<HEADLINE> Banta Corp. To Close Three Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENASHA, Wis. (AP) -- Banta Corp. plans to close three plants  
that employ 350 people and eliminate about 300 positions at other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts announced Monday amount to about 9.2 percent of the  
printer and information processor's work force of about 7,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Banta said the moves were expected to result in $5 million to $7  
million in savings during the second half of this year and annual 
savings of $18 million to $20 million starting in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Banta said it would close its prepress facility in Charlotte,  
N.C., a mailing and fulfillment operation in Berkeley, Ill., and a 
printing plant in Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has 32 other operations in the United States  
and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Mark Fleming the three plants would close by  
the end of the second quarter. He said the other cuts were starting 
Monday and would continue over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Banta serves publishers of educational and general books,  
special-interest magazines, consumer and business catalogs, and 
direct marketing materials. Banta also offers global project 
management services, multimedia and software packages, interactive 
media, online services, and single-use healthcare products. 
</P>
<P>
	Banta said wherever possible, the job cuts will occur through  
attrition and normal retirements.

<HEADLINE> McDougal May Testify on Counsel Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If House Democrats have their way, Susan  
McDougal will be the star witness at a hearing next month on the 
fate of the expiring Watergate-inspired law that gave Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that she will testify,'' said Rep. William  
Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
commercial and administrative law. ``Obviously, she gives a 
perspective that we haven't heard from yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, President and Mrs. Clinton's former Whitewater  
partner, has been outspoken in her contempt of Starr and his 
efforts to get her to testify against the first couple regarding 
their land dealings. She spent 18 months in prison for refusing to 
testify, saying her decision was based on a fear she would be 
charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated the president 
and first lady in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury in Little Rock, Arkansas, acquitted Mrs. McDougal  
on Monday of obstruction of justice charges, and a deadlocked-jury 
mistrial was declared on two criminal contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony is sought by Democrats who attacked Starr during  
last year's presidential impeachment hearings for his tactics 
during five years of investigating Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Democrats have requested that one hearing be  
devoted to abuses of the 1978 law and are considering calling 
officials including former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
Delahunt said. Espy was acquitted in December of 30 charges brought 
by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz that he accepted gifts and 
entertainment from companies or organizations regulated by the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also have discussed calling Monica Lewinsky but  
believe Starr's restrictions against her public comments would 
prevent her from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Mrs. McDougal would be the star witness in a hearing  
that could open as early as May, Democratic counsel Julian Epstein 
said, but he cautioned that no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's under active consideration,'' Epstein said. He said he  
has talked with Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's acquittal was another in a series of blows to  
Starr, who saw the Senate acquit Clinton in February and is being 
investigated by the Justice Department on charges of illegally 
leaking grand jury information. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr and the three-judge panel that appointed him are to  
testify Wednesday on the future of the independent counsel law 
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Congress must 
decide whether to let the law die or extend it in some form.

<HEADLINE> McConnell-Miller New Tulsa Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Kathy McConnell-Miller became Tulsa's  
women's basketball coach Monday, eager to bring on the same 
turnaround she saw as an assistant at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell-Miller pointed to community and university support for  
women's athletics in explaining her decision to accept a job she 
had not sought. 
</P>
<P>
	``The enthusiasm that TU has is something I've looked for,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell-Miller was associate head coach at Illinois last  
season and an assistant there for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa athletic director Judy MacLeod said the school sought out  
McConnell-Miller because of her reputation as a recruiter, teacher 
and a ``terrific person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kathy brings to TU the personal characteristics and qualities  
we were looking for in a head coach,'' MacLeod said. ``Her coaching 
experience and past success has prepared her well for this 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She replaces Marla Odom, who revived the basketball program at  
Tulsa but resigned last month after three seasons. Odom's teams 
were 21-59.

<HEADLINE> Judge Finds Clinton in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled President Clinton  
in contempt of court Monday for giving ``intentionally false'' 
testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during 
questioning in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's finding, a civil rather than criminal ruling, orders  
Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones ``any reasonable expenses including 
attorneys' fees caused by his willful failure to obey this court's 
discovery orders.'' Presumably, the president's legal defense fund, 
which has raised $4.5 million, would pay the sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said she would delay  
enforcement for 30 days to give Clinton an opportunity to ask for a 
hearing or file a notice of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as minimal since the 
judge had the option of citing the president for criminal contempt. 
But the lawyers were keeping options open until they learn how 
large a monetary penalty Mrs. Jones might receive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, a public reminder of the Lewinsky controversy at a  
time that national interest has turned to Kosovo and other matters, 
came nearly three months after the Senate voted to acquit Clinton 
of impeachment charges that grew out of the relationship and his 
denials of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said her decision to dismiss the Jones case a year ago  
would not have changed, even if the president had been ``truthful 
with respect to his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones appealed the dismissal, but then she and Clinton  
agreed to settle, with him paying $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said in her ruling, ``The record demonstrates by clear  
and convincing evidence that the president responded to plaintiff's 
questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were 
designed to obstruct the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this  
nation's president in contempt of court,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said Mrs. Jones was entitled to information regarding any  
state or federal employee with whom the president had or proposed 
to have sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	In his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton said: ``I have  
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the president's DNA was found on a dress belonging to Ms.  
Lewinsky, he acknowledged an ``inappropriate intimate 
relationship'' with her before a federal grand jury last Aug. 17 -- 
and again in a nationally televised address. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the relationship did not fall under the definition  
of ``sexual relations'' provided by Mrs. Jones' lawyers during his 
deposition, and that his testimony was legally accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office,  
said Monday there would be no comment until the president's 
personal attorney in the case, Robert Bennett, had an opportunity 
to review the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, a Republican appointed by President Bush, is a former  
law student of Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	She also is the judge who sent Susan McDougal to jail for 18  
months for Mrs. McDougal's refusal to answer grand jury questions 
in Kenneth Starr's Whitewater inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright first raised the contempt issue in a footnote to a Sept.  
1, 1998, ruling in which she released Clinton's testimony in the 
Jones case. In that footnote, Wright said she had concerns about 
the president's deposition but made no findings as to possible 
contempt at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	In her decision Monday, the judge wrote, ``It is difficult to  
construe the president's sworn statements ... as anything other 
than a willful refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding  
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally 
false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in 
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally 
false,'' said the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	She directed Mrs. Jones' lawyers to submit a statement of their  
expenses and fees within 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton decides not respond, the court will enter an order  
setting out the time and manner by which Clinton has to comply with 
the sanctions, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the payment to Mrs. Jones, Clinton must reimburse  
to the court $1,202 to cover the judge's travel expenses in going 
to Washington at Clinton's request to preside over ``his tainted 
deposition'' on Jan. 17, 1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also said she will refer the matter to the Arkansas  
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct to review any 
disciplinary action it thinks is appropriate. She referred to the 
Model Rules of Professional Conduct that say that it is misconduct 
for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving ``dishonesty, fraud, 
deceit or misrepresentation.'' Clinton is a lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Refugees From Nazi Germany Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A refugee ship from Nazi Germany that was  
turned away from the United States is being remembered this week 
with a vigil at the Capitol and a museum exhibit that opened 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony Tuesday in the rotunda of the Capitol, an annual  
candle-lit remembrance of the Nazi killing of Jews, will be devoted 
this year to the voyage of the S.S. St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The German ship, was sent back to Europe, where many of the  
passengers who were refused asylum here eventually died in Nazi gas 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	One survivor is Herbert Karliner, 72, who boarded the ship in  
Hamburg, Germany, as a 12-year-old just before the start of World 
War II in 1939. He and his family had entry permits to Cuba, sold 
by a corrupt Cuban official, and hoped to live there until they 
could get U.S. visas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Havana government refused to let the 906 passengers  
land, calling their permits invalid. The ship then headed to the 
United States, but also was refused entry at Miami's port. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ship in limbo off the U.S. coast, there were repeated  
appeals to let the passengers come ashore, but all were turned down 
by the U.S. government. Eventually, the ship and its passengers 
returned to Europe, where many of the passengers later died in Nazi 
death camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are different now, said Curator Steven Luckert of the  
United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. It opened an 
exhibit Monday called ``Voyage of the St. Louis.'' As part of 
research for the exhibit, the museum has worked to determine what 
happened to each of the passengers aboard the St. Louis. So far, 
they have been unable to find 31 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 60 years later, the United States and its NATO allies are  
offering to shelter over 100,000 ethnic Albanians driven out of 
Kosovo by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps there was a moral imperative created by the  
Holocaust,'' Luckert said in an interview, ``a willingness in many 
cases for more sympathy, more passion and more resolve to do 
something about the fate of refugees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karliner remembers seeing Miami from the deck of the St. Louis  
60 years ago. He lives there now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it so vividly that I decided I wanted to go some time,''  
he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	When the St. Louis finally docked in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1939  
his family was able to go to France. When the Germans occupied 
France, they sent his parents and two sisters to the extermination 
camp at Auschwitz -- ``it was only 15 miles from where we'd lived,'' 
Karliner said. 
</P>
<P>
	They never came back.  
</P>
<P>
	Sympathetic French people hid Herbert and his brother Walter and  
they made their way after the war to the United States. Walter now 
runs an antique shop in Westbrook, Conn., Herbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbert, retired, had his own pastry shop in Miami.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1939 they didn't want us,'' he said. ``In 1950 they drafted  
me into the army.'' He spent a year in Japan as an army cook. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trip of the St. Louis, the New York Daily Mirror  
carried a cartoon of the Statue of Liberty holding a ``Keep Out'' 
sign.

<HEADLINE> Senator Complains on Stonewalling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator whose investigation of China's  
influence in Washington was seen as a failure thinks the era of 
congressional hearings with explosive Watergate-type findings may 
have passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The news media, Capitol Hill partisanship and the Clinton  
Justice Department share the blame, Sen. Fred Thompson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, the ability of Congress to really find out anything  
substantive in congressional hearings has been very, very 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had been asked whether he plans new hearings on China and the  
Clinton administration in light of recent allegations of nuclear 
spying and campaign-finance misdeeds involving Chinese military 
officials and Democratic party donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee, said the hearing process has degenerated to little more 
than committee members revealing what their staffs have found out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media's short attention span, the partisanship that we  
have and all of that makes it so that you can kind of lay out and 
demonstrate what you already have,'' Thompson said on ``Fox News 
Sunday. ``But finding something out is very, very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've relied on in this country for years and years ...  
is a strong prosecution team, an independent counsel, a special 
counsel, or a Justice department who's aggressive,'' Thompson said. 
``That produces people who want to make deals, who want to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said: ``That hasn't happened in this case. The real  
scandal in this case (his committee's investigation) emanates from 
the Justice Department more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During China hearings in 1997, Thompson was stymied by Attorney  
General Janet Reno's decisions to withhold grants of immunity to 
crucial witnesses and by other actions Thompson considered unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno also has angered Thompson and other Republicans by refusing  
to seek the appointment of independent counsels to investigate some 
administration officials. Nevertheless, she has sought seven 
independent counsels, more than any other attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thompson has not given up completely on the hearings  
process: His committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on extending 
the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witnesses are prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who made the  
case the House used to impeach President Clinton, and the three 
federal judges who appointed Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is known as lukewarm on the law, despite repeated  
requests that Reno use it for China investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem, though, in totally doing away with it is that  
(any investigation) goes back to the Justice Department,'' Thompson 
said Sunday. ``And when I look at the performance of this Justice 
Department ..., it gives me cause for concern and hesitation.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Impeachment Debate Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin said a looming impeachment  
debate should take place soon as scheduled or be dropped 
completely, the Kremlin said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house is tentatively scheduled to begin the  
impeachment debate Thursday, but lawmakers are still discussing the 
possibility of postponing it. Leaders of the various factions 
planned to meet later today to decide how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, meanwhile, spoke with the speaker of parliament,  
Gennady Seleznyov, and said the impeachment issue should be debated 
now or dropped altogether, the presidential press service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's supporters -- and even a few of his rivals -- have  
called on the State Duma to put off the debate, saying it could 
further destabilize Russia's political situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment motion is considered unlikely to succeed, but  
Yeltsin's frequent illnesses and the nation's economic crisis have 
weakened his authority and made his ouster more likely than it once 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion must win a two-thirds majority in both houses of  
parliament and approval by Russia's two highest courts. 
</P>
<P>
	A Duma panel has charged Yeltsin with instigating the 1991  
Soviet collapse, improperly using force against hard-line lawmakers 
in 1993, launching the botched war in separatist Chechnya, bringing 
the nation's military to ruin and waging genocide against the 
Russian people by pursuing economic policies that impoverished the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also met today with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in  
the Kremlin for talks on the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	They also discussed ways to free a Russian humanitarian aid  
convoy that was stopped Sunday at the Hungarian border, while on 
its way to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungarian officials said the five armor-plated vehicles in the  
convoy violated the international arms embargo on Yugoslavia. The 
Hungarians have halted the rest of the convoy, which includes more 
than 60 trucks, due to a dispute over fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin sent Russia's Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei  
Shoigu to Hungary to deal with the problem, and Russia's Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov called in the Hungarian ambassador to protest 
the decision to halt the convoy.

<HEADLINE> BoxCar Willie Dies of Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- BoxCar Willie, whose gentle country voice  
and songs of life on the road evoked memories of a time when hobos 
watched America pass by from the door of a freight car, died Monday 
of leukemia. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	He died at home, a family spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	He had recently announced he was canceling his 1999 season of  
shows when the disease, first diagnosed in 1996, returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his health began to fail, was not only a Branson performer  
but one of the music town's elder statesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Clark became the first nationally known entertainer to put  
his name on a Branson theater in 1983. But BoxCar Willie liked to 
boast that unlike Clark, who often booked other people into his 
venue, he became the first name entertainer to work the town 
year-round when he arrived in 1987.

<HEADLINE> First-Time Playwright Wins Pulitzer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Wit,'' winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for  
drama, is a rare achievement -- a meditation on death that is 
emotional without being sentimental, intellectual without being 
ponderous. 
</P>
<P>
	It chronicles the final hours of a college professor battling  
ovarian cancer. An expert on the poetry of John Donne, the woman is 
independent yet needy, courageous yet terrified. In other words, 
she is full of the contradictions that create a memorable stage 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes ``Wit'' all the more remarkable is that it is a first  
play, written in 1991 when its author, Margaret Edson, was 30. 
Edson once worked in a research hospital which deals with cancer 
and AIDS patients. Today, she teaches kindergarten in an Atlanta 
elementary school. No wonder compassion and humor permeate the 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	The professor analyzes her fatal illness as if she were  
dissecting one of Donne's poems. The woman journeys from the world 
of the rational to a higher, almost spiritual plane as she 
reassesses what she has accomplished with her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wit'' once again demonstrates the decline of Broadway as the  
showplace for new American drama. Edson's play was born in the 
not-for-profit theater. The play had its world premiere in 1995 at 
South Coast Rep in Costa Mesa, Calif. A second production opened 
two years later at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Connecticut production, directed by Derek Anson Jones  
(a high school classmate of Edson's), that found its way to New 
York. The play arrived at Manhattan Class Company's tiny 99-seat 
theater in September 1998. After rave reviews, it quickly became 
one of the hottest tickets in town. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet ``Wit'' has found success in the commercial arena, too. It  
reopened in January at a larger off-Broadway theater and, defying 
skeptics who predicted audiences do not want to see plays about 
people dying of cancer, recouped its $700,000 production costs in 
less than four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the praise for the production has gone to its star,  
Kathleen Chalfant, until now best known as the Mormon mother in the 
original production of ``Angels in America.'' Wearing a hospital 
gown and a red baseball cap to hide her shaven head, Chalfant gives 
the play a fierce intensity to which audiences respond. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether Edson will write another play (a second called  
``Satisfied'' has not been produced) is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	When reached Monday at Atlanta's Centennial Park Elementary  
School, where she was cleaning her classroom, Edson said, ``We're 
in the middle of studying insects and nothing can take me away. I 
will continue teaching. I enjoy it.''

<HEADLINE> Land Conservation Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Proposals being considered by Congress for spending on land  
conservation: 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton ``land legacy'' initiative: Would double conservation  
spending to $1.1 billion. Includes $642 million for direct purchase 
of land, two-thirds federal and the rest by states; $154 million 
for marine resource restoration; $150 million for farmland and open 
spaces preservation. No legislation yet proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Boxer-Miller: Would spend $2.3 billion, including $900 million  
for conservation land purchases, divided equally between federal 
and states; $100 million for endangered species recovery; $750 
million for wildlife recovery and marine resource restoration. 
Introduced by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., S446, and Rep. George 
Miller, D-Calif., H798. Money distributed nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Landrieu-Murkowski bill: Would spend $2.1 billion, including  
$620 million for land purchases, equally divided between federal 
and states, and $1.16 billion in ``impact assistance'' from 
offshore oil drilling. Introduced by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., 
and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, S25. 
</P>
<P>
	--Young-Dingell bill: Require 60 percent of federal revenue from  
offshore oil drilling go to conservation programs. Spending 
estimated at $2.59 billion, using 1998 revenue figures, with about 
half ($1.24 billion) going for oil-drilling impact assistance; $836 
million for state and federal land purchases; $144 million for 
urban parks; $459 million for wildlife conservation. Reps. Don 
Young, R-Alaska, and John Dingell, D-Mich., H700. 
</P>
<P>
	--Distribution: Under the Young-Dingell bill, three-fourths of  
the oil drilling impact assistance would go to five states: 
Louisiana ($360 million), Texas ($205 million), Alaska ($150 
million), California ($125 million) and Florida ($115 million). 
Landrieu-Murkowski bill has a similar distribution.

<HEADLINE> Child-Care Centers Found Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two in three child care facilities surveyed by  
a federal consumer safety agency had safety hazards that put 
children at risk. The problems ranged from playgrounds without 
proper padding to loops on window blind cords. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission surveyed 220 facilities,  
including centers run by the federal government, for-profit and 
nonprofit companies, along with private homes that provide child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was released Monday by first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton, who visited a local child care center to highlight 
parents' troubles with child care and to advocate more federal 
money to help parents pay for care. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey looked for eight hazards that relate to the products  
regulated by the commission. States are responsible for regulating 
the safety of child care centers, and these particular hazards may 
not be barred by law in many states. But the commission hopes to 
alert parents and centers to the potential dangers, said spokesman 
Russ Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a 'gotcha' situation where we're saying these  
child care providers are bad,'' Rader said. ``We're simply pointing 
out some safety areas where even the best parents or child care 
providers may not be aware there's a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission works with manufacturers to correct these  
problems but wants parents and child care providers to look for 
them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the facilities surveyed had at least one of the  
eight hazards. Specifically, the survey found: 
</P>
<P>
	--At four in 10 facilities, children were wearing clothing with  
drawstrings around their necks, which can catch on objects and 
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four centers had loops on window blind cords that can  
strangle a child. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in four did not have safe playground surfacing, meaning if  
children fall off playground equipment they could be seriously 
injured when hitting a hard surface. Grass, for instance, is too 
hard a surface. Each year, there are 90,000 playground-related 
injuries each year to children under age 6, many of which involve 
falls, the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	--One in five facilities had cribs with soft bedding, which can  
suffocate infants. Each year, up to 900 babies who die from Sudden 
Infant Death Syndrome may have suffocated on soft bedding. 
</P>
<P>
	--Child safety gates were not used where needed at 13 percent of  
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers surveyed were randomly selected but not necessarily  
reflective of the nation as a whole, Rader said.

<HEADLINE> Genetech Sees Earnings Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Genentech's first-quarter profits  
plunged nearly 65 percent as a result of a $50 million charge to 
settle a federal probe into its aggressive marketing of a human 
growth hormone, the biotechnology firm said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings fell to 11 cents per share, or $14.4 million, in the  
quarter ended March 31, compared to 32 cents per share, or $41.0 
million in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the proposed 
Justice Department settlement, earnings would have been 44 cents 
per share, a dime better than analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetech's first-quarter revenues increased 22 percent to $322.3  
million, driven by sales of breast cancer drug Herceptin, and 
Rituxan, a drug for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales were phenomenal,'' said Greg Miliotes, an analyst with  
BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``This is a one-time settlement and 
it does not affect their ongoing growth potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently agreed with that sentiment; shares of  
Genentech rose $2.68 3/4 to close at $87.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which remains subject to court approval, was  
reached amid allegations that for nine years Genentech promoted the 
hormone Protropin for uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Review Gets New Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Columbia Journalism Review is getting a new  
publisher and will probably undergo some changes to respond to the 
rapidly evolving industry and the rise in media criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	David Laventhol, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times, will  
become publisher of CJR in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Laventhol will be the first publisher in the magazine's 38-year  
history who has not served as dean of the Columbia University 
Graduate School of Journalism. He succeeds Joan Konner, who has 
been publisher since 1988, when she became dean. She stepped down 
as dean in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	CJR's editor, Marshall Loeb, said readers will see changes in  
the magazine some time next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is on the table and should be,'' Loeb said.  
</P>
<P>
	Laventhol said in a statement that he hopes to ``make the review  
even more valuable in the context of the world of rapid change that 
today's journalists live in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laventhol retired last summer from the Times Mirror Co. During  
his 30-year tenure, he served as president of the company, 
publisher and editor of Newsday, and publisher of the Los Angeles 
Times. He also served on the Pulitzer Prize board for nine years 
and was its chairman in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	CJR has a circulation of just under 30,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Classic features such as its ``Darts &AMP; Laurels'' column and  
``The Lower case,'' which reproduces amusing errors, are not likely 
to change. But many other aspects of its format and content will be 
scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb noted that when CJR was first published, ``we had the field  
pretty much to ourselves.'' Now it is facing competition from the 
American Journalism Review, Brill's Content and media critics for 
various publications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are constantly reappraising what we can do to further  
distinguish ourselves, to make CJR still more urgent, still more 
relevant,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Xena' Lucy Lawless Is Pregnant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There's a little warrior prince or princess  
on the way for ``Xena'' star Lucy Lawless. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old actress and husband Rob Tapert, the show's  
executive producer, announced Monday they're expecting their first 
child this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' will continue and will  
accommodate the pregnancy of Miss Lawless for all episodes of the 
new season, publicist Leah Krantzler said. The new season begins 
shooting April 19 in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baby is due in October during the series' longest annual  
hiatus,'' the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Lawless, who plays the tough-talking, leather-clad lead on  
the syndicated TV show, married Tapert, 44, in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Tapert's first marriage and the second for Miss Lawless,  
who has a 10-year-old daughter from her first marriage.

<HEADLINE> Mets Put Piazza, Reed on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While the New York Mets keep winning games, they  
keep losing players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Rick Reed was put on the 15-day disabled list before  
today's home opener against Florida because of a torn calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not an Achilles' tendon injury,'' general manager  
Steve Phillips said, describing the diagnosis as good news. ``It's 
likely at the end of the 15 days we'll be able to activate him and 
put him back in the rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, 16-11 with a 3.48 ERA last season, hurt his left leg  
trying to stretch his game-tying RBI single into a double during 
Sunday's 6-3 win at Montreal. ``I don't want to miss my next 
start,'' he said. ``I don't think I will. It started to stiffen up 
but after I got some ice I was able to walk around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star catcher Mike Piazza also was put on the disabled list  
today, retroactive to Saturday, after spraining the medial 
collateral ligament in his right knee during a rundown Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	New York filled the roster spots by recalling left-hander Rigo  
Beltran and outfielder Terrence Long from Norfolk of the 
International League. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine said Allen Watson would take Reed's turn  
in the rotation against Philadelphia this weekend and that Todd 
Pratt would be the everyday catcher until Piazza returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss a big cog, but we're going to be able to  
play,'' Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza didn't want go on the disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor made it clear that if I do play, and I run the  
bases and suddenly have to change directions it could be a full 
tear and that would mean surgery,'' he said. ``Considering that 
possibility, I figure that this is for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets returned home after a 5-2 opening road trip and sent  
Bobby Jones (1-0) against Livan Hernandez (0-1) on a cold but sunny 
afternoon at Shea Stadium. The Mets had an advance sale of about 
45,000 coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels like the season didn't start yet because we've  
been on the road, so tomorrow I guess the season will start,'' 
closer John Franco said after Sunday's game. ``We'll have our own 
crowd behind us, rather than everyone else's. We've played two home 
openers, Florida and here, and now we'll have our own, and guys can 
get settled in and get apartments and get used to the home 
surroundings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the Mets' first game at Shea Stadium since their  
season-ending flop last year, when they went 0-5 and scored just 
seven runs to finish one game behind Chicago and San Francisco in 
the NL wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will be Bobby Bonilla's first game at Shea Stadium in a  
Mets uniform since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some pretty good opening days for New York, so that's  
one positive thing,'' Bonilla said. ``But everybody's really pretty 
fired up. We were able to do a nice job here in Montreal, which was 
very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have won five of six since losing their opener at Miami  
last Monday. But because of Piazza's injury, many fans worry 
whether their offense will struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they'll be disappointed that he's not there because  
he's such a great player,'' first baseman John Olerud said. ``He's 
the guy for us, offensively speaking, and so it definitely hurts 
having him out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we have a good team. We have a lot of good guys on  
this team, guys that can swing the bat, so hopefully we can pick up 
the slack until he comes back.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Must Pay Ex-Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A state appeals court overturned Barry  
Bonds' prenuptial agreement with his ex-wife today and granted her 
half of his baseball earnings during their nearly seven-year 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds and his first wife, Sun, signed an agreement the day  
before their wedding in February 1988 in which they relinquished 
the right to community property and agreed to keep future earnings 
separate. The effect was to deny her a 50 percent share of his 
salary, which was $8 million a year when they divorced in December 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled today the agreement  
was invalid because Mrs. Bonds didn't have her own lawyer, was not 
told by Bonds' attorneys why she needed a lawyer, and was warned by 
Bonds' agent that there would be no wedding unless she signed. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement itself was filled with typographical errors and  
appears to have been altered by Bonds or his representatives before 
a copy was presented in court, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Mrs. Bonds, a Swedish immigrant who had been in the  
United States only a month, did not understand English well and was 
advised only by a Swedish friend, while Bonds was represented by 
two lawyers and a financial adviser, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 ruling concluded that Mrs. Bonds did not voluntarily  
surrender her right to community property. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Paige Wickland, said Mrs. Bonds would not be  
entitled to half of everything Bonds was paid. With some 
exceptions, she would be limited to half the money and property 
that remained from his earnings when they separated in May 1994, 
Wickland said. That amount has yet to be determined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling is ``very important because more people are doing  
premarital agreements and they should be fair and fairly 
procured,'' Wickland said. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, she said, ``one side had everything, had all the  
money and got all the benefits of the agreement. ...There was no 
one who was looking out for her benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' lawyer, Richard Sherman, could not be reached immediately  
for comment.

<HEADLINE> GW Guard Rogers Gets Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- George Washington guard Shawnta Rogers  
has been selected to receive the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as 
the nation's best college player under 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-4 senior from Baltimore will be honored May 22 at the  
Basketball Hall of Fame's College Awards Day, hall officials 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was chosen Atlantic 10 player of the year this season  
after leading the league in scoring (20.7 points), assists (6.7), 
steals (3.6) and free throw shooting (87 percent). He led the 
Colonials to a 20-9 record last season and a berth in the NCAA 
tournament where they lost to Indiana in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award is named in honor of the  
daughter-in-law of basketball inventor James Naismith. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was selected for the award by a panel of collegiate  
coaches.

<HEADLINE> Slain Ky. Students' Parents To Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The families of three students killed in a  
high school shooting spree sued several entertainment companies for 
$130 million Monday, charging that violent computer games, Internet 
porn and a Leonardo DiCaprio movie contributed to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game  
industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites,'' said attorney 
Jack Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Carneal, a 14-year-old freshman at Heath High School,  
opened fire in 1997 with a stolen pistol on a group of students in 
the lobby as their prayer group was breaking up. Carneal pleaded 
guilty but mentally ill to murder and other charges and got life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims that Carneal was influenced by ``The  
Basketball Diaries.'' In the 1995 movie, DiCaprio's drug-addled 
character, during a dream sequence, guns down a teacher and some 
classmates at his school. 
</P>
<P>
	Carneal also enjoyed playing popular, ultraviolent computer  
games such as ``Doom,'' ``Quake'' and ``Redneck Rampage,'' which 
honed his shooting skills, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the teen-ager also frequently logged onto the Internet and  
looked at sexually violent material made available through at least 
two sex sites, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 25 defendants are Time Warner Inc., Polygram Film  
Entertainment Distribution Inc., Palm Pictures, Island Pictures and 
New Line Cinema, all of which were involved in ``The Basketball 
Diaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Internet sex sites named are Meow Media Inc. and Network  
Authentication Systems Inc. Also named are video game unit 
manufacturers Nintendo, Sega and Sony; and software companies id 
software inc. and Interplay Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to most of the entertainment companies were not  
immediately returned. Telephone numbers for the Internet sites were 
not available.
