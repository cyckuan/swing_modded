<HEADLINE> Fla. Prisons To Videotape Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- State prison workers will begin  
videotaping all instances where inmates are forcibly removed from 
their cells following a prisoner's death after a confrontation with 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy is already in place at Florida State Prison, where  
death row inmate Frank Valdes died July 17 after he refused to let 
himself be handcuffed and removed from his cell. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy was extended Wednesday to 53 other state prisons,  
said C.J. Drake, a Department of Corrections spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is being done systemwide so there is a video record of  
what happened,'' Drake said, adding that forced removals are rare 
and that ``they are done only as a last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven guards have been placed on administrative leave with pay  
while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and FBI investigate 
Valdes' death and other abuse allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an independent autopsy has been ordered by Valdes'  
family, which is planning to file a lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to see the body of Mr. Valdes' and it was evident  
that he was badly beaten,'' said Stuart Goldenberg, an attorney 
representing Valdes' wife and father. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of Valdes' first autopsy, performed by a state medical  
examiner, have been withheld by state officials because of the 
ongoing criminal investigation.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Falls on New J.D. Power List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn buyers were less satisfied with their  
dealers than customers of five other automotive franchises, which 
ousted Saturn from the top position in the annual J.D. Power and 
Associates study of automotive sales satisfaction for the first 
time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac, Jaguar and Volvo tied for first place, followed by  
Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz. Saturn finished in a tie with BMW and 
Lexus, according to the market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn, the small-car unit of General Motors Corp., apparently  
fell out of the top spot because more customers were feeling 
pressured during the purchase of their new car. J.D. Power said the 
percentage of buyers under pressure increased to 18 percent from 13 
percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We noted what the customer interpreted as being a little more  
negotiation with the deal, especially with the trade-in or the 
financing and insurance,'' Loretta Seymour, J.D. Power's director 
of sales satisfaction research, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That came as a surprise to Saturn officials. Saturn's success  
has been based in large part on its friendly, down-home atmosphere 
and no-haggle pricing, which makes the sales process faster and 
less stressful. It has attracted a loyal following of owners and 
repeat buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Tom Wilkinson said Saturn's own research showed its  
customers remained pleased with the Saturn sales process. He said 
officials planned to meet with J.D. Power ``to help us decide what 
continuous improvement steps we might need to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power speculated that lower sales at Saturn in the past  
year have put more pressure on Saturn's sales staff to maintain 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their inventories have been rising over the past year,'' Ms.  
Seymour said. ``So, yes, there is probably more pressure within the 
Saturn dealerships to go after the sale. But I think also what 
might be contributing to that loss of sales is the fact that they 
have a product that really has been around for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn sells just one line of subcompact cars, but plans to add  
a midsize model in the 2000 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that overall customer satisfaction with the  
experience of buying a new vehicle remained virtually unchanged. 
But more customers reported they were satisfied with the price they 
paid, a reflection of competitive pressures on the industry to keep 
price increases to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor cited was the increased amount of pricing  
information available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the brands that ranked above the industry average, 11 were  
U.S. divisions of GM, Ford Motor Co. or DaimlerChrysler AG, eight 
were European and two were Japanese. Fifteen automakers ranked 
below the industry average. They included Toyota, Volkswagen, 
Dodge, Ford, Honda and Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power, based in Agoura Hills, Calif., surveyed 42,700  
buyers of 1999 cars, minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles 
bought in January or February. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm, which sells information to the industry and licenses  
its awards for use in advertising, issues several annual surveys 
that are closely watched by automakers.

<HEADLINE> Woman Rescued on Mount St. Helens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YACOLT, Wash. (AP) -- Rescue crews battled blowing volcanic ash  
as they were lowered from a helicopter Wednesday to reach a woman 
who fell 20 feet into a crevasse near the summit of Mount St. 
Helens. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old woman was hiking with a group when she fell into  
the crevasse and apparently hurt her back, said paramedic Mike 
Hollingsworth of North Country Emergency Medical Services in 
Yacolt. 
</P>
<P>
	An Air Force Reserves helicopter from Portland, Ore., arrived  
but could not land because of thick, blowing ash left from the 
mountain's eruption on May 18, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who was about 6,800 feet up the 8,366-foot volcano,  
was hoisted about 60 feet through the air into the helicopter at 
about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	She was taken to a hospital and in serious condition, although  
her injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, 
Hollingsworth said. Her identity was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> GOP To Ask States To Return $6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Desperately seeking cash for routine spending  
bills, House Republican leaders intend to ask the nation's 
governors to return up to $6 billion in welfare money accumulated 
by the states in recent years, according to congressional 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
idea was broached most recently by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP 
whip, at a leadership meeting. It was approved by Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., as part of a months-long struggle by the GOP to 
win approval of all 13 regular spending measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having an impact on Congress' spending battles,  
the proposal could pose a dilemma for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
who is not only the elected leader of the nation's second-largest 
state, but also the front-runner for the GOP presidential 
nomination. Karen Hughes, an aide to Bush, said there had not yet 
been any contact with the governor's office. Moreover, she said, 
``we may, in fact, end up not having a substantial surplus'' for a 
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the return of money would be an irony for a political  
party whose oft-articulated philosophy is to ship money and power 
to the states. In addition, some GOP aides acknowledge, it could 
require Republican governors to choose between tax cuts at home and 
spending needs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Under welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, the nation's  
governors were guaranteed preset levels of funding for five years. 
Governors lobbied for the guarantee, saying they were assuming a 
risk; namely, that the demand for welfare money would outstrip the 
supply of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides in the House, though, say the opposite has  
happened -- that the federal government has been giving money and 
power back to the states and welfare rolls have gone down, leaving 
the states flush with money. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, several lawmakers and aides expressed doubt that the  
governors would be willing to voluntarily send money back to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat was harshly critical. ``Why should we be surprised  
that the House Republicans want to pay for their tax cut, 
two-thirds of which goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of the people 
in this society, by kicking the props out once again from 
low-income families and children with some of the toughest problems 
in the country,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the senior 
Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to find money outside Washington comes at a time when  
House Republicans are struggling mightily to win approval for all 
13 regular spending bills, while being able to claim at least the 
appearance of living within spending restraints imposed in the 1997 
balanced budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, they have resorted to a number of budgetary artifices  
to avoid the spending limits. Republicans recently declared $4.5 
billion for the 2000 Census to be an emergency -- meaning it would 
be above and beyond the spending limits in place and be paid for 
out of budget surplus funds. 
</P>
<P>
	This and other devices still leave Republicans an estimated $12  
billion short of funds they estimate will be needed to permit 
passage of legislation financing programs at the departments of 
Health and Human Services, Education and Labor. Work on the bill 
was recently sidetracked until September.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Denounces Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to fashion a gun control compromise  
inched forward in Congress on Wednesday despite a defiant speech 
from newly independent Sen. Bob Smith urging voters to defeat 
senators who support such legislation, regardless of their party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who bolted from the Republican Party this month, likened  
the Senate's gun control supporters to agents of Fidel Castro's 
government in Cuba, whom, he said, went door to door confiscating 
guns after they gained power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is interesting,'' Smith said. ``Tyrannical governments  
taking our guns, members of the Senate and the media taking our 
guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire senator, who is expected to run for the White  
House on a third-party ticket, twice appealed to ``my fellow 
Americans'' in his lengthy remarks, and vowed to filibuster any gun 
control compromise that returns to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of gun control legislation is unclear in the  
Republican-controlled Congress despite a surge in public support in 
the wake of last spring's shootings at Columbine High School in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved legislation in May to crack down on juvenile  
crime, with a handful of gun control provisions attached. These 
include a requirement for instant background checks on all sales at 
gun shows, a requirement that safety devices be sold with all 
handguns and a ban on the importation of certain high-capacity 
ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure contains none of those provisions, although  
efforts at negotiating a compromise are expected. For more than a 
week, Smith had blocked the Senate from taking the routine 
parliamentary steps needed to begin those talks. Lawmakers voted 
77-22 to go ahead, though, and the New Hampshire lawmaker announced 
he would fall back and wait for compromise talks to conclude before 
taking his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, parliamentary rules required the Senate to  
delete at the last minute the provision relating to high-ammunition 
clips. It is expected to be reinserted by House and Senate 
negotiators in a final compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has been treated gently by the Senate's GOP leadership  
despite his recent defection in what aides say is a calculated bid 
by Majority Leader Trent Lott and others to avoid turning him into 
a magnet for conservative voters the Republican Party needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on the Senate floor, Smith appealed to voters to  
begin paying close attention to what he said were attempts to 
trample on the Second Amendment's guarantee to possess arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you need to start throwing those people out of here,'' he  
said. ``That's what you need to do. I don't care what party they 
are. It's irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also spoke scathingly of the news media, which he said is  
solidly aligned with the forces advocating gun control. ``It would 
be interesting to take a little poll to find out how many of these 
news media pack a little sidearm somewhere to protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also made a passing reference to O.J. Simpson, who was  
acquitted in 1995 on charges of murdering his wife. Simpson, he 
said, should have gone to jail.

<HEADLINE> Bank Sues Over Internet Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- Harbor Florida Bancshares has sued the  
anonymous author of derogatory postings on a Yahoo! Internet 
message board, which included rumors of an imminent takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed against John Doe in Santa Clara County  
Superior Court in Northern California, claims the messenger -- known 
only as ``maytricks-99'' was seeking to manipulate the company's 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	The author repeatedly wrote that Harbor Florida management  
should sell out to a bigger bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside shareholders unite and storm the Bastille, er the  
downtown Fort Pierce office, and demand your $42 per share Monday 
morning,'' he wrote in one message. 
</P>
<P>
	Since May 5, Yahoo! users have posted 120 messages about Harbor  
Florida, 54 of them written by maytricks-99. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbor Florida sued for $25,000, plus costs, interest and  
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbor president Michael Brown would not comment on the  
specifics of the case, saying only that ``this is becoming a 
national problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, also declined  
comment. The Internet company is not named as a defendant in the 
suit.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Sign Top Pick Edwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers signed first-round  
draft pick Troy Edwards on Wednesday, ensuring that the wide 
receiver will be in training camp on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The team refused to announce terms of the multi-year contract.  
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has reported that Edwards' deal was for 
$6.3 million over five years, including a $4 million signing bonus. 
The deal would make Edwards the highest-paid rookie in Steelers 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-9 Edwards was the 13th pick in this year's draft. He  
is expected to bolster the offense, and could return kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Louisiana Tech, Edwards set a NCAA Division I-A record with  
50 touchdown catches over three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Pittsburgh's wide receivers scored just 13  
touchdowns. Charles Johnson, who caught seven, left the team via 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced the signings of third-round offensive  
tackle Kris Farris and free agent safety Vann Washington, who led 
the Berlin Thunder of the NFL Europe League in tackles this past 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, defensive end Kevin Henry signed a multi-year  
extension with the Steelers. Terms of that deal were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Probe of Tobacco Co. Lobbying Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Government watchdog groups want state ethics  
officials to investigate whether cigarette maker Philip Morris 
reported all of the money it spent to lobby New York state 
lawmakers in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The request to the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying came  
as The New York Times reported that the world's biggest cigarette 
maker had spent tens of thousands of dollars in recent years on 
gifts to New York lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported Tuesday that about 115 current and former  
state legislators accepted gifts such as expensive meals and 
tickets to the U.S. Open from Philip Morris. The report was based 
on interviews and itemized lobbying expenses included in Philip 
Morris documents in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the expenses found by the Times appear to have been  
disclosed by Philip Morris, according to a letter sent Tuesday to 
the lobbying commission by the state chapters of Common Cause, the 
New York Public Interest Research Group and the League of Women 
Voters. 
</P>
<P>
	State law requires lobbyists and their clients to disclose all  
expenses, with a specific description of those expenses that are in 
excess of $75, the watchdog groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics rules passed in the late 1980s prohibit legislators from  
accepting gifts of more than $75 if they are intended as a reward 
or to influence decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Philip Morris spokesman K. Richmond Temple  
was not immediately returned. His office faxed a statement saying 
Philip Morris engages in ``lawful lobbying and contribution 
activities in Albany.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Regrets? Paul Reubens, the alter-ego of Pee-Wee  
Herman, has a few -- like the look on his face in the infamous 1991 
mug shot photo after his arrest for indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>

real to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so reflective of the moment it was taken, where I was  
just going, `Oh my God! What is going to happen next?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest that spawned a thousand jokes occurred in an adult  
movie theater, and it took the creator of ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' 
years to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know it would be as huge as it was, but I knew it  
would be a big deal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jays Acquire Segui From Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- First baseman David Segui was dealt from the  
Seattle Mariners to the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday for pitchers 
Tom Davey and Steve Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
	Segui, 33, is hitting .293 this season in 90 games with 22  
doubles, three triples, nine home runs and 39 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly he's going to help our lineup,'' said Blue Jays  
general manager Gord Ash, who for the first time since being hired 
as the GM in 1994 is not dumping players before the July 31 trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	`He's an experienced bat, an experienced player,'' Ash said,  
``and any time you can add that kind of experience as you're going 
down the stretch, that's a very positive thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui, in Kansas City where the Mariners were playing the  
Royals, refused to talk to reporters as he left the clubhouse. The 
Blue Jays weren't immediately able to talk to him either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a free agent at the end of the year. We got a  
couple of good young pitchers for him,'' Mariners manager Lou 
Piniella said. ``I talked to David when he got to the ballpark and 
informed him of the trade. I thanked him for his contribution here 
and wished him well. He's a good player. I told him he's going to a 
contending club and he'll enjoy that for the next couple of 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segui has a .284 career average with 97 homers and 474 RBIs in a  
10-season career with Baltimore, the New York Mets, Montreal and 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said Segui will see playing time at  
first base, designated hitter and in the outfield. As a result, 
first baseman Carlos Delgado will see some time at designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally I'd like to be out there as much as possible, but  
I'll do anything to help the club win,'' Delgado said. ``I think 
Segui is going to help us. I'm happy the front office is showing 
the commitment to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Seattle traded outfielder Butch Huskey to the Boston  
Red Sox for minor league left-hander Robert Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
	Davey, 25, has split the 1999 season between the Blue Jays and  
Syracuse of the Triple-A International League, going 1-1 with one 
save and a 4.70 ERA with Toronto before he was sent down June 28. 
He was 1-2 with a 3.48 ERA at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting two good young arms from the Toronto  
organization,'' Piniella said. ``Both have big league experience. 
They're going to come in and join our bullpen in the next several 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair, 27, appeared in three games with Toronto this season  
and was 0-0 with a 12.71 ERA. He went 2-2 at Syracuse with 18 saves 
and a 2.06 ERA in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sinclair gives us a young left-hander ... and Davey is a power  
arm,'' Mariners general manager Woody Woodward said. ``Segui has 
done a nice job for us, but we feel we can afford to deal offense 
to improve our pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Tries Preserving Hubbell Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fine print in presidential friend Webster  
Hubbell's agreement with prosecutor Kenneth Starr is giving Hubbell 
a shot at erasing his guilty plea to a misdemeanor tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is saddled with an appeals court ruling that makes his tax  
case against Hubbell hard to prove. Under the agreement with 
Hubbell, Starr needs to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn that 
ruling for the guilty plea to remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Starr asked the high court to hear his appeal and  
give him a chance to preserve Hubbell's guilty plea. If the court 
denies review or rules against Starr, he has agreed to seek 
dismissal of Hubbell's June 30 plea to the tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hubbell's guilty plea to a felony charge of concealing  
legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land project would not be 
affected. Hubbell, the former No. 3 Justice Department official, 
was sentenced in June to a year of probation after entering the 
guilty pleas that wrapped up the Whitewater phase of Starr's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax charge alleged that Hubbell evaded paying taxes on some  
of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received from friends of 
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1994 when he was 
under criminal investigation by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled in January that Starr could  
prosecute Hubbell on the tax charge but set a high legal standard 
for use by prosecutors of Hubbell's own financial papers, which he 
was required to produce under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell had argued that using the papers to prosecute him would  
violate his right against self-incrimination, granted by the 
Constitution's Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court decision ``essentially requires advance  
knowledge of the contents of a document as a prerequisite of a 
right to use the document's contents,'' Starr's appeal to the 
Supreme Court said. ``That is a daunting standard that no 
prosecutor is ever likely to meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The June 30 plea agreement specified that Starr would take that  
issue to the nation's highest court. If the court denies review or 
fails to rule in the independent counsel's favor, Starr agreed to 
seek dismissal of Hubbell's guilty plea on the tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  
said Starr would need to show ``reasonably particular knowledge'' 
of Hubbell's financial records before they were subpoenaed to be 
able to use information from them.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Gaylord Entertainment Co. is acquiring  
majority interest in two online music services for $15 million, the 
company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Gaylord Entertainment a 51 percent interest in  
GBRJ Music LLC, also known as Musicforce.com. 
</P>
<P>
	GBRJ Music used part of its proceeds to buy 100 percent of KMA  
Companies. GBRJ will move to Nashville, but Musicforce will remain 
in Dallas, where both companies are now based. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Gaylord Entertainment division, known as  
GETdigitalmedia, will ``initiate a focused Internet strategy,'' 
according to an announcement by Terry E. London, president and 
chief executive officer of Gaylord Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to be the No. 1 sites on the Internet for  
Christian music, country music and the convention industry,'' 
London said.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote Soon on Holbrooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will probably vote next week on the  
long-delayed nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, D-S.D., said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had  
told him the vote will occur before lawmakers leave on their summer 
recess at the end of next week. Until now, at least four GOP 
senators, including Lott, have blocked Holbrooke's nomination from 
coming to a vote, even though he has broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has indicated that it will probably take some debate time  
and a vote,'' Daschle told reporters. ``I certainly appreciate the 
need to do that, given the opposition on his side, in some cases, 
to Mr. Holbrooke. But we'll do that, we'll schedule the time and 
make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Lott spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. job has been vacant since Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson left the post in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's nomination has been stalled for more than a year,  
initially because of ethical questions about some of his actions as 
an investment banker. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
unanimously approved the nomination June 30.

<HEADLINE> eToys Loses $21M but Sales Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- eToys Inc., the leading online toy  
seller, lost $21 million during the fiscal first quarter despite a 
1,990 percent jump in sales for the Internet startup. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss amounts to 21 cents per share, compared to a loss of  
$2.2 million, or 4 cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time special charge, the loss would have been  
$16.7 million, or 17 cents per share, meeting the average forecast 
by analyst surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, announced Tuesday, came on revenues of $7.9 million,  
up from $381,000 in the first quarter of the 1999 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the quarterly  
performance because the bulk of eToys' sales come during the 
Christmas shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that they didn't deviate from the  
estimates a whole lot,'' said Mitchell Bartlett, an analyst with 
Dain Rauscher Wessels. 
</P>
<P>
	When eToys went public in May, company executives warned that  
they expected to lose money for the ``foreseeable future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company will face new competition this year from Amazon.com,  
which has begun to sell toys online, and from Web stores launched 
by traditional retailers Toys R Us and KB Toys. 
</P>
<P>
	eToys is investing heavily in brand development, new product  
offerings and its technical infrastructure, said Toby Lenk, the 
company's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our most important achievement to date is having established a  
definitive online leadership position,'' Lenk said. 
</P>
<P>
	eToys shares fell $2.34 to $36.94 in afternoon trading on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose today as international blue chips  
and high technology shares recovered from recent losses. The dollar 
fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 117.19 points,  
or 0.67 percent, to close at 17,579.91. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 28.62 points, or 0.16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.52 yen, down 1.06 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and below its level of 116.36 yen in New York trading 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices were bolstered by investors hunting for bargains  
since the Nikkei index lost more than 1,000 points over the last 
five trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders doubted the rally would last.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today's gains are not part of a real or fundamental change in  
the market. They are merely a recovery in prices during a market 
correction,'' said Masaki Higashida, deputy general manager of the 
investment information and services department at Nomura 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 16.22 points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 
1,450.33. The TOPIX closed down 2.21 points, or 0.15 percent, to 
1,434.11 the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained sluggish, with volume on the main section  
falling to 459.90 million shares from 462.54 million shares 
Tuesday. Declines outnumbered advances 635 to 541 on the main 
section of the exchange while 133 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen amid  
growing speculation that the government has loosened its policy of 
intervening to curb gains in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank aggressively defended a dollar exchange rate of  
120 yen a few weeks ago, but has now become relatively inactive in 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar-buying intervention was designed to stem the yen's  
rapid rise and help the nation's fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at Japan's  
Ministry of Finance, said the rapid rise in the yen was unwelcome 
but there were no signs today that the central bank was moving to 
stem the gain. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.54 yen, down from  
124.12 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7000 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6550 percent, driving 
its price down to 100.86 yen from 101.25 yen.

<HEADLINE> Karpov May Miss Chess Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- There will be masters and grandmasters but  
apparently not THE master at the World Chess Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-long competition beginning Saturday was expected to  
draw 100 chess players from 52 countries, with the winner receiving 
$660,000 out of $3 million in prize money. But defending champion 
Anatoly Karpov isn't expected to be here. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Shiloh Quinn, said the chess champion will definitely  
not play in the Las Vegas tournament. ``He hasn't gone into 
training for the tournament,'' Quinn said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov, the Russian grandmaster, originally complained that the  
world title he won in January 1998 in Lausanne, Switzerland, should 
have been his for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 150-country World Chess Federation, known by its French  
acronym FIDE, decided this year that the championship should take 
place annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov also contended that he had already made lucrative  
engagements around the world that would prevent him from playing in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn said the legal hassle between Karpov and FIDE now boils  
down to seeding for the upcoming event. Instead of pitting Karpov 
against the eventual challenger, as in the past, he was seeded into 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Karpov would have to compete with 63 others beginning  
next Tuesday, rather than walking into the six-game final round to 
play a tired opponent beginning Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karpov has come to a mutual understanding with FIDE that the  
issue will be put before the court of arbitration for sports'' in 
Lausanne, Emanuel Omuku, FIDE executive director, said in a 
statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal ramifications were expected to continue long after the  
new champion is crowned Aug. 29 at the tournament site, Caesars 
Palace hotel-casino.

<HEADLINE> Real Babies Are Game's Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Forget those beanie baby giveaways that are so  
popular at ballparks these days. Some lucky Lowell Spinners fan 
could go home from the game carrying a real baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Class A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox is inviting 20  
expectant mothers -- dozens of others had to be turned away -- to 
attend ``Birth Night'' on Thursday against the Vermont Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	The first one to give birth after the first pitch wins a year's  
supply of diapers. Ambulances and local obstetrician Ed Lipman will 
be on call. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll take her to a hospital,'' Spinners spokesman Dan  
Hoffman said. ``She's not going to give birth on the concourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women and their partners get free box seats behind home  
plate -- under the screen, so they're protected from foul balls, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	If no one goes into labor, as is likely, the contest continues  
until one of the registered women has her baby. The winning mother 
need only fax the birth certificate to claim her prize, and she has 
a couple extra days to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'd be their first phone call,'' Hoffman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Giveaway days are credited to former White Sox, Indians and St.  
Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck, who used the prizes to lure children 
to the ballpark. He made his money back on all the peanuts and hot 
dogs they ate while waiting for the game to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the freebies would be limited by age, such as 12 years  
old and under. But never before has the age limit been measured in 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	To midwife this project to fruition, the Spinners contacted  
local obstetricians in search of women nearing their 40th week of 
pregnancy. Lisa Armstrong saw a poster at her doctor's office, 
noticed the game date was her due date, and figured she had a 
pretty good chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually closer (to the hospital) than if I were at  
home,'' she said. ``And I don't anticipate it actually happening 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While turning the miracle of childbirth into a promotional  
gimmick may not seem proper to some, doctors agreed there is no 
added medical risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unlikely that any of these women are going to go into  
labor during the game,'' said Dr. Edward Evantash, an obstetrician 
and gynecologist at Boston's Beth Israel-Deaconness Medical Center. 
``The watched uterus rarely contracts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veeck gave away bats, balls and caps. As the idea spread, the  
gifts expanded to beach sandals, team calendars and beanie babies. 
In recent years, publicity-starved teams have taken the idea to new 
heights, or lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who employ Veeck's son, Mike, in their  
marketing department, had a ``Lawyer Appreciation Night,'' in which 
attorneys were charged double -- and billed by the third of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	On Conversion Day, fans were rewarded for getting rid of New  
York Yankees caps. Plans to reprise his father's notorious Disco 
Demolition Night, when disco records were blown up between games of 
a doubleheader were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	During his minor league days, Mike Veeck's ideas included a pig  
that delivered baseballs to umpires and a nun that gave massages. 
In 1997, his Charleston RiverDogs planned giving away a free 
vasectomy in honor of Father's Day, then canceled the promotion 
after complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spinners said they asked around town to see if anyone was  
offended before going ahead with their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't gotten any complaints,'' Hoffman said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not terribly offensive,'' Evantash agreed. ``At least  
there's an available catcher's mitt.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Shop Owner Creates Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Some gun enthusiasts are starting to  
wonder what side Bob Lockett is on. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett, general manager and part-owner of the Second Amendment  
Gun Shop, wants tighter regulation of the gun industry. And at his 
store, he makes buyers show they can responsibly handle a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	His message: The industry must act to avoid expensive  
litigation, such as the lawsuits filed in recent months by various 
cities against gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a businessman in the gun business, and I'm trying to  
minimize my expenses,'' Lockett said, surrounded by dozens of 
pistols and rifles at his store, a tan and gray concrete-block 
building in a commercial area of this Kansas City, Mo., suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Before patrons can buy a gun at Lockett's store, they must  
demonstrate they know how to load, unload, disassemble, clean and 
reassemble the weapon. Employees must also instruct prospective 
buyers about how to use safety locks and store guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett's proposals include requiring gun store owners to pass a  
test on gun laws. He wants gun show promoters to be licensed and 
conduct background checks on prospective buyers. And he wants the 
industry to develop a public service campaign urging people not to 
use guns when they are angry. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless the industry changes, Lockett said, ``we're either going  
to be legislated out of existence or we're going to be litigated 
out of existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Paiss, spokeswoman for Handgun Control, the nation's  
largest gun control group, said she is happy to find an unlikely 
ally in Lockett, regardless of his largely economic motives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many good things have been accomplished by people's simple  
desire to make a profit and stay in business,'' Paiss said from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett's views have won him few friends among his colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
	C.D. Olsen, who owns the Sports Mart store near Lyndon, said  
exams on gun laws would be impractical because the rules are 
confusing and change frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is almost impossible for the general gun dealer or lay  
person to interpret what those laws mean,'' Olsen said. Olsen also 
said officials need to enforce current gun laws rather than create 
new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hodgdon, president of Hodgdon Powder Co., a gunpowder  
manufacturer in Overland Park, said he fears Lockett's suggestions 
will lead to higher gun prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he wants to do is add layers and layers of paperwork that  
will add to the cost,'' Hodgdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	National Rifle Association spokesman Bill Powers declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett, a 51-year-old former world-ranked marksman and father  
of two toddlers, said the other owners of the store are supportive 
of his views. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that business at the Second Amendment store, which has  
been open since 1981, is good, though he would not give sales 
figures. However, one Second Amendment store closed in 1989 and 
another shut down in 1991, making this location the last one in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockett adopted the store policy in 1995. He updated it this  
month to include checking the number of guns sold to a customer 
within the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no really set number, but once we get above a level  
that we feel like needs managerial review, we'll go over and punch 
up the past history on the computer and see what he's buying,'' 
Lockett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Dack of Evergreen, Colo., who bought a box of ammunition at  
the Second Amendment store during a recent visit to Kansas City, 
said he agrees with Lockett's ideas, particularly greater 
regulation of gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go to gun shows because there's a lot of element there  
that I don't really want to be around,'' Dack said. ``You can just 
walk in and buy a gun in a lot of cases.''

<HEADLINE> Belgium Weighs Pork Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The government faced fresh pressure  
Wednesday to destroy pork products suspected of dioxin 
contamination, after the European Union threatened further limits 
on the sale of Belgian foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission asked Belgium to remove from the market  
all pork products that can't be certified free of the 
cancer-causing chemical. If Belgium refuses, the EU said it may 
widen restrictions on the country's meat and dairy products imposed 
in June at the start of the dioxin scare. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat was made Tuesday by Eric Poudelet, a senior EU  
veterinary health official, after meeting Belgian officials to 
discuss evidence that the contamination of pig farms was feared 
wider than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Belgian government announced it would buy up and  
destroy 80,000 tons of suspect pork stockpiled since the start of 
the scare. The decision followed existing restrictions that ban 
pork products with more than 20 percent fat. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cabinet backed away from a Health Ministry proposal to  
recall pork products containing more than 2 percent fat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabinet was due to debate further action Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Poudelet said more measures were necessary to ensure the safety  
and restore consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The new EU demands follow last week's addition of 233 pig farms  
to a list of some 800 whose sales were blocked because of the 
dioxin problem. Although only two of the 233 farms so far have 
tested positive for dioxin, authorities have been unable to verify 
the rest did not receive contaminated animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is believed to have entered the food chain through motor  
oil dumped among recycled fats used in the feed.

<HEADLINE>  Americans Stun Cubans in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- For one day, Cuba was conquered in  
baseball. By a group of minor leaguers from the United States, no 
less. By guys who've been playing together for all of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Jensen's three-run homer sparked a five-run ninth  
Wednesday as the U.S. team stunned Cuba 10-5 in the pool round of 
the Pan American Games. It was the Americans' first victory over 
the world power in a major competition in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the guys are finally understanding the importance of  
these games. Each one is so critical. This is the way baseball 
should be played on a regular basis,'' Jensen said after the U.S. 
clinched a berth in the quarterfinals of the nine-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also soothed some of the pain from an opening 7-6  
loss to Canada, a game the Americans led 6-3 in the 11th inning. 
And it showed the United States has as good a shot as anyone to 
make the baseball finals here, which would secure a berth in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans and Cubans are both 2-1 in the four-game pool  
series, with the quarterfinals set for Saturday. Canada leads the 
group with a 3-0 mark after beating Mexico 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the U.S. team lost Wednesday, it probably would have faced  
Cuba again before next Monday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Americans feel good about their chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we first started, our concern was how quickly we could  
come together,'' said manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected for 
arguing a call in the ninth, right before Jensen sent his long 
blast over the right field fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much believe this has to do with the game we had with  
Canada on Monday. That hurt a lot and we were disappointed. It also 
made us understand what we were up against. Cuba is so 
fundamentally sound. They were even better than what I had read and 
what I had seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans, using many of the same players, split two exhibition  
games with the Baltimore Orioles earlier this year. Their last loss 
to the United States was on July 4, 1996, 8-4 in Norfolk, Va., 
during a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last significant loss was in the 1987 Pan Ams at  
Indianapolis, a 6-4 American win in the preliminary round. Cuba 
went on to win the gold there, beating the Americans in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we can beat them and that's a big key,'' U.S. left  
fielder Dave Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Paquette broke a 3-3 tie with a two-run homer in the  
seventh, and it appeared the Americans were on their way to 
victory, just like Monday. Reliever Dan Wheeler was breezing along 
after replacing Brad Penny in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cuba's Isacc Martin hit a wind-blown homer to left with two  
outs in the eighth, celebrating as he rounded the bases. The 
prospect of another crushing defeat faced the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But right fielder Peter Bergeron made a key play when he threw  
out a German Mesa at the plate after an overthrow down the right 
field line. tried to score from first on the play and the throw to 
catcher Jensen left the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
	``They challenged us to make a play and we made it,'' Jensen  
said.Bradley bunted. Paquette was called out at second on a throw 
from pitcher Maels Rodr for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bell was booted, Jon Zuber walked and Jensen, who hit two  
home runs in a victory over Mexico on Tuesday, delivered his long 
shot to right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Roberts and Adam Kennedy, whose double  
error in the second led to three Cuban runs, made it 10-5. Team USA 
had 19 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also got the best of the Cubans five times in  
freestyle wrestling. U.S. gold medalists were Cary Kolat at 63 
kilograms; Lincoln McIlravy at 69 kilos; Joe Williams at 76; 
Dominic Black at 97; and Stephen Neal at 130. Les Gutches beat a 
Canadian 6-1 for the gold at 85 kilos. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal beat world champion Alexis Rodriguez, rallying from a 6-1  
deficit to win 8-7 on a takedown with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Platas of Mexico won the men's platform diving gold,  
while Canada's Eryn Bulmer edged Jenny Lingamfelter of Dallas on 
the women's 3-meter springboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada passed Cuba for total medals, but trails the United  
States by 41. The Americans have 43 golds, 42 silvers and 28 
bronzes for 113. Cnada has 21 gold medals and 72 overall, while 
Cuba has 26 golds and 67 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Defections and ejections were the story elsewhere, and Olympic  
gold medalist Donovan Bailey finally showed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more Cubans -- softball coach Jose Mendez and a shooter --  
have sought asylum in Canada, according to sources close to the 
Cuban team. They left the delegation earlier this week, said the 
sources, who would not provide the shooter's name. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third and fourth Cubans to seek asylum at the  
games. Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before 
the games got started. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde 
also has sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive 
as media attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer turned ugly when police had to rush in to rescue referee  
Rich Grady, who ejected four Guatemalans and both coaches in 
Canada's 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players from Guatemala rushed toward a retreating Grady  
following the final ejection. His assistants and several police 
officers formed a circle around Grady, and they waited for the 
field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, the Pan Ams poster boy who has been roundly criticized  
for not running in the 100 meters, ran on the opening leg of 
Canada's 400 relay team in Wednesday's semifinals and helped his 
team record the fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe my teammates. I made a commitment to the Pan American  
Games people and the fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's 
what I did,'' said Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion in the 100. 
``I'm not stung by the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track winners included Americans Marla Runyan, who is legally  
blind, in the women's 1,500, and 1991 men's discus champion Anthony 
Washington, at 210 feet, 9 inches.

<HEADLINE> Legal Analyst Guidelines Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- They are the journalistic legacy of the  
O.J. Simpson trial: all-knowing, opinionated legal pundits who 
dissect trial strategy, grade lawyers and often predict outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now two law professors -- well-known commentators themselves --  
say it's high time to adopt ethical guidelines to bring some order 
to the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was horrified when I would turn on my radio and hear  
commentators make statements that I knew to be literally wrong,'' 
Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of Southern 
California, said of the 1995 Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do an enormous disservice when they give inaccurate  
information or mislead the public about the nature of legal 
proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chemerinsky and Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law  
School in Los Angeles, have come up with some voluntary guidelines 
for pundits. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts, they argue, should comment only on subjects they know  
about firsthand by watching the trial or reading trial transcripts. 
Those experts should also try to remain neutral and disclose any 
potential conflicts of interest and biases. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, Chemerinsky and Levenson say, the experts should  
refrain from scoring trials like sports events or predicting jury 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The restraints, they say, would improve legal commentary, help  
the media choose pundits and prevent lawyers from pursuing their 
own political agendas in the guise of legal analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Levenson cited the impeachment of President Clinton as a case of  
too many lawyers being lured into the minefield of defining 
impeachable offenses and saying whether Clinton had committed one. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Supreme Court has never decided the scope of an  
impeachable offense, ``it was just people voicing their political 
opinions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Uelmen, a Santa Clara University law professor, Simpson  
defense lawyer and longtime commentator on California legal issues, 
was dubious about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talking heads, he said, are chosen ``by and large because they  
will be provocative and entertaining, not because they will be 
accurate, educational and edifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But two nationwide lawyers' groups have adopted codes for their  
members in response to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Trial Lawyers passed guidelines last  
year calling for competence, disclosures of conflicts and biases 
and restrictions of commentary to legal procedures rather than 
lawyer scorecards or forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers endorsed a  
competency guideline, but disavowed any duty of neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense pundits ``have a special obligation to educate the  
public about what it means to be liberty's last champions,'' the 
association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemerinsky and Levenson said there's little likelihood that  
viewpoints would be suppressed, ``given the nature of many media 
broadcasts, embracing controversy and seeking opposing views,'' 
they wrote in the May edition of the Mercer (Ga.) Law Review. 
</P>
<P>
	The real problem, they say, is the opposite: the verbal  
food-fight that results when lawyers are cast as opposing partisans 
and encouraged to be provocative. 
</P>
<P>
	One show that doesn't seem to fit the Chemerinsky-Levenson model  
is CNN's ``Burden of Proof'' show in which panels of lawyers are 
asked to discuss the case of the day from their partisan 
perspectives -- prosecutor, defender, insurance lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-host Roger Cossack, a veteran trial lawyer, said the ethical  
guidelines apply more to the evening news than to a program like 
his. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a code of ethics should be more for the people who ask  
(lawyers) the questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levenson said she's seen signs that news organizations are  
becoming more selective about commentators and more sensitive to 
ethical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	But media groups haven't endorsed any formal guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really for individual news organizations to make their  
own editorial decisions,'' said Barbara Cochran, president of the 
Radio-Television News Directors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Law Journal editorialized that the proposed code  
probably wouldn't prevent unsavory members of the bar from doing 
their worst on TV: ``Better to use real ethical codes that have 
bite and to rely on the marketplace of ideas to argue which lawyers 
are jerks.''

<HEADLINE>  Americans Stun Cubans in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- For one day, Cuba was conquered in  
baseball. By a group of minor leaguers from the United States, no 
less. By guys who've been playing together for all of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Jensen's three-run homer sparked a five-run ninth  
Wednesday as the U.S. team stunned Cuba 10-5 in the pool round of 
the Pan American Games. It was the Americans' first victory over 
the world power in a major competition in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the guys are finally understanding the importance of  
these games. Each one is so critical. This is the way baseball 
should be played on a regular basis,'' Jensen said after the U.S. 
clinched a berth in the quarterfinals of the nine-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also soothed some of the pain from an opening 7-6  
loss to Canada, a game the Americans led 6-3 in the 11th inning. 
And it showed the United States has as good a shot as anyone to 
make the baseball finals here, which would secure a berth in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans and Cubans are both 2-1 in the four-game pool  
series, with the quarterfinals set for Saturday. Canada leads the 
group with a 3-0 mark after beating Mexico 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the U.S. team lost Wednesday, it probably would have faced  
Cuba again before next Monday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Americans feel good about their chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we first started, our concern was how quickly we could

<HEADLINE> Gruesome Photos Used in Fla. Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The photos showing a dead inmate in  
Florida's electric chair look like something out of a horror movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Lee Davis appears to grimace with a leather strap in his  
mouth, his face a purplish color and his eyes black. There is a 
large spot of blood on his chest and blood on the collar of his 
white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing death row inmates are using the pictures  
to support their arguments that Florida's death chamber inflicts 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the 344-pound inmate nicknamed ``Tiny''  
suffered a nosebleed during his execution July 8. Because the 
bleeding was unusual, corrections officials took pictures while he 
was still strapped to the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are distinct signs of pain,'' Dr. Donald Price, a  
neurophysiologist, testified Wednesday about Davis' half-shut eyes, 
scrunched-up nose and bruises on his face. 
</P>
<P>
	A physicist who specializes in the effects of electricity  
testified that it was possible for an inmate to remain conscious 15 
to 30 seconds into the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my opinion that death is not instantaneous and make take  
several minutes,'' said Dr. John Wikswo of Vanderbilt University in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report said Davis had ``several predisposing risk  
factors'' for nosebleeds, including hypertension and arthritis that 
required him to take blood-thinners. 
</P>
<P>
	An execution scheduled for July 9 was postponed to September,  
and the Florida Supreme Court ordered the hearing on the chair's 
constitutionality. Circuit Judge Clarence Johnson has until Monday 
to issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 1997 execution in Florida, flames shot out from behind  
the leather mask covering the face of Pedro Medina. Corrections 
officials then decided to photograph inmates if anything unusual 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' execution -- the fifth since Medina's -- was the first  
deemed unusual enough for pictures, said C.J. Drake, a spokesman 
for the Department of Corrections.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wins Wage Suit in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese court on Wednesday ruled in favor of a  
woman who sued a major pharmaceuticals company over wage 
discrimination, saying women should get the same pay as men. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osaka District court ordered Shionogi and Co. to pay Hisami  
Naka about $260,000 in compensation for discrimination suffered 
over a decade, a court official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Naka, 56, claimed that Shionogi paid her less than male  
colleagues merely because she was a woman. She had demanded 
$402,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Naka joined Shionogi in 1965 and worked there for 30 years  
before retiring in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Presiding judge Tetsuoh Matsumoto was quoted by the Asahi  
Shimbun as saying that companies ``should pay women the same wages 
as men as far as they request women to do the same job in quality 
and quantity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asahi said a total of 18 disputes related to wage discrimination  
are now in courts throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am delighted by the ruling as the court recognized my  
claim,'' Naka said in a nationally televised news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Shionogi said in a statement that it ``will decide what action  
it will take after studying the content of the ruling carefully.''

<HEADLINE> Police Rescue Ref at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Police came to the rescue of an  
American referee during a Pan American Games soccer match 
Wednesday, holding off an angry Guatemalan team upset by a 2-1 loss 
to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Guatemalan players were ejected in the game, as were both  
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The last ejection in the final minute resulted in several  
Guatemalans rushing toward referee Rich Grady, who had to be 
shielded by his linesmen and several police officers who scuffled 
with the Central Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Grady is a third-year FIFA referee who has officiated in each of  
Major League Soccer's four seasons and even worked games in the 
Spanish Primera Division in an exchange program with MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	He ejected the first three Guatemalans in the first 20 minutes  
for hard fouls and their protests. Carlos Ruiz went first in the 
16th minute and was followed by Denis Chen in the 18th and Jose 
Merlos in the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	That forced Guatemala to play the rest of the game with only  
eight players, a situation that took its toll in the 32nd minute. 
Steven Kindel's shot from outside the penalty area deflected off a 
Guatemalan defender's hip and past goalkeeper Luis Molina. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala coach Walter Claveri was the next to be ejected,  
getting red-carded at the end of the first half for running onto 
the field and verbally challenging Grady. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian manager Bruce Twamley also got tossed, earning his red  
card at the beginning of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some confusion,'' Twamley said. ``I asked for a  
substitution slip, because I wanted to make a change but the fourth 
official (spoke) Spanish and he didn't understand what I wanted. So 
I think because I came out of the (coach's) area I'm supposed to be 
in, he spoke to the referee and the referee sent me off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got a second goal in the 68th when Grady awarded a  
penalty kick, which Jason Mathot converted. 
</P>
<P>
	With the game winding down and Canada ahead 2-0, Oliver Carias  
eluded three defenders and scored in the 90th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	But a fourth ejection, of Walter Alegria for violent conduct  
following the goal, apparently was too much for the Guatemalans, 
several of whom ran toward a retreating Grady. 
</P>
<P>
	The referee's assistants and police formed a circle around  
Grady, waiting for the field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala and Canada have had their problems on the soccer field  
in recent months. Earlier this summer the senior Guatemala side had 
three players sent off in two games -- both losses -- against Canada 
in Toronto and Edmonton.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani May Net $200,000 in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's trip  
to Arkansas started as simple jab at Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
``listening tour'' back home. 
</P>
<P>
	It's turned into something more profitable.  
</P>
<P>
	The Republican mayor -- Mrs. Clinton's likely opponent should  
both decide to formally seek a U.S. Senate seat -- is expected to 
raise up to $200,000 on a two-day swing through the South. 
</P>
<P>
	A luncheon with prominent Arkansas Republicans on Tuesday netted  
$40,000, while he raised up to $50,000 later at a reception in New 
Orleans' French Quarter. Events were planned for today in the 
Alabama cities of Huntsville, Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. 
</P>

	In Arkansas on Tuesday, Giuliani called his trip ``a combination  
of fun and serious politicking,'' and played off Mrs. Clinton's 
sounding of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never lived here, I've never worked here, I've never gone  
to school here. It's the first time I've been here,'' he said. ``I 
guess it would be cool to run for the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was born in Chicago and has spent most of her adult  
life in Washington, D.C., and Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was 
governor before becoming president. Giuliani recently sent out a 
mailing in New York regarding Mrs. Clinton's travels. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, New York is not a political `stepping stone.' New York  
is my life,'' the mailing reads. ``So the question is not what New 
York can do for Mrs. Clinton, but what in the world can Mrs. 
Clinton do for the people of New York?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, declined to  
comment on the mayor's trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to engage in politics in Arkansas. She's going  
to continue her listening tour in New York,'' said Wolfson. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Huckabee and Lt. Gov. Win Rockefeller voiced their  
backing of Giuliani, despite the mayor's support of abortion rights 
and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do disagree on certain issues, but we agree on a lot more,  
particularly on the role of limiting government, cutting taxes, 
giving the individual the opportunity to do his or her best,'' 
Huckabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Vaughn McQuary  
derided Giuliani's trip to the state as ``a publicity stunt, as 
much on his part as it is on the governor's and lieutenant 
governor's part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Giuliani was in Little Rock, his aides in New York were  
busy lofting the Arkansas state flag, which features a star 
commemorating Arkansas' membership in the Confederacy, from a 
flagpole at City Hall. The move drew criticism from a black member 
of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous; we don't need that,'' said Councilman Bill  
Perkins, a Democrat. ``(It's) a smack in the face of those who were 
victims of slavery.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Whitewater Hale Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An investigator in Kenneth Starr's office  
found insufficient evidence that conservatives paid a key 
Whitewater witness in hopes of influencing his testimony about 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing a case that Clinton supporters viewed as evidence of a  
right-wing conspiracy to get the president, Starr accepted the 
investigator's recommendation that no charges be brought in 
connection with allegations against David Hale and activists 
working for a conservative magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator, former Justice Department watchdog Michael  
Shaheen, said that many of the allegations of financial assistance 
or other benefits to Hale were ``unsubstantiated or, in some cases, 
untrue,'' according to a statement issued by Starr's office 
Wednesday that quoted Shaheen and two retired judges who reviewed 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is little if any credible evidence establishing'' that  
Hale received some of the assistance alleged, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, there is insufficient evidence of ``criminal  
intent'' attached to favors to Hale, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to 1996 Hale sometimes stayed at secluded fishing camp  
in Arkansas owned by one of three men being paid by the American 
Spectator magazine to unearth information on Whitewater. He ate 
meals there and also was allowed to use the cabin owner's car. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale has denied receiving any cash payments from the group.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen sent a letter to Hale's lawyer on Tuesday stating that  
the Office of Special Review, as his team of investigators was 
called, had concluded no charges should be brought. 
</P>
<P>
	No further details of Shaheen's investigation were provided and  
the statement from Starr's office made no indication whether 
Shaheen's 168-page report, turned over to Starr in June, would be 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bowden, Hale's attorney, could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen's investigation focused on allegations, first reported  
by The Associated Press, that Hale received assistance from 
conservative activists working for the American Spectator magazine 
-- on a project financed by billionaire philanthropist Richard 
Mellon Scaife -- at the same time Hale was cooperating with Starr's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A disgraced former Arkansas judge, Hale pleaded guilty in 1994  
in connection with two Whitewater-related felonies and became 
Starr's top witness against Clinton and his Whitewater business 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony helped convict President Clinton's former business  
partners and Arkansas' sitting governor in a fraudulent loan case 
in the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishing camp owner Parker Dozhier of Hot Springs, Ark., and two  
other conservative activists were being paid by the magazine to 
unearth information about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozhier denied giving money to Hale. ``The investigation proved  
that out,'' he said in a phone interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine funded the project with $1.7 million it received  
from foundations controlled Scaife, whose foundations have given 
millions to anti-Clinton groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Caryn Mann, Dozhier' former girlfriend, alleged that Hale  
received a series of cash payments of between $40 and $500 each and 
frequently discussed the Whitewater case with Dozhier and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, hired in May 1998, spent just over a year investigating  
the matter. He contacted over 160 people, some of whom were called 
before a grand jury in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	He submitted a 168-page report to two retired judges who served  
as an independent oversight panel for the investigation, which was 
to have been conducted at arm's length from Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Former federal judges Arlin Adams and Charles Renfrew concurred  
with Shaheen's finding, as did Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	David Matthews, Mann's lawyer, said Wednesday that Mann stands  
by her word and ``did what she thought a responsible citizen should 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton supporters saw the alleged ties between Hale and  
Scaife-funded activists as proof of what Hillary Rodham Clinton 
called a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' out to discredit the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest and former  
congressman who testified on Clinton's behalf at his impeachment 
trial, said Starr should make public the entire Shaheen report. 
``It's one more outrage,'' Drinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, who ran a loan company, told prosecutors that Clinton and  
business partner James McDougal urged him to make a fraudulent 
$300,000 federally backed loan to Whitewater partner Susan 
McDougal, who never repaid it. The president denied knowing 
anything about the loan and denied pressuring Hale to make the 
loan.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Admits Yosemite Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso were  
strangled in their motel room, then stuffed into the trunk of their 
rental car. Fifteen-year-old Juli Sund was taken to a remote lake, 
where her head was nearly cut off the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the account given by motel handyman Cary Stayner, who  
confessed to the slayings. If he's telling the truth, it solves the 
Yosemite sightseers mystery, a case that has bedeviled the FBI 
since the three women disappeared from the Cedar Lodge on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, a member of a wealthy real estate family in  
Eureka, was on a trip through the Sierra foothills with her 
daughter Juli and their Argentine friend Ms. Pelosso, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found dead weeks later and hours away from where they  
were last seen. The burned bodies of Mrs. Sund and Ms. Pelosso were 
found in the trunk of their charred rental car. Juli's body was 
discovered more than 30 miles away on a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, described the crimes in detail to the FBI and again  
in a jailhouse interview, saying he had fantasized about tying up 
and killing women since he was 7. He also confessed to beheading 
Joie Armstrong, a naturalist at Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am guilty,'' Stayner said, according to Ted Rowlands, a  
reporter with KNTV in San Jose who questioned him through thick 
glass in the Sacramento County jail. ``I did murder Carole Sund, 
Juli Sund, Silvina Pelosso and Joie Armstrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner escaped detection until he was taken in Saturday in last  
week's slaying of Ms. Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaming voices in his head for driving him to murder, Stayner  
claimed he acted alone. And based on details from his confession 
and evidence recovered since then, the FBI apparently believes him, 
the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner also said during the KNTV interview that none of the  
women was sexually abused or tortured in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI hasn't released any details about Stayner's confessions,  
and the KNTV report and the Times story, which cites unidentified 
sources, provide no insights as to how he singlehandedly 
overpowered three women. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Carrington, Mrs. Sund's mother, learned of Stayner's  
admissions Monday night. She said ``I hope that's true,'' but 
remained skeptical he could have carried out the killings alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like for it to be solved but I can't help but wonder if  
somebody else wasn't involved, too,'' she told the Eureka Times 
Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner said he strangled Mrs. Sund and Ms. Pelosso in their  
room at the Cedar Lodge, where he also lived. He then took Juli to 
a point overlooking Don Pedro Reservoir, where he killed her early 
the next morning and hid the body in thick underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he left wet towels in the motel room to make it seem as  
if they had taken a morning shower and left without trouble. He 
then drove the sightseers' rental car with the bodies of Mrs. Sund 
and Ms. Pelosso in the trunk to Long Barn, a tiny town hours to the 
north along twisting mountain roads. 
</P>
<P>
	He abandoned the car and took a taxi and bus back to the lodge.  
A Sonora cab driver confirmed Tuesday night that she picked up 
Stayner at a shopping center and drove him two hours to Yosemite 
Valley. He paid the $125 fare in cash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he first got in the car he said he was really tired'' and  
had been stranded by his friends, said the cabbie, Jenny Paul. ``He 
said he had been outdoors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, he returned to burn the car, and to confuse  
police further, he took Mrs. Sund's wallet and dropped it on a 
Modesto street. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned and ruled out as a suspect early in the sightseer  
probe, he took a risk by sending an anonymous letter to the FBI 
tipping them to the whereabouts of Juli's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner told KNTV he figured he had gotten away with the  
murders, especially after news reports said the FBI had focused on 
a ring of ex-convicts in Modesto. He kept working and living at 
Cedar Lodge to avoid drawing suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risks, he said he couldn't help himself from killing  
again after he encountered Ms. Armstrong last week and realized she 
was alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry that all their loved ones were where they were when  
they were. I wish I could have controlled myself and not done what 
I did,'' Stayner said, according to KNTV. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnapping of his younger brother Steven by a child molester  
-- a case that made headlines when Steven resurfaced seven years 
later -- had nothing to do with his criminal behavior, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Broadly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. dollar turned broadly lower against  
other major currencies as there were no new interest rate surprises 
in congressional testimony by the chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0659, up  
from $1.0620 reached late Tuesday. On Monday, it rose as high as 
$1.0724, a 10-week high. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also slipped against the Japanese yen, falling to  
116.12 yen in New York from 116.36 yen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar lost ground as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan provided no new hints about prospects for a further 
increase in U.S. interest rates in testimony to the Senate Banking 
Committee. Rising American rates make returns more attractive on 
investments denominated in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the euro slid to an all-time low of $1.0108 before  
staging a sharp rebound amid signs of renewed economic growth in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5001  
Swiss francs, down from 1.5064, and 1.5065 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.5143. The British pound rose to $1.5977 from $1.5911 late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Wednesday's late euro rate, the dollar was worth: 
1.8339 German marks, down from 1.8416 late Tuesday; and 6.1540 
French francs, down from 6.1767.

<HEADLINE> Regional Insurer Drops Viagra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A regional health insurer has decided to stop  
coverage for Viagra and says it generally will no longer pay for 
any new medicines or medical devices until they have been on the 
market for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, one of Ohio's biggest health  
insurers, announced its decision in a letter to company 
policyholders in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The change applies to all of the company's individual and group  
commercial health plans. The rules do not apply to Anthem's Senior 
Advantage Medicare HMO, which by law must cover whatever Medicare 
covers. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month policy can be waived for new drugs judged to be  
effective treatments and unique on the market, Anthem said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was first reported by The Cincinnati Enquirer.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based company serves about 5 million Blue Cross  
and Blue Shield customers in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and 
Connecticut. It has recently announced plans to expand into 
Colorado and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The change takes effect whenever a policy is renewed, so some  
policyholders are already under the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthem's management said the policy change is part of the  
company's efforts to control rising pharmaceutical costs, which for 
most health plans increased 18 percent to 20 percent during the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthem canceled its coverage of Viagra because its  
pharmaceutical review committee considers it a ``lifestyle'' drug 
rather than a medical necessity, spokeswoman Diane Planck told the 
Enquirer. To be consistent, the company also canceled coverage for 
any other treatments or tests for sexual dysfunction problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with 50 or more employees can continue Anthem coverage  
for Viagra and the new-market drugs by paying increased premiums to 
Anthem, company spokesman Joe Bobbey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they decided Anthem needed a grace period  
to study the cost-effectiveness of new drugs that the Food and Drug 
Administration approves for the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FDA is getting drugs out there faster than ever. We wanted  
to have the right to take six months to look at covering a drug 
that comes out,'' Ms. Planck said. ``If there's already an 
effective, less expensive drug on the market, what's the need to 
add a new one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Shearer, director of health policy analysis for Consumers  
Union, the organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, 
said she didn't know of similar decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly question whether there's a defensible rationale  
for that policy,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> A Trip Into Performance Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Stare long enough and the paintings  
and sculptures move a little -- the slight sway of a body or the 
quiver of a limb. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the eyes playing tricks.  
</P>
<P>
	It's Pageant of the Masters, part museum exhibit and part  
history lesson with a dash of the inane and a sprinkle of the 
strange thrown in to round out the annual live performance art show 
in this Orange County oceanside community. 
</P>
<P>
	Here everything from a nude painting by Pablo Picasso to  
automobile hood ornaments to Little Richard's first album cover are 
brought to life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show's kind of like art meeting acting,'' says 16-year-old  
Michelle Akhanlich, who portrays an artist in the re-creation of 
John Singer Sergeant's 1907 painting ``Sketchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But during this 2 1/2-hour production at the outdoor Irvine Bowl  
there is no dialogue. The show's success depends on the ability of 
the 138 volunteer actors portraying various art works to stand, lay 
or sit still and blend in with background. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick is making it look like the actual work, but building  
it all around human beings,'' said Richard ``Butch'' Hill, the 
show's technical director. ``People have a hard time understanding 
this, but the pageant is really about people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The works in the show are re-created thanks to the magic of  
theater: sets, props, body makeup, costumes and, most importantly, 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Up close, the re-creations are three-dimensional. But from the  
audience's point of view, paintings appear as they would on walls -- 
two-dimensional -- and sculptures have a solid, heavy look. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent show, five women dressed in flesh body stockings  
and carrying props scurried across the stage and climbed into a set 
about two feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Using well-hidden handles and bars to grab onto, they held  
themselves flat against a set splashed with bright colors. A second 
set, resembling a giant frame, was rolled in front of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	When the lights came up -- they had become a giant, nearly  
faithful re-creation of Pablo Picasso's ``Les Demoiselles 
d'Avignon.'' For 90 seconds, the actors held their positions as a 
narrator gave a brief history of the artist and his work and an 
orchestra performed background music. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the lights dimmed and another piece was rolled onto the  
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The tableau vivant art form, known today as living pictures or  
performance art, began in France centuries ago as a way to bring 
biblical events, such as the Nativity, to life. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1932, looking for a way to bring attention to the Laguna arts  
community, pageant founder John Hinchman held a parade of living 
pictures, using actors to portray famous works of art. By 1935, it 
had become a theatrical production. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, the theme of the show changes.  
</P>
<P>
	``This year we are telling a story of the 20th century, using  
the art images of the era as illustrations for that story,'' 
director Diane Challis Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 43 re-creations are obvious to the story of this  
century: Felix de Weldon's bronze sculpture ``American Militia,'' 
depicting soldiers during World War I; Norman Rockwell's World War 
II paintings, including ``Rosie the Riveter''; and the re-creation 
of the statue atop the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, used to depict 
the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a tribute to the influence of rock 'n' roll: the  
cover of Little Richard's first album and Grant Speed's 1964 statue 
of Buddy Holly, which are both presented to tunes of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But some choices are unusual, if not downright weird: automobile  
hood ornaments, including the winged silver statue atop the 
Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all things that define the century,'' Challis Davy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For painter S.G. Vosburg, the show was a surreal experience. His  
depiction of World War II life on the home front in the 1995 
painting ``Impressing the Night Shift'' was in the show -- 15 times 
its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first met the people posing as the characters in my  
painting, it was really strange to see them with their makeup on. I 
was wondering why they are made up with shades and streaks, and 
then I realized those are my brush strokes up close,'' he said. 
``It's strange to see your work up close like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show is not without a bit of controversy either this year.  
Typically, the show closes with the re-creation of Leonardo da 
Vinci's painting of ``The Last Supper.'' But in keeping with the 
20th-century theme, the final piece is Salvador Dali's 1955 
painting, ``The Sacrament of the Last Supper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tradition is a big deal here. People come back year after  
year. We've actually had a few people demand their money back,'' 
said Sharbie Higuchi, the pageant's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 140,000 people are expected to attend the show, which  
runs through Aug. 29.

<HEADLINE> Paul Allen's Cable Co. Plans IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen plans to sell  
$3.5 billion worth of stock to finance his new-age communications 
empire, a patchwork of cable TV systems with the potential to 
deliver the Internet and telephone calls to the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial public offering, or IPO, is expected to take place  
in the third quarter and will be coordinated by the investment bank 
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Charter said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen bought St. Louis-based Charter just last summer. At the  
time, Charter had 1.2 million subscribers in 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Charter has bought or announced plans to buy 11  
other cable companies for more than $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deals are finalized, Charter will have 6.2 million  
subscribers in 36 states, making it the fourth-largest cable 
company in the country behind AT&AMP;T, Time Warner and Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry observers say Allen probably has more on his mind  
than cable TV. He may see Charter as an encore to Microsoft's 
dominance of the software industry, another chance to get in on the 
ground floor of a technological revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to get in on the second wave,'' said Joshua Cho,  
financial editor at Cable World magazine. ``First it was personal 
computers with Microsoft. This is the second wave for its 
high-speed data and all the applications that go into that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That data -- from interactive TV, high-speed Internet access, and  
local and long-distance calling -- is expected to flow through a 
single phone or cable wire to the nation's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to use cable as the big conduit to offer the public a  
whole variety of services,'' said Simon Applebaum, senior editor of 
Cablevision magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in your home, all through the TV set, all one  
connection,'' Applebaum said. ``He sees the IPO as sort of the 
quick financial lift to make it happen for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charter's spending spree comes amid a rapid transformation of  
the cable industry led by AT&AMP;T, which also plans to provide 
high-speed Internet access and telephone service over cable TV 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
	Between acquisitions and spending to upgrade cable equipment for  
two-way communications, AT&AMP;T is expected to spend more than $150 
billion on its strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Charter vice chairman Barry Babcock said during a panel

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive Alert Raises Cost Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy experts cautiously predict that  
Americans are unlikely to see much higher gasoline prices because 
of the Environmental Protection Agency's wish to curtail use of a 
common fuel additive. 
</P>
<P>
	But confusion about what would replace the methanol-based  
additive in a federal program that requires ``reformulated 
gasoline'' to be sold in areas with the most severe air pollution 
leaves unclear what might happen at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA advisory panel, in a report released Tuesday, recognized  
that reformulated gas has improved air quality in several 
metropolitan areas. The 1990 Clean Air Act mandates that 
reformulated gas contain a higher amount of oxygen, and MTBE has 
become the most widely used oxygenate additive to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical is in gasoline sold in at least 16 states, or  
altogether in about a third of the nation's motor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel said concerns are growing about MTBE's appearance  
in groundwater, where it causes a foul smell and taste while not 
yet posing a health risk, and recommended its use be substantially 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner responded by saying the agency  
would work with Congress on legislation to maintain the 
reformulated-gas program but phase out MTBE. She also a promised a 
crackdown on leaking underground storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested removing the oxygenate requirement to allow  
more alternatives to MTBE to emerge and reduce the chances of 
disruptions in the nation's fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator for air and  
radiation, stressed that any changes to the program must safeguard 
water supplies without sacrificing air quality gains. A reduction 
in MTBE must also protect consumers from gas price fluctuations and 
preserve the use of renewable fuels, such as corn-based ethanol, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	How the EPA would propose to meet all those goals was unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested MTBE use be gradually decreased over four  
years so refiners could find other ways to reduce toxic chemical 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given enough time for a transition ... the impact on  
(gasoline) prices should be very small or not noticeable,'' said 
Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects 
Institute and chairman of the advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy analysts tend to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who this is really traumatic for are the refiners  
who've invested production money into MTBE,'' said analyst Tim 
Evans at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If many refiners go bankrupt from their investments in MTBE, a  
reduction in overall production capacity could lead to spot 
gasoline shortages and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Evans said: ``I wouldn't expect to see any immediate  
impact of prices at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious replacement for MTBE would be ethanol, but it  
costs more to make. It also evaporates more readily, particularly 
in hot summer months, releasing organic pollutants. For that 
reason, to be used in the summer it must be blended with a more 
expensive, cleaner-burning gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	And ethanol is primarily manufactured in the Midwest, making it  
difficult now to get it to key West Coast and Northeast markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Knight, chief lobbyist for the National Corn Growers  
Association, said ethanol plants produce enough of the fuel now to 
meet the needs of the large California market. They could quickly 
grow their capacity -- outside the Midwest, if needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible alternative is a blend of alkalytes and  
aromatics, which are derived from crude oil, though neither is an 
oxygenate. Aromatics are slightly less expensive than ethanol, but 
pose risks of increased toxic emissions. Alkalytes, though clean 
burning, are low-octane and would require pricey capital 
investment.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle's Late-Nite Landing Dazzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's first female commander guided  
space shuttle Columbia to a dazzling late-night landing after 
delivering the world's most powerful X-ray telescope to orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a nearly full moon, Eileen Collins completed the 1.8  
million mile journey at 11:20 p.m. Tuesday, becoming the first 
woman to land a spaceship of any kind, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few hours of her triumph, NASA confirmed what it had  
already suspected: Hydrogen fuel leaked from one of the shuttle's 
main engines during liftoff five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like several of the tubes are damaged in the nozzle,  
and it looks like we had a real hydrogen leak there,'' shuttle 
manager Bill Gerstenmaier said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the leak -- and an unrelated short circuit that  
happened just five seconds into the flight -- as significant 
failures. If more hydrogen fuel had seeped out during Columbia's 
8 1/2-minute climb to orbit Friday, the engine could have shut down, 
forcing the shuttle to attempt an unprecedented emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Video of the right engine nozzle, taken following touchdown,  
showed that two, three or possibly even four hydrogen-circulating 
tubes were ruptured. The slender tubes are made of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerstenmaier said it's too soon to know whether the problems  
will delay the next shuttle flight, a radar-mapping mission by 
Endeavour in September. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, anyway, the spotlight is on Collins, a former test  
pilot and aircraft commander who was the first woman to lead a 
mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Air Force colonel made only the 12th space  
shuttle touchdown in darkness. The runway was illuminated by xenon 
lights and the shuttle's bright rockets illuminated the dark night. 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Collins posed for pictures in front of Columbia about  
1 1/2 hours after landing. ``Get over here you guys,'' she called to 
her four crewmates, who joined her for the photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	At five days, it was NASA's shortest planned shuttle flight in  
nine years. Despite its brevity, the mission to deliver the $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory to orbit was a plum assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of NASA officials greeted Collins on the runway following  
touchdown. Among the welcoming crowd of about 150 were her husband 
and 3 1/2-year-old daughter, Bridget. 
</P>
<P>
	A far bigger celebration was planned later today in Houston.  
Vice President Gore was expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen Collins represents the very best of this country,''  
said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin. ``She was cool and calm and 
handled the problem she had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra is using its thrusters to eventually reach an orbit  
extending one-third of the way to the moon. Once there, the 45-foot 
telescope will spend five years searching for signs of black holes 
and studying galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a while before Columbia, NASA's oldest space shuttle,  
flies again. By the end of September, it should be on its way to 
California for a yearlong overhaul.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Fifteen former Mexico City police officers  
have been sentenced to 40 years in prison for kidnapping and raping 
three teen-age girls in a case that contributed to the downfall of 
the capital's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	After an investigation, clouded by retracted statements by the  
girls, Judge Leonardo Perez Martinez ruled Tuesday night that there 
was sufficient evidence to find the men guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, officers from a police cavalry unit were accused  
of kidnapping the girls -- ages 13, 15, and 18 -- when the teens 
stopped them to ask directions to a Mexico City park. The girls 
said they were taken to a police stable where, during four days of 
captivity, they were raped repeatedly and forced to cook and clean 
for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were found guilty of rape, sexual abuse and illegal  
deprivation of liberty. In addition to their prison sentences, they 
were ordered to pay fines of between $3,800 and $6,300. 
</P>

	NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) -- It would have be a routine drug  
arrest for an unexceptional amount of marijuana -- except for one 
thing. The two men caught with the drug at the U.S.-Mexico border 
were heading south. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs police said the arrest Wednesday was the first they  
could remember in which anyone was caught trying to slip drugs into 
Mexico from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men, Mexican citizens with U.S. residency, were stopped  
at the customs station after they left Laredo, Texas. Officers 
found 66 pounds marijuana in two sacks in a toolbox in the truck's 
cargo area. The truck, with Texas license plates, was seized and 
the men arrested and handed over to federal police on suspicion of 
drugtrafficking.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Teams searched Wednesday for the body of a  
5-year-old American girl who drowned along with her father when 
they were swept into a river near the Pacific resort of Puerto 
Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaylie Kristine Scott had been swimming in the Boca de Tomatlan  
River, 10 miles south of Puerto Vallarta, when she was carried off 
by a current Tuesday afternoon, the Puerto Vallarta fire department 
reported. Her father, 35-year-old Derek John Scott, also was swept 
away when he tried to rescue the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's body was recovered Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Scott and his daughter were vacationing from their hometown of  
Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, along with his wife and another child, 
according to the U.S. Consulate office in Guadalajara, 120 miles 
east of Puerto Vallarta.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Authorities at Mexico City's international  
airport doubt a businessman's story that kidnappers seized him in a 
bathroom, local media reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Gutierrez Cortina, president of real estate developer  
Grupo Fondo Opcion, said that he was kidnapped on June 1 after 
attackers drugged him. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack allegedly took place in an airport bathroom after  
Gutierrez had left his bodyguards behind at a security checkpoint. 
Gutierrez said he managed to escape days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal attorney general's office announced Tuesday it has  
begun an investigation;. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport director Roberto Canovas said there was no evidence of  
the alleged kidnapping and doubted it would be possible to have 
sneaked an unconscious Gutierrez out of the airport, the daily 
Reforma reported Wednesday.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Mexican government will pay for security  
for candidates in the 2000 presidential race and work with the 
various political parties to determine how to best ensure each 
man's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the top contenders had expressed concern about potential  
attacks. In Mexico's last presidential race in 1994, a gunman 
assassinated ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio during a 
campaign rally in the border city of Tijuana. 
</P>

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori used his annual  
state-of-the-union address Wednesday to announce measures to help 
Peruvians weather a deep economic recession, but did not say if he 
will run for office in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori is expected to run for a third consecutive term in  
office in next April's presidential elections despite an apparent 
constitutional ban on such a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government would continue to toe a tight fiscal  
line, but would double a $1 billion pension fund for retirees next 
year and introduce other measures to help the poor through the 
economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition legislators called the measures populist and directed  
toward next year's elections.

	Despite economic growth brought by Fujimori's free market  
economic reforms, half of Peruvians still live in poverty and

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Determined to play a leading role in  
Brazil's energy market, the U.S.-based Duke Energy Corp. on 
Wednesday purchased a major Sao Paulo state power generating 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	In its largest investment to date in Latin America, Duke paid  
$685 million for a controlling share of Companhia de Geracao de 
Energia Eletrica Paranapanema. The amount paid at the privatization 
auction, held in Sao Paulo's Stock Exchange, was 90 percent more 
than the minimum bidding price of $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited. We expect this to be a very good business  
for Duke,'' Peter Wilt, senior vice president for Duke Energy 
International, said after the auction. 
</P>
<P>
	With a generating capacity of 2,300 megawatts, Paranapanema  
operates eight plants in Brazil's most populous and heavily 
industrialized state. It is the first of three state-owned 
generating companies belonging to Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo 
to be privatized.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Honduras' human rights commissioner  
on Wednesday accused the armed forces of hiding graves on a

</P>
<P>
	A missing American, James Francis Carney, could be among those  
buried at the El Aguacate air base, 80 miles east of Tegucigalpa, 
Commissioner Leo Valladares said. He said investigations indicated 
the graves contain the remains of 184 missing people. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-acre air base was used in the 1980s as a training  
center for the U.S.-backed ``Contra'' forces who were fighting the 
leftist Sandinista government in nearby Nicaragua. 
</P>

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Gendarmes fired rubber bullets  
and tear gas Wednesday to quell a protest by some 5,000 unpaid 
public workers in the province of Corrientes, leaving at least 12 
demonstrators injured, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash was the latest in a series of sporadic incidents  
stemming from a months-long dispute by provincial employees 
demanding back pay in Corrientes, 515 miles north of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving to ease tensions, the government said Wednesday it would  
give $55 million to provincial authorities to help meet demands for 
back pay. The announcement in Buenos Aires came as gendarmes in 
Corrientes dispersed protesters marching on a major bridge crossing 
the Parana river. 
</P>
<P>
	One demonstrator was seriously injured when he was struck in the  
face by a flying tear gas canister, the news agency Diarios y 
Noticias reported. Other injuries were caused by rubber bullets and 
many demonstrators still blocked the bridge after the midday 
incident, reports said.

<HEADLINE> McNabb Still Absent From Eagles Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- When Donovan McNabb finally signs a  
contract and puts on a Philadelphia Eagles uniform, he'll see just 
how vocal, critical and hungry fans are for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	He is off to a remarkably slow start.  
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, once a source of optimism after the Eagles' pathetic  
3-13 season, remained absent from training camp Wednesday and 
locked in a bitter contract dispute. Making matters worse, the 
Eagles were still seething over racially inflammatory comments made 
by McNabb's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	It is just the kind of dark cloud this franchise needed to avoid  
as it opened the first training camp under new coach Andy Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want him in here,'' Tom Modrak, the Eagles' director of  
football operations, said Wednesday as veterans began reporting to 
Lehigh University. ``It's valuable time. ... Things like this tend 
to take away from it, but we're not going to let it. We're just 
going to keep moving forward. We want him here, and I believe he 
wants to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and the Eagles were still at an  
impasse over how to structure a seven-year contract believed to be 
worth at least $50 million. Smith wants the contract to include 
voidable years and a buy-back clause, so McNabb could renegotiate 
or become a free agent after three or four seasons. The Eagles want 
no part of such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate took a nasty turn with Smith's assertion that race  
may be playing a role in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview which aired Tuesday on Philadelphia's Comcast  
SportsNet, Smith raised the possibility that the Eagles were 
reluctant to give McNabb a contract without voidable years because 
he is black. He cited white quarterbacks Tim Couch, Peyton Manning, 
Ryan Leaf and Kerry Collins who got such deals, and a black 
quarterback -- Steve McNair -- who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why pull the plug now when for the past couple of years you've  
been consistently doing it for the white quarterbacks?'' Smith 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith softened his comments in an interview with The Associated  
Press, saying, ``I really don't think race is an issue in this 
contract negotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the damage was done. Joe Banner, the Eagles' executive vice  
president who has been negotiating with Smith, issued an angry 
denial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our track record speaks for itself,'' said Banner,  
pointing out that blacks have held top positions in the 
organization -- from coach to personnel director to starting 
quarterback. ``I think it's an unfair accusation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at his Chicago office Wednesday afternoon, Smith said he  
and Banner hadn't spoken since Monday. Smith said the holdup was 
``how those last few years are going to be structured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith added that he hoped the recent controversy would not  
affect the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope enough has been said about an issue that was really not  
an issue,'' Smith said. ``I hope it's put to bed and we can resume 
our conversations and get this thing done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb missed his third day of practice Wednesday, and is not  
likely to arrive in time for Thursday's first full-squad workout 
even if he signs before Reid blows the whistle on the morning 
running drills. 
</P>
<P>
	Although McNabb is slated to back up starter Doug Pederson, his  
chances of taking over the job are hurt with each missed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him here,'' cornerback Troy Vincent said. ``Coming off  
a 3-13 season, we need everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the issue of voidable years, there is  
disagreement over what Smith and the Eagles agreed to when McNabb 
was picked second in the draft and anointed with the role of saving 
the franchise from a dismal era. 
</P>
<P>
	Before making their choice, the Eagles talked with agents for  
all the players they were considering. They indicated that their 
discussions with Smith formed the basis for an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner has declined to specify what was agreed to on draft day,  
but Smith said nothing was binding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's some discrepancy as to what was discussed on  
draft day,'' Smith said. ``I didn't want to do anything until I saw 
what Tim Couch did. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did have some discussions on draft day. It wasn't ever that  
this is the deal, we're done, Donovan's signed. That was not the 
deal.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Adding Minorities to TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC, which has been criticized along  
with other major networks for planning nearly all-white fall 
series, is adding ethnic characters to at least five shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC executives said they began the effort to make their programs  
more inclusive in May, before the NAACP and other groups condemned 
TV's lack of racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we have an obligation to reflect society as it  
exists,'' Stu Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment Television Group 
co-chairman, told the Television Critics Association on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As presented in pilot form this spring, none of the 27 new  
comedies and dramas set to premiere on the top four networks had 
minorities in a leading role; few had them in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority characters are being added to ABC's ``Wasteland,'' a  
new drama about young New Yorkers, and to ``Once and Again,'' from 
``thirtysomething'' creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Upcoming ABC shows ``Talk to Me'' and ``Bellevue'' will gain  
ethnic characters, as will returning series ``Sabrina.'' The 
sitcom's two new characters will include a Hispanic woman, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said producers were  
asked to look for opportunities to diversify their casts but were 
not issued a directive to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting a very long time for this and it's a step  
in the right direction,'' said Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the 
National Council of La Raza. The council and other Latino groups on 
Tuesday demanded more Hispanic representation on TV and called for 
a weeklong boycott of the four major networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. population is 11 percent Hispanic, but Hispanics make  
up less than 2 percent of the characters on primetime TV shows, Ms. 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People announced a new initiative to monitor how well the 
entertainment industry reflects America's ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Will Riot Spell End of Woodstock? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The idea of more Woodstocks -- or any other giant  
multi-day rock festival -- may have gone up in the flames stoked by 
rampaging rock fans this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The riot that ended the three-day Woodstock '99 over the weekend  
will probably make it difficult for anyone who wants to stage such 
a concert again, industry watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now you have to ask yourself whether any community would  
ever allow another Woodstock,'' said Bob Grossweiner, a concert 
industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's final act, Red Hot Chili Peppers, was performing  
before what was left of the 225,000 music fans at an abandoned 
military base in Rome, N.Y., when a mob began to set fire to 12 
tractor-trailers, a small bus and several portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottles were hurled at police and vendor booths destroyed before  
the site was brought under control early Monday. Five people, 
including two state troopers, were injured, and seven people were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second Woodstock of the 1990s modeled after the  
original 1969 concert, known for its memorable music and 
counterculture vibes of peace and love. The rain-drenched Woodstock 
of 1994 is best remembered for its mud. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ugly ending to Woodstock '99, promoters weren't  
talking Tuesday about what this meant for their plan to repeat 
Woodstock every five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of young kids in there, people in high school,''  
said Chris Connelly, who covered the event for MTV. ``You have to 
wonder if parents are going to be very concerned about letting 
their kids go to things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The melee will be remembered by any city that is considering  
allowing music festivals, said James Griffis, town supervisor of 
Saugerties, the last location of a Woodstock festival. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't say if the town would bid again for the next  
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to make it any easier, that's for sure,''  
Griffis said. ``Communities that will want to host it, if there is 
another one in five years, are going to be a lot more cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A New York state senator said Tuesday she will propose  
legislation giving the state final say over any such mass 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be pretty hard for (promoters) to find a  
community that will accept things on the terms they dictated this 
time,'' said Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a Syracuse Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock festivals that last several days are already a rarity in  
the United States, in part because promoters lost money on the 
first two Woodstocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were unable to explain what triggered the melee, but  
there was no shortage of theories: hot weather unrelieved by rain, 
dissatisfaction caused by filthy grounds and high food prices, or 
simple lawlessness propelled by peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock's most popular artists -- Limp Bizkit, Korn, Kid Rock  
and Rage Against the Machine -- specialize in an aggressive 
combination of rock and rap that some say encourages aggressive 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids like this are basically nonviolent unless somebody  
instigated them,'' Grossweiner said, ``and the instigation came 
from the stage.''

<HEADLINE> Gruesome Photos Used in Fla. Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Lawyers who say Florida's electric chair  
delivers cruel and unusual punishment are using gruesome photos of 
an executed inmate's bloody body to support their case. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said 344-pound Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis suffered  
a nose bleed during his execution on July 8. Because the bleeding 
was unusual, corrections officials took pictures of Davis' body 
while he was still strapped tightly to the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos show Davis grimacing. His face appears purplish and  
his eyes black. There is a large spot of blood on his chest and 
drips of blood on the collar of his white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures are being used by lawyers for convicted killer  
Thomas Provenzano, the next inmate scheduled for electrocution. The 
attorneys argue that the chair is unconstitutional and that Davis 
and other executed inmates suffered pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Provenzano's execution was postponed from July 9 to September,  
and the Florida Supreme Court ordered a hearing on the chair's 
constitutionality. Circuit Judge Clarence Johnson has until Monday 
to issue a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donald Price, a neurophysiologist testifying Wednesday for  
Provenzano, said electrocutions result ``in enormous pain and 
suffering and other related emotional experiences such as fear and 
dread.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price said a prisoner can experience pain three different times:  
when guards strap him in, when electrical currents penetrate his 
brain and when the currents cause burns and muscle contractions. 
</P>
<P>
	During a 1997 execution in Florida, flames shot out from behind  
the leather mask covering an inmate's face. After that, corrections 
officials decided to photograph inmates if anything unusual 
occurred. Davis' death -- the fifth since Medina's -- was the first 
deemed unusual enough for pictures, said C.J. Drake, a spokesman 
for the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report said Davis had ``several predisposing risk  
factors'' for nosebleeds, including hypertension and arthritis that 
required him to take blood-thinners.

<HEADLINE> FBI Davidian Conclusion Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Evidence stored by the Texas Rangers may  
contradict the U.S. government's claim that no pyrotechnic devices 
were fired into the Branch Davidian compound the day it burned, The 
Dallas Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80 followers died  
in the 1993 inferno at the compound 10 miles east of Waco, Texas. 
Authorities have denied using any incendiary devices during the 
assault that ended when the compound was consumed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concluded that sect members set the fire.  
</P>
<P>
	A probe by the Texas Rangers became the backbone of a 1994  
criminal trial in which eight Branch Davidians were convicted of 
charges ranging from manslaughter to weapons violations. More than 
12 tons of evidence were gathered and much of it is stored in Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher for a 1997 documentary critical of the government's  
conduct was allowed access to the evidence last spring, the Morning 
News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher, Michael McNulty, who is preparing a new  
documentary on the standoff, said he found that at least six items 
listed in Texas Ranger inventories as silencers or suppressors were 
actually ``flash-bang'' devices, commonly used by law enforcement 
to stun suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty said the devices sometimes ignite fires in enclosed  
spaces because they emit a loud bang and flash driven by a small 
pyrotechnic charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Rangers' evidence logs indicate the devices were found in  
areas of the Davidian compound in which the fires broke out, 
McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our belief that these pieces of ordnance could and  
probably did have an impact on the fire on April 19th,'' he told 
the Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin called the conclusion  
``nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know of no evidence to support that any incendiary device  
was fired into the compound on April 19, 1993,'' Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davidians and authorities became locked in a 51-day standoff  
after agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were 
fired upon when they tried to arrest Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The compound erupted in flames April 19 when federal agents  
punched through the walls and fired tear gas inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings have pointed to mistakes by the law  
enforcement officers, but none has been charged with a crime. A 
lawsuit filed by surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead 
challenges the conclusion that the Davidians started the fire and 
also shot first during the raid.

<HEADLINE> Umps Likely To Fight Over Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Sports Analysis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that they've lost their fight with baseball,  
look for umpires to battle with each other over the future of union 
head Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	In spring training, umpires voted 49-14 to give him a new  
five-year contract, with most of the opposing votes from the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
	When a dozen AL umps refused to go along with Phillips' strategy  
of mass resignations last week, the umpires' position crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Now baseball knows it is dealing with a divided union, and it's  
hard to envision umpires uniting as long as Phillips remains in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously didn't turn out to be the right move because we  
had defectors,'' said AL ump Richie Garcia, a Phillips backer who 
appears to have lost his job. ``Most of the stuff a union does, 
anything a union does, will not work if the body doesn't stick 
together. And we didn't stick together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players achieved their tremendous gains by maintaining a nearly  
solid front through eight work stoppages since 1972, increasing the 
average salary from $34,000 to $1.72 million in the past 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Miller, who masterminded the players' position for many  
of those years, can't fathom Phillips' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where he's going,'' Miller said Wednesday. ``It's  
so ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By resigning en masse, then suing baseball and attempting to  
withdraw the resignations, the umpires lost all job protection 
under federal law, according to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at an extreme disadvantage,'' he said. ``They've put  
themselves in a very difficult position, mostly because they've 
given the owners and the leagues so many options and so many 
weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's clear that somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of the  
union won't follow Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, as long as he heads the union, umpires won't  
have any power, according to lawyers who are involved with major 
league baseball through the player's union, agents and management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our association fell apart when the American League guys went  
the other way, and it totally devastated our negotiations,'' NL ump 
Randy Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The events of the last two weeks have left NL umps angry at  
their AL counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in the minors, I looked up to the major league  
umpires and how they did their job,'' the NL's Angel Hernandez 
said. ``I would never have thought that a couple of guys would take 
out a personal vendetta to try to break us apart. But that was what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips called for the resignations at a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, a day after the All-Star game, wanting to 
seize the initiative and not wait until the expiration of the 
current labor contract Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Because that tactic backfired, umpires will finish the contract  
and wonder if they'll be locked out next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But 22 -- nine in the AL and 13 in the NL -- are losing their  
jobs, replaced Sept. 1 by 25 new hires from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the pro- and anti-Phillips factions will fight for the  
votes of the new union members. Phillips' chief backers are union 
president Jerry Crawford, Bruce Froemming and Terry Tata in the NL 
and Garcia in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction has sought advice from Ron Shapiro,  
the agent for Cal Ripken. This group says that after 22 years, it's 
time to replace Phillips with a less confrontational leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``His expertise in negotiating is what got us where we are,''  
Garcia said. ``He's been successful in negotiating and we're 
getting punished for it.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Defends Agribusiness Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Low crop prices aren't being caused by  
agribusiness mergers such as Cargill Inc.'s planned acquisition of 
Continental Grain Co., says the Justice Department's antitrust 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``That price decline is not a product of increased  
concentration'' in agribusiness, Assistant Attorney General Joel I. 
Klein told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday. ``There are 
other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists attribute the recent decline in crop prices to a  
worldwide glut of grain and economic problems in Asia and Europe 
that cut into their food imports. There is no significant 
difference in competition in the industry now than in 1996, when 
commodity prices peaked, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the agricultural economy stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, many lawmakers have been pointing to declining 
competition among food processors, pesticide makers, seed companies 
and other agribusinesses as the culprits. For example, four 
meatpackers control 80 percent of the nation's beef, up from 36 
percent two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department came under criticism this month from  
congressional Democrats for allowing Cargill Inc., North America's 
second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain operations of 
Continental Grain Co. even though the companies were required to 
sell some of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said Klein  
was ignoring a long-term decline in commodity prices relative to 
what consumers pay for food. ``Power in the marketing chain gives 
you a greater share of the retail dollar,'' Conrad said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Cargill deal, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told Klein the  
forced divestiture wouldn't ``mean a darn thing back on the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department estimates Cargill and Continental  
control 42 percent of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold 
overseas and at least 20 percent of wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's action will ensure buyers are still  
available to compete for farmers' grain, Klein said. It's in 
farmers' interest for U.S. companies to cut their costs because 
they have to compete overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't compete efficiently in Asia, if we don't compete  
efficiently in Europe to sell products, that's going to hurt the 
family farm,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also told the panel antitrust laws generally are adequate  
to protect farm interests, although he thinks Congress should give 
Justice responsibility for approving railroad mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Surface Transportation Board, which has authority over  
acquisitions in the railroad industry, approved a $5.4 billion 
merger three years ago between the Union Pacific and Southern 
Pacific over the opposition of the Justice, Transportation and 
Agriculture departments.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Industrial Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Production at Japan's factories and mines rose 3.0  
percent in June for the largest increase in 30 months, the 
government announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-on-month gain, calculated after adjustment for  
seasonal factors, was the largest since January 1997, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also far exceeded forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow  
Jones Newswires. They had predicted industrial production would 
rise 1.6 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials attributed the boost to economic recovery  
around Asia, a key market for Japanese manufactures. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry said further that it expects output to rise 0.5  
percent in July and then increase 3.7 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the ministry announced production had decreased in  
May to its lowest level in five years, dipping 0.7 percent from 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been fighting its worst recession in more than 50  
years. But some bright signs have appeared recently, most notably a 
1.9 percent increase in gross domestic product for the first 
quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Edge Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds edged higher Wednesday as Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan reiterated his readiness to fight inflation 
with higher interest rates, a message most investors expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32  
point, or 31 1/4 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.00 percent from 6.01 
percent at the same point on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were between 1/32 point higher and 1/32 point lower, while 
intermediate-term Treasurys rose 1/16 point to 3/32 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The session was mostly uneventful, with Greenspan offering no  
new clues in a Senate appearance as to whether the Fed might nudge 
its lending rates higher again. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders were also awaiting some key economic data due  
Thursday. The government is scheduled to report on the 
second-quarter economic growth and a reading on employment costs, 
which typically account for two-thirds of a product's price. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in his midyear report to Congress, Greenspan sent  
markets swooning with a warning that inflationary pressures 
persist. Inflation and rising interest rates make fixed-income 
investments like bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
eased to 4.68 percent and the discount to 4.56 percent, each 
falling 0.01 percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields finished at 4.78 percent with a discount rate  
of 4.60 percent, up 0.03 percentage point. One-year yields were 
5.01 percent with a discount of 4.76 percent, down 0.01 percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, held steady at late Tuesday's 4.94 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/32 to 118 21/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.54 percent, up from 5.53 percent late Tuesday.

older people's brains a good workout, boosting memory and 
sharpening judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaerobic exercise -- stretching and weightlifting -- did not  
produce similar cognitive improvements. The experiment was 
conducted at the University of Illinois and reported in Thursday's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The mental benefits of walking were especially significant,  
researchers said, because the senior citizens had not exercised 
regularly before joining the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have chosen a lifetime of relative inactivity can  
benefit mentally from improved aerobic fitness,'' said the study's 
lead author, cognitive neuroscientist Arthur Kramer. ``It's never 
too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers recruited 124 sedentary men and women ages 60 to 75.  
They were randomly assigned to either a walking program or an 
anaerobic regimen of stretching and muscle-toning. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment lasted six months. Walkers eventually were  
completing an hour-long loop around the university's 
Urbana-Champaign campus three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer and others administered a variety of simple tests to  
gauge the participants' ability to plan, establish schedules, make 
and remember choices and rapidly reconsider them if circumstances 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurologists call these brain functions ``executive control  
processes'' because they help a person live independently. They are 
controlled in the brain's frontal and prefrontal lobes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These areas of the brain decline the earliest with aging,''  
Kramer said. ``So executive control is more severely affected by 
the normal aging process than other brain functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, participants were shown alternating letters  
and numbers, and asked to quickly determine between vowels and 
consonants, and odd and even numbers. The exercise is known as task 
switching. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkers' ability to switch tasks improved by 25 percent,  
while the non-walkers' showed little improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that regular exercise may reduce the  
risk of developing Alzheimer's disease later in life, possibly 
because exercise enhances the production of certain hormones and 
other protective compounds in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	But those studies involved only people with long-term exercise  
habits. And Alzheimer's involves the death of brain cells, which is 
different from more generalized memory lapses that frequently 
accompany aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who reviewed the Illinois study said it is not clear how  
walking might stimulate memory and planning ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might just be more a function of people in the study  
interacting with other people,'' said Dr. William Thies of the 
Alzheimer's Association. ``Being isolated is bad for your health 
and bad for your day-to-day functioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering that question is the goal of the Illinois experiment's  
second phase, which began this week. Researchers are taking 
magnetic resonance images of participants' brains to see if there 
is enhanced blood flow in their executive control centers, and if 
it corresponds to the walkers' improved test performance.

	Suicide Prevention Effort Launched  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surgeon general today declared suicide a  
serious public health threat for the first time, launching an 
effort to educate school counselors, parents and even hairdressers 
on how to spot signs of trouble. Suicide is the eighth leading 
cause of death in the United States, claiming about 30,000 lives in 
1997, compared with fewer than 19,000 homicides. About a half 
million Americans are treated in an emergency room each year after 
trying to kill themselves. White men age 65 and older are the most 
likely to commit suicide, accounting for 20 percent of the cases.

<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The death toll climbed to 49 today as  
temperatures rose to above-normal temperatures again from the 
Plains to the East, and no relief was forecast at least through 
this weekend. Authorities urged people to watch out for anyone who 
might be reluctant to use air conditioning. Since July 19, there 
have 18 heat-related deaths in Missouri, 16 in Illinois, 10 in 
Ohio, two in North Carolina and one each in Georgia, Pennsylvania 
and Maryland. In addition to Pennsylvania's one death, Philadelphia 
had 60 heat-related deaths earlier in the summer.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has told Gen.  
Wesley Clark, the American commander who led the successful NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, to give up his command two 
months early next year. Clark, a four-star Army general who is 
supreme allied commander in Europe, called it a routine staff 
change. His successor, Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, is currently 
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. At the White House, spokesman 
Joe Lockhart insisted Clark is not being punished for blunt 
assessments of the alliance's strategy in Kosovo, and wartime 
tension with the Clinton administration.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A counterculture guru turned fugitive,  
convicted in absentia of killing his girlfriend two decades ago, 
was ordered by a jury today to pay her family $907 million for 
wrongful death. The family of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux convinced the 
jury that Ira Einhorn, who is fighting extradition from France, 
should pay for her 1977 death, effectively preventing him from 
profiting from any book or movie deals about the high-profile case. 
He had not even sent someone to defend against the civil suit.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began debate today on a  
Republican-backed bill offering the biggest tax cut in nearly two 
decades. Supporters of the 10-year, $792 billion tax cut were 
immediately confronted by a rival plan put forth by a bipartisan 
group of senators that would lower the size of the reduction to 
$500 billion. ``We probably would be better off holding off on a 
tax cut'' because of the uncertainty of budget surplus projections 
said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying today 
before the Senate Banking Committee.

group of adventure-seeking tourists in the Swiss Alps, killing 19. 
The accident occurred yesterday while a party of 45 tourists and 
eight guides were plunging down waterfalls and rapids on the 
Saxeten brook. A sudden storm swelled the mountain stream into a 
raging torrent. Two of the dead were reportedly guides from 
Adventure World, the tour's organizers.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China's state-run TV news has expanded its  
evening program from 30 minutes to nearly an hour in recent days, 
devoting nearly all the time to denouncing an outlawed meditation 
group. The newscast today showed bulldozers crunching piles of 
video tapes produced by the popular Falun Gong movement. Mounds of

<HEADLINE> Hawkeyes Suspend QB for Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa quarterback Randy Reiners, arrested  
last month on an alcohol charge for the second time in 18 months, 
has been suspended for the Hawkeyes' season-opener against 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior is allowed to practice with the team but will not be  
on the sidelines for the Sept. 4 home game, according to first-year 
coach Kirk Ferentz. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners, one of three players battling for the starting job, was  
arrested at 2:26 a.m. on June 29 after being found ``sleeping or 
passed out'' in a university parking lot, court records showed. 
</P>
<P>
	He registered a .225 on an alcohol breath test before being  
arrested. The legal limit in Iowa is .10. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Reiners was arrested and charged with drunken  
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners has started eight games in his career, including four  
each of the last two years. Last year, he completed 37-of-86 passes 
for 521 yards, three touchdowns and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiners has thrown for 1,428 yards and 15 TDs in his career.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 1, United States 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos    	
</P>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Before a venomous anti-American crowd  
Wednesday night, a goal by Ronaldinho lifted Brazil over a 
surprisingly strong American team 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans held back the offense of the more seasoned  
Brazilian team, improving their chances of advancing to the 
semifinals of the Confederations Cup. The Brazilians are almost 
assured a berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States came out fighting and never gave up,  
dominating possession for much of the game and taking many shots on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Brazilians exploited their opportunities better, and in  
the 12th minute Ronaldinho headed a pass from Serginho into the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States missed its best chance in the 72nd minute,  
when Joe-Max Moore's penalty kick went straight into goalkeeper 
Dida's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams marked the other's players closely. The Brazilians,  
with a deeper bench, speeded up the game wherever they could to 
tire the Americans, while the Americans often slowed it down. 
</P>
<P>
	The rowdy crowd was overwhelmingly with the Brazilians,  
whistling catcalls during ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and chanting 
``Brazil! Brazil!'' The fans erupted with every Brazilian offensive 
and booed when the Americans got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guadalajara area is home to many American immigrants, and  
people resent the treatment Hispanics receive up north. At the same 
time, Brazil was based in Guadalajara in its 1970 World Cup victory 
and again in the 1986 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has us very oppressed,'' said Luis Damazo, a  
42-year-old merchant. ``This is the only place where we can let out 
our feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This victory, together with Brazil's 4-0 rout of Germany on  
Saturday, virtually guaranteed the Brazilians a spot in the 
semifinals. The other semifinal spot will be determined Friday 
between the United States and Germany, which beat New Zealand 2-0 
earlier Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Tillman Franks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Tillman Franks grew up in a world of  
honky-tonks and hillbilly tunes, that triangle between Louisiana, 
Texas and Arkansas that he still calls the ``country soul of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fell in love early on with the kind of music that celebrates  
hard lives, lost loves, bad men who go out carousing and the good 
women who wait at home for them -- the kind of music that pays 
tribute to the rough-edged folks who listened to church songs and 
torch songs with equal fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been the best place in the world for music,  
the holy triangle,'' Franks says. ``You can find any kind and every 
kind -- country, blues, rock 'n' roll, anything -- and it's all 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks, 79, went on to find fame in the world of country music.  
But not the kind of fame that sent shrieking girls after him or 
caused theaters to sell out when he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks is the kind of famous where a lot of famous people know  
him. The kind of famous that existed when big things were 
happening. He was part of building the legends around countless 
country music stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in country music knows Tillman,'' says Merle Kilgore,  
manager of Hank Williams Jr. ``And those of us who've been around 
for a while have stories about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks' little office is crowded with a very special brand of  
memorabilia. A musician, songwriter, manager and producer, Franks 
has done everything from back-up groups to book talent to lend 
money or supply groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	The walls are hung with records he helped write, pictures of  
people he helped launch -- including a young Elvis Presley and Hank 
Williams -- awards he's won and letters from people he's known. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. postage stamp of Hank Williams shows the singer wearing  
one of Franks' suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so poor when he was starting out he didn't have a  
suit,'' said Franks, who booked Williams for many of his early 
gigs. ``So we cut one of mine down to fit him. It's my photo of him 
that was used for the stamp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks is also the man who booked a young Presley onto the  
Louisiana Hayride when Presley was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship that still pays dividends was Franks' long  
association with Johnny Horton, who had Top-10 country hits like 
``Battle of New Orleans,'' ``North to Alaska'' and ``Sink the 
Bismarck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Franks and Horton were both down and out when they  
got together. Franks had been fired by the Hayride and Horton, who 
then billed himself as ``The Singing Fisherman,'' was spending more 
time fishing than singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Tillman, if you'll manage me I'll hit No. 1,''  
Franks recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	And Horton promised they'd make some money on the way.  
</P>
<P>
	Franks had enough faith in Horton to sell some of the songs he'd  
written to pay off Horton's mortgage and to finance a 1955 trip to 
Nashville to record ``Honky-Tonk Man,'' which Franks and Horton 
wrote with Howard Hausey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the playback and said, `Johnny, this is it. You've  
done it with this one.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The song flew into the Top 10, as did ``I'm a One Woman Man,''  
recorded at the same session, and Horton became known as the 
Honky-Tonk Man rather than the Singing Fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	At Franks' urging, Horton recorded ``When It's Springtime in  
Alaska,'' a song used in Horton's stage show. That was followed by 
``Battle of New Orleans,'' and ``North to Alaska,'' the theme song 
of a John Wayne movie. 
</P>
<P>
	But Horton suddenly started holding seances and became  
fascinated with the supernatural. He feared air travel, telling 
Franks he was convinced he was about to die violently. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton's prediction came true as he drove back from an  
appearance in Austin, Texas, on Nov. 5, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to get back to Shreveport because duck season was  
starting,'' Franks says. ``He was driving pretty fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a bridge near Milano, Texas, a pickup truck swerved into  
Horton's car, shearing the driver's side. Horton died on the way to 
the hospital; Franks, who was asleep in the seat next to Horton, 
had only cuts to his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a loss,'' Franks says. ``He was just getting into  
his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horton's music lives on, however.  
</P>
<P>
	His records have regained popularity and young singers are  
discovering his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm making a living today because of the songs I wrote for  
Johnny Horton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks also performs, playing bass for gigs in Texas, Louisiana,  
Arkansas, and anywhere else he can. He was honored at the 50th 
Anniversary show for the Louisiana Hayride. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a pretty funny life I guess, but it's always been  
interesting,'' Franks said. ``I've had the pleasure of knowing a 
lot of people and enjoying most of them.''

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent in June, boosted by gains 
in autos and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods  
-- items expected to last at least three years -- increased $64 
million last month to a seasonally adjusted $196.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase followed a 0.8 percent gain in May, less than what  
the government previously estimated, and a drop of 2.4 percent in 
orders in April. June's performance marked the sixth increase in 
the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	But June's increase was smaller than many analysts had expected.  
They predicted that orders for manufactured goods would rise 0.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for transportation equipment rose a sizable 2.7 percent  
in June, led by an increase in demand for autos and car parts. U.S. 
automakers are enjoying a good year of sales, hovering near record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in the transportation sector came despite a  
decrease in aircraft and airplane parts, which had led growth in 
the transportation category in May. 
</P>
<P>
	June's rise in orders for transportation products followed a  
hefty 9 percent increase in May, slightly less than the government 
initially estimated, and a sharp 12.5 percent decline in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation sector is often volatile from month to month  
because it includes such big ticket purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices, meanwhile, have risen sharply in recent weeks  
spurred by higher crude oil prices and increased demand caused by 
recovering world economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the strength in transportation, overall orders for  
durable goods would have fallen 0.4 percent in June, the fourth 
decrease in the last sixth months. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, however,  
rose a solid 2.1 percent in June, following a 0.8 percent decline 
in May and a 0.3 percent advance in April. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been battered by a global financial  
crisis, which has cut sharply into their overseas sales, and also 
opened them up to stiffer competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the weakness in manufacturing, which has lost 488,000  
jobs since March 1998, the overall economy has continued to do 
exceptionally well, powered by strong consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the  
global turmoil has been steel. Today's report indicated that the 
industry is recovering slowly from the global crisis and may be 
still feeling its lingering effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders  
pretty much hold steady in June, following a percent 0.5 percent 
gain in May and a solid 1.6 percent increase in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery, the category which includes  
computers, however, fell a sharp 5.4 percent in June, the second 
monthly decline in a row. In May, orders dropped 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current  
demand increased 0.9 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a private research group,  
reported that consumer confidence fell in July after rising eight 
straight months to a 30-year-high. Economists said it partly was 
the result of the Federal Reserve Board's June 30 move to nudge up 
interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Push On With Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rejected a Democratic call for  
scaled-down tax cuts Wednesday night as Republicans pushed a 
larger, $792 billion measure toward passage despite a fresh word of 
caution from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and a veto 
threat from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 60-39 against a Democratic proposal for cuts of  
$290 billion over 10 years, an amount that supporters said would 
leave enough money to safeguard Social Security, Medicare and other 
domestic priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, countered the Democratic plan was  
``too puny to do the economic good that ought to be done. It's too 
puny to return political and economic freedom to the taxpayers of 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was the first of substance on the tax issue, which is  
expected to come to a final Senate vote by Friday. And it 
underscored the Republican command of the Senate floor on the 
issue, despite a largely symbolic retreat earlier in the day in 
which the GOP was forced to agree to make any tax cuts expire in 
2009. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., anticipating passage by Friday of a 10-year bill that 
contains tax breaks for individuals, families, education, IRAs, 
long-term care insurance, small businesses and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be talking about allowing the people to keep  
just a little bit more of their own hard-earned money,'' Lott said. 
House-Senate negotiations on a compromise were possible by the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, told  
reporters there was ``zero room'' for compromise on the figure of 
$290 billion, and Democrats crafted their alternative to convey 
their claim that the GOP measure could damage the economy while 
shortchanging important programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``is more of a responsible approach, and I would hope that we  
would not revisit the mistakes of the past,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev., in a reference to large Republican-crafted tax cuts 
of the 1980s that led to the exploding federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the Democratic proposal was a large increase  
in the standard deduction for both singles and married couples, 
although it also contained breaks for education, long-term care and 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drew the support of 39 of the Senate's 45  
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	A new nationwide poll suggested that support for a tax cut  
lagged behind a desire to safeguard Social Security. Given four 
choices for the use of projected surpluses, 47 percent in an ABC 
News survey picked Social Security, 22 percent selected a tax cut, 
19 percent wanted to reduce the national debt and 10 percent 
favored domestic programs. The survey had a margin of error of 
three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy forecast to produce large surpluses -- an  
estimated $2.9 trillion over 10 years -- Republicans stressed they 
were proposing to return roughly 25 cents of each dollar to 
taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure the American people that Congress' tax plan will  
not overheat the economy,'' the Senate Budget Committee chairman 
said in comments designed to blunt Greenspan's caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``By saving nearly all of the surpluses over the next two years,  
our plan should postpone the amount'' of interest rate increasing 
the Federal Reserve feels obligated to take, added Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who wins bipartisan praise for his stewardship of the  
nation's central bank, appeared a short while earlier before the 
Senate Banking Committee, and repeated words of caution he had 
uttered previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut  
immediately, largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are 
doing a great deal of good to the economy,'' he said. Greenspan 
said his first preference would be to allocate surplus funds to 
retire the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said he would prefer a tax cut over using the  
surplus for spending on government programs, and Republicans said 
that was precisely what President Clinton and the Democrats 
intended to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate here is not between reducing the debt and cutting  
taxes, '' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``The debate is between 
taxpayers spending money and Washington spending money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As debate began, the Clinton administration issued a statement  
saying the president ``strongly opposes the package of tax cuts'' 
crafted by the Republicans and ``would veto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As written, the GOP proposal called for reducing the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is currently taxed at 28 percent. Together, those provisions 
account for nearly $300 billion of the $792 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the legislation includes relief from the so-called  
marriage penalty that forces some couples to pay more in taxes than 
they would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee, also inserted several provisions to assist taxpayers 
saving for their retirements. One would raise contribution levels; 
another would permit individuals who are at least 50 years old to 
make larger contributions to their retirement plans than are 
otherwise allowed. Republicans stressed the benefit of that 
provision for women, in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Another element of the measure would provide a tax credit for  
employer-provided child care. 
</P>
<P>
	The allowable deduction for interest on student loans would be  
increased and a temporary tax break for employer-provided education 
would be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurance tax breaks would be made more generous, and a  
new deduction would be created for the cost of long-term care 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Estate taxes, which were cut in the tax measure Clinton signed  
in 1997, would be cut again.

<HEADLINE> Daimler, GM Gas Tank Probe Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration has upgraded an investigation into millions of 
DaimlerChrysler minivans and General Motors pickups because of 
possible gas tank leaks during side-impact crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a monthly report released Tuesday, the agency said its  
investigators will examine the fuel tank construction on minivans 
from model years 1996-1999 and some pickups from model years 
1994-99. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 2 million of the minivans and nearly 1.3 million  
of the pickups on the road, the agency estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Both DaimlerChrylser and GM representatives have said the  
companies are cooperating in the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork 
including any complaints, as in the DaimlerChrysler and GM cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are 
defective. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also upgraded an investigation into 85 complaints  
from motorists of fuel leakage in Ford Motor Co. Mercury Villager 
cars from model years 1993-1997. The consumers complained of 
leakage from loose clamps or hoses in the engine's fuel rail 
assembly, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is upgrading these investigations:  
</P>
<P>
	--1991-1996 GM S-10 series pickup trucks; 171 complaints that the  
mechanism fails that holds the spare tire stored underneath the 
pickup trucks, allowing the tire to fall while motorists are 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	One injury has been reported and there have been more than 6,000  
warranty claims on the parts holding the tire, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	--1992-95 Cherokee and Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles; 118  
complaints that the brake rotors can corrode and crack or separate 
causing braking problems, including increased stopping distance. 
</P>
<P>
	--1987-1992 Cadillac Allante cars; 415 complaints of partial or  
total loss of braking power on the anti-lock braking system. 
</P>
<P>
	--1995 Mazda Miata cars; 21 motorist complaints the air bags  
deployed inadvertently while motorists were driving.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Computer Monitoring Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration has proposed a plan  
in which the FBI would oversee a computer monitoring system 
intended to protect the nation's data networks from intruders, The 
New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or Fidnet, would alert  
authorities to computer attacks that could cripple government 
operations or the nation's economy, the newspaper said, citing a 
draft of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The system, to be implemented by 2003, also calls for monitoring  
activities on non-military government networks and those in key 
industries such as banking, telecommunications and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern about an organized cyberattack has escalated  
dramatically,'' said Jeffrey Hunker, the National Security 
Council's director of information protection who is overseeing the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the concern centers on foreign governments and  
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the system are still being debated, the Times said.  
But Hunker said data from non-government computer networks would be 
collected separately from data collected by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the system would be used to look for patterns  
suggesting illegal activity, not for eavesdropping. But monitoring 
the data flowing over networks could potentially open access to 
computer-to-computer communications like e-mail, documents and 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups said they feared the system could be used  
to snoop into private files and computer documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidnet ``is an ill-defined monitoring system of potentially  
broad sweep,'' said James Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for 
Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Earnings Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings from continuing  
operations at DuPont Co. rose 6 percent, exceeding analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont announced earnings of $886 million or 78 cents per  
diluted share from continuing operations, excluding non-recurring 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
73 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including discontinued operations and charges, DuPont had net  
income of $917 million, or 80 cents per share, in the three months 
ended June 30. That was down from $959 million, or 83 cents share 
in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter rose 9 percent over last year because of  
growth from the company's acquisitions rising to $7 billion from 
$6.4 billion. Excluding acquisitions, sales declined 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings from DuPont's pharmaceuticals segment posted the  
sharpest gains, with a 96 percent jump, helped by earnings from 
anti-HIV drug Sustiva and hypertension drug Cozaar. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's polyester segment posted a loss of $13 million,  
compared with earnings of $1 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although overall sales in Europe and Asia rose, DuPont said,  
U.S. sales were down 3 percent compared with the second quarter 
last year. It cited weakness in the Crop Protection Products 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont is also restructuring in a number of areas. It is in the  
process of spinning off Conoco, its oil and gas subsidiary, into a 
separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, DuPont announced that it would cut 800 jobs  
as it restructures its crop products division to deal with 
struggling farm markets worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials also said the restructuring would streamline  
DuPont's agricultural business as it acquires Pioneer Hi-Bred 
International Inc., the world's largest seed corn company based in 
Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of DuPont rose 81 1/4 cents to $72.81 1/4 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Cut Up to 8,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp.'s new leader already is  
moving on a blueprint for the future, but the pain of the present 
is just taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest personal computer maker plans to close some  
as-yet undisclosed facilities this year and slash up to 8,000 jobs, 
or 12 percent of its work force, amid a $184 million second-quarter 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The realignment of the company is fully under way (and) our  
management team is basically in place,'' said Michael D. Capellas, 
who was promoted to president and chief executive last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The work force reduction, which will be a minimum of 6,000 jobs,  
comes on top of 17,000 positions that Compaq already is axing after 
acquiring Digital Equipment last year. More than 1,000 jobs from 
that effort remain to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions unveiled Wednesday mark the first major  
announcement by chief executive and president Capellas, who already 
had been making many day-to-day decisions as chief operating 
officer before his promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said its loss for the April-June quarter came to 10 cents  
a share, slightly less than the 11 cents-a-share forecast by 
analysts polled by First Call. Compaq had warned last month it 
would lose up to 15 cents a share, compared to initial predictions 
of a 20-cents-per-share profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss compared to a profit of $32 million, or 2 cents a  
share, in the year-ago quarter, not counting a $3.63 billion charge 
related to Compaq's acquisition of Digital Equipment and other 
one-time costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly sales rose 17 percent to $9.42 billion from $8.02  
billion of a year ago. The year-ago figure was recalculated as if 
Compaq had already bought Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq expects its restructuring plan, including the job cuts  
and related facility closings, to cost $700 million to $900 million 
over the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an aggressive schedule for meeting our realignment  
goals and reducing our cost structure,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Acree, an analyst with Southwest Securities in Dallas, said  
he's optimistic about Compaq's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now just getting some real answers about where the  
restructuring is going,'' Acree said. ``Preliminarily, everything 
looks very positive and should put Compaq back on a path to gain a 
competitive cost structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company tied its quarterly loss to intense price competition  
with rival sellers of desktop computers to businesses, eroding 
profit margins. At the same time, Compaq's operating expenses rose 
16 percent to $2.2 billion from $1.9 billion in the first quarter, 
which Compaq blamed on increased advertising, costs associated with 
its AltaVista Web site and discontinued business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq hopes the savings from the work force reductions and the  
sale of the AltaVista search portal will quell operating costs by 
the fourth quarter, Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer was ousted last April  
after Compaq posted a first-quarter profit that came in at less 
than half of expectations. The departure of several other top 
managers quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man interim management team led by chairman Ben Rosen  
assumed control until Capellas rose up from the chief operating 
officer's post he'd held for less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Rosen said that Compaq will shave $2 billion in  
annual costs and reorganize its business groups to improve 
financial accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas said the company also intends to strengthen its direct  
sales, hoping to increase from 15 percent to 25 percent of total 
sales by the end of 1999. Dell and Gateway have captured large 
segments of the market by marketing directly to end customers, 
while Compaq traditionally has relied on resellers.

<HEADLINE> Campers Wary After Yosemite Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESTES PARK, Colo. (AP) -- Hundreds of miles and a time zone away  
from the four brutal slayings near Yosemite National Park, campers 
Jerry and Lorie Heidemann weren't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple stayed close to their pickup truck in Rocky Mountain  
National Park, one of the crown jewels of the nation's park system. 
The truck would be their bed for the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel safe in a tent,'' said Heidemann, a tractor  
salesman from Tripoli, Iowa. ``I don't know much about the murders 
in California as to why. I don't think they know why. If it's money 
they wanted, they should rob a convenience store. Why pick on 
campers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the West's national parks, the slayings of three Yosemite  
sightseers and a naturalist have focused attention on the 
vulnerability of outdoor visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Evans, Rocky Mountain's chief ranger, said Tuesday that the  
parks are generally safe, but visitors shouldn't be lulled into 
feeling secure just because of the idyllic setting. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a false sense of security when they're in parks,''  
he said. ``Their experiences in national parks in the past have 
generally been positive, camping with their parents and families. 
For decades, that was true. It's only been the past 20 or 30 years 
that we've seen more violent crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National parks are similar to cities, he said, noting that as  
many as 20,000 visitors a week pass through the 415-square-mile 
Rocky Mountain National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans warns his 15 full-time rangers and 25 seasonal enforcers  
that those visitors represent a microcosm of society, including 
criminals. ``We get 3 million people here a year,'' he said. ``You 
just don't know who you're going to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the number of visitors to national parks has steadily  
increased while the number of crimes has declined. The U.S. Park 
Service rangers reported 448 assaults, 184 robberies, 92 rapes and 
24 murders among its 242 million visitors in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, those crime numbers were down across the board: Of  
286 million visitors, there were 159 assaults, 25 robberies, 29 
rapes and 10 murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the lurid and sensational reports of the Yosemite  
slayings have left many visitors bewildered that such brutal acts 
could take place amid the ethereal beauty of the pine-studded 
Sierra. A motel handyman has been linked to all four killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People go to national parks and national forests to get away  
from a lot of the problems we have in urban areas, and for 
something like this to happen is just horrible,'' Yosemite 
spokesman Scott Gediman told CNN on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosemite is one of the premier vacation destinations in the  
West, drawing about 4 million visitors a year, and like other 
national parks, it has long had a reputation for being safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 15 violent crimes were reported in 1998 in Yosemite, a 35  
percent drop since 1992. The park has had only one other murder in 
the past 12 years, a park spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said the drop in violent crimes at national parks just  
follows the national trend. He said a robust economy has helped 
keep property and related crimes down. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans has worked at Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite and  
has investigated murders, armed robberies and assaults. He said the 
larger parks have more serious crimes because they have large 
overnight facilities for guests, including bars. They also take in 
large amounts of cash from concessions, making them bigger targets. 
</P>
<P>
	As the sun beat down on the Colorado wilderness Tuesday, John  
Jennings relaxed in a lounge chair outside his blue-and-white 1997 
camping trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amarillo, Texas, resident said he feels safe in Rocky  
Mountain National Park and has never witnessed a crime while 
camping across the West in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just something about campers in general,'' he said.  
``You trust people when you're visiting the parks.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Death Toll Climbs to 54 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The body of 83-year-old Russell E. Dowley was  
found in his brick bungalow. Despite a scorching heat wave, the 
windows were closed and a fan and two air conditioners were turned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Air conditioning wasn't a part of their lives while they were  
growing up, and a lot of them feel they don't need it now,'' 
Jacqualine Hutchinson, spokeswoman for Operation Weather Survival, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat wave that has hit the Midwest and the East has led to  
the deaths of at least 54 people since July 19. There have been 18 
deaths in Missouri, 18 in Illinois, 10 in Ohio, two in North 
Carolina, Georgia and Maryland and one each in Pennsylvania and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, temperatures were in the 90s from the Plains to  
the East Coast. The heat index made it feel like triple digits in 
some areas, and forecasters say there's no relief in sight at least 
through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of showers Wednesday helped cool some parts of Missouri  
but much of the state topped 90 degrees for the 14th straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bismarck, N.D., temperatures reached 100 degrees for the  
first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's monumental,'' said meteorologist John Paul Martin.  
``Typically we get 100 degrees maybe one or two days during the 
summer at sites in North Dakota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman said she planned to issue a  
drought warning so that water can be transferred from wetter areas 
to drier ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, utility companies braced for continued heavy demand  
for electricity to keep air conditioners running. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, warned  
industrial customers their power could be turned off. These 
customers receive discounted rates with the understanding their 
service could be interrupted on days of high demand. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, Millicent Merritt, 43, sat in the shade of trees  
near a downtown fountain, looking for a way to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like I'm sitting in one of the hot seats in Hades,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Top American Art Going on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen lots of the greatest American art are  
hitting the road for three years of crisscrossing the nation while 
two of the capital's major museums shut down for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Museum of American Art and the National Portrait  
Gallery share the old Patent Office, which dates back to 1836. Walt 
Whitman once called it ``the noblest of Washington buildings,'' but 
even the noble can get run down over time. 
</P>
<P>
	So the museums will close in January to finish putting on a new  
two-acre, $5 million copper roof, repair bursting pipes, open 
skylights, install better climate control and turn offices into 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery where President Lincoln held his second inaugural  
ball, a few weeks before he was shot, has already been closed to 
reinstall skylights covered for more than 30 years. Once finished, 
it will continue to house 20th century American art. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials estimated the three-year renovation would cost $60  
million. When the building reopens, it will have about 60,000 more 
square feet, not only to show pictures but also for lobbies and 
restaurants. Offices, a library and a new Center for American Art 
will relocate to a separate building nearby, recently bought for 
$86 million by the Smithsonian Institution, to which both museums 
belong. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the traveling shows will come from the Museum of  
American Art. They cover a variety of work -- pictures of the 
earliest America, the West, the Gilded Age of the late 1900s, 
modern and abstract art, the work of folk painters like Grandma 
Moses. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum is billing the eight traveling exhibits as  
``Treasures to Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One exhibit will show that the French weren't the only  
impressionists, there were American impressionists too. Both Mary 
Cassatt and James McNeill Whistler will be represented in that one. 
Another show illustrates the Roaring Twenties, including New York's 
``Ashcan school'' and the work of Edward Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
	The modern and abstract show will be the first to go out. It's  
due to open Jan. 7, four days after the Washington galleries close, 
in the Art Museum at Florida International University in Miami. It 
will stay there until March 5, 2000 before going on to at least 
eight other cities from Maine to California, through September 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The American impressionists can be seen outside Washington  
through January 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``Storing treasures that attract half a million visitors each  
year was not an option the staff wanted to consider,'' said 
Elizabeth Broun, director of the Museum of American Art. 
</P>
<P>
	So more than 500 pictures from its 38,000 paintings, drawings  
and craft objects will go to more than 70 museums. 
</P>
<P>
	The four traveling exhibits from the Portrait Gallery will  
include portraits of all the presidents, masterworks of painting, 
photos of notable 20th century women and a selection of modern 
American portrait drawings. Ellen Miles, curator of a show of 
Washington portraits at the gallery, noted that Gilbert Stuart's 
depiction of Washington looks to the viewer's left, and on the 
dollar bill he looks to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	``An engraving made from an original often gets flipped over,''  
Miles said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these 12, four shows from the portrait gallery  
are already traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	The old Patent Office was last renovated in 1968. Soon after the  
museums moved in, the area was devastated by riots following the 
murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It has been revived in 
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Miller Brewing Switches Ad Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. has hired new advertising  
agencies for its Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft beer as sales 
of its two biggest brands continue to slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-biggest brewer said Wednesday it has  
dismissed Fallon McElligott of Minneapolis from its flagship Miller 
Lite account and hired New York-based Ogilvy Mather Worldwide for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Miller said it had reassigned the Miller  
Genuine Draft account to J. Walter Thompson, Chicago. That account 
had been handled by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., which will 
continue on Miller's roster as the agency for Miller High Life. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and the agencies declined to comment on the value of the  
accounts, but the research firm Competitive Media Reporting said 
Miller spent $95.2 million last year to advertise Miller Lite and 
$47 million on Miller Genuine Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Lite is the nation's No. 3 beer brand behind Budweiser  
and Bud Light from Anheuser-Busch Inc. Miller Genuine Draft ranked 
seventh, according to the publication Beer Marketers Insights. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales of both brands have been in decline. Miller parent  
Philip Morris Cos. reported recently that shipments of Miller Lite 
were off 1.5 percent in the April-June quarter from a year ago and 
said Miller Genuine Draft was down by an unspecified amount. 
</P>
<P>
	In hiring Ogilvy &AMP; Mather and J. Walter Thompson, Miller is  
adding two agencies long associated with sister company Kraft 
Foods. Ogilvy creates ads for Kraft brands like Post cereals, 
Maxwell House coffee and Kool-Aid while Thompson makes advertising 
for Kraft cheese, Miracle Whip dressing and Oscar Mayer. Thompson 
also worked on the Miller High Life brand in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted to bring on board to Miller these two truly  
world-class advertising agencies to help us create world-class, 
integrated marketing campaigns,'' said Bob Mikulay, Miller's top 
marketing executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal of Fallon McElligott did not come as a complete  
surprise even though the agency saved its job on the Miller Lite 
account earlier this year by creating a new campaign that echoed 
the popular ``Great Taste/Less Filling'' ads from the brand's 
heyday in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign features celebrities and retired sports figures  
like baseball Robin Yount and George Brett in barroom debates over 
whether Lite's smoothness or hops accounted for the beer's taste. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics have said the new ads were a lame imitation.  
Possibly more importantly, the three top Miller executives who 
approved the new approach were dismissed by parent Philip Morris in 
April and replaced with a new team that includes Mikulay. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller spokeswoman Susan Henderson said the company plans to run  
new ads from Fallon in the Miller Lite series starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she ``can't speculate on what will happen'' beyond  
that and notes the new agencies can ``explore any and all 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fallon's nearly three years on the Miller Lite account had been  
controversial. Its first ads for the brand featured a fictional ad 
executive named Dick and quirky scenarios like cowboys singing 
``Adios Amigo'' as they shuffled off to a tavern's bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ads were aimed at creating a hipper image for Miller Lite  
among younger drinkers but distributors complained the ads were too 
strange and failed to revive sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, which also works for clients like Nike,  
created ads depicting Miller Genuine Draft as an old-fashioned 
macrobrew favored by approachable people in contrast to the 
microbrews guzzled by yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
	Its work for Miller has also been evolving. Recent ads showed  
Miller Genuine Draft as a cooling drink in a party scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Fallon, chairman and chief executive of Fallon McElligott,  
said the brewer called late Tuesday to say it was changing 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel grateful for the opportunity they gave us but are  
disappointed we can't finish the task,'' he said. He said there 
would be no layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Expectations High As Cards Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- With their first playoff victory in 51 years  
still a fresh memory, the Arizona Cardinals open training camp amid 
high expectations this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipation, however, is tempered by a familiar Cardinal  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three draft picks had not signed contracts as of  
Wednesday and two starters, wide receiver Rob Moore and defensive 
tackle Mark Smith, likely will be no-shows because of contract 
squabbles when the team opens camp with a dinner Thursday night in 
Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice-a-day workouts begin Friday at the team's training  
facility at Northern Arizona University. 
</P>
<P>
	When they do sign, first-round picks David Boston and L.J.  
Shelton and second-round pick Johnny Rutledge all figure to fill 
big roles for the Cardinals, who face a much tougher schedule and 
must cope with the loss of the leadership of Larry Centers, Jamir 
Miller and Lomas Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said the rookies need to be in camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that missing camp sets guys behind, not  
only in their football ability but in learning what it takes to be 
a pro, to practice like a pro, to be a part of a football team,'' 
he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of becomes a boot camp mentality, where they draw  
together as a group, lean on each other in hard times and come out 
of the camp situation as a unit. When you have rookies that aren't 
a part of that, they try to get involved but they're always a 
little bit on the edge that whole year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the rookies could be less of a problem than dealing with  
Moore and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals upset Moore by declaring him their franchise  
player, which limits the amount he can receive in a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking for a signing bonus and a long-term commitment,''  
general manager Bob Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is in an even more difficult position. He is demanding  
three times the $325,000 the Cardinals reportedly are offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how that's going to be resolved,'' Tobin said.  
``He went down a road where there aren't very many options at the 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's shaky status and the uncertainty of Eric Swann's  
condition makes defensive tackle, previously a Cardinals' strength, 
a big question mark going into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann is recovering from an unusual surgical procedure on his  
right knee, which has been plagued by arthritis for years. He will 
continue rehabilitation from surgery in Flagstaff but it isn't 
known when he will be able to work out with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a long talk with Eric yesterday,'' Tobin said. ``We're  
in an area where we've had a surgery that hasn't been performed 
that many times. How quickly he comes back, I think we're going to 
play it by ear. He's working awfully hard on getting his knee ready 
to play, but we have to take it slowly enough that he doesn't have 
any setbacks.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Billick Eager To Hit Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- His brain kept telling him it's OK to be  
moping around the office. The rest of Brian Billick reminded him 
that in the third week of July he should be sweating under the sun, 
surrounded by 100 guys wearing helmets and shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``The season's later this year, so your body clock says you  
should be in camp now,'' Billick said earlier this week. ``So 
there's an anxiety there, beyond the fact that this is my first 
camp as a head coach and with a new organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wait is over. Billick will open his first training camp with  
the Baltimore Ravens at Western Maryland College on Thursday, and 
he's already mapped out every practice right up to the regular 
season opener on Sept. 12 against the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick spent the past seven years as an assistant with the  
Minnesota Vikings, where he helped build a team that last season 
advanced to the NFC Championship game. Now he's back at ground zero 
with Baltimore, where he faces the prospect of rebuilding a team 
that in three seasons has yet to reach .500, let alone the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seven years in Minnesota, training camp tended to run on  
its own, so to speak. The players knew what was expected of them 
and we had the roster pretty much set, so that allows you to move 
along at a certain pace,'' Billick said. ``Obviously, we can't do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't even begin to think of ourselves as a team until  
literally late in the preseason because, if for no other reason, 
you have a number of guys who aren't even sure they're going to be 
on this team. A team like Minnesota will have 45 of the 53 roster 
spots already determined. We're probably in the 30 to 35 range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick isn't the only newcomer to the Ravens. Starter Scott  
Mitchell and backup Tony Banks have replaced Jim Harbaugh and Eric 
Zeier, Chuck Evans is the new fullback and three imports at tight 
end will compete for the spot left open by the departure of free 
agent Eric Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent receivers Billy Davis, Webster Slaughter and Qadry  
Ismail will seek to make a good first impression, and there are 
holes to fill in both lines. In addition, Rod Woodson's move to 
safety creates a three-way battle between DeRon Jenkins, Duane 
Starks and top draft pick Chris McAlister for the two starting 
cornerback spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick will direct most of his attention toward an offense that  
last year failed to score more than 14 points in nine of 16 games. 
The rebuilding process began during minicamp and will continue at 
the outset of Thursday's initial training camp session. 
</P>
<P>
	All the work, the sweat and the film sessions are designed to  
get the Ravens off to a good start at the Trans World Dome against 
the Rams. Unfortunately, Billick can't allow himself to look that 
far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would like to start thinking about the season opener on  
the first day, and in future camps we will. We don't have that 
luxury right now,'' he said. ``We're not a veteran team that has 
been together for a long time. We have too many other things we 
have to address for us to be that myopic in what we want to get 
done.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Barry Sanders' Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Barry Sanders' statement on his retirement, as posted on The  
Wichita Eagle's Web site: 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably  
would not return for the 1999-2000 season. I also felt that I 
should take as much time as possible to sort through my feelings 
and make sure that my feelings were backed with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, I officially declare my departure from the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a wonderful experience to play in the NFL, and I have no  
regrets. I truly will miss playing for the Lions. I consider the 
Lions' players, coaches, staff, management and fans my family. I 
leave on good terms with everyone in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	I have enjoyed playing for two great head coaches, Wayne Fontes  
and Bobby Ross, who are good coaches and leaders. I am not involved 
in a salary dispute of any kind. If I had played this season, I 
would have earned a more than satisfactory salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason I am retiring is simple:  
</P>
<P>
	My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to remain  
in it. I have searched my heart through and through and feel 
comfortable with this decision. 
</P>
<P>
	I want to thank all of the fans and media who made playing in  
the NFL such a wonderful experience. I have had the pleasure of 
meeting many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Although I was not able to honor many of your requests for  
autographs and interviews, it was not because I overlooked the 
importance of those who asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, I want to thank my family and friends for their support  
and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	I wish my teammates, coaches and the entire Lions organization  
all the best.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Closes X-Ray Plant in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. has closed a film plant  
employing more than 520 people in eastern China, saying that new 
environmental laws aimed at protecting a nearby lake made the 
factory unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure of the medical X-ray film factory in Wuxi, Jiangsu  
province, was agreed between the U.S. company, its local partner 
and government authorities, said Jessica Chan, a Kodak spokeswoman 
in Hong Kong. China tightened waste water disposal laws to preserve 
Lake Tai nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak bought into the former state-owned plant and formed Kodak  
(Wuxi) Co. Ltd. with a local partner in March 1998 as part of its 
plan to invest $1 billion in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chan declined to provide any financial data on the Wuxi plant,  
which was 70 percent owned by Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak said in a statement that X-ray film production will be  
concentrated at its Shantou plant in the southern province of 
Guangdong. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak employs about 1,900 people in China.

<HEADLINE> ABC's `Brave New World' Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When they plug upcoming stories, TV newscasts  
use a familiar come-on: ``What we found just might surprise you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, in his series of eight ABC News specials, Robert Krulwich  
could say the same thing. Even though he never gets around to 
exposing auto repair rip-offs or a dread new health threat, he's 
never short of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The first big surprise from Krulwich's ``Nightline in Prime  
Time: Brave New World'' is that he doesn't really care about 
surprising you with answers. Instead, his ambitious series, 
premiering Thursday at 10 p.m. EDT, believes provocative questions 
are their own reward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of the un-news news program,'' said Ted Koppel,  
who nominally anchors the series. ``It's unlike any other news 
program you've ever seen, in part because we're taking up issues 
that are so huge and so profound, that most of us are afraid to 
touch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krulwich isn't. The series' constant presence, he is game to ask  
questions, make connections, stir up thought and -- yes -- have fun 
with ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's ``Brave New World'' explores speed. What is it about  
speed that is so irresistible? What is the effect of ever-speedier 
machines continuously revving up the pace of our lives? How would 
we ever slow down? Would we even want to? 
</P>
<P>
	Krulwich clocks the once-acceptable span of time required to  
place a call on a dial telephone. But now that the far speedier 
push-button phone is the norm, he wonders why a dial phone seems 
not just slower, but torturously slo-o-oow. 
</P>
<P>
	He chats with Michael Malone, editor of the magazine ``ASAP''  
(As Soon As Possible), who declares that, in our culture, speed has 
come to imply accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that important people were idle,'' Malone says.  
But somewhere along the line, he says, ``it became a measure of 
success to have no free time whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krulwich observes Mary, a short-order cook, then checks in with  
video artists John and Adam, who portray cells in Mary's brain that 
regulate her nimble multitasking. 
</P>
<P>
	And he hears from his designated ``house band,'' They Might Be  
Giants, which performs ``You're Older Than You Were Before and Now 
You're Even Older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's much more, but the point already should be clear: This  
isn't ``20/20.'' Call it ``Un-20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, viewers already familiar with Krulwich are somewhat  
in on the surprise. As they know, he's a man with a rambunctious 
intellect and whimsy to match; a journalist who seemingly can make 
any concept understandable, and usually amusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Unencumbered by TV good looks or TV bad habits, Krulwich honed  
his special skills as a business correspondent for National Public 
Radio. Then he stepped before the cameras at CBS News, where he 
once used a whale toy to illustrate corporate takeovers of big fish 
by small fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, Krulwich has been at ABC News and regularly reports  
for ``Nightline,'' under whose auspices ``Brave New World'' 
originated. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it was at ``Nightline'' a couple of years ago that a  
discussion arose over how routinized and predictable the network 
news divisions had become. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Nightline'' crowd concluded that ``television news misses  
all kinds of opportunities,'' in the words of executive producer 
Tom Bettag. ``In the same way that we are underrating the viewers, 
we are underrating the potential of the medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettag and his associates noted how stories that break on the  
evening news will, like clockwork, re-emerge on the prime-time 
magazines a couple of weeks hence. But the more thoughtful 
examination might come a few weeks after that, and outside of 
journalism's realm, when a dramatic series like ``The Practice'' or 
``Law &AMP; Order'' confronts the issue in a fictional setting. 
</P>
<P>
	How, they wondered, could they reclaim for news these complex  
and compelling inquiries? 
</P>
<P>
	``How,'' mused Krulwich, ``do you make a show that sneaks up on  
people, that takes them right to where you want to go without them 
realizing what happened?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Brave New World'' is the bracing result.  
</P>
<P>
	Future programs explore such broad and oddball subjects as man  
vs. machine, human cloning, the family, hope and particle physics. 
Assisting Krulwich in his inquiries are varied personalities 
including dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones, Harvard University 
professor Stephen Jay Gould, and actors Jane Curtin and Buck Henry. 
</P>
<P>
	True, this series won't save you money or keep your kids out of  
trouble, nor does it guarantee you any other answers. The people 
who made it freely admit it may not serve as an answer for what 
ails TV news. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Brave New World'' is a brave new try, a refreshing  
alternative to TV's dog days grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This,'' said Bettag, ``is what summer replacement programming  
should be -- not just filling a slot, but trying something off the 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	`DARNDEST THINGS': Youngsters come out with the darndest  
descriptions of host Bill Cosby on ``Kids Say the Darndest 
Things,'' airing on CBS Friday at 8 p.m. EDT. One little girl says 
Cosby is ``really skinny and I don't like his face.'' And a young 
boy says, ``Bill Cosby is old. Really old.'' Then Cosby holds 
tryouts for youngsters who hope to be on television, watching and 
encouraging them as they sing, tap dance and attempt magic tricks. 
Art Linkletter introduces clips from his ``House Party'' show, 
asking children what their parents told them not to do and say

zipper doesn't go down.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Begins Debate on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began debate today on a  
Republican-backed bill offering the biggest tax cut in nearly two 
decades. ``It will benefit nearly every working American,'' said 
the author, Sen. William Roth. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the 10-year, $792 billion tax cut were immediately  
confronted by a rival plan put forth by a bipartisan group of 
senators that would lower the size of the reduction to $500 
billion. Both bills are too large for President Clinton's liking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., a strong proponent of the bill. ``We are going to be 
talking about allowing the people to keep just a little bit more of 
their own hard-earned money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before the  
Senate Banking Committee, repeated a caution: ``We probably would 
be better off holding off on a tax cut'' because of the uncertainty 
of budget surplus projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he hopes to bring the bill to a vote Friday, setting  
the stage for House-Senate negotiations to work out differences in 
their companion bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, on a largely party-line vote, last week passed a bill  
that also would provide $792 billion in tax relief over the next 
decade but through different means. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders are likely to wait until after the August  
recess to send a bill to Clinton, giving them more than a month to 
take the issue to their constituents and try to drum up support for 
their larger tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Vice President Gore and White House officials have  
stated repeatedly that the president would veto the GOP bills 
because they are too large, would threaten future efforts to save 
Social Security and Medicare, and leave no money for needed 
improvements in defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The option that is being offered by the Republican leadership,  
disguised by phony bookkeeping, is to take virtually all of the 
surplus and just blow it on a risky tax scheme that would not save 
one penny for Medicare or Social Security, and toward what end?'' 
Gore said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist that, with the budget surplus projected at  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, they can set aside money 
for Social Security, Medicare and federal debt reduction and still 
have $792 billion to return to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	But a group of six Democratic and five Republican senators, all  
moderates, gathered today to say that the GOP plan was too big, and 
a $500 billion cut would be both politically and fiscally more 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are headed for a financial train wreck that can and must be  
avoided,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said the House-passed bill ``fails the  
basic test of fairness'' because much of its benefits go to the 
well-off, and the Senate bill crafted by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
who chairs the Finance Committee, is ``just too big for my comfort 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The moderates' bill would expand the lowest, 15-percent tax  
bracket so that $2,500 would be taxed at the lowest rate for single 
filers and $5,000 for joint filers. It would increase standard 
deductions, increase IRA contribution limits, eliminate the 
marriage tax penalty and eliminate capital-gains taxes for most 
middle-class taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that was too much for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who  
said he would offer an amendment to put off any tax cut this year 
to ensure that the surplus estimates are accurate. ``Before the ink 
is barely dry on the projections we're going to jeopardize it 
all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal would reduce the 15 percent income tax rate to  
14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 2005, the new 14 
percent tax rate would apply to some income that is currently taxed 
at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the measure provides relief from the marriage  
penalty and contains tax breaks for education, IRAs, long-term care 
insurance, small businesses and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept a tax cut of around $250  
billion and White House officials have made clear that even a 
compromise bill of $500 billion would be subject to a veto.

<HEADLINE> EDS Offers Workers Early Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Electronic Data Systems Corp. has offered early  
retirement to about 8,000 employees, or 11 percent of its 
workforce, and said it expects to lay off an unspecified number of 
staffers by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of layoffs depends in part upon how many people  
accept the early-retirement offer, said Reed Byrum, a company 
spokesman in Plano. 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of reductions is on top of 5,200 positions that  
the Plano-based information services company eliminated beginning 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS chairman and CEO Richard H. ``Dick'' Brown pledged last  
month at an investor conference to slash an additional $1 billion 
from the company's $17 billion overall cost structure. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown joined EDS in January, he announced a mandate to make  
the company more competitive against rivals in the rapidly growing 
computer services business. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS employs 74,000 people in the United States and 126,000  
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The early-retirement offer is available to U.S. employees over  
50 who are vested in the company's retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS said it expects about half of those offered early retirement  
will at least give serious consideration to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS continues to add some jobs even as it eliminates positions,  
Byrum said. 
</P>
<P>
	EDS typically hires the technical staff of organizations that  
contract with the company for computer services. EDS also is 
continuing to hire people with special skills that the company 
needs.

<HEADLINE> Surveys Show Frustration With HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers and doctors report widespread  
trouble getting needed care from HMOs, according to two surveys 
today that give a fresh view of the frustration behind efforts to 
impose new rules on managed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly nine in 10 doctors and one in four consumers complained  
they had trouble getting needed services. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House leaders were maneuvering to bring an HMO  
``patients' bill of rights'' directly to the House floor, bypassing 
committees that have failed to produce legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, despite the interest in regulating HMOs, there's been  
steady improvement in clinical care and more managed care plans are 
willing to report the results of evaluations, according to the 
annual report on the quality of HMOs that includes customer 
satisfaction data. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a survey of  
doctors and nurses. It documented frustration, but also found 
doctors regularly intervening to fight for care they believed to be 
necessary and usually succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a survey that goes beyond anecdote and opinion by  
providing detailed information about what's actually going on,'' 
said Drew Altman, president of the foundation, which conducted the 
poll with the Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``This level of conflict and administrative haggling between  
doctors and plans can't be good for our health care system or for 
patients who are often caught in the middle,'' Altman added. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, frustrated by a new system that questions their  
judgments and reduces payments to control costs, have rallied 
around congressional efforts to impose new regulations on health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser survey provides the most extensive documentation of  
their experience with managed care and reactions to it. 
</P>
<P>
	It found 87 percent of doctors said their patients had  
experienced some type of denial of coverage over the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Most common -- 79 percent -- was trouble getting approval for a  
drug they wanted to prescribe. Sixty-nine percent said they had 
trouble getting a diagnostic test approved; 60 percent, a hospital 
stay; 52 percent, referral to a specialist, and 38 percent for 
mental health or substance abuse referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on the type of care denied, one-third to two-thirds of  
doctors believed it resulted in a serious decline in health. 
Denials of mental health were most likely to be serious, followed 
by referrals to specialists; denials of drugs and hospital stays 
were least likely to be seen as serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, about half of nurses said they had seen a decision by  
a health plan that resulted in a decline in a patient's health in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors and nurses say they fight for the treatments they  
think are necessary. Two in three doctors said they sometimes or 
often make contact with a health plan on behalf of patients. Of 
them, 42 percent said the issue was resolved in favor of the 
patient and 22 percent said there was a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, about three in 10 doctors and nurses say they  
sometimes or often exaggerate the severity of a patient's condition 
to get them needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual survey by the National Committee on Quality  
Assurance, meanwhile, evaluated 523 health plans offered by 247 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, 410 plans serving nearly 70 million Americans allowed  
their data to be publicly released -- a big jump from last year, 
when many companies feared negative publicity and insisted on 
secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, there was little change on measurements such as  
immunizations, advising smokers to quit, screening for breast and 
cervical cancer and giving early prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also looked at consumer satisfaction and found 26.5  
percent had trouble getting needed care, including difficulty 
seeing a doctor they liked and getting referrals to specialists. 
Patients gave higher overall marks to the office staff and doctors 
and nurses than to the health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the people said they had a problem with paperwork,  
understanding written materials or getting help from a customer 
service line. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found continued enormous disparities among  
health plans across the country. In the best plans, more than 80 
percent of diabetics -- at risk for blindness -- got eye exams; in 
the worst, it was below 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Health plans in New England were again the top performers and  
those in the South Central region did the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser surveyed 1,053 doctors and 768 nurses by mail between  
February and June. Both groups were randomly chosen. The margin of 
error for doctors' responses was plus or minus three percentage 
points; for nurses, it was plus or minus four percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Gardeners Still Like Old Tomatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Tomatoes have made great advances in  
100 years except in the aspect that matters most -- taste. 
</P>
<P>
	As gardeners harvest their last crop of the century, the  
tastiest, in the opinion of many, still feature oldies like 
Brandywine -- first bred by our 19th-century ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
	Taste, to be sure, is relative, not to say fickle. You drool  
over a flavor one year and wonder why the next. But the devotion of 
gardeners to heirloom varieties appears not only steadfast but on 
the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandywine, an Amish heirloom dating back to 1885, gets its name  
from Brandywine Creek in Chester County, Pa. It comes in red, pink 
and yellow fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	In my garden, where I usually raise six or seven different  
tomatoes, Brandywine stands unsurpassed in flavor. Its production 
of fruits per plant, is meager, however, and if you wants lots of 
Brandywines you should put in lots of plants. Like other heirlooms, 
it is also prone to disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Disease resistance is where hybrid varieties shine. Open a  
catalog and the new tomatoes carry glowing recommendations for 
their ability to beat off wilts. Nothing wrong with that, 
especially if you're a farmer. But the home gardener's prime 
concern is taste; he or she will sacrifice much in its pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone who has gardened awhile has noticed that even a misshapen  
and bespotted tomato with pedigree often tastes better than the 
newer and handsomer fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are gardeners who, like mountain climbers, are always  
looking for a higher peak to conquer. Some experiment with 
literally hundreds of varieties, finding very good ones, but never 
that ultimate tomato taste they are seeking and which may exist 
only in their imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing I've noticed in the last few years (and this may  
strike some home gardeners as heresy) is that store-bought tomatoes 
are tasting better. 
</P>
<P>
	Right in front of me, as I write this, is a cherry-sized tomato  
from Mexico marketed as ``vine-ripened.'' I bite into it and I have 
to say it's very good, not as good, perhaps, as one I'd pick from 
my own vines with the heat of the sun still on it, but still very 
good. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, I cut a slice of a medium-sized tomato also bought at the  
supermarket and labeled as ``vine-ripened.'' The variety is not 
mentioned. I bite into it and find it much blander than the cherry, 
but still packing definite tomato taste. The techniques of getting 
better-tasting tomatoes to market have obviously improved, so I'm 
ditching the cliche that produce-shelf tomatoes are tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
	Some gardeners stick to just one tomato variety year after year.  
A friend of mine who gardens so well that people buy his produce 
grows only Rutgers tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a good-sized, blood-red tomato, also known as Jersey,  
whose origins date back to 1928 and which is not found today in 
many catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
	But my friend says the sign in front of his driveway saying  
``Rutgers Tomatoes'' draws a steady flow of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In my garden, the last-of- the-century tomato crop features a  
mix of oldies and more recent arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
	For earliness, I grew a Burpee tomato introduced recently under  
the name of Fourth of July. While they matured a little later than 
the Fourth, they were still the earliest in the garden by weeks and 
had good taste and abundance. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were two of French origin named Dona and Carmello,  
both fine-tasting red tomatoes that have been offered for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	I grew Costaluto Genevose, an Italian heirloom, for its  
interesting convoluted shape as well as good flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellow Pear, one of my favorites for decades, was already  
mentioned early in the 19th century long before most people had 
overcome their belief that tomatoes were poisonous. It bears 
clusters of small pear-shaped fruits with mild flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, I grew Red Currant tomatoes which are even smaller  
than Yellow Pear and, in fact, are the smallest tomatoes of all, 
about the size of marbles. Very tart, the taste of these heirlooms 
can be thought of as the essence of tomato. 
</P>
<P>
	Persimmon, another heirloom, gives me beefsteak-size fruit of  
persimmon color, highly flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, as I've said, there is Brandywine.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tax-Managed Funds for Old Investors? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- If you are like many fortunate investors over the  
past decade, you've watched your mutual fund investments post 
strong returns. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you are like many investors, you probably haven't given  
much thought to the taxes on those returns. Perhaps it's time you 
did, says an investment expert at the College for Financial 
Planning, especially if you are nearing retirement or are retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is important is what you keep, not what you make,'' says  
Donald Johnson, a senior academic associate at the College. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson emphasizes that mutual funds whose investment policies  
pay no attention to the taxes their portfolios generate can have a 
negative impact on total return for shareholders -- much like mutual 
fund expenses, which shareholders seem far more sensitive to. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 study by Morningstar, which tracks and rates mutual  
funds, noted that one particularly successful mutual fund that had 
returned 23.4 percent annually for five years would have returned 
only 15.4 percent after taxes for shareholders in the highest tax 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Because returns are reported on a pre-tax basis, few investors  
are aware of the effect taxes have on their returns. Johnson 
believes that the growing number of tax-managed mutual funds -- 
funds that do their best to minimize taxes for their shareholders -- 
may be just the answer for mutual fund investors for whom taxes are 
a significant issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax management of investments isn't a problem for money you have  
in tax-advantaged accounts, such as company retirement plans or 
individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investment money held in taxable accounts can face a  
significant tax bite. Johnson notes that investors approaching 
retirement typically are in their peak earning years -- and in their 
peak tax brackets. Retirees also may worry about investment taxes 
further reducing their limited incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	One way around the problem, of course, is to invest in  
individual securities. That way, you can control when you buy and 
sell the securities not only from an investment standpoint, but a 
tax standpoint as well. 
</P>
<P>
	As a mutual fund investor, you only can control when you buy and  
sell your fund shares; you can't control the fund's actual trading 
of securities. But many investors don't have the time, knowledge or 
money to buy a well-diversified collection of individual securities 
on their own. They rely instead on the expertise of professional 
fund managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, mutual fund managers have not attempted to manage  
the tax ramifications of their trading. Instead, they have focused 
on pre-tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some funds, for example, buy and sell securities more frequently  
than other funds. This higher turnover can generate high capital 
gains distributions for shareholders if the fund is doing well 
because there are fewer losses to offset the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	If the fund holds onto the securities for less than 12 months,  
which is common with high-turnover funds, shareholders will pay 
taxes on those gains at their highest personal income tax rate -- as 
much as 39.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where tax-managed mutual funds come in,'' Johnson  
says. ``They invest to meet the fund's investment objectives, such 
as growth, but with an eye on the tax ramifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a tax-efficient mutual fund might focus on  
non-dividend or low-dividend paying stocks, or buy municipal bonds. 
They also may minimize taxable gains by turning over their 
portfolio less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities a fund holds for 12 months or longer before selling  
are taxed at each shareholder's highest capital gains rate -- a 
maximum of only 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Index funds, for example, have relatively low turnovers because  
they passively follow a particular index without attempting to 
outperform it through trades. Other ways to minimize gains are to 
offset them with carefully chosen capital losses, or sell 
highest-cost shares first. 
</P>
<P>
	The number and types of tax-managed mutual funds have grown  
significantly the last few years, according to Johnson, so 
investors have a wider choice of funds. However, track records are 
fairly short for most of the funds. Where tax-managed offerings are 
few, such as in international funds, an index fund can often serve 
as a tax-managed fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson cautions that mutual fund investors should never pick a  
particular fund just because it's a tax-managed fund. ``It's only 
one consideration when you're picking a fund,'' Johnson says. ``A 
fund that doesn't pay attention to tax consequences may still 
return better on an after-tax basis for shareholders than a 
poorly-performing tax-managed fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, if two funds are performing similarly, the  
tax-managed fund is often the better choice for you and even more 
so if you are in one of the higher tax brackets.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft VP Paul Maritz May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Paul Maritz, among the most powerful executives  
at Microsoft Corp., is stepping off the fast track and even 
considering retiring, possibly as soon as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 44-year-old vice president of Microsoft's developer group  
leaves, he will be following a longstanding tradition of Microsoft 
millionaires who take their money and follow their dreams: starting 
new companies, creating charitable foundations, or simply enjoying 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul has not made any decision to leave the company,''  
Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw repeated several times during a 
telephone interview Wednesday.

<P>
	But Shaw acknowledged retirement was a possibility for Maritz,  
who has committed to staying at Microsoft only through the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw dismissed notion of a brain-drain at Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft has a retention rate that is better than the  
industry at large and they're very happy about their ability to 
attract and retain qualified individuals,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that's always good is that there's a very  
deep bench at the company. In this case, as Paul steps back from 
some of the day-to-day operations to focus on other things'' there 
are other qualified people to step forward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's success -- it recently became the first corporation  
to pass a half trillion dollars in market capitalization -- has 
produced thousands of multimillionaires among employees with stock 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who have stepped back recently from their corporate  
duties are Nathan Myhrvold, the company's chief technology officer, 
who is taking a yearlong leave of absence; John Ludwig, vice 
president of the Consumer and Commerce Group, who is taking three 
months off to spend time with his family; and Chris Peters, vice 
president of the Office software division and former lead developer 
of the spreadsheet program Excel, who is on leave to take a stab at 
professional bowling. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a year ago, chairman Bill Gates named Steve Ballmer as  
president and turned over some responsibilities to him. Gates is 
spending more time on philanthropy and with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz joined Microsoft in 1986 and played a major role  
supervising the development of the Windows 95 and Windows NT 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	His role in the developer group -- targeted at the software  
developers -- is pivotal in winning the allegiance of independent 
programmers that has helped Microsoft dominate the personal 
computer software market. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-to-day responsibility for that group will be turned over to  
David Vaskevitch, a vice president who now reports to Maritz. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Maritz) wanted to free up some more of his time to work on  
developer strategy and work on some technical aspects of the job,'' 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last September, Maritz held more than 3.4 million shares  
of Microsoft stock, currently valued at more than $300 million, and 
he holds options on many more.

<HEADLINE> Education Billing Plan Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- A proposal to bill Mexico to recoup  
millions of dollars spent educating illegal immigrants in an Orange 
County school district has touched off a community dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for accusations of hidden agendas and  
discrimination to surface after school board president Harald G. 
Martin came up with the plan for the Anaheim Unified High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the middle are the district's 30,000 students who  
could be the first in the nation to be counted by Immigration and 
Naturalization Service agents looking for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, educators say the proposal could inspire a  
national trend of districts trying to recover the costs of 
educating those students. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS estimates 2 million of the nation's 3.9 million illegal  
immigrants live in California. Although there are no statistics on 
the number of those attending public schools, officials estimate 
that up to one in six are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anaheim debate began after a federal judge ruled that  
Proposition 187, which excluded illegal immigrants from public 
schools and other services, violated the federal government's 
exclusive authority to regulate immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Martin introduced a proposal to bill Mexico $50 million  
in back payments and $10 million every year thereafter, arguing 
that thousands of illegal immigrant children from Mexico were being 
taught in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is purely an economic issue. This is about what it costs  
the American taxpayer to educate illegal aliens,'' Martin 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal drew the immediate ire of the heavily Hispanic  
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this was about money, why not consider a bond issue? That's  
what other school districts do,'' said Amen David of Los Amigos of 
Orange County, which promotes equality for Hispanics. ``What they 
are considering is anti-immigrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you call it when somebody singles out a group of  
people? I call it racist,'' added opponent Josie Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
	A revamped proposal to be released this week seeks to require  
the INS to count the number of illegal students and force the 
federal government to hold other countries responsible for the cost 
of educating certain students. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is a class-action lawsuit by students or  
their parents alleging the government violated students' civil 
rights and misused tax money by forcing taxpayers to pay to educate 
illegal immigrants, said board member Alexandra Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, opponents have filed 34 lawsuits against Martin,  
alleging violations of their civil rights and misuse of tax dollars 
in pursuit of the proposal. They have promised to file another suit 
if the proposal is approved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a hidden agenda -- bringing immigration agents into  
the school. That's harassment of the students and their parents, 
pure and simple,'' Mrs. Montoya said. ``We're going to keep filing 
the lawsuits to make a point: You can't do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials stress the INS count would not single out  
students for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priority is about deterring illegal entrance at the  
border, identifying criminal aliens,'' said Virginia Kice, a 
spokeswoman for the INS Western Regional District. ``It's not about 
pointing the finger at schoolchildren and it won't be.''

<HEADLINE> Fumes Sicken Controllers in Illinois </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A class-action lawsuit was filed Wednesday  
against a company that did sealing work at an air traffic control 
center where controllers complained they were sickened by noxious 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Downen, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers  
Association local, said about 50 employees missed work because of 
illness Wednesday at the control center in Aurora. The Federal 
Aviation Administration put the figure at just over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which handles flights over much of the Midwest, is  
the nation's busiest. The workers who remained Wednesday were able 
to handle air traffic because bad weather in the East Coast and the 
Southwest reduced the number of incoming flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers at the center, 36 miles west of Chicago, began  
experiencing nausea, headaches and blurred vision Monday night 
after inhaling fumes from maintenance work above the control room. 
The problem slowed air traffic Tuesday and caused delays of up to 
two hours for flights into O'Hare and Midway airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The fumes came from a sealant that included chloroprene, a  
nontoxic chemical that can cause damage to the liver, kidneys and 
lungs in high concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing supervisor at an Aurora hospital said nine controllers  
had been treated and released since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Hartman, one of the controllers sickened by the fumes,  
filed the lawsuit, alleging negligence by the company hired to do 
the sealing work. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the company, Spectrum Contracting Corp., were not  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspectors  
were at the control center to examine whether safety regulations 
had been violated.

<HEADLINE>  A's Jaha Is Baseball's Best Bargain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- At spring training, John Jaha was  
contemplating retirement. Now, the Oakland slugger just might be 
the biggest bargain in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I round the bases I definitely appreciate things a  
little more,'' said Jaha, who's rounded them 25 times this season. 
``After the years I had in '95 and '96, I thought I was on the 
verge of taking off and having a good career. Things just didn't 
work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then, almost being done with baseball? Almost not having a  
job? I definitely appreciate the game more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha hit 20 home runs in 88 games for Milwaukee in 1995 then had  
career highs in '96 when he hit .300 with 34 homers and 118 RBIs 
for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he slumped to 11 homers in '97, when his season was cut  
short by shoulder surgery and just seven homers last year because 
of leg injuries much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed an operation in September to repair a fracture and  
torn ligaments in his left foot. That resulted from a misstep 
rounding second base in a game in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He was slow to heal and Oakland was the only team to take a  
chance on him after the Boston Red Sox team physician gave him a 
thumbs-down medical report over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha, who has earned nearly $4 million with the Brewers in '98,  
signed with Oakland for just $400,000 with no incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Still healing, he had a shaky spring and was on the verge of  
getting cut. He spoke then about retiring rather than trying to 
hook on elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``He barely made the club,'' said Athletics manager Art Howe,  
who's decision to keep Jaha has turned into a brilliant move. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not even completely healthy now, but he can DH,'' Howe  
said. ``He's in some pain. But he's getting better. He's a class 
guy. He's our leader. He brings us power and professionalism. I'd 
like to have him back for quite a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha hasn't discussed a contract extension but he wants to  
return to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the chance,'' he said during batting practice at  
the Metrodome this week. 
</P>
<P>
	And Howe shouldn't be too worried about affording his slugger,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interested in money -- my agent will probably kill  
me,'' Jaha said with a laugh. ``But I've been fortunate enough to 
make a lot of money and I'm not a big spender. I got my house and 
take care of my family and that's really it. I don't know how much 
money people need ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha's history of leg injuries relegated him to the AL, where he  
doesn't have to worry about playing the field anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely helped,'' Jaha said. ``Early in my career I  
thought I was a real good first baseman. I never wanted to DH. But 
there have been some days where if this were the National League, I 
would have had a tough time being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha, 33, is accustomed to playing in pain. He's battled  
injuries since 1990, when he tore up his right knee running stairs 
at his Portland home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to have to battle to be on the field every  
day,'' he said. ``I've gotten used to it. I just love baseball, the 
competition. I don't care. If I had a broken leg I think I'd still 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha isn't one to dwell on the games he's missed, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``When it's all said and done and I'm 40-something and I'm  
looking back, I probably will think once or twice about what it 
would have been like to be healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha hasn't even taken much time to contemplate his first trip  
to the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because baseball's such a mentally tough game, my mind is on  
baseball 24 hours a day,'' he said. ``I think when the year is over 
and I'm able to sit down for a week, go fishing and be out with my 
family, I'll sit back and say, `Hey that was a pretty incredible 
All-Star game.'''

<HEADLINE> McCain Wants To End Ethanol Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain proposed  
eliminating the federal ethanol subsidy on Wednesday, putting 
himself at odds with many voters in Iowa, where he faces the first 
test of his hopes for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Iowa voters were in your mind, that wouldn't seem to be the  
place to be,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa 
Republican Party. ``You wouldn't go to California and tell people 
to stay away from the beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, McCain proposed a school voucher program to offer  
education opportunities for disadvantaged children. He suggested 
paying for it by eliminating $5.4 billion worth of subsidies for 
ethanol, sugar, gas and oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Under McCain's three-year test program, disadvantaged children  
would receive vouchers worth $2,000 a year. The money would be used 
to offset the costs of attending any school chosen by the student 
or parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't have special interest giveaways at the expense of  
our neediest children,'' McCain said, adding that the ethanol 
program was ``simply an outdated subsidy for corn producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls regularly show that education is a top issue with voters  
across the country, but the stand is likely to cause McCain 
headaches in politically sensitive Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol is alcohol distilled from corn and blended with  
gasoline. Its backers argue that it burns cleaner than traditional 
gasoline, a point disputed by critics. There is disagreement over 
whether ethanol is good for the environment, but there is no doubt 
it provides an economic boost for farmers. Ethanol production 
facilities provide a big new market for corn at a time when prices 
are depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it's very popular with farmers and Iowa is a farm state,  
ethanol is a bipartisan crusade for most politicians. Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, once went so far as to drink some during a 
congressional hearing to demonstrate its safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Gov. George W. Bush, from oil-rich Texas, used his initial  
Iowa swing to pledge allegiance to ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ethanol critics argue that the overwhelming bulk of  
government subsidies goes to a few giant producers like 
Illinois-based Archer Daniels Midland Co. Backers insist there's a 
growing legion of smaller producers. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's proposal couldn't come at a worse time for farmers.  
Commodity prices are at historic lows, and there are fears of a new 
wave of farm foreclosures. Congressional Democrats have proposed a 
$10 billion emergency farm bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, sure, at a time of crisis in farming, take away the one  
thing that offers a possible solution, and that's ethanol,'' said 
Paula Chizek, of the Iowa Corn Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support education, but not at the expense of ethanol,'' she  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol producers get tax breaks of $1.5 billion a year for  
producing the fuel.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Up 16.78; Nasdaq Up 19.53 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan provided no new shocks to markets 
in testimony to a Senate committee. Greenspan echoed previous 
concerns about the U.S. economy and reasserted that the Fed is 
prepared to raise interest rates at any sign of a rebound in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 16.78 at 10,995.82. The blue-chip index had fallen as much as 53 
points in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher after earlier losses.  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.04 at 1,366.88, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was up 19.53 at 2,698.86. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing support behind stocks on Tuesday, sending the Dow  
up 115.88 points, investors initially shied away today as Greenspan 
began his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated that sentiment today, but traders said that  
this time around, they had anticipated the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a Commerce Department report today showed that orders to  
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 
percent in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, and a fresh 
sign that the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock  
market investors who may think that the nation's 8-year economic 
expansion can continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, turned mostly higher following Greenspan's 
testimony. American Express, which rose Tuesday due to a strong 
profit report, edged up 7/8 to 143 1/4. Merrill Lynch rose 1 to 74 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 4 3/8 to 35 7/8 a day after the company said it 
will spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Internet companies slipped, other computer-related  
companies rose amid growing sentiment that the market for personal 
computers is thriving. Intel, the leading maker of computer chips, 
gained 2 13/16 to 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 542.50 million 
shares at midafternoon, behind Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said the sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
data on the employment cost index and gross domestic product are 
released later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to be too enthusiastic,'' he said. ``Any  
rallies will be subdued until we get that out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.60 at 641.29, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.46 at 790.16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 0.37 at  
446.11.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 6.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left  
financial markets unscathed and unimpressed today as he reasserted 
the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates at any sign of a 
rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes ended the session with mixed results. The Dow  
Jones industrial average fell 6.97 to close at 10,972.07. The 
blue-chip index spent much of the afternoon in positive territory 
before falling back in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, were modestly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.56 to 1,365.40, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 26.51 to 2,705.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,600 down, 1,373 up and 575 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 688.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
714.65 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 0.29 to 640.40, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.02 to 789.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.13 to 446.61.  
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. Stocks fell into a slump until Tuesday, when the Dow 
picked up 115.88 points.

traders said that this time around, they had anticipated the 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``But the sigh-of-relief rally was 
short-lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are focusing on a full slate of economic news scheduled  
for release this week. Today, a Commerce Department report said 
that orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods 
rose just 0.3 percent in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, 
and a fresh sign that the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>

gained. 
</P>
<P>
	And the latest Internet retailer to make its initial public  
offering thrived. Drugstore.com, which was priced at 18, rose as 
high as 69 before trailing off again to 55 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
the government releases its employment cost index and gross 
domestic product reports Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Welcomes Shuttle Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Astronaut Eileen Collins, the first female  
shuttle commander, was welcomed back from space Wednesday and 
hailed by Vice President Al Gore as a bigger hero than Amelia 
Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has not only equaled but surpassed Amelia Earhart in the  
history of flight,'' Gore told the crowd, which was filled with a 
larger-than-usual percentage of women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1995, Collins became the first woman to pilot a  
shuttle on what was her first shuttle mission. 
</P>
<P>
	She took with her a scarf worn by Earhart, an early aviation  
pioneer who vanished over the Pacific in 1937 while attempting to 
become the first woman to fly around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	As Collins' 3-year-old daughter Bridget, clad in a jumper  
bearing the Stars and Stripes, sat in front row of the audience, 
her mother grinned graciously as Gore congratulated her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, Bridget, your mommy stands here as a hero to all girls  
and boys, women and men, Americans and people all over the world,'' 
Gore lauded. 
</P>
<P>
	With this mission, the 42-year-old Air Force colonel became the  
first woman to command a U.S. space flight and the first woman ever 
to land a spacecraft. The latter record came late Tuesday, when 
Collins smoothly put Columbia down at Kennedy Space Center for just 
the 12th night landing in 95 shuttle missions. 
</P>
<P>
	A typically modest and relaxed Collins said nothing of her  
achievements, instead choosing to use her time at the microphone to 
thank the ground crews that supported Columbia and also to plug the 
space program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really is a lot of interest out there and we need to  
tap into it,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the brief ceremony, Collins immediately stepped off the  
stage to hug her daughter before sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a president or vice president personally welcomed  
returning astronauts was in September 1996, when President Clinton 
greeted Shannon Lucid's homecoming from a record-setting 188-day 
stay aboard the Russian space station Mir.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Man? It's William H. Macy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several years ago, William H. Macy faced a grim  
dilemma: Either speak up forcefully or risk losing the role of a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy had auditioned early -- and twice again -- to play the lead  
in Joel and Ethan Coen's next film, an absurd gothic tale set in 
Minnesota. The filmmakers, however, wouldn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy decided to speak up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I threatened to shoot their dog,'' he says with a smile.  
``Yeah, I know. It really wasn't one of my proudest moments. But I 
wanted the role so desperately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got it, oh you betcha -- and with no loss of canine life. The  
film, of course, was the hit ``Fargo'' and, for Macy, that's when 
things changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, everything. Night and day. I was ratified! I was  
sanctified! I'm a made guy,'' he says. ``People that had liked my 
work before now have permission to say it out loud and actually 
hire me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he's watching all the fuss -- the angling  
photographers, the buzzing publicists and the reporters hanging on 
his every word -- with a cheeky smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``So,'' he asks happily, ``what took you guys so long?''  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Macy took his own time. Raised in Georgia, he went to  
college in West Virginia with the intention of becoming a vet. 
``There's a theme in my life: animal husbandry,'' he jokes when 
reminded of his threat against the Coens' dog. 
</P>
<P>
	But acting, not Alsatians, was his dream. Macy transferred to  
Goddard College in Vermont, where he struck up a friendship with 
theater guru David Mamet, a man he affectionately calls ``a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy spend most of the 1970s on stage in Chicago, where he was a  
founder of the St. Nicholas Theater and an originator of Mamet 
roles in plays like ``American Buffalo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These were far from glamorous times. Macy, who would help hammer  
scenery during the day and perform at night, was living on good 
humor, cheap cheese and income from commercial voice-overs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My big claim to fame was, 'Secret: Strong enough for a man but  
made for a woman.' I was the guy that said that for a while,'' he 
says. ``I did a lot of research on armpits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Macy showed up to read a single word: ``It was a  
commercial where the guy would say, 'Thanks!' And they would call 
70 men in to go, 'Thanks!' ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in a low level of rage the entire time,'' he says.  
``I'd spend all week being told, 'No.' Week, after week, after 
week. Then some producer would turn to me and say, 'Bill, put a 
smile in your voice.''' 
</P>
<P>
	By the '80s, Macy, who had gone broke twice, started appearing  
on TV and in films such as ``Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' ``The 
Client'' and ``Ghosts of Mississippi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there already was an actor named Bill Macy, he went for  
a time by his initials, W.H. Macy. That moniker was abandoned when 
he realized it confused the biggest VIPs: casting directors. 
</P>
<P>
	With a face that sags and bulges like a sack of Idaho potatoes,  
Macy's hangdog demeanor made him one of Hollywood's better losers, 
an actor who wore the shirt of despair as if he owned a closet full 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was pretty young when I realized we all think we're  
flawed. All of us share one thing: We look around at the rest of 
the world and think, 'Everybody knows what's going on, everyone 
belongs here except me. I'm a fraud.' I think that's one of the 
things that made me get into acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work came steadily in during the early 1990s. There were TV  
movies, lots of plays in New York and a recurring role on ``ER'' as 
the terse chief of surgery Dr. David Morgenstern. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, few knew who this guy was -- a fact made clear when he  
arrived on the set of ``Mr. Holland's Opus'' to play an uptight 
vice principal who must take over Richard Dreyfuss' unruly high 
school music class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a big voice because I've been on stage a long time, and  
I screamed, 'Sit down!' It was so big that some of the girls 
giggled out of embarrassment. I said, 'Sit down! You think this is 
funny?''' 
</P>
<P>
	When the scene was finished, and the crew was resetting the  
lights, the girls piped up with a question: ``Are you really a vice 
principal?'' they asked. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he told them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh,'' they replied. ``Then what do you do?''  
</P>
<P>
	Macy's anonymity wouldn't last, particularly after he -- ahem --  
convinced the Coens that he was right for the ``Fargo'' part of 
Jerry Lundegaard, a weaselly car salesman stuck in an unraveling 
murder scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy's polite desperation -- ``Hey! I'm cooperating here!'' -- and  
heartbreaking glumness, all delivered in an irresistible Minnesota 
accent, had folks saying, ``Ah, jeez!'' and ``Yah, sure!'' for most 
of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friend Mamet was talking to this guy who said, 'What a  
great film! Frances McDormand, wasn't she great? And what are the 
odds of finding that guy up there? What are the odds of finding a 
car dealer who could learn all those lines?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy took that as ``a wonderful compliment.''  
</P>
<P>
	After earning an Oscar nomination, the limelight beckoned: He  
played a man unable to cope with the garish sexuality of ``Boogie 
Nights,'' took a bullet for the president aboard ``Air Force One'' 
and tackled the anguished honey-I'm-home dad in ``Pleasantville.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably gravitate to those types of roles because, with my  
background, I've always felt like the Everyman. I came from the 
South and moved to the North -- that combination somehow put me in 
touch with simple people trying to make their way,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at 49, Macy finally gets to play a real hero, a superhero.  
Well, actually, his character in ``Mystery Men'' is still a loser -- 
a family man who feels compelled to go out and fight crime with a 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the typical Macy role.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, maybe I'm a little perverse,'' says the film's  
producer, Lloyd Levin. ``But I just thought, 'That's Bill Macy! 
Bill can sell that! He can make it really poignant.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And Macy knows why.  
</P>
<P>
	``We just love rooting for people as they struggle. That's what  
life is about, really,'' he says. ``When you look around and go, 
'You know what? It's me. Whether I like it or not, there's nobody 
else.'''

<HEADLINE> Big Central Montana Fire Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSSELSHELL, Mont. (AP) -- A fire that had burned more than  
33,000 acres of grass and sage brush over three days should be 
under control by the end of this week, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, which surrounded this small ranch community, was 100  
percent contained Tuesday evening, meaning crews had fire lines 
built entirely around its perimeter, said fire information office 
Mary Lunsford. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are buttoning this little baby up,'' she said. ``It will  
burn in the interior. It will be burning until we get rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The containment declaration came a few hours after Gov. Marc  
Racicot proclaimed 32 counties disaster areas, streamlining 
deployment of National Guard troops if fires had raged out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began Saturday as 11 separate blazes ignited by  
lightning. It destroyed one house outside town. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, at Henefer, Utah, crews contained three fires that  
had burned 3,700 acres since Sunday. Authorities said the fires 
were sparked by human causes -- one resulted from a car spark or 
discarded cigarette, one the result of a campfire and another 
started by sparks from a power saw.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Ex-Guru Loses Damages Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A counterculture guru turned fugitive,  
convicted in absentia of killing his girlfriend two decades ago, 
was ordered by a jury today to pay her family $907 million for 
wrongful death. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux convinced the jury that Ira  
Einhorn, who is fighting extradition from France, should pay for 
her 1977 death, effectively preventing him from profiting from any 
book or movie deals about the high-profile case. He had not even 
sent someone to defend against the civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In deliberations that took just over an hour, the six-member  
jury awarded the family $752 million in punitive damages and $155 
million in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brain doesn't go that high,'' said Ms. Maddux's sister,  
Elizabeth Hall. ``I couldn't have stood up then, if you'd pulled me 
to my feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall said she did not expect to see the money, ``but that  
really never has been the point. This is a kind of psychological 
blow to Ira. I hope it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments this morning, Maddux family attorney James  
R. Beasley told the jury that the punitive award against Einhorn 
``has got to be so substantial that it will be a shot heard around 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley had argued that Einhorn's refusal to answer any legal  
papers, including a request that he either admit or deny that he 
killed Ms. Maddux, was equivalent to an admission of liability. The 
court accepted that argument. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1997 in response to rumors that Einhorn  
was talking to publishers about a book. Beasley noted that stories 
about Einhorn already have appeared on major TV newsmagazine shows, 
and there was a television miniseries about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn, a prominent antiwar activist in the 1960s who once ran  
for mayor of Philadelphia, became a successful lecturer on the 
environment and other New Age concerns in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maddux disappeared in 1977, and her remains were found 18  
months later in a closet in Einhorn's apartment after neighbors 
complained of the stench. She had been bludgeoned to death. 
</P>
<P>
	At his preliminary hearing in 1979, the courtroom was packed  
with professors, lawyers, civic leaders and other prominent 
Philadelphians who wanted to testify about his good character. 
</P>
<P>
	He was free on $40,000 bail in 1981 when he boarded a plane for  
London with a new girlfriend shortly before he was to go on trial. 
He was convicted in absentia of murder in 1993 and sentenced to 
life in prison. Witnesses had testified that Ms. Maddux, 31, was 
trying to break off her relationship with Einhorn when she 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn spent 16 years in hiding before he was arrested in 1997  
at his home in the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	A court refused to extradite him because French law does not  
allow for trial without the defendant being present. After 
Pennsylvania passed a law promising a retrial, Einhorn was 
rearrested in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a French court ordered him extradited provided that  
he be retried and not face the death penalty. He is appealing that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the case went to jurors today, Ms. Hall testified that  
she was outraged at the thought that Einhorn could make millions by 
selling his story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was absolutely infuriated and horrified. What kind of  
posthumous damage could he do to the reputation of my sister?'' she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict was reached today, the judge allowed the  
six-member jury to speak with the Maddux family. They exchanged 
hugs, kisses and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an indication of how many good people there are in  
the world,'' said Ms. Maddux's brother, John Maddux.

	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated that sentiment today, but traders said they  
had anticipated the Fed chairman's remarks. Also, a Commerce 
Department report today showed that orders to U.S. factories for 
big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent in June -- less 
than analysts had anticipated, and a fresh sign that the global 
economy has not overheated.

<P>
	Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock  
market investors who may think that the nation's 8-year economic 
expansion can continue indefinitely.

<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, turned higher as Greenspan's testimony continued.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Wreck in Colombia Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Wreckage scattered on an Andean  
mountainside is the remains of a U.S. army spy plane that 
disappeared last week with five American soldiers aboard, the U.S. 
military confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no official word on whether anyone survived.  
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen U.S. and Colombian rescuers have reached the  
site of the wrecked de Havilland RC-7 reconnaissance plane, said 
Capt. Jack Miller, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any information on the crew,'' Miller said. In  
addition to the five Americans, two Colombian air force officers 
were aboard the plane. The aircraft went down Friday during a 
counter-narcotics mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's air force commander, Gen. Fabio Velasco, reported  
late Tuesday that Colombian army and air force search and rescue 
personnel had been lowered to the crash site from helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had broken into many small pieces and was scattered  
over a wide area of the Andean peak, Velasco said. He called the 
chance anyone survived ``nonexistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thick clouds and steep terrain prevented rescuers from reaching  
the crash site earlier. The wreckage was spotted Sunday near the 
southwestern border with Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Army uses planes with eavesdropping equipment to gather  
information on drug traffickers' movements and to photograph 
plantations where drug crops are grown. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the RC-7 had been circling over Putumayo State, which  
in recent years has seen an explosion in the cultivation of coca -- 
the raw material of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The state is also a stronghold of the rebel Revolutionary Armed  
Forces of Colombia, which earns huge profits off the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Says Race Ready To Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
formally opened his campaign headquarters Wednesday, saying a 
competitive fight for the Democratic presidential nomination would 
be good for the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think competition is what America is all about,'' said  
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why two candidates running for office can't push  
each other to more clearly define and to lay out a vision for the 
country,'' said Bradley. ``Ultimately the country would benefit 
from having the debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke to about 100 activists, then lunched with key  
operatives. He is the only announced opposition to Vice President 
Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has the backing of the White House and much of the  
Democratic Party establishment, is generally considered the 
frontrunner for the nomination. But Bradley has been persistent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial reports this month showed Bradley with $7 million in  
the bank, compared to Gore's $9 million. In addition, Bradley was 
making his 13th swing through Iowa this year, vowing to organize a 
grassroots effort in a state where campaign organizations matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll show respect for every voter,'' said Bradley. ``We want  
to make sure we're out there listening to them and talking to 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic strategists are worried that Bradley can stay  
alive deep into the primary season, firing away at Gore and 
weakening the party's chances to retain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley dismissed those worries, even as he predicted the race  
will heat up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that there is a competitive primary only enhances the  
ultimate winner because it prepares him for the real challenge 
which will come in the fall,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Up 16.78; Nasdaq Up 19.53 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan provided no new shocks to markets 
in testimony to a Senate committee. Greenspan echoed previous 
concerns about the U.S. economy and reasserted that the Fed is 
prepared to raise interest rates at any sign of a rebound in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 16.78 at 10,995.82. The blue-chip index had fallen as much as 53 
points in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher after earlier losses.  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.04 at 1,366.88, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was up 19.53 at 2,698.86. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing support behind stocks on Tuesday, sending the Dow  
up 115.88 points, investors initially shied away today as Greenspan 
began his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated that sentiment today, but traders said that  
this time around, they had anticipated the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a Commerce Department report today showed that orders to  
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 
percent in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, and a fresh 
sign that the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock  
market investors who may think that the nation's 8-year economic 
expansion can continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, turned mostly higher following Greenspan's 
testimony. American Express, which rose Tuesday due to a strong 
profit report, edged up 7/8 to 143 1/4. Merrill Lynch rose 1 to 74 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 4 3/8 to 35 7/8 a day after the company said it 
will spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Internet companies slipped, other computer-related  
companies rose amid growing sentiment that the market for personal 
computers is thriving. Intel, the leading maker of computer chips, 
gained 2 13/16 to 70 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 542.50 million 
shares at midafternoon, behind Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said the sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
data on the employment cost index and gross domestic product are 
released later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to be too enthusiastic,'' he said. ``Any  
rallies will be subdued until we get that out of the way.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 6.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left  
financial markets unscathed and unimpressed today as he reasserted 
the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates at any sign of a 
rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes ended the session with mixed results. The Dow  
Jones industrial average fell 6.97 to close at 10,972.07. The 
blue-chip index spent much of the afternoon in positive territory 
before falling back in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, were modestly higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.56 to 1,365.40, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 26.51 to 2,705.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,600 down, 1,373 up and 575 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 688.93 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
714.65 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 0.29 to 640.40, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.02 to 789.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.13 to 446.61.  
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. Stocks fell into a slump until Tuesday, when the Dow 
picked up 115.88 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated his concerns about the economy today, but  
traders said that this time around, they had anticipated the 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``But the sigh-of-relief rally was 
short-lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are focusing on a full slate of economic news scheduled  
for release this week. Today, a Commerce Department report said 
that orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods 
rose just 0.3 percent in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, 
and a fresh sign that the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock  
market investors who may think that the nation's 8-year economic 
expansion can continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in

</P>
<P>

service provider, dropped a day after the company said it will 
spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Internet companies slipped, other computer-related  
companies rose amid growing sentiment that the market for personal 
computers is thriving. Intel, the leading maker of computer chips, 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	And the latest Internet retailer to make its initial public  
offering thrived. Drugstore.com, which was priced at 18, rose as 
high as 69 before trailing off again to 55 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
the government releases its employment cost index and gross 
domestic product reports Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to be too enthusiastic,'' he said. ``Any

<P>
	Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the  
United States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	July 27  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on a special perk for Al Gore:  
</P>
<P>
	If you're the vice president and the Democratic Party's leading  
White House contender, you don't have to worry about being up the 
creek without a paddle or, for that matter, without water. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Gore's photo-opportunity canoe trip on the Connecticut River  
got a 4 billion-gallon lift last week. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Connecticut River Joint Commission and the Secret  
Service advance team checked out the conditions, the commission 
asked for the release of additional water from a dam as a 
precaution. Besides being unphotogenic, a veep mired in mud 
probably gives Secret Service agents ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of the Vermont Department of Natural Resources was  
quoted -- inaccurately, he said later -- by the Washington Times: 
``They won't release water for the fish when we ask them to, but 
somehow they find themselves able to release it for a politician.'' 

</P>
<P>
	July 25  
</P>
<P>
	Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune, on HMOs and Medicare:  
</P>
<P>
	About 327,000 Medicare beneficiaries and the general public  
recently got a reminder that health care in the United States is a 
business, not a public service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-nine health maintenance organizations have informed the  
federal government that they either will leave the Medicare program 
entirely by the end of the year or reduce the number of areas they 
serve. These notices follow similar cutbacks last year that sent 
more than 400,000 Medicare HMO patients scrambling for 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMOs complain that the federal government isn't paying them  
enough to make Medicare worth their while, and their complaints may 
be valid. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO cutbacks are timely, coming as Congress considers  
whether Medicare should provide prescription coverage and how to 
ensure Medicare's solvency in the future. The message from the HMOs 
is that decent health care coverage for the elderly doesn't come 
cheap -- as if the public needed another reminder. 

</P>
<P>
	July 17  
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessean, Nashville, on private prisons:  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee cannot claim to control public safety unless and until  
it gets control of the policies on private prisons operating in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor over tax reform dominated discussion this year in the  
General Assembly and put prisons on the back burner. But while 
discussion of private prison issues died down, the problems 
associated with them did not. 
</P>
<P>
	The state got a nasty reminder about the problem in May when  
four Montana prisoners broke out of the Mason Correctional Facility 
in Tipton County. Two of the four never made it past a fence. One 
of those who did was a murderer, the other an armed robber. It was 
a week before the two escapees were captured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tipton County prison is owned and operated by Corrections  
Corporation of America, the Nashville-based company that operates 
nine prisons or jails in Tennessee, three of which it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Both for the sake of public funds and public safety, Tennessee  
needs to get a handle on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Private prisons escaped the legislature this year without  
regulation. But lawmakers must make sure the issue is not 
forgotten. As long as these institutions operate within state 
borders, the state must have some say about how they operate, who 
is held there, and what happens in the event of an escape. 

</P>
<P>
	July 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Herald, Everett, Wash., on marriage  
</P>
<P>
	Despite what some cultural anthropologists say, the institution  
of marriage is still a significant rite of passage in American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report released by Rutgers University's National  
Marriage Project concludes that ``the institution of marriage is in 
serious trouble'' because people are taking longer to get married. 
What the writers of the report fail to realize is that people are 
taking longer to get married because they want it to last, not 
because they don't believe in it. 
</P>
<P>
	More often, men and women are realizing that it's OK to postpone  
getting married while they're pursuing an education, establishing a 
career and finding themselves. In the 1950s, it was more socially 
correct to marry and then do all those other life-altering things. 
Young adults today are recognizing that a marriage can be stronger 
if two people join in wedlock after going through a few major life 
experiences on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the young adults who are marrying today grew  
up with only one parent in the household. They know how tough it is 
to live through a divorce and the last thing they want is to 
experience it again. As a result, they know that marriage is 
fragile and they only want to enter into it if they are convinced 
it's the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rutgers University study interprets this as a decline in the  
importance of marriage as an institution, but it is just the 
opposite. Marriage is considered more sacred today and people are 
saying they would rather not enter it at all than enter it with 
trepidation. ... 

</P>
<P>
	July 26  
</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, La., on nuclear security:  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has made a smashing start in cleaning up the security  
mess in the Energy Department that has seen Chinese agents steal 
the nation's nuclear secrets for perhaps more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House may have far more radical ideas, and President  
Clinton ... may ultimately have to choose between bureaucracy and 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 96-1 for an amendment ... that would set up  
within the Energy Department an Agency for Nuclear Security; it 
then passed the bill. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would in essence rename the department staff that  
runs the labs that research and develop nuclear weapons. It would 
also be responsible for counterintelligence and security. 
</P>
<P>
	It would largely bypass the department of bureaucracy, which has  
proven incapable of providing effective security. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary Bill Richardson ... has opposed proposals to take the  
nuclear weapons operation out of his hands. ... But President 
Clinton will have to decide the most effective arrangement for 
protecting the national security because the ultimate 
responsibility for that is the president's.

	In his 30s, John F. Kennedy Jr. had earned a certain celebrity  
as publisher of ``George'' magazine, as America's most desirable 
bachelor and, recently, as a New York socialite and husband to a 
glamorous wife. But his inherited celebrity ... clearly 
overshadowed whatever personal accomplishments he could claim. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latter JFK Jr. the nation now mourns, his death made  
more poignant by our memories of the shining days of this father's 
presidency. And that sadness is compounded by reflection on the 
almost inconceivable misfortune the Kennedy family has had to 
endure over the years. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In one regard, the Bessettes are entitled to more of our  
sympathy than the Kennedys. They lost two family members in (the) 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the national sense of loss concerns more than just the  
untimely death of these three attractive young people. We also 
grieve over the loss of the 3-year-old boy who toddled across the 
White House lawn and later saluted his father's flag-covered casket 
as the funeral procession passed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In hindsight, JFK's Camelot may have been a product of skillful  
public relations and a willing self-delusion on the part of the 
nation. But we don't relinquish our fairy tales lightly, even when 
we know they are myths. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of JFK Jr. drives home the point that this fairy tale  
has a decidedly unhappy ending.

<P>
	Mickey Mouse and Howdy Doody must not be available.  
</P>
<P>
	So, in an obviously desperate search to find a candidate to  
oppose Sen. Mike DeWine next year, some Democratic leaders in Ohio 
are pondering the next best thing -- Jerry Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, some Democrats are serious about this farcical idea.

</P>
<P>
	Dear President Bill Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	For days now the state of Nebraska has quietly pondered the  
significance of being the only state in the country you have not 
visited since your election as president. Frankly, some Nebraskans 
even reveled in the notoriety. Some of them are Republicans. Others 
are just contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraskans like to be ornery -- in a nice way, of course. It's  
just that they relish their independence. That's why Nebraska is 
the only state in the country with a unicameral legislature. So 
Nebraskans are used to being one of a kind, and they sort of like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're friendly, gosh darn it, and they don't want you to  
think that you're unwelcome here. And they'd be upset if you 
thought there was no darn good reason to come to their state.

	The Times, London, on Russia:  
</P>
<P>
	There is more to this week's trip to Washington by the Russian  
Prime Minister, Sergei Stepashin, than meets the foreign eye. 
Foreigners may chart his progress in mending Moscow's ties to the 
West, damaged during the Kosovo war which Russia opposed, or look 
at his success in persuading the World Bank and IMF to resume 
lending suspended since last August's rouble crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians, however, will be aware of an extra, and to them  
equally important, domestic dimension. How well Mr. Stepashin does 
in Washington will have a direct bearing on his chances of a place 
in the still murky battle lines being drawn up in Moscow, at the 
start of a year of elections which should end by giving Russia a 
new president.

</P>
<P>
	We have a timely suggestion that should appeal to a prime  
minister who says he wants to ``modernize'' Britain -- try a smaller 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The present complement of 22 has been typical for many years.  
But as Britain PLC heads toward the new millennium, some radical 
streamlining in the boardroom seems in order. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, think of the savings to be made from elimination, not  
only of whole tranches of ministers, but also of the small armies 
of officials, publicity wallahs, political advisers and sundry 
hangers-on who support them. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as though there are no obvious candidates for the chop.  
Now that Scotland and Wales have their own assemblies and their own 
chief executives, can there be a compelling justification for the 
continued existence in Whitehall of the Scottish Secretary and a 
Welsh Secretary?

</P>
<P>
	The new king of Morocco must decide soon whether he wants to  
continue with his father's repressive policies or further open the 
country up democratically. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Was King Hassan II, who died on Friday, not an oriental despot  
wallowing in luxury who did as he pleased in his country and 
reigned much as Louis XIV once did in France? 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed so.  
</P>
<P>
	But Hassan II was more than that. If the world's great and good  
came to the mausoleum in Rabat, it was because he was one of the 
few heads of the state in the Arab world the West could rely on. 
...
</P>
<P>
	In the years preceding his death, to the West's great pleasure,  
the king was striving for the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan II ordered a democratic opening in his country which  
wouldn't encroach on the foundations of his power. 
</P>
<P>
	Respect for human rights in Morocco has grown, and freedom of  
the press also grew a little. But the country's feudal structures 
have stayed in place. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor, Mohammed VI, must decide. He can't have both.

<P>
	Both of them developed a tradition over several years of holding  
secret relations with Israel. Both of them decided five years ago 
to make the relations formal and open. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has to hope that also during the term of Mohamed VI (in  
Morocco) the relations will continue between Israel and Morocco in 
the same fashion and will even be improved as the peace process 
progresses. Above all, it is in the interest of the two countries 
to implement the wide commitment to cooperation between them and 
not to let it pass away with the disappearance of Hassan II.

	Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, Sweden, on Kosovo refugees:  
</P>
<P>
	The refugee problem, naturally, is not solved through the fact  
that a majority of them can be given the possibility of returning 
to their land. The material destruction in Kosovo is extensive and 
the food supply will slump. The need of support from the outside 
world will not lessen because the borders are open. It is just as 
large, but does not have the same character. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this, it follows that Sweden and other more fortunate  
countries must show great flexibility both in treatment of its 
refugees and regarding contributions for restoring economic 
security and stability in the suffering countries as soon as 
possible. The fact that an open civil war is no longer going on 
does not mean that Kosovo is a place with a functioning public 
society or infrastructure. The development of a normal society, in 
any sense, comes with security and defense against economic 
problems. Food on the table and a roof over one's head are two of 
the most important preparations for a sustainable peace and to 
prevent violence.

	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on China-Taiwan relations:  
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui set off a firestorm by using  
the phrase `two states in one nation' to describe the China-Taiwan 
relationship during a radio interview. China condemned Lee's new 
definition of the relationship as a ploy to reject the `one China' 
principle and is reportedly gearing up for military exercises, 
giving rise to fears that there might be a re-enactment of the 
Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-1996. Taiwan, however, insists there 
has been no change in its continental policy. Both China and Taiwan 
must exercise restraint to avert a needless clash. 
</P>
<P>
	It is understandable that China would be sensitive to any  
attempt by Taiwan to assert independence. But Taiwan has not 
abandoned the objectives that it has pursued for most of this 
decade -- namely, `status quo over the medium term' and `unification 
under a democratic polity in the future.' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee made his provocative remarks with an eye on the coming  
presidential election. ... For the next six months, Taiwan will be 
preoccupied with choosing Lee's successor. While Taiwan-China 
relations are unlikely to improve until after the election, there 
is no reason to sever the relationship. We hope that both sides 
will refrain from imprudent actions that would bode ill for the 
future.

	Bangkok Post, Thailand, on drug flow from Myanmar:  
</P>
<P>
	Thailand is the destination for millions of methamphetamine  
pills produced by clients of the Myanmar regime on our northern 
border. Yangon says it can do little to halt the flow of drugs from 
its border. And ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations are holding to the policy that precludes them from saying 
anything unpleasant to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years that Myanmar was admitted to ASEAN, our  
northern border has become a gateway for the import of narcotics 
that have resulted in a national menace. We are seeing ... the 
establishment of drugs-funded bastions that can only be likened to 
those of the cocaine cartels in Colombia. As a member of ASEAN, 
Yangon has a lot of explaining to do, and ASEAN should remove its 
blinkers and demand an end to its unacceptable conduct.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Wants More School Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To help prevent another school massacre,  
teachers should answer a student's Nazi salute or raised middle 
finger with harsh discipline, Republican presidential candidate 
Gary Bauer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a First Amendment issue on Nazi salutes in public  
school hallways,'' Bauer told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The longshot candidate, who called GOP rival George W. Bush's  
fund-raising juggernaut ``devastating'' to his own bid, also 
rejected for the first time the idea of a third-party run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should never say never, I guess,'' Bauer said in an  
interview saturated by his references to Ronald Reagan and his 
unabashedly conservative party of ``bold colors not pale pastels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to spend 25 years building something from  
scratch,'' Bauer said. ``I'd rather stay in this party and make it 
the party of Lincoln and Reagan than bail out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boasting a tie clip from his days working in the Reagan White  
House, Bauer joked of also sporting Reagan underwear. ``Anything I 
can do to fortify me for the long road ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the hourlong interview, Bauer grew most animated when  
discussing the April 20 rampage at a Colorado school by teen gunmen 
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who were reportedly known among 
classmates as Nazi sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did adults in that school feel that they couldn't grab  
Eric and Dylan and say 'You know, if I see you give the Nazi salute 
again, if I don't break your arm you're going to be out of this 
school for the rest of this year.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to his boyhood home, Bauer added: ``That's what would  
have happened in Newport, Ky., 30 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not advocating violence as a response to  
violence, and was also not proposing to outlaw certain uruly or 
offensive gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say throw 'em in jail. I say you discipline a kid  
that gives the Nazi salute. I mean, if the kid goes down the hall 
and gives you the finger you ought to do something about it,'' 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he put to rest recent speculation that he would bolt the  
GOP to test third-party prospects, Bauer harshly accused Republican 
congressional leaders of ``hesitancy ... lack of direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have, he said, effectively given President Clinton free  
rein over policy, particularly on trade with China. On that issue, 
the Republican-led Congress also ``couldn't free itself'' from the 
influence of lobbyists, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next month's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, Bauer  
said he hoped to finish among the top five of 10 Republicans. He 
acknowleged Bush's formidable status as frontrunner but called the 
Texas governor's campaign ``pitiful so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I envious that the guy can go into a state and flip some  
pancakes and be on the front pages of all the state newspapers? 
Yeah, I'd love to be able to do that,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how does that help somebody who's trying to figure out how  
to make their schools better?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who reported a $500,000 campaign deficit as of June 30,  
said he and his staff of 40 are prepared to run in the red until 
January, when federal matching funds become available.

<HEADLINE> Milburn Ready for Rebirth With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Chicago Bears coach Dick Jauron hopes  
to make Glyn Milburn somebody else's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, who spent the last four years as Jacksonville's  
defensive coordinator, remembers trying to find somebody -- anybody 
-- who could cover Milburn one-on-one in his days with the Denver 
Broncos. It never quite worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had to double him. We did not feel like we had a  
linebacker that could cover him alone,'' Jauron said. ``When you 
have that kind of problem defensively, it really opens up a lot of 
other things. So we want to use all of his talents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn will be returning kicks and punts again this season just  
as he's done his entire career. But he'll also spend some time in 
the backfield. He'll probably line up as a receiver, too. And with 
the way things are going for the Bears at quarterback, he might 
even toss a few passes. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, scratch that last part, Milburn isn't Kordell Stewart. But  
the running back/returner is going to be a big part of the Bears' 
new wide-open offense this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be in the backfield at times, but he won't be solely in  
the backfield,'' Jauron said. ``He gives us another dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn is known primarily as a return specialist, a tag he  
doesn't really like. Returns are what he does best; in his first 
season with the Bears last year, he returned three kicks for 
touchdowns and set Chicago records for kickoff returns (62) and 
yards (1,550). 
</P>
<P>
	But there's much more to his game than catching a kick and  
flying down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You become typecast into being one-dimensional and people  
think that's the only thing I can do,'' he said. ``Throughout my 
career, I've done some things that don't fit that tag. I played 
running back and receiver in Denver and had some success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn did a little bit of everything for the Broncos from  
1993-95. In his first season, he rushed for 231 yards and caught 38 
passes for 300 yards and three touchdowns. In his very first game, 
he had a career-long 50-yard reception, a 36-yard punt return and a 
25-yard TD catch. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the year he went to the Pro Bowl, he led the NFL with  
his 27-yard kickoff return average and was fifth in the league with 
11.4 yards per punt return. He also rushed for 266 yards, including 
a career-best 131 yards against Seattle, and averaged 11.4 yards 
per catch on 31 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears hoped to take advantage of that versatility when they  
acquired him from Green Bay a week before the first game last year. 
But things got a little tumultuous for Chicago's offense -- Curtis 
Enis blew out his knee and Erik Kramer missed the last half of the 
season -- and the Bears never did fit Milburn in. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Curtis and the running backs they had here, it was  
difficult to expect to be inserted right away,'' Milburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this year. The Bears are opening up their traditional  
smashmouth offense, and Milburn can count on plenty of playing 
time. With Enis still recovering from reconstructive knee surgery 
and Edgar Bennett from off-season surgery, Milburn is getting a lot 
of work during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He might take a handoff from Shane Matthews in one drill, and be  
sprinting downfield for a catch on the next. And when the special 
teams practice begins, there he is again, sprinting up the field, 
zigging and zagging so no one can get a hand on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited. This is a great opportunity this year,'' he said.  
``It's a new offense, one that's more wide open, where players can 
line up at different positions. Defenses may not be able to expect 
one thing when I go into a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Jauron knows all too well, that's bad news for whomever's  
playing across from him.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Hector Elizondo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Never mind the dozens of movies and television  
programs he has done during the past 40 years. Hector Elizondo 
considers himself a stage actor. 
</P>
<P>
	And just like a role dreamed up in a playwright's mind, Elizondo  
is an interesting character. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really want to do every day is be a voyeur of sorts,  
not in a creepy way, but I love to hang around and read, work out 
and meet plenty of interesting people,'' he said during a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo comes across as pensive and flippant, formal yet  
relaxed. He reviews the history of Latinos in America in one breath 
and explains his disdain for pigeons in the next. 
</P>
<P>
	He speaks proudly of his family's Basque and Puerto Rican roots  
but says his nationality is ``New Yorker.'' Elizondo, one of the 
stars of ``Chicago Hope'' on CBS, chats with a waiter in Spanish as 
he orders coffee and smiles to passers-by as he sits in a Manhattan 
hotel lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	His desire to interact with people fuels his affinity for the  
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much depends on the audience in a play. The audience is  
really another character,'' Elizondo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you film, you don't sense the audience. There is no  
reaction. You work and work and nothing comes back to you. Instead 
you have to wait for your ratings or your box-office numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``I don't especially like making movies. I don't think  
many stage actors do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is an exception to that rule. Elizondo, 62, enjoys  
working with film director Garry Marshall so much that he has 
appeared in 11 of Marshall's films. ``That must be an official 
Hollywood record,'' Elizondo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marshall-Elizondo collaborations include ``Pretty Woman,''  
in which Elizondo played the hotel manager, and the upcoming 
``Runaway Bride.'' The new film reunites Julia Roberts and Richard 
Gere in the starring roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew eventually we would all work together again. We  
thought it was going to be a sequel to `Pretty Woman,' but this is 
a much better idea. It's another romantic comedy that brings the 
same people back to a new story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Runaway Bride,'' Elizondo plays Fisher, the husband of  
Gere's ex-wife Ellie, played by Rita Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	While he has appeared in more than 40 movies, Elizondo explained  
that he is anything but ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I like to be busy. Being busy, I realize now, is not  
the same thing as being ambitious. I think of `ambitious' as making 
plans, having a vision. I'm still trying to get ambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. What is it about Garry Marshall that makes you want to work  
with him repeatedly? 
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo: He knows how to make people feel relaxed and do their  
best. Working with him, you're not afraid to fail, and that's the 
important thing. As an actor, you're not afraid to take a chance. 
He has that kind of confidence in you and in himself. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Have you ever done a movie that you thought would do well but  
didn't? Or a movie that turned out to be an unexpected success? 
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo: I had no idea about `Pretty Woman.' I thought `this is  
going to be just OK,' and it turned out to be the biggest success 
I've been in. The one I thought was going to be successful was 
something called `Being Human,' which starred a wonderful fellow, 
Robin Williams. But `Being Human,' who has heard of that? At least 
I got to go to Morocco for it. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Several ``Chicago Hope'' cast members are not returning in  
the fall. What lies ahead for you and the show? 
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo: We didn't think we'd have a sixth season. But now we  
have a new and exciting cast. And as long as there are enough 
kidneys and spleens to transplant, I'll be there. It's a terrific 
job. I like familiarity. I like knowing who I work with, who I can 
count on, and who I have to watch out for. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Have you learned anything about medicine?  
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo: You learn something in spite of yourself. Doctors have  
a hard job. I think bedside manner is more important than almost 
anything. Hospitals are no place to be sick in. There's lots of 
bacteria and the food is lousy. It's funny because it's the place 
where you should be treated the best. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How do you feel about the recent media attention on Latinos?  
</P>
<P>
	Elizondo: People have forgotten that we were the first Europeans  
to walk across America. It's like we're just being discovered now. 
It's a big deal to be Latin now, but I'd rather not exploit that 
and make a big deal of it, and I guess I haven't. My driver said to 
me yesterday, `I didn't know you were Latino.' Hector Elizondo?! 
Did he think my name was Lance Armstrong and I changed it to Hector 
Elizondo?

	Posting Loss, Compaq Cuts Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. plans to slash up to 8,000  
jobs, or 12 percent of its workforce, as it struggles to cut costs 
amid a $184 million loss in the second quarter brought on by 
computer price wars and slowing sales. The cuts are the first major 
move by new chief executive and president Michael D. Capellas, 
hoping to turn around the No. 1 PC maker's flagging business. 
Compaq said its second-quarter loss came to 10 cents a share, 
slightly less than the 11 cents-a-share forecast by analysts polled 
by First Call. Compaq had warned last month it would lose up to 15 
cents a share, compared to initial predictions of a 20-cents 
profit. The loss compared to a profit of $32 million, or 2 cents a 
share, in the April-June quarter a year ago, not counting a $3.63 
billion charge related to the acquisition of Digital Equipment and 
other one-time costs.

	Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Down 6.97  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left  
financial markets unscathed and unimpressed today as he reasserted 
the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates at any sign of a 
rebound in inflation. Market indexes ended the session with mixed 
results. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.97 to close at 
10,972.07. The blue-chip index spent much of the afternoon in

	Greenspan Cautions Against Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged  
Congress today to delay any big tax cuts until budget surpluses 
materialize. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, 
Greenspan also renewed a warning issued to House lawmakers last 
week that the Fed was prepared to raise interest rates again if 
necessary to hold inflation in check. On tax cuts, Greenspan said 
Congress should proceed slowly and cautiously. ``Probably we would 
be better off holding off on a tax cut immediately, largely because 
of the fact that it is apparent that the surpluses are doing a 
great deal of positive good to the economy,'' Greenspan told the 
panel.

	Durable Goods Orders Rise in June  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Increased demand for autos and electronic  
equipment led orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured 
goods up 0.3 percent in June. The Commerce Department said today 
that orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least 
three years -- increased $64 million last month to a seasonally 
adjusted $196.9 billion. The increase followed a 0.8 percent gain 
in May, less than what the government previously estimated, and a 
drop of 2.4 percent in orders in April. June's performance marked 
the sixth increase in the last eight months.

	Fed Software Would Protect Systems  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is planning to  
create a government-wide security network to protect the nation's 
most important computer systems from hackers, thieves, terrorists 
and hostile countries. The proposal would involve building an 
elaborate network of electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers 
to watch for potentially suspicious activity on federal computer 
systems. The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on 
nonmilitary computers next year, according to a draft copy of the 
proposal obtained by The Associated Press. Civil liberties groups 
complain that the security tools also would make possible 
unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially because of the 
increasingly widespread use of computers by the government in 
almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund neared  
agreement today on providing Russia with a $4.5 billion financial 
lifeline to help keep the country afloat through the December 
parliamentary elections and presidential voting scheduled for June 
2000. President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to international 
financial institutions, Mikhail Zadanov, was working out the final 
details with the IMF's deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, 
and the 24-member executive board. The move to resume lending comes 
nearly a year after Russia defaulted on its debts and devalued its 
currency last Aug 17. The IMF froze a loan package worth $22.6 
billion after the financial collapse but reached a preliminary 
accord on new financing in April.

<HEADLINE> Stylist Helps Stars Look Their Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, you are what you drive, and Phillip Bloch has a  
black Dodge pickup. In back is a custom-built box, locked and 
loaded with up to 150 designer outfits he has chosen for 
Hollywood's hottest stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever other people usually carry in their trucks, I'm  
carrying Armani, Valentino and Karan and Klein gowns, with shoes to 
match,'' said Bloch, aka Tinseltown's fashion guru. 
</P>
<P>
	In an industry where one outfit -- for better or worse -- can land  
a star all over the glossies, Bloch is a celebrity's fast track to 
just the right image. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Bullock. Salma Hayek. Jim Carrey, John Travolta, Jada  
Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, Lauren Holly, Jewel. They all have been 
dressed to impress by Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
	His mission: ``We try to keep people chic. That's my job, the  
most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, just how hot is Phillip Bloch?  
</P>
<P>
	One magazine dubbed him one of its ``Four Most Lusted-After Men  
in Fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's even signed with the William Morris Agency -- and not as a  
dresser. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for the right `property' for me to go into,''  
said Bloch, referring to a sitcom or fashion TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's his light green eyes. (You'll find them peeking out  
beneath one of his trademark Kangol hats.) 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's his fashion fluency. No one else spouts ``You look  
fabulous'' as irrepressibly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a constant fast-cut fashion show going on in his  
mind,'' said Martha Nelson in the foreword to Bloch's ``Elements of 
Style'' (Warner Books, 1998). Bloch possesses a ``freewheeling 
interior flip-book of images'' from film, television, music and 
magazines, Nelson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	That flip-book has had years of practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was around 10 or 12, I lived for watching the Oscars,  
and I'd buy Vogue. I wasn't reading Sports Illustrated,'' said 
Bloch, 38, in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only natural that at 18 he left his New York hometown of  
Seaford, Long Island, to study fashion design in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Adventure followed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went to F.I.T. (Fashion Institute of Technology), but I  
majored in Studio 54,'' said Bloch, who waited tables at the disco 
in 1980. Moonlighting also led to a stint pouring cappuccino at 
Fiorucci, a trendy clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
	Good contacts also brought Bloch work assisting top stylists  
with photo shoots and fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Even better contacts were to come. A talent scout for a Japanese  
modeling agency discovered Bloch at a New York boutique and whisked 
him off to Tokyo for modeling. There Bloch met Jean-Paul Gaultier. 
The noted French designer transplanted Bloch to his Paris runway. 
</P>
<P>
	London and Milan beckoned as well, where Bloch modeled for Yves  
Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace and John Galliano, and graced layouts 
in European magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bloch preferred the other side of the camera and began  
working as a publicist for European designers. He also designed his 
own men's and women's collection in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	On a trip to Los Angeles in 1993, Bloch couldn't resist the  
California lifestyle -- or the offer to be represented by Cloutier, 
a top Los Angeles stylist agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The celebrity thing just sort of kicked in,'' said Bloch, who  
scored his first plum photo shoots dressing River Phoenix and Faye 
Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
	But aren't celebs glamorous enough without the aid of a stylist?  
</P>
<P>
	No, said Bloch, not when ``they're busy working, they have  
families, they have production companies, they have to be on the 
set at 4 a.m., and they want to have some semblance of a normal 
life at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not uncommon for my celebrities to be all over the place.  
That's why they come to depend so heavily on me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even menswear requires artistry.  
</P>
<P>
	``On men, the interesting thing is to mix the patterns of the  
shirts and the patterns of the tie,'' said Bloch. ``It's such a 
banal thing, finding a shirt and a tie and suit. But I make it 
elegant with a twist. There's always this picture you're trying to 
paint, even if it's the simplest thing.''

<HEADLINE> Witness Must Testify in Conn. Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The elderly brother-in-law of the  
late Robert F. Kennedy must testify before a grand jury 
investigating the 1975 murder of a teen-age girl in Greenwich, 
Conn., a Florida appeals court ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th District Court of Appeal rejected arguments by Rushton  
Skakel's lawyer that the 74-year-old man is mentally unfit to 
travel or testify. His lawyer claims Skakel barks, refuses to bathe 
and rubs noses and bellies with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe Skakel may have information about the death  
of 15-year-old Martha Moxley, who was bludgeoned on her family's 
estate with a golf club that Skakel admitted two decades ago came 
from a set in his home in Greenwich. Skakel, who is the brother of 
Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, now lives in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel's sons, Michael and Thomas, have been identified as  
suspects in the slaying. Michael, who was 15 at the time, and 
Thomas, then 17, have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sherman, an attorney for Michael Skakel, said Rushton  
Skakel does not have any incriminating information about his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly an unnecessary exercise because Rushton Skakel  
was not in Connecticut when this crime occurred,'' Sherman said. 
``He has consistently said that no child of his admitted or 
confessed anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling, the court did not mention Skakel's bizarre  
behavior. Instead, it noted Skakel sat through a four-hour hearing 
in a lower court, apparently without undue hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said his lawyer had the opportunity to put Skakel on the  
stand to demonstrate his lack of competency but did not. 
</P>
<P>
	That lower-court judge ruled Skakel should be forced to testify  
in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Skakel's attorney, Richard Lubin, did not immediately return a  
call. 
</P>
<P>
	An affidavit by an investigator suggests Skakel might have  
overheard one of his sons discussing the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed by prosecutors and investigators in Connecticut  
``indicate that Skakel may have direct knowledge as to the 
instrumentality of the crime and the identity of the perpetrator,'' 
the appeals court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the former tutor for the Skakel boys who was himself  
a former suspect in the Moxley slaying was hospitalized in Boston 
last week with stab wounds. Kenneth Littleton's girlfriend, Anne 
Drake, said that the wounds were self-inflicted and that he had 
been despondent about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton, 47, was a suspect for more than 20 years but was  
given immunity from prosecution after he testified before a grand 
jury last summer.

	Republicans Push On With Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate rejected a  
Democratic call for scaled-down tax cuts today and pushed a larger, 
$792 billion measure toward passage despite a fresh word of caution 
from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and a veto threat from 
the White House. The vote was 60-39 against a Democratic proposal 
for cuts of $290 billion over 10 years, an amount that supporters 
said would leave enough money to safeguard Social Security, 
Medicare and other domestic priorities.

<HEADLINE> Senate Moves On GOP Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders are steering their $792  
billion tax cut bill through the Senate, shunting aside a much 
smaller Democratic alternative and ignoring a promise from 
President Clinton that he will never let it become law. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the 10-year plan were confident, despite misgivings  
among several Republicans about its size, of winning passage by the 
end of the week and moving quickly to work out differences with a 
similar House-passed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``are rightful heirs to the wealth they're creating,''  
Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., the bill's 
chief author, said in opening the debate Wednesday. ``After paying 
for the government programs for which Congress has planned and 
budgeted, the change must now be returned to the taxpayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was what to do with a budget surplus estimated to total  
$1 trillion over the next decade, or nearly $3 trillion if the 
revenues from Social Security are included. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted that their tax relief wouldn't affect  
efforts to restore fiscal integrity to Social Security and Medicare 
and would leave funds to bring down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and most Democrats said a tax cut should come  
only after the Social Security and Medicare issues are dealt with, 
and that it should be kept modest -- under $300 billion -- so funds 
would be available to strengthen education and defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, in a statement, said Clinton would veto the  
GOP plan because it ``leaves virtually none of these surpluses 
available'' for saving Social Security and Medicare and addressing 
national needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides on Wednesday proposed Social Security ``lock box''  
amendments that precluded the spending of the Social Security 
surplus on anything but saving the pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan, envisioning the biggest tax cut since Ronald  
Reagan's in 1981, would reduce the 15 percent income tax rate to 14 
percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 2005, the new 14 percent 
tax rate would apply to some income that is currently taxed at 28 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It also offers relief from the so-called marriage penalty,  
allows larger contributions to IRA retirement plans, cuts estate 
taxes and provides tax breaks for employer-provided health care, 
interest on student loans and long-term care insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate defeated, on a 60-39 vote, a $290 billion Democratic  
alternative centered on raising the standard deductions for married 
couples, removing more low-income families from the tax rolls, and 
providing tax credits for the care of children and the elderly and 
for education. Six Democrats voted against their party's 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said there should  
be no tax cut until the surpluses predicted by economic forecasts, 
which have been unreliable in the past, become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Mistrust of economic projections was also expressed by a  
bipartisan group of senators, led by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who 
proposed a $500 billion compromise bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan, said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, errs on the side  
of economic caution. People from Maine know, she said, that ``just 
because the calendar says it's spring doesn't mean that you should 
put away the shovel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, however, has so far insisted that it is not  
open to a bill that splits the difference on a tax cut. They won't 
budge off $300 billion, said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle 
of South Dakota. ``There is absolutely no room for compromise on 
that tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who testified before  
the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, was quoted by both sides in 
defending their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats referred to his statement that the nation ``probably  
would be better off holding off on a tax cut'' because the surplus, 
left alone, was healthy for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that Greenspan also made the point that he  
was strongly against using the surplus for new government spending. 
``If that appears to be coming, I would favor tax cuts even in the 
short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats did score one small victory Wednesday, winning a  
procedural vote that would make the tax cuts effective only for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House tax cut plan passed last week on a largely party-line  
vote also outlines $792 billion in tax cuts but has elements not 
contained in the Senate bill, such as an across-the-board 10 
percent tax cut and reductions in the capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Vetoes Outreach Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis broke with his fellow  
Democrats once again Wednesday and vetoed a bill that said outreach 
programs for minorities and women are permissible under a 
voter-approved ban on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative, barred preferential  
treatment based on race or gender in public education, employment 
and contracting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that outreach programs can be fashioned that  
are constitutionally permissible, based on socioeconomic status, 
geographic area or other non-race-based characteristics,'' Davis 
wrote in his veto message. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of outreach that is merit-based, not race-based,  
Davis pointed to his proposal that the University of California 
accept all high school students who graduate in the top 4 percent 
of their classes. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time that Davis has gone against the  
wishes of Democratic lawmakers, who rejoiced six months ago when 
one of their own was sworn in as governor of the nation's most 
populous state. Republicans had held the office for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When Davis won, liberal lawmakers and interest groups  
immediately set about drawing up wish lists on health care, the 
environment, gun control and workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	While some items on the wish lists are now law, several others  
are likely to die. And the governor and the Legislature are 
clashing as bitterly as when California government was divided. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, decimated in last fall's elections, are elated at  
the opposition's infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Davis dumps on Democrats!'' shouted a recent news release from  
the state GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis campaigned as a moderate and declared in his inaugural  
speech, ``It matters not whether an idea comes from a Republican or 
a Democrat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature, on the other hand, is led by lawmakers  
considerably more liberal than he is, and they are whipping their 
bills through the Senate and Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching a wave of legislation approach his desk, Davis has  
employed parliamentary tricks to bottle up health care and other 
bills, angering the Legislature's Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	After they exposed his attempts at stealth maneuvering earlier  
this month, Davis, a former lawmaker himself, lashed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a totally different view of the world than I do,  
totally different,'' Davis said last week. ``Their job is to 
implement my vision. That is their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante framed Davis' challenge this  
way: ``How does a moderate govern without moderates in the 
Legislature?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are reluctant to go on the record with direct  
criticism of their governor, but there has been plenty of 
behind-the-scenes grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has strayed little from his promise to take a centrist  
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	He cut more from health and welfare programs in his budget  
vetoes than from any other area, although the budget he signed also 
includes a 2.3 percent increase for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently satisfied gun-control advocates by signing the  
toughest assault-weapons ban in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis stunned fellow Democrats earlier this year by  
proposing to spend $335 million to build a new prison. Republicans 
applauded the idea, but Senate Leader John Burton said, ``Building 
a prison doesn't make any sense without reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Davis angered Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante by  
sidestepping a decision on whether to kill Proposition 187, the 
1994 voter-approved measure that sought to outlaw most state aid to 
illegal immigrants. Davis instead sent the matter to a federal 
mediator.

<HEADLINE>  NATO's Clark Stepping Down Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has told Gen.  
Wesley Clark, the American commander who led the successful NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, to give up his command two 
months early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a soldier's journey is over, it's over,'' Clark, a  
four-star Army general who is supreme allied commander in Europe, 
said today. He described the action as a routine staff change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very proud of wearing this uniform. I love my job,'' he  
said in Vilnius, Lithuania, after a meeting with Lithuanian 
President Valdas Adamkus, according to Baltic News Service. He 
received word of the change of command Tuesday in a call from Army 
Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart insisted Clark is not  
being punished for blunt assessments of the alliance's strategy in 
Kosovo, and wartime tension with the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is being pushed out, no one is being forced out,''  
Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who had the tough job of molding together a multinational  
NATO military during the 11-week air campaign against Yugoslavia, 
had been scheduled to step aside next July, having just received a 
customary one-year extension of his term as the NATO commander in 
Europe. But the Clinton administration has decided to install Air 
Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston's current appointment expires in February and to avoid  
an automatic reduction in rank upon leaving a Joint Chiefs post, 
his appointment as European commander must become effective in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift in Clark's schedule, approved by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen, comes a month after NATO ended the air campaign over 
Yugoslavia and its province of Kosovo, having forced the Belgrade 
government to halt its repressive campaign against an ethnic 
Albanian-Muslim population in the southern province. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters today at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Cohen  
said he regarded Clark highly and attributed his early replacement 
to a matter of timing rather than a measure of Clark's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked for the same qualities that General Clark had in  
serving in his capacity as commander as the European forces,'' 
Cohen said. ``I see the same qualities in General Ralston, namely 
diplomatic skills, his ... war record as such and the capability of 
serving in that capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters in Rome  
that ``General Clark has done a tremendous job in the whole 
military campaign in Kosovo ... he was able to navigate through 
some very difficult decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's done a great job at a time when NATO was asked to  
do something that it had not done for 48 years, which is to carry 
on an active military operation,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the House Armed  
Services Committee, criticized the Pentagon treatment of Clark and 
proposed that he be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. ``We 
should show greater respect to the person who led our most 
successful and largest military operation in almost a decade,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, interviewed by telephone from Brussels, told The  
Washington Post, ``I'm not going to speculate on what opportunities 
might be available in public life or private life. There is a long 
time yet to do this job, and I've got to keep my attention on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid much criticism and against widespread doubt, the air  
campaign succeeded in compelling Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo and halt the ground 
campaign against the Kosovo Albanians. A NATO peacekeeping force is 
now in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark served not only as the commander of U.S. forces in Europe  
but also as the supreme commander of all NATO forces, a post 
requiring approval not only of President Clinton but of 18 NATO 
allies. The general's relationship with Cohen has been more distant 
than that of some of the other U.S. field commanders, according to 
one of the defense officials. Cohen has largely relied on Shelton 
to relay commands and instructions to Clark, a senior defense 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Clark argued in private councils that NATO  
leave open the option of using ground troops in the Kosovo 
campaign, something Cohen vehemently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	A second defense official dismissed any suggestion that the  
administration was unhappy with Clark's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton apparently decided to inform Clark quickly, before word  
leaked out, and the general, who was traveling in Europe on 
Tuesday, agreed to yield his post two months early to accommodate 
Ralston. The defense officials said Shelton wanted to give Ralston 
plenty of lead time to gain approval from Clinton and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston was himself initially a candidate for chairman of the  
Joint Chiefs, but word of a past marital infidelity coming amidst 
widespread publicity about strict military rules against adultery 
raised sufficient political pressure to halt Ralston's promotion to 
the nation's top military post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the administration is not worried that Ralston's  
past difficulties will derail his NATO posting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to move forward, and I don't think we would move  
forward if we were not confident,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions with Ralph Stanley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Country Music Hall of Fame has yet  
to elect bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley as a member. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the stature of Stanley in American music that the  
oversight reflects more on the Hall of Fame than on the tenor 
vocalist and banjo player. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley, 72, isn't a regular cast member of the Grand Ole Opry  
radio show, either. That's despite the Opry being the most famous 
forum for his rustic brand of music. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, it is the Opry that diminishes itself by not having  
Stanley in the fold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not many people that they call bluegrass musicians in  
the Country Music Hall of Fame,'' Stanley explained. ``Bill Monroe 
and, I guess, Flatt and Scruggs might be in it. ... Maybe someday I 
will. I just hope I live to enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe, who died in 1996, is perhaps the only bluegrass  
performer more revered than Stanley. When Bob Dylan recorded a duet 
with Stanley in 1998, he called it ``the highlight of my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in the mountains of Virginia, Stanley teamed  
with his brother Carter in 1946 after they came home from World War 
II. The Stanley Brothers, second only to Monroe's Blue Grass Boys, 
lasted through the rock 'n' roll craze to re-emerge in the 1960s as 
part of the folk music boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter Stanley, the lead singer, songwriter and front man of the  
act, died of cancer in 1966. Ralph Stanley carried on, and future 
country stars like Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley have passed 
through his band The Clinch Mountain Boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down to Earth,'' a new documentary on Stanley's life directed  
by Herbie Smith, is currently being screened at film festivals. 
Stanley still tours regularly, and he is recording a duet album 
with country singer Jim Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Ralph Stanley II, 20, is Stanley's current lead singer  
and is poised to continue the tradition of the Stanley Brothers 
into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked how long he intends to keep performing, Stanley  
replied, ``We play 150 to 160 shows a year, and the way I feel 
right now, I don't have any intentions of stopping. ... as long as 
I'm able to carry on and give the music justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. I understand you're not entirely comfortable with the  
``bluegrass'' label for your music. Why? 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: Well, I really don't know what bluegrass music is.  
There's so many people playing it now and playing it different 
styles. If there's a banjo and a mandolin in it, they call it 
bluegrass. When I think of bluegrass music, I think of Bill Monroe. 
... I have a completely different style. I call my music old-time 
mountain country music. Actually, back years ago when I first 
started, they called it hillbilly music, and of course it spread 
out from the hills and it's national and international now. I thank 
the Lord for giving me the voice that he did that it just rings out 
of the mountains. It's got a mountain sound to it. 
</P>
<P>
	2. What were the early Stanley Brothers shows like?  
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: I remember, I believe, the first night we played. There  
were four of us and we made $2.50 apiece for a show. But after that 
we got a show on WCYB (radio) in Bristol (Va). It was called `Farm 
and Fun Time.' After that we would pack every school or theater or 
wherever we went to. There were so many (offers) that came in that 
we couldn't handle them all. 
</P>
<P>
	3. How was your relationship with Bill Monroe?  
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: We thought the world of Bill Monroe. We wanted to make  
a living at it just like he was, but it seemed like at first he 
didn't care for us. When we signed with Columbia Records, why Bill 
was on Columbia, too. And he told them that if they signed the 
Stanley Brothers that he would leave! And so they signed us, and he 
left. But afterward, Bill and we were the best of friends. Carter 
worked a little while with Bill in his band, and he's helped me 
record on my records and I've helped him, and for years and years 
we were the best of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	4. I understand Elvis Presley and rock 'n' roll finished off  
many bluegrass acts. How did the Stanley Brothers cope? 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: It just about paralyzed music like ours. I'm proud we  
survived. We just had to cut down on everything. Carter and me 
owned a car together. We couldn't afford a car apiece. We went to a 
lot of places and the people just didn't have the money to come out 
'cause times were sort of hard in the '50s, too, especially in the 
country where we were playing. We just hung in there. 
</P>
<P>
	4 1/2. A more personal setback came with the death of Carter in  
1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: Yeah. Carter did all the (lead singing), all the  
announcing and Carter wrote most of the songs. He sort of left it 
up to me to do the bookings and the book work, sort of behind the 
scenes. I really didn't know whether I could handle it without him. 
But I bet I got a thousand cards and letters and phone calls that 
said, `Ralph, don't quit.' We had our band together, and all I had 
to hire was a lead singer. Carter and me traveled together 20 
years. And now I've been on the road on my own for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	5. It must be a thrill having your lead singer be a Stanley  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley: I took (Ralph Stanley II) out of school at 16 and I got  
a homebound teacher that taught him and he graduated with his 
class. And he's holding down the lead (vocals) and rhythm guitar 
playing right now as good as any man I've ever had since my brother 
Carter passed away. I'm certainly proud.

<HEADLINE> ABC Adding Minorities to TV Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ABC, which has been criticized along  
with other major networks for planning nearly all-white fall 
series, is adding ethnic characters to at least five shows. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC executives said they began the effort to make their programs  
more inclusive in May, before the NAACP and other groups condemned 
TV's lack of racial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we have an obligation to reflect society as it  
exists,'' Stu Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment Television Group 
co-chairman, told the Television Critics Association on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As presented in pilot form this spring, none of the 27 new  
comedies and dramas set to premiere on the top four networks had 
minorities in a leading role; few had them in supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority characters are being added to ABC's ``Wasteland,'' a  
new drama about young New Yorkers, and to ``Once and Again,'' from 
``thirtysomething'' creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Upcoming ABC shows ``Talk to Me'' and ``Bellevue'' will gain  
ethnic characters, as will returning series ``Sabrina.'' The 
sitcom's two new characters will include a Hispanic woman, the 
network said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses said producers were  
asked to look for opportunities to diversify their casts but were 
not issued a directive to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting a very long time for this and it's a step  
in the right direction,'' said Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the 
National Council of La Raza. The council and other Latino groups on 
Tuesday demanded more Hispanic representation on TV and called for 
a weeklong boycott of the four major networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. population is 11 percent Hispanic, but Hispanics make  
up less than 2 percent of the characters on primetime TV shows, Ms. 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People announced a new initiative to monitor how well the 
entertainment industry reflects America's ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Ban Mulled on Net Drug Directions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instructions for making the illegal drug  
methamphetamine are easy to get from the Internet, witnesses told a 
Senate panel considering a ban on online drug recipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Doerge, Newton County sheriff in southwestern Missouri, on  
Wednesday showed senators a chemical-stained sheaf of meth-making 
instructions a teen-ager had copied from an Internet site he looked 
up using a public library's computer. The boy used the directions 
to make methamphetamine several times before he was caught, Doerge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to eliminate these recipes from the Internet,'' Doerge  
told the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering 
legislation that would try to ban such instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Methamphetamine became a serious problem during the 1990s,  
particularly in the Southwest and Midwest, said Donnie Marshall, 
acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He said the 
drug comes from two sources: Mexican cartels that make large 
quantities in Mexico or the United States and thousands of smaller, 
independent labs using procedures detailed on dozens of Internet 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed ban on publishing drug-making instructions is part  
of a larger anti-methamphetamine bill sponsored by Sen. Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, the committee's chairman. Other provisions include 
increased penalties for methamphetamine makers whose clandestine 
labs pollute the environment and more federal help to local police 
battling drug labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said Wednesday the committee would combine his proposal  
with several other anti-methamphetamine measures from both 
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Free-speech advocates say the proposal to ban drug recipes would  
be unconstitutional and nearly unenforceable on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is, this is speech. It is not the making of drugs,  
it is just a description of how drugs are made,'' said Shari 
Steele, staff lawyer for the San Francisco-based Electronic 
Frontier Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, U.S. law would not affect Internet sites based in  
other countries, so banning the posting of drug-making information 
in this country would not eliminate such information from the 
Internet, Steele said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Clearing Way for Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee  
approved a dozen new ambassadors and a new director for the foreign 
aid agency Wednesday. The Senate Democratic leader said he expects 
confirmation of Richard Holbrooke as U.N. ambassador next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, headed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who has held  
up several nominations in past disputes with the Clinton 
administration, approved the postings in a brief session. 
</P>
<P>
	They included J. Brady Anderson to be administrator for the  
Agency for International Development, which Helms wanted to 
consolidated into the State Department. Anderson is a former 
Arkansas assistant attorney general who speaks Swahili and has 
served as ambassador to Tanzania 
</P>
<P>
	He will succeed J. Brian Atwood, who withdrew as a nominee to be  
ambassador to Brazil as a result of the tussle with Helms over AID 
reorganization. Atwood will continue as coordinator for aid to 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other nominations Helms' committee approved unanimously  
was that of A. Peter Burleigh to be ambassador to the Philippines. 
Burleigh has been filling in as acting U.N. ambassador, awaiting 
Senate confirmation of Holbrooke to succeed Bill Richardson, who 
has become energy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Wednesday Holbrooke's  
nomination probably would go to a Senate vote next week, although a 
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said possible 
obstacles remain. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four GOP senators, including Lott, had placed ``holds''  
on the Holbrooke nomination, although pressure was growing from the 
Clinton administration and from some Republican senators to fill 
the critical post with Holbrooke, the former assistant secretary of 
state who brokered the peace agreement in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, D-S.D., said Lott told him the vote will occur before  
lawmakers leave on their summer recess at the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has indicated that it will probably take some debate time  
and a vote,'' Daschle told reporters. ``I certainly appreciate the 
need to do that, given the opposition on his side, in some cases, 
to Mr. Holbrooke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said the majority leader recently  
discussed the Holbrooke nomination with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have three ifs,'' Czwartacki said, listing the need for  
Democrats to cooperate on getting other work done, concerns of Sen. 
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who objects to State Department treatment 
of a whistleblower, and the possibility of any new information on 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're met, there'll be a vote,'' Czwartacki said.  
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's nomination has been stalled for more than a year,  
initially by the White House because of ethical questions about 
some of his actions as an investment banker. The Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee unanimously approved the nomination June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia joined two other  
lawmakers recently in urging senators to abandon the holds. Senate 
rules allow any senator to block a nomination even without 
revealing the reason, which often has nothing to do with the 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, said he had  
been told by Pentagon briefers that the continued lack of U.S. 
leadership at the United Nations increased the risks of the Balkans 
peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
	On other nominations, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  
approved Michael A. Sheehan to be coordinator for counterterrorism 
and William B. Taylor Jr. to hold the rank of ambassador in his 
current post as coordinator for aid to the former Soviet states. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ambassadorial postings approved were J. Richard Fredericks  
for Switzerland; Robert S. Gelbard, Indonesia; Barbara J. 
Griffiths, Iceland; Richard Monroe Miles, Bulgaria; Carl 
Spielvogel, Slovakia; Sylvia Gaye Stanfield, Brunei; and M. Osman 
Siddique, Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mark McGwire was ejected for arguing a  
called third strike in the fourth inning of the St. Louis 
Cardinals' game Wednesday against the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who leads the major leagues with 37 homers, was called  
out on strikes on a full count and then was ejected by plate umpire 
Greg Bonin after arguing for about 10 seconds.

<P>
	McGwire tossed his batting gloves into the stands as he left the  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time McGwire has been ejected since he was

<HEADLINE> Fed Plans Computer Security Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is planning to  
create a government-wide security network to protect the nation's 
most important computer systems from hackers, thieves, terrorists 
and hostile countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups complain that the security tools also  
would make possible unprecedented electronic monitoring, especially 
because of the increasingly widespread use of computers by the 
government in almost every aspect of its citizens' daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The 148-page proposal describes building an elaborate network of  
electronic obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch for 
potentially suspicious activity on federal computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 500 intrusion monitors would be installed on  
nonmilitary government computers next year, according to a draft 
copy of the proposal obtained by The Associated Press. The full 
system would be completed by May 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also suggests ways to convince private companies to  
monitor their corporate computer networks and share information 
about threats, although it says the government will not force 
companies to permit federal monitoring of their systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicts federal spending on computer security to  
increase to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a cover letter, President Clinton warned that a ``concerted  
attack on the computers of any one of our key economic sectors or 
governmental agencies could have catastrophic effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Where once our opponents relied exclusively on bombs and  
bullets, hostile powers and terrorists can now turn a laptop 
computer into a potent weapon capable of doing enormous damage,'' 
Clinton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was described within the report as ``Version 1.0,''  
and it pledged that no proposal would ``infringe on civil 
liberties, privacy rights or proprietary information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about protecting privacy rights,''  
Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Wednesday 
at the White House. ``But there is also a privacy right in not 
having hostile entities attack systems. We're not only talking 
about 17-year-old kids in their basement. We're talking about 
governments that we know are developing systems to get access to 
our computer systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups said the plan was ill-advised  
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a privacy perspective, it means scrutinizing millions of  
legitimate interactions with the government looking for the 
extremely rare illegal activity,'' said James Dempsey of the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology. ``Trying to 
calibrate the size of the holes in the strainer you're using is 
very hard. Nobody has figured out how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey and others complained that the security network could,  
for example, inadvertently forward to the FBI's National 
Infrastructure Protection Center a citizen's innocent -- but somehow 
anomalous -- electronic message. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when they detect something they deem  
suspicious?'' asked David Sobel of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center. ``Is there a wiretap placed on his 
phone? Is his e-mail intercepted? ... The perceived threat has been 
very much overblown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, whose Senate committee will hold a  
hearing on cyberterrorism Thursday, said he planned to ask White 
House officials about the plan. He said the question about 
monitoring citizens ``always has to be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, concerns about invasion of privacy are  
often overblown,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, head of the FBI's computer center, declined to  
comment through a spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Group Watch for Hate Fliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- A leader of a Jewish group said armed  
volunteers will patrol a neighborhood where hate fliers were 
distributed recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Herschel Dickter, security director of the local chapter of the  
Jewish Defense League, said as many as 20 volunteers will drive 
through the Emerald Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaflets were recently left at many homes in the predominantly  
Jewish community. The fliers were signed by The World Church of the 
Creator, which made headlines earlier this month when a follower 
was charged with going on a shooting spree in the Midwest. The 
gunman killed a black man and an Asian man, and injured more than a 
dozen others before shooting himself to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Local World Church leader Jules Fettu of West Palm Beach is on  
trial on charges he and several other members attacked a Cuban-born 
man and his son outside a concert in Sunrise in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickter said the armed volunteers will remain ``as long as  
necessary.'' The last time the area was leafletted, in February 
1998, he said they patrolled for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Lt. Chad Wagner said the department is  
concerned about armed vigilantism. He said Dickter told him late 
Tuesday the volunteers would be unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale was unable to reach Dickter  
to confirm Wagner's report.

<HEADLINE> Low-Fat Diet, Dementia Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Researchers studying dementia say they have  
uncovered a possible health benefit to the relatively fatty Western 
diet, but they caution against changing eating habits based on the 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
	A study funded by the National Institute on Aging and the  
Department of Veterans Affairs found that a diet high in animal fat 
and protein may protect against the onset of dementia in people who 
have suffered a stroke. The study was published in the July 22 
issue of the journal Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are the latest from an ongoing study of  
cardiovascular disease that began in 1965 and initially involved 
more than 8,000 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than half the participants of the Honolulu Heart Program  
are still living. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study, begun in 1991, is 
a part of the program that deals with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers compared the dietary preferences of 68 study  
participants who had developed dementia as a result of a stroke 
with the preferences of 106 participants who had had a stroke but 
were not suffering from dementia, and 3,335 participants who had 
had neither a stroke nor dementia. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that those who preferred a Western diet -- higher in  
animal fat and protein and lower in complex carbohydrates than a 
traditional Asian diet -- were roughly 57 percent less likely to 
develop dementia after a stroke. They also found a lower incidence 
of stroke-related dementia in people who took vitamin E 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Study participants, born between 1900 and 1919, answered  
questions about their food preferences when the study began in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shouldn't be interpreted as advice to go and get in line  
at the Burger King or McDonald's,'' said Dr. G. Webster Ross, 
co-principal investigator of the aging study and a neurologist with 
the Honolulu VA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the study did not determine exactly what foods and  
nutrients in the Western diet may be most important in preventing 
dementia after a stroke. Future research will attempt to do that, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ross said studies in animals suggest that higher amounts of  
animal fat and protein in the diet may contribute to better 
stability of blood vessel walls in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke-related, or vascular, dementia is the nation's  
second-leading cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, which 
afflicts about 4 million people in the United States. An estimated 
1 million to 2 million people in the United States suffer from 
vascular dementia, a deterioration of emotional and cognitive 
abilities that can affect memory, language, reasoning and 
personality traits. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Helen Petrovitch, co-principal investigator of the Honolulu  
aging study, said the study accounted for previously known factors 
related to dementia such as age and education. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest prevalence of dementia was found in the oldest study  
participants. The study also found that controlling hypertension, 
diabetes and other risk factors could help prevent strokes and 
vascular dementia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said that by studying the same group of first- and  
second-generation Japanese-Americans over three decades, 
researchers have been able to compare environmental and cultural 
differences between the United States and Japan while keeping 
genetic factors constant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Mortimer, director of the Institute on Aging at the  
University of South Florida in Tampa, called the Honolulu findings 
``very interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know it's the first time that anyone has looked at  
the issue this way. People have looked at diet and stroke, but no 
one has looked at diet and (stroke-related) dementia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortimer said the findings may be related to the fact that the  
relatively high-salt Japanese diet is associated with an increased 
stroke risk. High salt consumption is related to hypertension, a 
common factor in strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	University of South Florida epidemiology professor Amy  
Borenstein Graves, who is married to Mortimer, said the study adds 
an intriguing twist to her own finding that the general Japanese 
lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. She 
said she hasn't studied the impact of diet, specifically. 
</P>
<P>
	Borenstein Graves has collaborated with the Honolulu-Asia Aging  
Study as co-principal investigator of the Ni-Hon-Sea Project, a 
broader dementia research effort involving Japanese and 
Japanese-American populations in Seattle, Honolulu and Hiroshima, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting study because it's one of several new  
studies showing an association between dementia and Japanese 
lifestyle,'' Borenstein Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said until more is known, people with low-fat diets  
should not eat more fat based on the findings because they could 
increase their risk of heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Americans Stun Cubans in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- For the first time in 12 years, the  
U.S. baseball team beat the world champion Cubans, scoring five 
runs in the ninth inning Wednesday for a 10-5 victory at the Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States did it with a group of minor leaguers, few of  
whom are top major league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	One player who will get a long look from the highest level,  
though, is Marcus Jensen. His three-run homer broke a 5-5 tie and 
helped the Americans clinch a berth in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also soothed some of the pain from an opening 7-6  
loss to Canada, a game the Americans led 6-3 in the 11th inning. 
And it showed the United States has as good a shot as anyone to 
make the baseball finals here, which would secure a berth in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Cubans, who split two exhibition games with the  
Baltimore Orioles earlier this year, it was a stunning defeat. 
Their last loss to the United States was on July 4, 1996, 8-4 in 
Norfolk, Va., during a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last significant loss was in the 1987 Pan Ams at  
Indianapolis, a 6-4 American win in the preliminary round. Cuba 
went on to win the gold there, beating the Americans in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the U.S. team led almost all the way. When Cuba tied  
it 3-3, Craig Paquette's two-run homer in seventh gave the 
Americans another lead. But Cuba's Isacc Martinez hit a wind-aided, 
two-out two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. right fielder Peter Bergeron then made a key play when he  
threw out a potential go-ahead run at the plate after an overthrow 
down the right field line. German Mesa tried to score from first on 
the play and the throw to catcher Jensen left the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette led off the ninth with a single and Milton Bradley  
bunted. Paquette was called out at second on a throw from pitcher 
Maels Rodriguez, even though Mesa bobbled the ball. U.S. manager 
Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Zuber then walked and Jensen, who hit two home runs in a  
victory over Mexico on Tuesday, delivered his long shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Dave Roberts and Adam Kennedy made it  
10-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Defections and ejections were the story elsewhere, and Olympic  
gold medalist Donovan Bailey finally showed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more Cubans -- a shooter and softball coach -- have sought  
asylum in Canada, according to sources close to the Cuban team. 
They left the delegation earlier this week, said the sources, who 
would not provide their names. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third and fourth Cubans to seek asylum at the  
games. Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before 
the games got started. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde 
also has sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive 
as media attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer turned ugly when police had to rush in to rescue referee  
Rich Grady, who ejected four Guatemalans and both coaches in 
Canada's 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players from Guatemala rushed toward a retreating Grady  
following the final ejection. His assistants and several police 
officers formed a circle around Grady, and they waited for the 
field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, the Pan Ams poster boy who has been roundly criticized  
for not running in the 100 meters, ran on the opening leg of 
Canada's 400 relay team in Wednesday's semifinals and helped his 
team record the fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe my teammates,'' said Bailey, who does not feel he owed  
anything more to the games' organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion in the 100. ``I'm not stung by 
the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the lone early track final, Cuba's Magalys Garcia won the  
women's heptathlon with 6,290 points. Americans Shelia Burrell and 
Nicole Haynes finished 2-3.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed To Invest in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The U.S. aerospace company Lockheed Martin Corp.  
has agreed to invest $68 million in Russia's Khrunichev Space 
Center to develop a new line of rockets for commercial launches, 
news reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angara family of rockets will include light, medium and  
heavy rockets, said Anatoly Kiselyov, director general of the 
Russian center, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angara rocket will be more powerful than the Proton rocket,  
which is used for many launches. The Angara will be capable of 
lifting cargoes as heavy as 6 tons into geostationary orbit and up 
to 30 tons in lower orbits, Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's cash-strapped space industry has been trying to  
increase its number of commercial launches, and has been working 
with some Western firms, including Lockheed Martin.

<HEADLINE>  UCLA Players Get Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine of 14 UCLA football players accused of  
illegally possessing handicapped parking permits pleaded no contest 
today and were sentenced to 200 hours of community service, fines 
and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arraignment of the other five players was delayed to Aug. 25.  
Two of those players were away at the Washington Redskins and San 
Francisco 49ers training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	A Municipal Court judge ordered that half the community service  
be done with the Special Olympics. The other 100 hours were 
assigned to various charities, groups dealing with cerebral palsy, 
multiple sclerosis, and the parks and recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
	The court dismissed one of the two counts that had been filed  
against each. 
</P>
<P>
	All were fined $500 apiece and also ordered to pay $100 in  
restitution as well as other penalties and assessments. All were 
given 24 months probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion who now is a  
Special Olympics board member, was present at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told  
me that and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of 
them,'' Johnson said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were said to have used the placards to avoid paying  
for parking on campus or in the area around the UCLA campus, where 
parking problems are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of 6 months in  
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The case sparked outrage among advocacy groups for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began Jan. 16 when a UCLA police officer  
spotted a car with an improperly placed handicapped placard. The 
driver told the officer he had borrowed the placard from a football 
player, and an investigation was launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen defendants were each charged with a count of illegally  
possessing a handicapped placard and a count of giving false 
information to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. One 
person allegedly obtained two placards so he was charged with four 
misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than an embarrassment to UCLA, which starts its  
football season on Sept. 4, because several of the defendants are 
starters or key reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo had said the players also would be disciplined  
by him, but he was on vacation and unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The players allegedly submitted applications to the DMV with the  
signatures, addresses and medical license numbers of nonexistent 
physicians. They listed a litany of complaints: knee injuries, back 
injuries, back surgery, a torn ligament, Bell's Palsy, asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	All the claims were bogus, said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the  
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuse of the handicapped parking law is not uncommon, officials  
said, although usually it involves simply taking the parking space 
or using the permit of a friend or relative.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Will Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fourteen UCLA football players plan to plead  
guilty to illegally possessing handicapped parking permits and will 
be sentenced to do community service with the disabled and pay 
fines, a source said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which was to be finalized before a hearing Wednesday,  
calls for the players to work with the Special Olympics and other 
groups dealing with the physically handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion who now is a  
Special Olympics board member, helped to negotiate for the players 
and will appear at their plea hearing, according to the source, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Each player will be required to do 200 hours -- or five weeks --  
of service and will receive a fine of $150, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The football players allegedly used the placards to avoid paying  
for parking on campus or in the area around UCLA, where parking 
problems are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players is expected to speak in court, representing  
the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, deputy city attorney Brian Williams, confirmed  
that negotiations were under way toward pleas that would involve 
probation, community service and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a strong likelihood that there will be a  
disposition,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of 6 months in  
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The case sparked outrage among advocacy groups for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
	The players are expected to express remorse for their actions.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began Jan. 16 when a UCLA police officer  
spotted a car with an improperly placed handicapped placard, Mike 
Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney, said. The driver told

<HEADLINE> Surgeon General Focuses on Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suicide, once only whispered about, must be  
boldly confronted by the nation's parents and children, doctors and 
schools, baseball coaches and hairdressers, Surgeon General David 
Satcher said Wednesday as he declared suicide a serious national 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death, claiming about  
30,000 lives each year. That compares with fewer than 19,000 
homicides. And more than a half million Americans attempt suicide 
each year but survive. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should not be afraid or ashamed to seek help,'' Satcher  
said, putting his first stamp on mental health issues. ``Suicide is 
a serious public health problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He issued 15 public recommendations for increasing awareness  
about suicide, stepping up research and encouraging intervention 
with people at risk. Early next year, Satcher plans to present a 
``national strategy'' toward suicide prevention that will offer 
more specific ideas for helping particular groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Older Americans, particularly men, are most likely to take their  
own lives. Also at heightened risk are American Indians and gay and 
lesbian youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher plans a full report reviewing the science and treatments  
for mental illness, a first for the surgeon general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife and a longtime advocate  
for mental health issues, joined Satcher to release the report and 
said that too often, mental illness leads to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of Americans and their families face mental illness,  
often alone and sometimes in fear. Too often suicide is the 
result,'' said Mrs. Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents, teachers and others who interact with people at risk of  
suicide often do not realize that they can help, the report 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	Doris Smith of Atlanta, whose 27-year-old son committed suicide,  
agreed. ``I did not know depression was a disease that could be 
treated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims also need to be educated that depression and other  
mental illnesses are treatable, said Christopher Marshall, 37, who 
suffered from panic attacks that nobody seemed to understand. He 
spoke of one day in the summer of 1994 when he walked into his 
father's Wardtown, Va., farm with his father's shotgun in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried as I walked and wondered how I got to this place. I  
believed there was no other way to end this nightmare,'' he said. 
But somehow, he said, he was able to ``grasp the faintest notion'' 
that there could be hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tears streamed down my face and I put the gun down,'' he said.  
``Suicide is preventable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., whose father shot himself to death in  
1972, said that hearings are planned for this fall in the Senate 
Appropriations health subcommittee. Advocates hope it will be an 
important step toward getting more money and attention to the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Reid encouraged Americans to talk about the issue,  
saying it took him 24 years to speak about his father's death in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's report grew out of a conference on suicide  
prevention in Reno, Nev., last October. Some 450 experts compiled 
81 recommendations. Fifteen of them were picked for immediate 
implementation because they had the strongest science behind them, 
could be implemented with current resources and could be done 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of them involve educating the public to recognize when  
someone seems at risk of suicide and how to get that person help. 
That includes doctors and nurses, but also clergy, coaches and 
hairdressers -- anyone who is likely to hear about someone's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the administration announced that the Ronald  
McDonald House Charities are paying to distribute a PBS video 
called ``Depression: On the Edge'' to school counselors to help 
them detect teen depression. Mrs. Gore and Satcher are also working 
with the Ad Council and MTV to develop a campaign reducing the 
stigma of mental illness. That isn't expected until late this year 
or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Department of Health and Human Services plans to work  
with organizations like Meals on Wheels to identify people who may 
be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recommendations include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Educating the public that suicide is preventable and working to  
diminish stigma of mental illness, substance abuse and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Helping primary care doctors and nurses learn how to recognize  
and treat depression, substance abuse and other mental problems 
associated with suicide, and increasing referrals to specialists 
when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Working with news and entertainment media to present balanced  
portrayals of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing research on suicide risk and prevention programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--Formally evaluating suicide prevention programs to determine  
what works.

<HEADLINE> GOP Women Counter Tax Cut Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican women in Congress sent an angry  
letter to President Clinton on Wednesday taking issue with 
administration assertions that tax cuts proposed by Republicans 
could hurt women. 
</P>
<P>
	``In your misleading attempt to alarm women, you also are  
missing the critical facts about the realities women face today,'' 
wrote 12 female House members and one senator, Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchinson of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men and  
making 80 percent of all consumer decisions for families. As a 
result, women rely on tax relief more than men do,'' according to 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	At public events on Tuesday, the president, first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore charged that a $792 
billion Republican tax cut proposal could hurt women by using up 
government surpluses the administration wants for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration cited a study showing that women rely more on  
Medicare -- the nation's health insurance program for the elderly 
and disabled -- than men do because women, on average, live longer 
and have lower incomes than men. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter, the lawmakers listed parts of the GOP tax  
proposal they said could particularly help women. One would let 
people over age 50 contribute more to tax-exempt retirement savings 
plans. Women are more likely to fall behind on contributions when 
they are younger and take time off from work to rear children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working to do all this with respect for women so they  
can keep more of their hard earned dollars to gain independence and 
control their own future,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also noted that Republicans have committed to setting  
aside $2 trillion in surpluses expected to come from Social 
Security taxes over the next decade in order to help shore up 
federal retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hutchinson and Dunn, the lawmakers signing the  
letter were Reps. Mary Bono of California, Nancy Johnson of 
Connecticut, Tillie Fowler of Florida, Judy Biggert of Illinois, 
Anne Northup of Kentucky, Jo Ann Emerson of Missouri, Heather 
Wilson of New Mexico, Sue Myrick of North Carolina, Deborah Pryce 
of Ohio, Kay Granger of Texas, and Barbara Cubin of Wyoming.

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires appear to be big losers after  
the collapse of their threatened walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 68 major league umpires will lose their  
jobs, even after the withdrawal of all resignations Tuesday, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said. That's because the American 
and National leagues already have hired 25 replacements from the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the wrong strategy,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh  
insisted. ``I wish we weren't put in the situation where we had to 
do it. It's kind of like taking a hammer to hit someone as opposed 
to tapping them on the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials, 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires escalated their labor battle with baseball on July  
14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy began 
to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Froemming, a senior NL umpire who helped hire union head  
Richie Phillips in 1979, was angry that some umps didn't back the 
union stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' he said. ``Obviously they  
think they're going to get a better deal somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over with yet. Our contract doesn't expire until Dec.  
31, so we will go on through the year and then negotiate a new 
deal,'' NL umpire Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's 
Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file, said nothing had 
been received by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball lawyers said they expect a battle among the  
divided umpires on whether Phillips, the umpires' lawyer since 
1978, will be in charge of negotiations this offseason for a new 
labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need solidarity,'' NL umpire Angel Hernandez said. ``I'm  
sure there will be turmoil down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union's president, said that  
Phillips will remain in charge because umpires voted 49-14 last 
spring in favor of giving him a five-year contract. Crawford also 
said it was too early to term the strategy a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't categorize it until after everything is all said and  
done,'' Crawford said. ``We were asked by a federal judge to 
withdraw our resignations to de-escalate the situation. We complied 
with what he asked. It is now in the hands of a judicial proceeding 
and we are willing to wait for the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, and 56 of the 68 umpires submitted 
resignation letters the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their  
resignations. The rest of the withdrawals were sent to the leagues 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires decided on the resignation strategy because they feared  
owners would lock them out when their labor contract expires Dec. 
31, and the agreement contains a no-strike clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Mark  
Hirschbeck, who never quit, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, who 
withdrew their resignations last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're saying is with the people they've hired, minor  
leaguers and the guys that jumped ship, they've got 13 guys, so 
they need 23 to fill out the staff,'' Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, one of the most respected and well-liked umpires in the  
game, said the split among the umpires doomed the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the guys don't stick together, I don't care what kind of  
time you've got, it's not going to work,'' he said. ``I'm 100 
percent behind Richie Phillips. He got us here. He got us 
everything we have. He's been loyal to us for 22 years. It's a 
shame the guys aren't loyal toward him.''

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires appear to be big losers after  
the collapse of their threatened walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 68 major league umpires will lose their  
jobs, even after the withdrawal of all resignations Tuesday, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said. That's because the American 
and National leagues already have hired 25 replacements from the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the wrong strategy,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh  
insisted. ``I wish we weren't put in the situation where we had to 
do it. It's kind of like taking a hammer to hit someone as opposed 
to tapping them on the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials, 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires escalated their labor battle with baseball on July  
14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy began 
to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Froemming, a senior NL umpire who helped hire union head  
Richie Phillips in 1979, was angry that some umps didn't back the 
union stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' he said. ``Obviously they  
think they're going to get a better deal somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over with yet. Our contract doesn't expire until Dec.  
31, so we will go on through the year and then negotiate a new 
deal,'' NL umpire Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's 
Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file, said nothing had 
been received by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Several baseball lawyers said they expect a battle among the  
divided umpires on whether Phillips, the umpires' lawyer since 
1978, will be in charge of negotiations this offseason for a new 
labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need solidarity,'' NL umpire Angel Hernandez said. ``I'm  
sure there will be turmoil down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Jerry Crawford, the union's president, said that  
Phillips will remain in charge because umpires voted 49-14 last 
spring in favor of giving him a five-year contract. Crawford also 
said it was too early to term the strategy a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't categorize it until after everything is all said and  
done,'' Crawford said. ``We were asked by a federal judge to 
withdraw our resignations to de-escalate the situation. We complied 
with what he asked. It is now in the hands of a judicial proceeding 
and we are willing to wait for the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, and 56 of the 68 umpires submitted 
resignation letters the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their  
resignations. The rest of the withdrawals were sent to the leagues 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires decided on the resignation strategy because they feared  
owners would lock them out when their labor contract expires Dec. 
31, and the agreement contains a no-strike clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Mark  
Hirschbeck, who never quit, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, who 
withdrew their resignations last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're saying is with the people they've hired, minor  
leaguers and the guys that jumped ship, they've got 13 guys, so 
they need 23 to fill out the staff,'' Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, one of the most respected and well-liked umpires in the  
game, said the split among the umpires doomed the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the guys don't stick together, I don't care what kind of  
time you've got, it's not going to work,'' he said. ``I'm 100 
percent behind Richie Phillips. He got us here. He got us 
everything we have. He's been loyal to us for 22 years. It's a 
shame the guys aren't loyal toward him.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Mull Low-Flow Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some members of Congress want to flush away a  
federal law that requires new toilets to use less water. 
</P>
<P>
	The new low-flow commodes are intended to save water, but some  
lawmakers complained Tuesday that you have to flush again -- and 
maybe again -- to rinse all waste out of the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1992 conservation law requires less water for any new toilets  
installed in homes, along with lighter sprays in shower heads. New 
toilets are limited to 1.6 gallons of water per flush; the older 
toilets allowed 3.5 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., author of legislation to repeal  
the law, testified before a House subcommittee that he has received 
thousands of complaints ``from disgruntled consumers who are angry 
that their new toilets repeatedly clog, require multiple flushing, 
and in the end do not save water.'' Dozens of those complaints were 
written on toilet paper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their message is clear and straightforward: Get the federal  
government out of my bathroom,'' Knollenberg told the House 
Commerce Committee's subcommittee on energy and power. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said he  
supported the repeal legislation and hoped to move it forward. 
</P>
<P>
	However, other lawmakers said water was a scarce resource that  
must be conserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said the low-flow toilets also would  
``reduce the amount of dollars this country has to spend on waste 
treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers say they have improved low-flow toilets in recent  
years. The Plumbing Manufacturers Institute wants to keep the 
standard, since manufacturers have invested in retooling for the 
1.6-gallon toilets and could be subjected to a patchwork of state 
and local ordinances without it. 
</P>
<P>
	George Whalen, of the National Association of  
Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors, told lawmakers that flushing 
toilets account for nearly 40 percent of all water consumed by an 
average household. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day we flush more than 5 billion gallons of water down  
the drain,'' Whalen said, adding: ``Switching to water-efficient 
plumbing fixtures could save the average household as much as $50 
to $100 a year on water and wastewater treatment bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the plunger has become a regular bathroom fixture for  
frustrated toilets owners who are not exactly bowled over by the 
new commodes, home builders testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard of new home owners putting instructions on their  
bathroom doors for guests instructing them how to help make the 
toilet flush with plungers and extra cups of water. That is 
absurd,'' said Gerald Kosmensky, president of Gerald Building Co. 
in Southgate, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Plumbers and handymen say the old toilets may be outlawed in new  
homes, but there is a black market for them because they flush 
better and don't back up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has gotten to the point that many Americans are crossing  
the border to Canada and Mexico to purchase these now illegal 
toilets,'' said Glenn Haege, a handyman who hosts a nationally 
syndicated radio show based in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine if you get caught, Knollenberg says, is as high as  
$2,500.

<HEADLINE> Payton Sad To See Sanders Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- As a former player, Walter Payton can  
understand why Barry Sanders is quitting. As a fan, he hopes it 
isn't for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders retired Wednesday, even though he's just 1,458 yards shy  
of breaking Payton's career NFL rushing record and almost certainly 
would have done it this season. He said his ``desire to exit the 
game is greater than my desire to remain in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have never played the game of football, you can never  
begin to understand what is going through Barry's heart and mind at 
this time,'' Payton said in a statement. ``It is not about money. 
It is not about statistics. It is about the romance kindled by 
playing the game the way it was supposed to be played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a few players were gifted enough to feel the love for  
football that burns in a player's heart, players such as Jim Brown, 
Emmitt Smith, Tony Dorsett and Earl Campbell. You see the love for 
the game in Barry's eyes, in his performance and in the way he 
carries himself off the field. Even if you cheered against Barry's 
team, you always respected him as a player. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I am engulfed in my personal trials, my family, friends and  
life are more important than any yard or touchdown ever scored. And 
in a sense, Barry is fighting for the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, 45, announced in February he has a rare liver disease  
and is awaiting a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, rushed for 15,269 yards in his 10-year career with  
the Detroit Lions and probably would have broken Payton's record of 
16,726 sometime this season. He rushed for 1,491 yards last season, 
ending a streak of four consecutive 1,500-yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears are scheduled to play the Lions in the traditional  
Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit and also Dec. 19 at Soldier Field, 
so there was a possibility Sanders might have broken Payton's 
record in front of his old team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always great to see great performances out of athletes  
and to see records be broken,'' Bears defensive tackle Jim Flanigan 
said. ``But Walter worked hard for a long time to get that record, 
and I don't mind seeing it stand alone for a couple more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Payton didn't seem to have a problem with Sanders breaking  
his record. 
</P>
<P>
	``For my own selfish reasons,'' he said, ``I would like to see  
Barry come back and play.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Sign 3 Draft Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Kevin Faulk, who could emerge as the  
Patriots' starting running back, and two other draft picks signed 
Wednesday with New England. 
</P>
<P>
	To clear salary cap room, the Patriots terminated the final year  
of the contract of Willie Clay, their starting free safety the last 
three years. That money would be needed to pay the two remaining 
unsigned Patriots picks, Boston College center Damien Woody and 
Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, both first-rounders. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Faulk, a second-round choice from LSU, the Patriots  
signed defensive back Tony George, a third-rounder from Florida, 
and offensive lineman Derrick Fletcher, a fifth-rounder from 
Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk could replace Robert Edwards, who suffered a potential  
career-ending leg injury during a beach football game in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk signed a five-year deal, while George and Katzenmoyer  
signed for three years each. Further details were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have signed six of their eight draft picks.

<HEADLINE>  Junior Seau To Play Tight End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Every so often during San Diego Chargers  
practices, Junior Seau switches sides, pulls on a white jersey and, 
presto, the All-Pro linebacker turns into a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes he makes great catches. Other times, he simply looks  
like a linebacker trying to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	What in the name of Polynesia are the Chargers doing? The team  
now has what it calls its ``coconut package'' in which Seau, from 
Samoa, and tight end Alfred Pupunu, from Tonga, would be on the 
field at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing 31 games in three seasons, the Chargers think they  
can only gain from experimenting with their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you if we had the No. 1 offense, this would never  
come up,'' said Seau, the Chargers' live-wire leader who's entering 
his 10th NFL season. ``The fact here is we need identity on 
offense. If I can add a spark to the offense, then let's do it. I 
have no problems about it. We're going to put the best players on 
the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers had the 24th-ranked offense and the overwhelming  
number of blunders by quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan 
repeatedly undid the work of the NFL's top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Chargers' 5-11 debacle, Seau urged the team to sign a  
veteran quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he played some tight end during his eighth straight Pro  
Bowl appearance. He was the primary receiver on the play during 
which John Elway threw his final scoring pass, but couldn't get 
open and Elway dumped off a 3-yarder to Sam Gash. 
</P>
<P>
	Seau later spoke to new coach Mike Riley, who wants to have some  
fun while trying to win. Riley agreed to give him a look at tight 
end beginning with minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletically, you can do nothing but agree with him,'' said  
Riley, who made the jump from Oregon State to his first NFL job. 
``I think he'd be great. If he played that full time, he'd probably 
be Pro Bowl at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Seau is being used as an H-back, a hybrid tight  
end/fullback who lines up in different spots and goes in motion a 
lot more. He is used as a receiver and blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	If this experiment works, Seau can expect to be in for about 10  
plays on offense during the regular season. The way he looks at it, 
an improved offense will mean the defense will be on the field for 
12-14 fewer plays this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New starting quarterback Jim Harbaugh had his doubts during  
spring workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really taking it a lot more seriously now,'' Harbaugh  
said. ``He can really make us better on offense. We've got good 
tight ends, don't get me wrong, but Junior, he just has a spark to 
him or something. He comes over there and he just makes plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're firing all our bullets, and damn the torpedoes. I kind  
of like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh then uttered these magic words: ``We've got an  
open-minded coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau knows this never would have been possible under Kevin  
Gilbride, the stubborn former head coach who was 6-16 when he was 
fired six games into last season. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only one not excited about seeing Seau at tight end is  
defensive coordinator Joe Pascale, who doesn't want the two-way 
duties interfering with his concentration and zest on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I'm the first to say that if it deteriorates what  
I've done, and the bread and butter of who I am and what I stand 
for, I'll definitely step aside,'' Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what if Seau gets hurt playing offense? The coaching staff  
is all too familiar with New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn. 
He injured his knee on a kickoff return during an exhibition game 
last year and was out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	That hardly sways Seau, who has missed only three games in his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I play this game is 100 percent, full out, smash  
someone in the mouth, get up and get back in the huddle,'' he said. 
``When I have the ball in my hand it's not going to change 
anything. They're going to have to come after me rather than me 
going after them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches are chronic worriers, but this staff wants to give it a  
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves that,'' offensive coordinator Geep Chryst said.  
``If anyone has equity in this team, it's Junior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers plan to use Seau mostly inside the opponents'  
20-yard line and in other short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good to have him out there,'' tight end Freddie  
Jones said. ``He brings an energy that we need over there.''

<HEADLINE> Questions Raised About Yen Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Just weeks after Japan's financial authorities drew  
criticism for intervening too much in currency markets, those same 
authorities now seem to have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	In their absence, the yen has risen against the dollar to a  
level economists say could smother Japan's fledgling economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials deny there is any change in policy. ``We are not  
seeking a rapid rise in the yen,'' Zembei Mizoguchi, the head of 
the international bureau at the Ministry of Finance, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders and analysts point out that financial officials are  
not exactly backing up their words with action. 
</P>
<P>
	After jumping into markets at any hint of a yen rise last month,  
financial authorities have mostly stood by in July as the yen 
marched ahead. The Japanese currency climbed to a five-month high 
of 115.52 yen to the dollar on Wednesday. In late New York trading, 
it had dropped slightly to 116.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Any shift may indicate that authorities are losing faith in the  
effectiveness of intervention to control currency rates, analysts 
said, though they may simply be timing their next move for maximum 
impact. It's hard to tell, given the secrecy surrounding the 
Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, their inaction has been surprising because the  
stakes are so high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy emerged early this year from its longest postwar  
recession, shooting ahead 1.9 percent in the first three months of 
the year after a year and a half in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	That unexpected growth has been the main reason for the yen's  
rise. Such growth, generating optimism about corporate prospects, 
has brought a flood of investors' cash into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	That has economists worried. Too strong a yen ``could be a  
factor derailing the fragile recovery we have right now,'' said 
Darrell Whitten, strategist for ABN Amro Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem,'' agreed Robert Feldman, economist for  
Morgan Stanley. ``If the yen stays at its current level that would 
put some pretty significant pressure on company earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, finance officials have mostly given up on  
trying to influence the direction of the dollar, arguing that 
intervention is expensive and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus in Japan has to be on strengthening the fundamentals  
... not seeking to manipulate currencies,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dollar slipped below 120 yen last month, financial  
authorities moved quickly, selling some $20 billion worth of yen in 
a series of market interventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive selling drove down the yen's value, pushing the  
dollar up to 122.59 yen on July 5. But as optimism about Japan's 
economy has grown, so has investors' hunger for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the currency's increasing strength in recent weeks,  
Japan has intervened just twice and spent only about $2 billion to 
drive the yen lower.

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive Alert Raises Cost Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy experts cautiously predict that  
Americans are unlikely to see much higher gasoline prices because 
of the Environmental Protection Agency's wish to curtail use of a 
common fuel additive. 
</P>
<P>
	But confusion about what would replace the methanol-based  
additive in a federal program that requires ``reformulated 
gasoline'' to be sold in areas with the most severe air pollution 
leaves unclear what might happen at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA advisory panel, in a report released Tuesday, recognized  
that reformulated gas has improved air quality in several 
metropolitan areas. The 1990 Clean Air Act mandates that 
reformulated gas contain a higher amount of oxygen, and MTBE has 
become the most widely used oxygenate additive to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical is in gasoline sold in at least 16 states, or  
altogether in about a third of the nation's motor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel said concerns are growing about MTBE's appearance  
in groundwater, where it causes a foul smell and taste while not 
yet posing a health risk, and recommended its use be substantially 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner responded by saying the agency  
would work with Congress on legislation to maintain the 
reformulated-gas program but phase out MTBE. She also a promised a 
crackdown on leaking underground storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested removing the oxygenate requirement to allow  
more alternatives to MTBE to emerge and reduce the chances of 
disruptions in the nation's fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator for air and  
radiation, stressed that any changes to the program must safeguard 
water supplies without sacrificing air quality gains. A reduction 
in MTBE must also protect consumers from gas price fluctuations and 
preserve the use of renewable fuels, such as corn-based ethanol, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	How the EPA would propose to meet all those goals was unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested MTBE use be gradually decreased over four  
years so refiners could find other ways to reduce toxic chemical 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given enough time for a transition ... the impact on  
(gasoline) prices should be very small or not noticeable,'' said 
Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects 
Institute and chairman of the advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy analysts tend to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who this is really traumatic for are the refiners  
who've invested production money into MTBE,'' said analyst Tim 
Evans at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If many refiners go bankrupt from their investments in MTBE, a  
reduction in overall production capacity could lead to spot 
gasoline shortages and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Evans said: ``I wouldn't expect to see any immediate  
impact of prices at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious replacement for MTBE would be ethanol, but it  
costs more to make. It also evaporates more readily, particularly 
in hot summer months, releasing organic pollutants. For that 
reason, to be used in the summer it must be blended with a more 
expensive, cleaner-burning gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	And ethanol is primarily manufactured in the Midwest, making it  
difficult now to get it to key West Coast and Northeast markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Knight, chief lobbyist for the National Corn Growers  
Association, said ethanol plants produce enough of the fuel now to 
meet the needs of the large California market. They could quickly 
grow their capacity -- outside the Midwest, if needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible alternative is a blend of alkalytes and  
aromatics, which are derived from crude oil, though neither is an 
oxygenate. Aromatics are slightly less expensive than ethanol, but 
pose risks of increased toxic emissions. Alkalytes, though clean 
burning, are low-octane and would require pricey capital 
investment.

<HEADLINE> Small Video Retailers Losing Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five years ago, video store owner David Zullo  
was ready to hit the eject button and bail out of the business 
because of chain retailers and other competition for viewers' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But a funny thing happened on the way to the liquidation sale.  
Video rentals went up at his store, despite a sea of 
blue-and-yellow Blockbuster signs dotting the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	With some aggressive marketing, a bit of diversification on  
movie titles and renewed investment in time and money, 1998 was the 
best year Zullo has had in the 15 years he's operated his Showcase 
Video stores around Shelburne, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	While many retailers opened video stores because they were movie  
lovers, industry analysts say it's savvy business people who will 
survive as Blockbuster, Hollywood Entertainment and other retail 
monoliths spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you are extremely clever and resourceful and really  
understand retailing, it's going to be hard to be part of this 
industry's future,'' said Bruce Apar, editor-in-chief of Video 
Business, a trade publication. ``The industry's matured to the 
point where it's not very forgiving anymore of people who opened 
stores because they like movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,500 U.S. video stores went out of business in 1998,  
according to the Video Software Dealers Association, roughly 10 
percent of the total rental stores. With the growth of national 
chains, which added about 1,000 stores last year, that trend is 
likely to continue and even accelerate, some industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt I'll be in business five years from now,'' said Ray  
Hoving, who owns a video store in Victorville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeout resembles what happened to independent book and  
record stores that were run out of business by national retailers. 
Handfuls of locally owned shops survived and even thrived as 
smaller niche stores, and industry experts see the same happening 
for video retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our store looks more like a coffee shop than it does a  
Blockbuster,'' said Mark Vrieling, who owns three Rain City Video 
stores around Seattle and is chairman of the video dealers 
association. ``We bring in a different crowd. We've still got the 
new release junkies, but we're catering to the real film buffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on customers' rental patterns, one of Vrieling's stores is  
heavy on foreign films while another has a bigger family-oriented 
section. The idea is to play to the interests of the neighborhood, 
something a generic chain store cannot do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller retailers count on anti-corporate customers, film buffs  
such as Jackie Sanchez of Montclair, N.J., who prefers the personal 
touch of a homegrown video store. She rents movies from her 
neighborhood store, Video Showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel strongly I have to be loyal to my local video store,''  
she said. ``You go in and they know your name, and if they didn't 
have what you wanted, they'd try and get it for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though some small video dealers concede they will have a tough  
time staying in business, many say they're steeling themselves to 
tough it out against corporate retailers and other competition such 
as satellite television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had to work a lot harder in the last year and a half than  
I have in a long time,'' said John Virtue, who owns five Movietime 
Video stores in central Indiana. ``It's almost been like 
reinventing the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many small retailers, Virtue said he is playing to  
independent advantages, stocking more eclectic titles, improving 
customer service and trying to keep a veteran staff with broader 
movie knowledge than the typical chain-store employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers like Virtue and Zullo said they also try to keep pace  
as best they can with the chain-store edge of providing scores and 
scores of the biggest new releases. Through complicated deals with 
studios, small video shops are able to buy a certain number of 
copies and lease many more, allowing them to have 50 or 60 copies 
of hits like ``Armageddon'' on hand where they once might have had 
only a dozen or so. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year or two, Blockbuster and other chains irritated  
independent retailers by cutting revenue-sharing deals with studios 
that allowed them to get huge numbers of top movies for far less 
money upfront. That led to guarantees by chain stores that some hot 
titles would always be in stock, resulting in diminished traffic at 
smaller stores with only a few copies of the same movies. 
</P>
<P>
	But it raised the profile of the industry as a whole and spurred  
a healthy 9 percent increase in video-rental revenues in 1998 after 
a decrease the year before. Americans spent a record $8.1 billion 
last year on movie rentals, according to the video dealers 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	Big video stores took in most of the increase, with Blockbuster  
now accounting for nearly 30 percent of the rental business. 
Blockbuster, which has about 6,300 stores, would not comment on its 
strategy because it is in a quiet period imposed by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission while its parent, Viacom Inc., prepares a 
public stock offering for the video chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Though national chains and independent retailers each accounted  
for roughly half of the business, rentals at small stores overall 
have been relatively flat. 
</P>
<P>
	As more small retailers close, the market share for independent  
stores will shrink, analysts say. Apar said independents might 
account for as little as 20 percent of the rental business within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's room for very well run mom-and-pop stores to  
thrive,'' said Jeff Jordan, president of online video seller 
Reel.com, which is owned by Hollywood Entertainment. ``But it's 
hard to compete against the resources and business models that 
Hollywood and Blockbuster provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As technology improves, viewers also will have  
``video-on-demand'' options, movies piped right into their homes 
over the Internet, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	With competition from all sides, the choice for many small  
retailers comes down to closing their video stores or branching off 
into other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Beckloff, owner of Castle Rental Center stores in northwest  
Arkansas, said video rentals accounted for most of his business 
four years ago. Now, videos account for only 8 to 10 percent of 
profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He increased his focus on rent-to-own furniture and electronics  
as video rentals waned, Beckloff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to decide now if I should stay in the video  
business at all,'' Beckloff said. ``It's a lot of work for not a 
lot of profit.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 33.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower today, failing to follow  
through on Tuesday's gains. At the opening, traders were awaiting 
remarks by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to a Senate 
committee for hints as to whether the Fed might raise interest 
rates again. As it turned out, he said in his prepared text that 
the Federal Reserve is prepared to act promptly if inflation 
dangers appear. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 33.56 at 10,945.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 6.31 at 1,356.53, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 18.67 at 2,660.66. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing support behind stocks on Tuesday, sending the Dow  
up 115.88 points, investors shied away today as Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan began his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's opening testimony today closely mirrored last week's  
remarks, but traders were gearing up to listen closely to the 
question-and-answer period following his prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, dipped today. American Express, which rose Tuesday 
due to a strong profit report, fell 1 11/16 to 140 11/16. Chase 
Manhattan fell 5/8 to 83 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 5 to 35 1/4 a day after the company said it 
will spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 214.71 million shares 
at late morning, slightly ahead of Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.15 at 638.54, and the

<HEADLINE> Umpires Criticize Union Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than a dozen major league umpires on  
Wednesday night criticized their leadership for ``a flawed and 
doomed strategy'' that apparently will cost 22 umps their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, baseball officials said ability, racial and ethnic  
background, and experience will be among the factors used by to 
decide which 19 National League umpires to take back and which 13 
to let go. 
</P>
<P>
	After the collapse of the union's planned Sept. 2 walkout, many  
of the umpires who kept their jobs blamed the mess on the 
leadership group, headed by union president Jerry Crawford and 
Richie Phillips, the umps' negotiator since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major league umpires have been seriously harmed because  
union leadership adopted a flawed strategy that was doomed to fail 
from the beginning,'' said the statement, agreed to by a group that 
included Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck, Dave Phillips, Dale Scott 
and Rocky Roe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advice to quit jobs in order to keep them made no sense at  
all,'' the group said, ``especially under a collective bargaining 
contract that not only ruled out strikes, but also ruled out `other 
concerted work stoppage.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A person familiar with the drafting of the statement said more  
than a dozen umps joined in and possibly more. The statement will 
be formally issued Thursday and will include Wally Bell and Jeff 
Nelson of the National League, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It grieves us that more than 20 umpires will apparently lose  
their jobs as a result of this flawed and doomed strategy,'' the 
statement said. ``We have been able to save some of our colleagues 
by convincing them not to resign or to quickly rescind their 
resignations. If we had not taken a stand, all major league umpires 
could be facing the end of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that we proceed with a realistic view of the  
world and do what is in the best interest of all umpires, our 
families and the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management officials and lawyers spent much of Wednesday trying  
to make decisions on the NL umps, and they said they expected to 
make their choices by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, AL president Gene Budig told nine of his umpires that  
their resignations were being accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after its attempted walkout collapsed, there were no new  
actions by the Major League Umpires Association. While Richie 
Phillips said Tuesday he would file unfair labor practice charges 
against baseball, none was received by the National Labor Relations 
Board's Philadelphia office, where umpires usually file. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, baseball wrote a letter threatening to seek  
sanctions against Phillips for filing a lawsuit Monday, a 
management official said on the condition he not be identified. 
Federal court rules say suits must be based on ``existing law or by 
a nonfrivolous argument'' for changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the claims the umpires made in the suit are subject to  
the jurisdiction of the NLRB or the binding arbitration clause in 
the umpires' labor contract, or are based on anticipated actions 
that haven't occurred, management officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two umpires withdrew their resignations Tuesday as the  
union's strategy of a Sept. 2 mass walkout collapsed due to lack of 
support among AL umps. The group withdrawing their resignations 
included the nine AL umps who were told Monday that they weren't 
welcome back because 12 replacements already had been hired from 
Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Tuesday, only four NL umps had told their bosses they  
were remaining, with a baseball official saying Greg Bonin will 
remain because his resignation was never sent by the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 32 NL umps who withdrew their resignations Tuesday, 19  
will be taken back and 13 will be replaced by new hires from the 
minors, several baseball officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-ranking officials said ability won't be the sole factor  
in determining who stays. Baseball has pushed to increase minority 
hiring in recent years, and doesn't want to decrease the percentage 
of minority umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if an umpire is close to retirement age, the NL may  
be more likely to let him go, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball also must be careful not to accept the resignations of  
too many of the union's leaders, because that would open the sport 
to a charge of illegal retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	While union president Jerry Crawford was the highest-rated NL  
umpire in a survey by the players' association after the 1998 
season, Terry Tata was ranked 29th of 36th and Bruce Froemming was 
ranked 33rd. Both Tata and Froemming are key backers of Phillips.

<HEADLINE> Inkster Looks To Cap Great Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Juli Inkster sparkled under the bright  
lights of television cameras, courtesy of a second set of diamond 
earrings her two daughters want her to wear. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought I needed an upgrade,'' Inkster said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The diamonds only accentuate her brilliant play the past three  
months, which has brought Inkster to the threshold of history 
heading into the du Maurier Classic, the final major championship 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster achieved a lifelong dream by winning the U.S. Open.  
Three weeks later, she birdied the last three holes to win the LPGA 
Championship and become only the second woman to complete the 
modern career Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived at Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club, a  
spectacular setting in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, with 
even higher aspirations. A victory in the du Maurier would make her 
only the fifth golfer to win three majors in a season, and it would 
give her enough points to be 17th member of the LPGA Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure?  
</P>
<P>
	``None,'' Inkster said with a relaxed, confident smile that  
erased any doubts. ``I've already had a great year. If I keep 
playing the way I'm playing, I'm going to have a chance on Sunday. 
And that's all I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody, not even five-time winner Karrie Webb, has done it as  
well as Inkster lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the final day of the Chick-Fil-A Charity Classic on April  
25, Inkster has played 25 consecutive rounds at par or better, 
including one stretch of 19 straight rounds under par. She has not 
finished lower than sixth, and her two victories happened to be 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I win this tournament, great,'' Inkster said. ``I have as  
good a chance as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final major could be the most demanding this year. Scoring  
records were set in the Dinah Shore (19-under par) and U.S. Open 
(16 under), and Inkster won the LPGA with a 16-under 268, one 
stroke off the tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixteen under won't win this thing,'' Inkster said.  
</P>
<P>
	Priddis Greens features tight, tree-lined fairways and more  
rough than the women ever saw at Old Waverly for the U.S. Open. The 
course is 6,415 yards, although at an altitude of 4,200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably going to be the toughest major course we've  
played this year, which is what we've needed,'' Webb said. ``You 
should be afraid to miss the fairway. You should be afraid to miss 
the green. That's what major golf is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conspicuously missing is Annika Sorenstam, who decided she  
needed to rest this week to get ready for the Women's British Open, 
which is important to European players but is not a major. This is 
the first major Sorenstam has missed since joining the LPGA Tour in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Also absent is Nancy Lopez, still recovering from arthroscopic  
knee surgery last month, and defending champion Brandie Burton, who 
required more surgery on her left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, all eyes will be on Inkster.  
</P>
<P>
	The last player to win three majors in the same season was Pat  
Bradley in 1986. The only other women to get the major trifecta 
were Mickey Wright in 1961 and Babe Zaharias in 1950, when the LPGA 
had only three majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Hogan in 1953 is the only PGA Tour player to win three in  
one season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's pretty exclusive company for a 39-year-old mother who  
wanted only to prove she could still compete with the next 
generation of stars, such as Webb, Sorenstam and Se Ri Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkster attributes her success to finding a balance between  
family and golf. She took 5-year-old Cori to the doctor for a fever 
on Tuesday, but focused on golf the rest of the day while working 
with swing coach Mike McGetrick. 
</P>
<P>
	She also found confidence earlier than usual, winning in Arizona  
in her fifth tournament of the year. Inkster's lone victory each of 
the past two years was the Samsung World Championship played in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``That took the pressure off me,'' she said. ``I think I played  
a little more aggressively and that helped my confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	If Inkster feels no pressure to win the du Maurier, she is bound  
to feel it before long when it comes to the Hall of Fame. She needs 
to win only one more tournament or the Vare Trophy for scoring 
average or player of the year. Webb is leading both those 
categories at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Hall of Fame always puts emphasis on winning the last  
tournament, no matter what you've done your entire career,'' 
Inkster said. ``I'm not going to get caught up in that. If I keep 
playing solid golf and give myself a chance to win on Sunday, I'm 
going to win a tournament. That's the way I'm going about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, she can't complain about the results.

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Daniel Suffers Neck Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Robert Daniel, a sixth-round draft choice  
of the Carolina Panthers, suffered a neck injury during practice 
Wednesday and was taken by ambulance to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel, a rookie defensive end from Northwestern (La.) State,  
had movement in all extremities and the preliminary diagnosis was a 
bruised spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good prognosis sign that he has complete movement and  
strength in both legs and his left arm,'' said Dr. Pat Connor, the 
team's assistant orthopedist. ``His right arm has movement but is 
weak from the bruising of nerves that affected his right 
shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels was to undergo tests Wednesday night at Carolinas  
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel was injured during a blocking sled drill. When his helmet  
collided with the sled, Daniel's knees buckled, and he immediately 
fell on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just started praying instantly when I saw him go down,''  
said Mike Rucker, who like Daniel is a rookie defensive lineman.

<HEADLINE> Most Thought JFK Coverage Excessive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The news story of the deaths of John F.  
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law drew a huge audience, but 
many people thought the media coverage was excessive, new polls 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls, by the Gallup Organization and the Pew Research  
Center for the People &AMP; the Press, illustrate the mixed public 
message about tragedies involving celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public tunes in because they want news,'' said Bob Giles,  
executive director of the Freedom Forum's Media Studies Center. 
``But part of the reaction is because the 24-hour news channels and 
the main networks ... kept that story on even when there was 
nothing new to report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of the plane crash that killed Kennedy, his wife Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette was followed 
closely by 54 percent of the public, according to the Pew poll, 
while 29 percent followed it fairly closely. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, only the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., drew  
more attention, as 68 percent of the public followed the news 
closely, and 24 percent followed it fairly closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were more likely than men to pay close attention to the  
Kennedy news, according to the polls. Among age groups, citizens 
who are 60 and older showed the most interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Gallup poll, almost six out of 10 thought coverage of the  
Kennedy crash was excessive, while people were evenly divided 
almost two years ago on whether the coverage of the death of 
Princess Diana was excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew telephone poll of 753 adults was taken Friday through  
Monday and had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The Gallup poll of 1,021 adults was taken Thursday through 
Sunday and had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for Pharmacia &AMP;  
Upjohn jumped 15.5 percent, helped by huge sales increases for its 
glaucoma and overactive bladder drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Nicorette smoking cessation products and Rogaine  
for hair loss said Wednesday earnings rose to $216 million, or 41 
cents per share, matching analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	A year earlier, second-quarter earnings were $187 million, or 36  
cents per share, excluding a $41 million charge for settling a 
lawsuit U.S. retail pharmacies brought against several major drug 
makers over price discounts offered only to larger customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the three months ended June 30 were up 11 percent,  
to $1.74 billion from $1.56 billion. Excluding the effect of the 
company's 1998 sale of its nutrition business, revenues rose 6.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now completed the turnaround phase for P&AMP;U'' begun in  
1997, said chief executive officer Fred Hassan. ``As we go forward, 
our strategic focus is on building the base for sustainable, 
long-term growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Chris Coughlin said the company expects  
to meet analysts' expectations for earnings per share of about 
$1.80 this year and $2 next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that the company's planned merger with Sugen Inc.,  
a biotechnology company focused on ``understanding signaling 
between cells that directs basic biological processes,'' should be 
wrapped up this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were led by the glaucoma medication Xalatan's 64 percent  
sales increase to $110.5 million. Xalatan is now on the verge of 
passing Genotropin, a growth hormone that has long been P&AMP;U's best 
seller; Genotropin sales rose 18 percent to $112.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing on them is Detrol, which has grabbed about half the  
market for ``overactive bladder'' drugs. Sales were $85.5 million, 
a 300 percent increase over 1998's second quarter, when the 
twice-a-day pill was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dipped for Xanax, an anti-anxiety pill, and Depo-Provera,  
the six-year-old contraceptive injection, while Nicorette revenues 
climbed 31 percent to $62 million and Camptosar, an injection for 
spreading colorectal cancer, had sales increase 50 percent to $65.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the sales growth came the United States, with revenues  
up 21 percent to $691 million, and Japan, where Coughlin said an 
improving economy helped boost sales 29 percent, to $176 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, net earnings jumped 16  
percent, to $437 million, or 83 cents per share, from $376 million, 
or 72 cents per share, a year ago. Sales rose 14 percent to $3.49 
billion from $3.06 billion in the January-June period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn fell $1.93 3/4 to $55.93 3/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> NOAA Corps Leader Assumes Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rear Adm. Evelyn J. Fields on Tuesday became  
the first woman and first black to take command of NOAA Corps, the 
small uniformed service that operates ships and aircraft used to 
study the weather, oceans and fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to have such a visionary and outstanding officer  
... lead the NOAA Corps,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said at 
her induction ceremony. Fields was the first woman to command an 
oceangoing federal ship. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA Corps, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration, is the nation's smallest uniformed service. It was 
founded in 1807 as the Coastal Survey during Thomas Jefferson's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps' 400 officers, all scientists or engineers, operate  
the ships and aircraft used in weather and ocean research and 
police the ocean fisheries. Its ships Rude and Whiting were called 
in assist in the search for the missing aircraft of John F. Kennedy 
Jr., and it was the hydrographic survey ship Rude that located the 
aircraft wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton nominated Fields for the position of NOAA  
Corps director on Jan. 19. The Senate confirmed her nomination on 
May 6 and she was promoted to rear admiral the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	She began serving as director at that time, with Tuesday's  
assumption of command ceremony marking a formal recognition of her 
new position. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields began her career with NOAA in 1972 as a civilian  
cartographer at the Atlantic Marine Center in Norfolk, Va. She was 
recruited into NOAA Corps in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman to serve as commanding officer on a NOAA  
ship, the McArthur, as well as the first woman to command a federal 
ship for an extended period within the nation's uniformed services.

<HEADLINE> Can and Should, Homosexuals Change? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- Exodus International, an alliance of  
Christian ministries, raised difficult questions about gays and 
lesbians this week at its annual and best-attended conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Can homosexuals change? Should they? Should churches encourage  
those unhappy as homosexuals to seek change? Or should they help 
homosexuals accept their lifestyle as God-given? 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus, based in Seattle, is at the center of intense religious  
debate it generated through an ad campaign after last year's 
conference. The ads, in national newspapers, said homosexuals can 
become heterosexual through prayer, counseling and Christian 
fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus ministries are run largely by conservative Protestants  
from homosexual backgrounds. They endorse traditional Christian 
beliefs, calling homosexual activity sinful, and help gays and 
lesbians become celibate or, if possible, heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus reports affiliation by 131 independent local ministries  
in the United States. Adding non-U.S. groups headquartered in Ajax, 
Ontario, officials claim more than 200,000 gays and lesbians have 
contacted Exodus ministries for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus announced no plans for further ads, but officials this  
week revealed a new project: scientific research to prove claims of 
sexual orientation changes. 
</P>
<P>
	That message -- change is possible -- reverberated through  
inspirational talks, practical instruction and testimonies for the 
1,133 Exodus leaders and clients in attendance, up from last year's 
850. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Tracy, former press secretary for the National Organization  
for Women, identified herself as a one-time committed homosexual 
but told listeners, ``Jesus saw through that lesbian-feminist 
facade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just before she spoke, a nearby protest by 50 demonstrators  
indicated that others believe it is perfectly all right to be 
Christian and openly gay or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Exodus ads appeared, gay organizations denounced such  
ministries and pointed to former leaders of Exodus who returned to 
the homosexual lifestyle. The discussion continues over the 
Internet, complete with an ``ex-ex-gay'' Web site for Exodus 
dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been controversial for some time.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) assembly debated  
bills from regional units in Chicago, Detroit, New York and 
Rochester, N.Y., opposing gay conversion therapies. A bill from 
Iowa supported such treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterians advised that any such therapy conform with  
``recognized professional standards.'' Last December, the board of 
the American Psychiatric Association declared treatment aimed at 
changing sexual orientation can cause depression, anxiety and 
self-destructive behavior. Other clinical associations agree. 
</P>
<P>
	That worries John Paulk, chairman of the Exodus board and author  
of a 1998 autobiography about conversion from the gay life. He is 
the spokesman on homosexual issues for James Dobson's Focus on the 
Family in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulk thinks counselors who provide change therapies might  
eventually risk losing their licenses. ``The gay lobby is so 
powerful, much more than we are, that it could happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy, who also works for Focus on the Family, thinks ``the gay  
activist community is very threatened by Exodus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Their civil rights campaign is based on the belief that  
homosexuality is immutable,'' she said. ``Yet people have changed. 
We are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Observing the conference with his gay partner, author Mel White  
had a different outlook. White was once a ghost writer for Jerry 
Falwell and Pat Robertson, noted critics of gay activism. Then he 
identified himself as gay and became a minister with the 
Metropolitan Community Churches, which reach out to gays and 
lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	To White, Exodus ministries ``make Jerry, Pat and Jim  
possible.'' He considers sexual conversions rare and often suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Brock Bennett, a Chicago member of the Unity School of  
Christianity. After participating in Exodus for five years, he 
resumed an active gay identity. Bennett said he knew hundreds of 
homosexuals in Exodus and not one managed to become heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	But, contrary to gay lobbies that call Exodus destructive,  
Bennett did find that Exodus produced ``many people who felt very 
much at ease, and much happier'' among Christians who agreed with 
them that homosexuality is wrong.

<HEADLINE> NFL Owners Not Sold on Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill., (AP) -- Los Angeles wants a football team and the  
NFL wants to accommodate the second-largest TV market in the 
country. But owners and commissioner Paul Tagliabue wouldn't commit 
Wednesday to placing a team in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers and representatives from Los Angeles presented a  
proposal that would bring a team to Los Angeles, but in the end 
Tagliabue chose not to sign it, despite its non-binding nature. 
Owners and representatives from NFL teams met Wednesday at a 
suburban Chicago hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Tagliabue said the agreement could be used as ``framework  
for negotiations,'' he cited economic questions about how to 
finance a new stadium in Los Angeles that would have to be 
addressed to get the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to get an NFL commitment puts added pressure on Bill  
Chadwick, the man handpicked by California's governor to negotiate 
with the NFL to bring a team back to the city. Chadwick had 
predicted that Los Angeles would ``have a sign-off on the document 
by the end of the week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Sept. 15 deadline was set for exclusive negotiations with Los  
Angeles and if that date passes, Houston will become a strong 
contender for the 32nd NFL team. Tagliabue emphasized that the 
deadline wouldn't be pushed back under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans that include issuing bonds to pay for a parking facility  
next to the new stadium and a ticket surcharge to raise revenue 
were among the economic alternatives put forth in the proposal. But 
Tagliabue indicated that without adequate public funding for the 
stadium, the NFL couldn't vote to send the new team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue was reacting to predictions that the total cost of the  
stadium would be about $750 million, but would probably only 
generate around $30 million annually during the first several years 
of operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the placement of the team is still murky, Al Davis, owner  
of the Oakland Raiders, who were once in Los Angeles, said he 
opposed NFL approval of any deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the a state-of-the-art stadium (in Los Angeles) ready to  
go and they killed the deal, the National Football League,'' Davis 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Regales Teens at Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave members of Boys Nation  
and Girls Nation an impromptu history lesson Wednesday, recounting 
tales about the conduct of Thomas Jefferson and Dolly Madison in 
the very room in which they sat. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers, in town for the annual Boys Nation-Girls Nation  
legislative gathering, listened raptly from their seats in the East 
Room as Clinton pointed to a painting of George Washington and told 
how Madison's wife saved it from a British invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had purchased the Gilbert Stuart painting in  
1797 ``for the then-enormous sum of $500,'' Clinton said. When 
James Madison sent word for his wife to forget the banquet she was 
planning and flee the White House, Dolly Madison took a few extra 
minutes to remove the painting from its frame and take it with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what, she had to take the picture of George  
Washington,'' Clinton said. ``The British arrived to find the empty 
frame, ate the food and burned the house. But we rebuilt the house 
and the picture still lives. Every time I see that picture I think 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The East Room also was the setting for Jefferson's meeting with  
Merriwether Lewis to plan the Lewis and Clark expedition, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place was covered with bearskins and ancient maps,'' he  
said. ``President Jefferson was in love with the geography and 
science, and he saw this whole thing not only as a geographical 
expedition, but he thought that all kinds of scientific information 
would be gathered along the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So a lot of very important things have happened where you are  
sitting today that remind us that America is a place with great 
opportunities and great responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was greeted with a rousing cheer, and Boys Nation vice  
president John Feeny attached a red pin to Clinton's lapel, making 
him a member of the 1999 class. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was among the Boys Nation class of 1963, during  
which he met President Kennedy. He has often cited that moment as 
one of the proudest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of Clinton's 1963 class, Rep. Jim Ramstad,  
R-Minn., also was present Wednesday.

	Space Shuttle Columbia's Landing Dazzles  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's first female commander guided  
space shuttle Columbia to a dazzling late-night landing after 
delivering the world's most powerful X-ray telescope to orbit. 
Under a nearly full moon, Eileen Collins completed the 1.8 million 
mile journey at 11:20 p.m. yesterday, becoming the first woman to 
land a spaceship of any kind, anywhere. Within a few hours of her 
triumph, NASA confirmed what it had already suspected: Hydrogen 
fuel leaked from one of the shuttle's main engines during liftoff 
five days earlier.

	Serbs Prepare To Bury 14 Slain Farmers  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two white U.N. trucks carrying the  
coffins of 14 slain Serbs left a morgue in Pristina today, bound 
for the victims' home village and a funeral before hundreds of 
mourners and leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Workers 
wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the wooden coffins one by 
one from the morgue to the waiting trucks for the 15-mile trip 
south to Gracko, where the farmers were shot to death Friday night 
while harvesting wheat. The killings, the worst single incident of 
violence since NATO troops deployed in mid-June, shook Serb 
confidence in the peacekeeping mission and the alliance's pledges 
to protect all ethnic groups in Kosovo.

	U.N. Delays E. Timor Referendum

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has  
delayed by a week the historic referendum on East Timor's 
independence, Indonesia's foreign minister said today. This would 
be the second time that the United Nations has delayed the vote 
amid concerns that the security situation in the Indonesian 
territory is not conducive to a free and fair ballot. ``The 
secretary-general apparently is now proposing that the popular 
consultation in East Timor will definitely be held on Aug. 30,'' 
Alatas told CNBC television.

	US, China Resume Compensation Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. officials are hoping that a second round of  
talks in China will settle the issue of paying compensation for 
NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
U.S. envoys were back in Beijing today to resume negotiations that 
are part of efforts to repair the damage done to U.S.-China ties by 
the bombing that killed three Chinese journalists, injured 20 
diplomats and plunged relations to their lowest level in decades. A 
State Department legal adviser, was leading the U.S. delegation, 
said a U.S. Embassy spokesman.

	U.S., Russia To Hold Nuclear Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Russia will open talks  
in Moscow next month aimed at deeper reductions in their long-range 
nuclear weapons arsenals. The move reflects a new spirit of 
cooperation after the rift over Kosovo. The decision was made 
Tuesday by Vice President Al Gore and visiting Russian Prime 
Minister Sergei Stepashin, co-chairmen of a joint U.S.-Russian 
commission. ``The United States and Russia have long understood 
that reducing nuclear arsenals is in our mutual interest,'' Gore 
said. Stepashin, meanwhile, endorsed efforts to develop defenses 
against potential missile attack by rogue regimes.

	KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia  
has launched a major offensive against the opposition alliance on 
three fronts north of the capital Kabul, officials said today. Both 
sides confirmed the attacks. Each recently has accused the other of 
gearing up for an all-out assault, and fighting has intensified 
since two days of peace talks last week in neighboring Uzbekistan 
failed to yield a cease-fire agreement. The Taliban, which control 
almost 90 percent of Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul, are 
battling the opposition in a bid to extend their strict Islamic 
rule over the entire country.

Gwynn went 2-for-5 to move within 10 hits of 3,000, but lined out

final start for Kansas City, pitched seven strong innings as the 
Royals overcame Ken Griffey Jr.'s 33rd homer to beat the Seattle 
Mariners 9-7 last night. Appier, on the trading block all season, 
allowed two runs and eight hits. He stopped his three-game losing 
streak, allowing single runs in the fifth and seventh innings.

<HEADLINE> Weather Modernization Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some success stories cited by the National Weather Service to  
illustrate the value of improved forecasts: 
</P>
<P>
	--Grand Canyon, Ariz., July 14-15: Modern Doppler radar detected  
rain of up to 3 inches falling over the area, threatening flooding 
of Bright Angel Creek. The advance warnings allowed park officials 
to close hiking trails and keep visitors away from mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
	--Beebe, Ark., Jan. 21: A girl's basketball game was called at  
halftime after the school superintendent heard a tornado warning on 
National Weather Service radio. Thirty minutes later, the gym, by 
that time empty, was leveled by the twister. 
</P>
<P>
	--Zion National Park, Utah, July 27, 1998: Forecasters used new  
technology to pinpoint which drainage areas will flood in heavy 
rains, and park rangers persuaded most hikers to vacate the area. 
Two hikers who ignored the warnings were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Camp Springs, Md., June 17, 1997: For the first time,  
forecasters correctly predicted the arrival of the El Nino weather 
phenomenon, six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cincinnati, March 25, 1997: Advance flood warnings saved  
opening day for the Cincinnati Reds by giving managers of Cinergy 
Field time to close floodgates and activate pumps to prevent 
flooding of the new $2 million Astroturf field. 
</P>
<P>
	--Honolulu, July 16, 1994: Using new technology to track and  
forecast the path of Hurricane Emilia, forecasters were able to 
avoid issuing an unnecessary warning, saving millions of dollars in 
evacuation costs.

<HEADLINE> MLB Lawyers Defeat Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After losing more court cases than the poor devil that Perry  
Mason clobbered week in and week out on TV for years, the lawyers 
for major league baseball finally won one. They beat the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it wasn't a fair fight.  
</P>
<P>
	The umps had Richie Phillips on their side.  
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the few times in recent memory -- Carmen Electra's  
brief marriage to Dennis Rodman being another -- when something that 
seemed too good to be true actually was. So if you happened to be 
one of the suits running baseball, Tuesday really was Christmas in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the umpires got together at a union meeting and  
threatened to walk out. Baseball's response? ``Walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The week after that, 56 of the 68 umpires submitted resignation  
letters, effective Sept. 2. There were defections almost 
immediately. By last Friday, 14 had asked for their jobs and their 
resignation letters back. Soon enough, the 42 holdouts made it 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's response? ``Keep on walking.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the umpires and Phillips, their union boss and chief  
legal strategist, sued the American and National Leagues in federal 
court. They basically threw themselves on the mercy of the court, 
asking for an order that would allow them to withdraw the 
resignations prior to Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the court unmercifully threw the umps out. During a  
conference call with lawyers for both sides, U.S. District Judge 
Edmund V. Ludwig denied the union's request for a temporary 
restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, about one-third of the 68 umpires will lose  
their jobs. Even now, some of the pink slips are already in the 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-ranking baseball officials told The Associated Press  
that AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine umps accepting 
their resignations; his NL counterpart, Len Coleman, is expected to 
mail as many as 13 by the end of this week. The officials also said 
that the two leagues already have hired 25 replacements, all 
minor-leaguers, to fill the spots. 
</P>
<P>
	As is customary in such cases, the officials spoke on condition  
of anonymity. The real wonder is not that they leaked the 
information, but that they could speak at all -- given how hard all 
the baseball people must have been laughing after the lawyers 
called them to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	What isn't funny is what happens next: Phillips keeps his job  
and a few good umps lose theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	One big loss will be the exit of Rich Garcia. He gained  
notoriety three seasons ago working right field in the AL playoff 
between the Orioles and Yankees, when a then-13-year-old New Yorker 
named Jeff Maier leaned over the railing and helped turn a 
warning-track fly ball into a hometown home run. But that's the way 
umpires always get remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that Garcia was a very solid, very mobile, very  
respected official who was ranked third-best in the league in a 
survey of players last winter. Fat lot of good that did him. 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side of that is some of the umps who managed to grab a  
chair when the music stopped, but didn't deserve to. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Hendry blew at least two memorable calls in playoff games  
last season, failed to get out of the way of a grounder in a third 
and was ranked 30th out of 32 AL umps in the player survey. But he 
will be back next season, because he got his resignation letter 
back early. So will the guy ranked behind him, Mr. No. 31, Durwood 
Merrill, for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shame, though, is that Phillips has four years left  
on a deal the umps gave him last year. He badly miscalculated his 
union's solidarity. As a result, his strategy for outmaneuvering 
baseball in advance of contract negotiations was to open the window 
and tell the rank-and-file: ``Jump. You'll get instructions on the 
way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' contract was up Dec. 31. Phillips anticipated a  
lockout and hatched the resignation-letter scheme to get around a 
no-strike provision in the existing contract. All that did was move 
the umps outside the protective cushion that federal law extends. 
People who resign voluntarily have no job protection. Wouldn't it 
have been something to see Phillips face when he mouthed the word, 
``Ooops!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' desperation move was the lawsuit filed Monday. People  
who have seen the complaint say it's notable only for the poor 
quality of the arguments. He asked a district court to do what the 
National Labor Relations Board or an arbitrator are more likely to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	The umps can only hope that District Judge Ludwig has a change  
of heart somewhere along the way, or that the NLRB or an arbitrator 
bails them out. Their odds don't look any better than they turned 
out for another bunch of low-flyers, the air-traffic controllers 
who went up against President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	And just like Reagan, commissioner Bud Selig won the staredown  
without batting an eyelash. That's not hard to do when the sidewalk 
is coming up fast on the guys you're staring down. And even better, 
Selig won't have to play the Grinch when the umps' contract 
expires, right around the real Christmastime. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO's Clark Stepping Down Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has told Gen.  
Wesley Clark, the American commander who led the successful NATO 
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, to give up his command two 
months early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, an Army four-star general who is supreme allied commander  
in Europe, fielded a call from Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday with word of the early relief 
of command. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who had the tough job of molding together a multinational  
NATO military during the 11-week air campaign against Yugoslavia, 
was scheduled to step aside in July of next year, having just 
received a customary one-year extension of his term as the NATO 
commander in Europe. But the Clinton administration has decided to 
install Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, now the vice chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston's current appointment expires in February and to avoid  
an automatic reduction in Ralston's rank upon leaving a Joint 
Chief's post, his appointment as European commander must become 
effective in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Two senior defense officials, who spoke Tuesday on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed Shelton's call to Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, approved by Defense Secretary William Cohen, comes a  
month after NATO ended the air campaign over Yugoslavia and its 
province of Kosovo, having forced the Belgrade government to halt 
its repressive campaign against an ethnic Albanian-Muslim 
population in the southern province. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters today at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Cohen  
said he regarded Clark highly and attributed his early replacement 
to a matter of timing rather than a measure of Clark's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked for the same qualities that General Clark had in  
serving in his capacity as commander as the European forces,'' 
Cohen said. ``I see the same qualities in General Ralston, namely 
diplomatic skills, his ... war record as such and the capability of 
serving in that capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, interviewed by telephone from Brussels, told the Post,  
``I'm not going to speculate on what opportunities might be 
available in public life or private life. There is a long time yet 
to do this job, and I've got to keep my attention on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid much criticism and against widespread doubt, the air  
campaign succeeded in compelling Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo and halt the ground 
campaign against the Kosovo Albanians. A NATO peacekeeping force is 
now in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark served not only as the commander of U.S. forces in Europe  
but also as the supreme commander of all NATO forces, a post 
requiring approval not only of President Clinton but of 19 NATO 
allies. The general's relationship with Cohen has been more distant 
than that of some of the other U.S. field commanders, according to 
one of the defense officials. Cohen has largely relied on Shelton 
to relay commands and instructions to Clark, one of the defense 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Clark argued in private councils that NATO  
leave on the table the option of using ground troops in the Kosovo 
campaign, something Cohen vehemently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The second defense official, however, dismissed any suggestion  
that the administration was unhappy with Clark's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton apparently decided to inform Clark quickly, before word  
leaked out, and the general, who was traveling in Europe on 
Tuesday, agreed to yield his post two months early to accommodate 
Ralston. The defense officials said Shelton wanted to give Ralston 
plenty of lead time to gain approval from Clinton and NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston was himself initially a candidate for chairman of the  
Joint Chiefs, but word of a past marital infidelity coming amidst 
widespread publicity about strict military rules against adultery 
raised sufficient political pressure to halt Ralston's promotion to 
the nation's top military post. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Pentagon is faced next summer with nominating  
no fewer than nine senior officers for four-star commands, 
including the Central, Southern, European and Atlantic commands, 
the chief of naval operations and the vice chairmanship post being 
vacated by Ralston. Cohen and Shelton decided this week to get an 
early start on picking the nominees for these jobs, and decided to 
start with Clark's European Command. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket  
manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent in June, boosted by gains 
in autos and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods  
-- items expected to last at least three years -- increased $64 
million last month to a seasonally adjusted $196.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase followed a 0.8 percent gain in May, less than what  
the government previously estimated, and a drop of 2.4 percent in 
orders in April. June's performance marked the sixth increase in 
the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	But June's increase was smaller than many analysts had expected.  
They predicted that orders for manufactured goods would rise 0.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for transportation equipment rose a sizable 2.7 percent  
in June, led by an increase in demand for autos and car parts. U.S. 
automakers are enjoying a good year of sales, hovering near record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in the transportation sector came despite a  
decrease in aircraft and airplane parts, which had led growth in 
the transportation category in May. 
</P>
<P>
	June's rise in orders for transportation products followed a  
hefty 9 percent increase in May, slightly less than the government 
initially estimated, and a sharp 12.5 percent decline in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The transportation sector is often volatile from month to month  
because it includes such big ticket purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices, meanwhile, have risen sharply in recent weeks  
spurred by higher crude oil prices and increased demand caused by 
recovering world economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the strength in transportation, overall orders for  
durable goods would have fallen 0.4 percent in June, the fourth 
decrease in the last sixth months. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, however,  
rose a solid 2.1 percent in June, following a 0.8 percent decline 
in May and a 0.3 percent advance in April. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers have been battered by a global financial  
crisis, which has cut sharply into their overseas sales, and also 
opened them up to stiffer competition from cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the weakness in manufacturing, which has lost 488,000  
jobs since March 1998, the overall economy has continued to do 
exceptionally well, powered by strong consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the  
global turmoil has been steel. Today's report indicated that the 
industry is recovering slowly from the global crisis and may be 
still feeling its lingering effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders  
pretty much hold steady in June, following a percent 0.5 percent 
gain in May and a solid 1.6 percent increase in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery, the category which includes  
computers, however, fell a sharp 5.4 percent in June, the second 
monthly decline in a row. In May, orders dropped 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current  
demand increased 0.9 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Conference Board, a private research group,  
reported that consumer confidence fell in July after rising eight 
straight months to a 30-year-high. Economists said it partly was 
the result of the Federal Reserve Board's June 30 move to nudge up 
interest rates in a pre-emptive strike against inflation.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Jim Abbott Retires at 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Abbott, born without a right hand, set  
fierce standards for himself in becoming a major league pitcher. 
And he knows he is no longer the pitcher he wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after struggling through a comeback the last six months, he  
has quit baseball at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you don't measure up to the standards that you'd like  
to, it's time to look at what you're doing,'' he said Wednesday by 
telephone from his Corona del Mar home. ``So with my inconsistency 
over the past few months, I've had the chance to think about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His decision to retire without fanfare comes less than a week  
after being released by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott pitched for a decade, including a no-hitter against  
Cleveland in 1993 at Yankee Stadium. But he had been just 2-8 with 
a 6.91 ERA since signing a $600,000 free-agent contract with the 
Brewers six month ago. Lifetime, Abbott was 87-108 with an ERA of 
4.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate,'' former California Angels manager  
Marcel Lachemann said. ``But there comes a point for everyone in 
their career when they have to make this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his career, Abbott was saluted by fans and the league  
as an inspiration. But he hopes to be remembered for his game, not 
his handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always sort of said 'I'm just a baseball player,''' he  
said. ``I just wanted to be the best pitcher I could be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that I had to overcome something, I always  
thought that I had to live up to something,'' he said. ``But I 
understand that, in looking back, that will be the first thing that 
is mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he begins a new stage, though he's not sure what's in store.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no game plan,'' he said. ``Instead of forcing something  
quickly, I'll take a step back with my wife to see how we feel, 
then follow our hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mocked as ``Crab'' by young playmates who were uncomfortable  
with his unformed right hand, Abbott learned to shut out adversity 
and focus when on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was too concerned about what I was doing on the field to be  
concerned about what people were thinking in the stands,'' he 
recalled. ``I always did the best I could in terms of winning that 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott's signature pitching style dazzled fans. He would brace  
his mitt under his right arm while pitching, then slip his hand 
into the glove after he released the ball and be ready to catch 
before the ball reached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I was curious to see how he did it,'' said New York  
Mets third baseman Robin Ventura, who met Abbott during tryouts for 
the 1988 Olympic team. ``But quickly it became this guy is a great 
pitcher and you don't think about the fact that he only has one 
hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he's sad about Abbott's retirement, ``but obviously  
what he accomplished was more than what a regular player did. He 
gave people who face similar problems every day hope and 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His handicap was obvious, but to do that at the major league  
level was very inspirational. It was a burden. It made the job even 
harder,'' Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him,'' said Willie Fraser, who pitched with  
Abbott for the Angels in 1989-1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he had had enough,'' Fraser said of his friend  
and neighbor. ``He had a great career. He had everything to be 
proud of. He wasn't having as much fun doing it, not this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was California's pick in the first round of the 1988  
draft, but he did not join the team right away because he was busy 
pitching the Olympic team to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the 1989 season with the Angels, one of only a few  
players never to spend a single day in the minors. He pitched for 
the Angels for four years before being traded to the Yankees for 
three prospects, then signed with the White Sox as a free agent in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was traded back to the Angels, who released him after a  
series of shaky starts in 1997 spring training. He signed a minor 
league deal with the Angels in 1998, then on Jan. 27, joined the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott didn't bat in a regular season game until he joined the  
Brewers. He got his first hit in June during a game with the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers manager Phil Garner called Abbott ``one class  
individual,'' adding, ``that doesn't belie his competitive nature, 
but he's very much a gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former teammate Mark Langston, now with Cleveland, called Abbott  
``one of my favorite people on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how anybody could not have rooted for a guy like  
Jim,'' Langston said. ``To overcome what he did ... what an 
unbelievable guy and what a great athlete.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Linebacker Peterson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts' list of  
holdouts was cut in half when linebacker Mike Peterson agreed to a 
four-year contract, his agent said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Steve Weinberg said the deal for the second-round pick was  
completed in the afternoon and that Peterson was en route from 
Florida to join the team for its trip to Champaign, Ill., where it 
will practice and scrimmage with the St. Louis Rams this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Jim Polian was out of town and no team  
representative was available to confirm the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg said substantial progress was made Tuesday during talks  
involving himself, Polian, senior vice president Bob Terpening and 
David Canter, Peterson's co-agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a big breakthrough. It shows what can happen  
when four guys put their heads together,'' Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, the 36th overall pick in the draft, will earn in  
excess of $3 million for the length of the contract,'' Weinberg 
said, adding that the agreement called for a signing bonus of more 
than $1 million and a reporting bonus of about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to this contract is it will allow for Mike to be paid  
incentives depending on how he plays. That's what Mike wanted. He 
wants the chance to show the Indianapolis fans what he can do and 
is ready to go to work,'' Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fair contract for both sides. It gives Mike the  
chance to prove himself. If he does produce, he'll be the highest 
paid second-rounder in this year's draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora didn't confirm the signing, but said Peterson  
will be behind his teammates when he joins the team for Thursday's 
two practice sessions. The 6-foot-2, 229-pound former Florida star 
missed nine practices since the team reported to training camp 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A starter in 11 games for Florida last season, Peterson had 249  
tackles in 42 games with the Gators. He is expected to challenge 
veteran Andre Royal for the starting weak-side linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was no news of progress in talks to get  
first-round draft pick Edgerrin James into camp. Leigh Steinberg, 
James' agent, has not responded to numerous telephone messages left 
by The Associated Press and Polian has not discussed the 
negotiations publicly since Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Americans Stun Cubans in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- For the first time in 12 years, the  
U.S. baseball team beat the world champion Cubans, scoring five 
runs in the ninth inning Wednesday for a 10-5 victory at the Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States did it with a group of minor leaguers, few of  
whom are top major league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	One player who will get a long look from the highest level,  
though, is Marcus Jensen. His three-run homer broke a 5-5 tie and 
helped the Americans clinch a berth in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also soothed some of the pain from an opening 7-6  
loss to Canada, a game the Americans led 6-3 in the 11th inning. 
And it showed the United States has as good a shot as anyone to 
make the baseball finals here, which would secure a berth in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Cubans, who split two exhibition games with the  
Baltimore Orioles earlier this year, it was a stunning defeat. 
Their last loss to the United States was on July 4, 1996, 8-4 in 
Norfolk, Va., during a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last significant loss was in the 1987 Pan Ams at  
Indianapolis, a 6-4 American win in the preliminary round. Cuba 
went on to win the gold there, beating the Americans in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the U.S. team led almost all the way. When Cuba tied  
it 3-3, Craig Paquette's two-run homer in seventh gave the 
Americans another lead. But Cuba's Isacc Martinez hit a wind-aided, 
two-out two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. right fielder Peter Bergeron then made a key play when he  
threw out a potential go-ahead run at the plate after an overthrow 
down the right field line. German Mesa tried to score from first on 
the play and the throw to catcher Jensen left the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette led off the ninth with a single and Milton Bradley  
bunted. Paquette was called out at second on a throw from pitcher 
Maels Rodriguez, even though Mesa bobbled the ball. U.S. manager 
Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Zuber then walked and Jensen, who hit two home runs in a  
victory over Mexico on Tuesday, delivered his long shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Dave Roberts and Adam Kennedy made it  
10-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Defections and ejections were the story elsewhere, and Olympic  
gold medalist Donovan Bailey finally showed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more Cubans -- a shooter and softball coach -- have sought  
asylum in Canada, according to sources close to the Cuban team. 
They left the delegation earlier this week, said the sources, who 
would not provide their names. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third and fourth Cubans to seek asylum at the  
games. Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before 
the games got started. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde 
also has sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive 
as media attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer turned ugly when police had to rush in to rescue referee  
Rich Grady, who ejected four Guatemalans and both coaches in 
Canada's 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players from Guatemala rushed toward a retreating Grady  
following the final ejection. His assistants and several police 
officers formed a circle around Grady, and they waited for the 
field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, the Pan Ams poster boy who has been roundly criticized  
for not running in the 100 meters, ran on the opening leg of 
Canada's 400 relay team in Wednesday's semifinals and helped his 
team record the fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe my teammates,'' said Bailey, who does not feel he owed  
anything more to the games' organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion in the 100. ``I'm not stung by 
the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the lone early track final, Cuba's Magalys Garcia won the  
women's heptathlon with 6,290 points. Americans Shelia Burrell and 
Nicole Haynes finished 2-3.

Maels Rodriguez, even though Mesa bobbled the ball. U.S. manager 
Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Zuber then walked and Jensen, who hit two home runs in a  
victory over Mexico on Tuesday, delivered his long shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Dave Roberts and Adam Kennedy made it  
10-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Defections and ejections were the story elsewhere, and Olympic  
gold medalist Donovan Bailey finally showed at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more Cubans -- a shooter and softball coach -- have sought  
asylum in Canada, according to sources close to the Cuban team. 
They left the delegation earlier this week, said the sources, who 
would not provide their names. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the third and fourth Cubans to seek asylum at the  
games. Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before 
the games got started. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde 
also has sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive 
as media attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer turned ugly when police had to rush in to rescue referee  
Rich Grady, who ejected four Guatemalans and both coaches in 
Canada's 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players from Guatemala rushed toward a retreating Grady  
following the final ejection. His assistants and several police 
officers formed a circle around Grady, and they waited for the 
field to clear before escorting him away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, the Pan Ams poster boy who has been roundly criticized  
for not running in the 100 meters, ran on the opening leg of 
Canada's 400 relay team in Wednesday's semifinals and helped his 
team record the fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe my teammates,'' said Bailey, who does not feel he owed  
anything more to the games' organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion in the 100. ``I'm not stung by 
the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the lone early track final, Cuba's Magalys Garcia won the  
women's heptathlon with 6,290 points. Americans Shelia Burrell and 
Nicole Haynes finished 2-3.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Turn Good Cell Cancerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time, scientists have created a cancerous human  
cell by genetically altering a normal one in the laboratory -- a 
breakthrough that could speed the development of drugs that wipe 
out tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers know that cancer is caused by genes turned bad, and  
they have been trying to develop drugs that fix these flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	But up to now, they have been fumbling in the dark: They aren't  
sure exactly which combinations of flaws cause the many types of 
cancer. Nor do they know precisely which drugs repair which faulty 
genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with this latest breakthrough, they will be able to create  
specific genetic flaws in the lab and then try to find drugs that 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, they can use this breakthrough to work backwards and  
determine which flaws cause which types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was led by Dr. Robert Weinberg of the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical 
Research. It was reported in Thursday's issue of the science 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provides a laboratory tool, and it's a significant one,''  
said Curt Harris, chief of the National Cancer Institute's human 
carcinogenesis lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Moshe Yaniv, a cancer researcher at France's Pasteur Institute,  
called Weinberg's work a landmark paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is an important step. Understanding cancer is an  
important step,'' Yaniv said. ``But we should not give people the 
impression that we're going to cure cancer next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have previously been able to turn normal human cells  
cancerous using chemicals and X-rays. But that is a scattershot 
approach: The scientists have no idea exactly what kind of genetic 
flaws might result. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg's research is part of a relatively new approach to  
treating cancer that is more like a rifle than a shotgun. 
Scientists believe that attacking the underlying genetic flaws 
would not only be more effective but would also spare patients the 
side effects caused by today's chemotherapy drugs, which assault 
both cancerous cells and healthy ones. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen gene-targeting drugs are already in the testing  
pipeline. Earlier research by Weinberg helped pave the way for 
Herceptin, a government-approved drug that targets the genetic 
flaws that cause breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Genes are the blueprints that tell a cell when to divide and  
when to die. Often, when a gene turns bad, it triggers uncontrolled 
growth, but genes called tumor suppressors step in to stop it. It's 
when these tumor suppressors also turn bad that tumors develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg built his cancer cell by first inserting a  
gene-turned-bad called ras that causes cells to grow incessantly. 
Then he disabled two tumor-suppressing proteins with another bad 
gene. Finally, he added a telomerase catalyst, which allows cells 
to continue dividing indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers can now look for drugs that would, for example,  
restore the tumor suppressors or intercept the telomerase catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``One can use this model now to identify in a rational way drugs  
that are targeted to those pathways,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	In creating this cancer cell, the researchers started with skin  
and kidney tissue, but they do not believe it is like any cancer 
that exists in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	There are major types of cancer, such as breast cancer or colon  
cancer, and then sub-groups that may have slightly different 
genetic flaws. Researchers know some of the flaws that cause, say, 
breast cancer, but not all of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Simply taking cancerous tissue from a patient and examining it  
for genetic flaws would be near impossible because there are 
hundreds of thousands of genes in every cell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cell is still very much a black box. We've rubbed away  
some of the outside of it, but the middle is still unclear,'' said 
Bill Hahn, a clinical oncologist involved in MIT's research. 
</P>
<P>
	But by using this latest breakthrough, scientists can work  
backwards. They can take, say, human breast cells, genetically 
alter them and see what happens. That way, they might identify some 
of the major genetic changes that cause breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Soar on High Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Prices of gasoline futures contracts rose to 21-month highs  
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as government and 
industry reports showed falling inventories and high demand during 
a peak driving period. 
</P>
<P>
	On other commodity markets, platinum futures prices plunged,  
while favorable Midwestern weather forecasts drove down corn and 
soybeans futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline futures prices climbed to their highest levels  
since October 1997 as the U.S. Department of Energy released a 
report showing declines in crude and gasoline stockpiles last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the industry's American Petroleum Institute reported  
that demand for gasoline rose last week. The holiday travel period 
between Memorial Day and Labor Day generally sees high gasoline 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst with AG Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in  
St. Louis, said the falling inventory numbers coupled with summer 
car trips have sent energy futures soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand's up, inventories are tightening and crude oil is going  
along for the ride,'' O'Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have been on an upward trend this year, driven  
in part by an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum 
Exporting Countries and non-OPEC oil producers to reduce world 
output. A report this month showed the countries were at between 93 
percent and 95 percent compliance with their accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for September delivery rose 16 cents to $20.54 a barrel;  
August heating oil rose 0.74 cent to 51.45 cents a gallon; August 
unleaded gasoline rose 1.73 cents to 63.08 cents a gallon; August 
natural gas rose 0.25 cent to $2.601 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
September rose 21 cents to $19.34 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum futures prices dropped to a nine-month low of $341 a  
troy ounce during early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
but rebounded slightly before closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Platinum prices fell sharply early Wednesday in Asia following  
news of an agreement between the Central Bank of Russia and the 
giant Norilsk Nickel mine to coordinate palladium sales. The 
Norilsk mine accounts for most of the palladium and platinum that 
is exported to world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak palladium prices have led to long liquidation in the  
platinum market. Palladium prices saw little change on news of the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	October platinum fell $5.90 to $342.50 per troy ounce. September  
palladium was up $1.20 to $339.55 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans futures prices fell further on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid forecasts for cooler, wetter weather in key 
Midwestern growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service forecasts released during trading  
showed temperatures tapering off in portions of the Midwest next 
week as rains were expected to move in, giving parched crops some 
relief. The forecasts -- delayed because of a computer glitch -- 
erased early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices rose on expectations of increased demand,  
including possible exports to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.73 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.07 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.13 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 6 1/2 cents to 
$4.28 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Falls on New J.D. Power List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saturn's five-year reign at the top of a closely  
watched survey of automotive sales satisfaction ended with the 
small-car unit of General Motors Corp. falling below five other 
makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers of five luxury brands were more satisfied with their  
dealers than were Saturn buyers in the annual J.D. Power and 
Associates study. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac, Jaguar and Volvo tied for first place, followed by  
Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz. Saturn finished in a tie with BMW and 
Lexus, according to the market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn, the small-car unit of General Motors Corp., apparently  
fell out of the top spot because more customers were feeling 
pressured during the purchase of their new car. J.D. Power said the 
percentage of buyers under pressure increased to 18 percent from 13 
percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We noted what the customer interpreted as being a little more  
negotiation with the deal, especially with the trade-in or the 
financing and insurance,'' Loretta Seymour, J.D. Power's director 
of sales satisfaction research, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That came as a surprise to Saturn officials. Saturn's success  
has been based in large part on its friendly, down-home atmosphere 
and no-haggle pricing, which makes the sales process faster and 
less stressful. It has attracted a loyal following of owners and 
repeat buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Tom Wilkinson said Saturn's own research showed its  
customers remained pleased with the Saturn sales process. He said 
officials planned to meet with J.D. Power ``to help us decide what 
continuous improvement steps we might need to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power speculated that lower sales at Saturn in the past  
year have put more pressure on Saturn's sales staff to maintain 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their inventories have been rising over the past year,'' Ms.  
Seymour said. ``So, yes, there is probably more pressure within the 
Saturn dealerships to go after the sale. But I think also what 
might be contributing to that loss of sales is the fact that they 
have a product that really has been around for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn sells just one line of subcompact cars, but plans to add  
a midsize model in the 2000 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that overall customer satisfaction with the  
experience of buying a new vehicle remained virtually unchanged. 
But more customers reported they were satisfied with the price they 
paid, a reflection of competitive pressures on the industry to keep 
price increases to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor cited was the increased amount of pricing  
information available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the brands that ranked above the industry average, 11 were  
U.S. divisions of GM, Ford Motor Co. or DaimlerChrysler AG, eight 
were European and two were Japanese. Fifteen automakers ranked 
below the industry average. They included Toyota, Volkswagen, 
Dodge, Ford, Honda and Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power, based in Agoura Hills, Calif., surveyed 42,700  
buyers of 1999 cars, minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles 
bought in January or February. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm, which sells information to the industry and licenses  
its awards for use in advertising, issues several annual surveys 
that are closely watched by automakers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Contempt Ruling in Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a federal court  
to hold Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. in civil and 
criminal contempt Tuesday for setting up a joint venture allegedly 
prohibited by a 1994 court order. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first criminal contempt case in 15 years to grow  
out of an alleged violation of a court decree that resolved the 
government's objections to a corporate merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In a petition filed in U.S. District Court here, the  
department's antitrust division said Smith and Schlumberger formed 
a joint venture in drilling fluids, which are used to control well 
pressure and improve drilling in oil and natural gas wells. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies' flagrant and contemptuous disregard of a  
binding consent decree is wholly unacceptable,'' said Assistant 
Attorney General Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 23, 1993, the department filed a lawsuit to block the  
merger of Dresser Industries Inc. and Baroid Corp. At that time, 
M-I Drilling Fluids, in which Dresser held a 64 percent interest, 
and Baroid were the two largest producers of drilling fluids in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	An April 12, 1994, federal court order required Dresser to sell  
either its share of M-I or Baroid's drilling fluids subsidiary. 
Dresser sold its M-I interest to Smith, and Smith agreed to be 
bound by the court order. 
</P>
<P>
	That order barred Smith from selling the divested share of M-I  
to, or combining that drilling fluid business with, the drilling 
fluid operations of Schlumberger and certain other companies, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's petition said that nevertheless Smith sold  
Schlumberger a 40 percent interest in the joint venture and 
combined M-I with Schlumberger's drilling fluid operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith willfully violated the court order and Schlumberger  
willfully acted in concert with Smith despite its knowledge of the 
ban in the court decree, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government asked the court to find both companies in civil  
and criminal contempt, to fine them for each day they are in 
contempt and to impose criminal fines as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil contempt is designed to force compliance with court orders  
and judges can use fines to achieve that. Criminal contempt is a 
punishment -- a fine in the case of a corporation -- for having 
violated a court order. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last similar government action, the department brought a  
criminal contempt charge in 1983 against H.P. Hood Inc. for 
combining with and acquiring control of three New England dairies 
in violation of a 1981 consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is headquartered in Houston. Schlumberger's U.S.  
headquarters are in New York; its oil field service business is 
based in Sugarland, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Agency Chided on Pipeline Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agency that oversees pipelines has  
been slow to respond to safety recommendations from the National 
Transportation Safety Board, the board's chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of action by the Research and Special Programs  
Administration ``continues to place the American people at risk,'' 
Jim Hall told a House subcommittee responsible for pipelines and 
hazardous material. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel met in response to a fatal pipeline accident last  
month in Bellingham, Wash. As well, it is preparing to reauthorize 
a pipeline safety law next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel Chairman Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., said Hall's statements  
were troubling and could prompt legislation or other action to spur 
the federal pipeline agency to act on safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``clearly had a grossly unacceptable record of  
adopting recommendations,'' Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board is investigating the cause of a June 10  
pipeline rupture that spilled 250,000 gallons of gasoline into 
Whatcom Creek in Bellingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 10-year-old boys who were playing with a lighter ignited the  
blast, killing themselves and an 18-year-old man fishing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said the pipeline agency accepts only slightly more than  
two-thirds of the board's safety recommendations, the lowest rate 
of any agency within the Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a process here that seems to be being ignored,'' Hall  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, in 1987 the board recommended that the agency  
require regular training programs for pipeline personnel. But for 
11 years the agency failed to act and in 1998 the board considered 
its recommendation rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the board recommended new requirements for a rapid  
shutdown of pipelines in emergencies, but that action was not 
taken, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kelley Coyner, the agency's administrator, said acceptance  
of board recommendations has been improving in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	She also touted the agency's overall pipeline safety record,  
saying mishaps have steadily declined in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the rate of decline has slowed in the past decade, it  
remains moving in the right direction,'' Coyner told the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry representatives called for no drastic changes in the  
nation's pipeline safety law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bellingham disaster does not represent anything close to  
the norm in our industry,'' said Steven Ball of the Association of 
Oil Pipe Lines. ``It should not precipitate drastic changes in 
public policy. Bellingham notwithstanding, oil pipelines are safe 
and getting safer.''

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Medals Scarce in Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- There was no more gold for the United  
States in gymnastics. Nor many other medals, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was plenty for Cuba's Eric Lopez, and for American  
track and field athletes, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	After entering the Pan American Games with what appeared to be  
the strongest team in women's gymnastics, the United States left 
with just four medals. Only one of them came Tuesday night in the 
individual event finals, a bronze by Morgan White in the uneven 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. hopes for additional medals were jolted when Jennie  
Thompson, who's especially strong in the floor exercise, injured 
her ankle in the vault, the first event, and had to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, White left Winnipeg Arena with a smile. She did win the  
all-around on Monday night and helped the United States win the 
silver medal in Saturday's team competition, though the Americans 
had been favored for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very consistent the whole meet,'' said White, at 16 the  
youngest member of the U.S. team. ``I had no falls. I feel really 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proud enough that White felt she gave herself a major boost for  
the U.S. championships next month. Then come the world team trials, 
followed by the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	And of course, there's the Olympics next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's still a long, long time away,'' White said. ``But with  
each meet I do, it builds up my confidence even more. Maybe I can 
be ready by then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. coach Mary Lee Tracy thinks White will be in the hunt when  
the Olympic berths are decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morgan did a great job,'' Tracy said. ``She has to concentrate  
on getting some bigger skills and learning some new things, but the 
biggest thing is she made a statement in an international meet that 
she is a contender and a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered by a vocal crowd of 6,116, Canadian gymnasts won three  
of the four gold medals in the women's competition and added two 
silvers. Yvonne Tousek won the uneven bars and floor exercise and 
Lise Leveille won the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
	But not even that performance could match Lopez, who dominated  
the men's side. Lopez won the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars 
and was the silver medalist in the high bar. That gave him six 
medals for the games, five gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez earlier won the all-around and helped Cuba win the gold in  
the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men had to compete without Chris Young, who left the  
team because of a family emergency, and were shut out in the 
individual finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the frequent trips by Lopez to the victory stand, the  
United States stretched its lead in the overall medals race. The 
United States has 83, far ahead of Cuba's 49 and Canada's 44. 
Americans have 31 golds, with Cuba at 21 and Canada at 14. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States collected three more gold medals at the  
track, the baseball team showed its resilience with a 5-1 
early-morning win over Mexico. The victory came only hours after 
the Americans blew a three-run lead in a shocking 7-6 loss to 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was huge for us,'' U.S. manager Buddy Bell said. ``It  
might have been best for us to come out at 9 a.m. and get after it 
before yesterday's game was out of our system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up: world champion Cuba today. The Cubans won their second  
straight, routing Brazil 10-1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members of the old guard on a relatively young U.S. team  
won the track gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammer thrower Lance Deal and women's shot putter Connie  
Price-Smith both repeated as Pan Ams champions. Deal, 37, threw 261 
feet, 2 inches to break the games record and lead a 1-2 U.S. 
finish. Price-Smith, also 37, won her fourth Pan Ams medal with a 
throw of 62-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of pressure,'' Price-Smith said. ``You have to  
defend your title from the last games. The field was very strong. I 
expected to win and prepared to give myself the best possible 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Manson, 31, the oldest competitor in the pole vault, cleared  
18-4 1/2 for this third straight gold medal in the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow,'' Manson said. ``That's cool, that's neat. I really  
wanted to come here and get a third gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans also did well in freestyle wrestling, which had some  
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Cuba's Yoel Romero in overtime at 85 kilograms,  
American Les Gutches lightly pounded the back of the Cuban with his 
hands. Both stood up and began yelling at each other, with Gutches, 
of Corvallis, Ore., taunting Romero and screaming in his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Romero pointed his finger in Gutches' face and yelled right back  
before the referee separated them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did the same thing to me the last time,'' said Gutches, who  
lost to Romero in their two most recent meetings. ``In Spokane, the 
love taps went the other way. I'm not proud of it, but it goes both 
ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gutches and three other U.S. wrestlers advanced to gold medal  
matches tonight, meaning they're assured of at least silver. The 
others were Joe Williams at 76 kilos, Dominic Black at 97 kilos and 
Stephen Neal at 130 kilos. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more Americans made it to the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there were more bright spots than bad,'' U.S. coach  
John Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Extend Miller's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Coach and general manager Cheryl Miller signed a  
multiyear contract extension with the Phoenix Mercury, the WNBA 
club announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials would not say how much Miller is being paid or  
how long the extension is for, but The Arizona Republic reported 
earlier this week that the new deal would add three years at 
between $225,000 and $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix, reported last  
week that the contract would cover two years and would be between 
$250,000 and $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Miller led Phoenix to the WNBA playoffs in the  
league's inaugural year in 1997 and into the finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no place I'd rather be than in Phoenix,'' Miller said  
in a statement. ``This is a first class organization and I know 
that my job isn't done until I lead my team back to the WNBA Finals 
and bring the championship trophy to Phoenix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Colangelo, the team's president, said Miller is the right  
person to lead the team now and into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has compiled a 43-34 regular season record and a 13-4  
record in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But she has also been ejected from three games and been fined a  
record $5,000 for criticizing the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercury got off to a rough 3-10 start this season but have  
begun a turnaround in the last several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Astros Stars Want Their Mitts Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio think their gloves  
have been Rocky Mountain hijacked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros infielders' mitts were reported missing after they  
arrived in Denver on Monday for a four-game series against the 
Colorado Rockies. Bagwell thinks the gloves were stolen somewhere 
between Denver International Airport and Coors Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like too much of a coincidence for Craig's and my  
glove to be missing,'' Bagwell said Tuesday. ``(Monday) I heard his 
glove was missing. I went to get my batting gloves, and it 
(Bagwell's mitt) wasn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Biggio gets a new glove each season and carries a spare,  
Bagwell had used his for ``four or five years,'' he said. He didn't 
own a backup, so he's using teammate Bill Spiers' glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell made an error Monday night, marking the first time in  
six years that he has committed errors in back-to-back games. He 
was using his own glove Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell, who had five errors entering Wednesday, told the  
Houston Chronicle he laments having to break in a new glove halfway 
through the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of your life. It's a tool you use a lot,'' he said.  
``I wish they would have taken my spikes or my batting gloves 
instead.''

<HEADLINE> Mystery Man? It's William H. Macy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several years ago, William H. Macy faced a grim  
dilemma: Either speak up forcefully or risk losing the role of a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy had auditioned early -- and twice again -- to play the lead  
in Joel and Ethan Coen's next film, an absurd gothic tale set in 
Minnesota. The filmmakers, however, wouldn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy decided to speak up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I threatened to shoot their dog,'' he says with a smile.  
``Yeah, I know. It really wasn't one of my proudest moments. But I 
wanted the role so desperately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got it, oh you betcha -- and with no loss of canine life. The  
film, of course, was the hit ``Fargo'' and, for Macy, that's when 
things changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, everything. Night and day. I was ratified! I was  
sanctified! I'm a made guy,'' he says. ``People that had liked my 
work before now have permission to say it out loud and actually 
hire me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he's watching all the fuss -- the angling  
photographers, the buzzing publicists and the reporters hanging on 
his every word -- with a cheeky smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``So,'' he asks happily, ``what took you guys so long?''  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Macy took his own time. Raised in Georgia, he went to  
college in West Virginia with the intention of becoming a vet. 
``There's a theme in my life: animal husbandry,'' he jokes when 
reminded of his threat against the Coens' dog. 
</P>
<P>
	But acting, not Alsatians, was his dream. Macy transferred to  
Goddard College in Vermont, where he struck up a friendship with 
theater guru David Mamet, a man he affectionately calls ``a god.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy spend most of the 1970s on stage in Chicago, where he was a  
founder of the St. Nicholas Theater and an originator of Mamet 
roles in plays like ``American Buffalo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These were far from glamorous times. Macy, who would help hammer  
scenery during the day and perform at night, was living on good 
humor, cheap cheese and income from commercial voice-overs. 
</P>
<P>
	``My big claim to fame was, 'Secret: Strong enough for a man but  
made for a woman.' I was the guy that said that for a while,'' he 
says. ``I did a lot of research on armpits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Macy showed up to read a single word: ``It was a  
commercial where the guy would say, 'Thanks!' And they would call 
70 men in to go, 'Thanks!' ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived in a low level of rage the entire time,'' he says.  
``I'd spend all week being told, 'No.' Week, after week, after 
week. Then some producer would turn to me and say, 'Bill, put a 
smile in your voice.''' 
</P>
<P>
	By the '80s, Macy, who had gone broke twice, started appearing  
on TV and in films such as ``Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' ``The 
Client'' and ``Ghosts of Mississippi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there already was an actor named Bill Macy, he went for  
a time by his initials, W.H. Macy. That moniker was abandoned when 
he realized it confused the biggest VIPs: casting directors. 
</P>
<P>
	With a face that sags and bulges like a sack of Idaho potatoes,  
Macy's hangdog demeanor made him one of Hollywood's better losers, 
an actor who wore the shirt of despair as if he owned a closet full 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was pretty young when I realized we all think we're  
flawed. All of us share one thing: We look around at the rest of 
the world and think, 'Everybody knows what's going on, everyone 
belongs here except me. I'm a fraud.' I think that's one of the 
things that made me get into acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work came steadily in during the early 1990s. There were TV  
movies, lots of plays in New York and a recurring role on ``ER'' as 
the terse chief of surgery Dr. David Morgenstern. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, few knew who this guy was -- a fact made clear when he  
arrived on the set of ``Mr. Holland's Opus'' to play an uptight 
vice principal who must take over Richard Dreyfuss' unruly high 
school music class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a big voice because I've been on stage a long time, and  
I screamed, 'Sit down!' It was so big that some of the girls 
giggled out of embarrassment. I said, 'Sit down! You think this is 
funny?''' 
</P>
<P>
	When the scene was finished, and the crew was resetting the  
lights, the girls piped up with a question: ``Are you really a vice 
principal?'' they asked. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he told them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh,'' they replied. ``Then what do you do?''  
</P>
<P>
	Macy's anonymity wouldn't last, particularly after he -- ahem --  
convinced the Coens that he was right for the ``Fargo'' part of 
Jerry Lundegaard, a weaselly car salesman stuck in an unraveling 
murder scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy's polite desperation -- ``Hey! I'm cooperating here!'' -- and  
heartbreaking glumness, all delivered in an irresistible Minnesota 
accent, had folks saying, ``Ah, jeez!'' and ``Yah, sure!'' for most 
of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friend Mamet was talking to this guy who said, 'What a  
great film! Frances McDormand, wasn't she great? And what are the 
odds of finding that guy up there? What are the odds of finding a 
car dealer who could learn all those lines?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Macy took that as ``a wonderful compliment.''  
</P>
<P>
	After earning an Oscar nomination, the limelight beckoned: He  
played a man unable to cope with the garish sexuality of ``Boogie 
Nights,'' took a bullet for the president aboard ``Air Force One'' 
and tackled the anguished honey-I'm-home dad in ``Pleasantville.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably gravitate to those types of roles because, with my

	Now, at 49, Macy finally gets to play a real hero, a superhero.  
Well, actually, his character in ``Mystery Men'' is still a loser --

<P>
	In other words, the typical Macy role.

Bill can sell that! He can make it really poignant.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And Macy knows why.  
</P>
<P>
	``We just love rooting for people as they struggle. That's what

'You know what? It's me. Whether I like it or not, there's nobody 
else.'''

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Return to Work in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a week of family mourning over the  
deaths of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife and sister-in-law in a 
plane crash, the father and son Kennedys in Congress are slowly 
resuming their Washington routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Kennedy and Bessette families issued a joint  
statement Tuesday acknowledging the public outpouring of ``love and 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They asked those wishing to honor Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy and Lauren Bessette to make charitable contributions, bring 
flowers or prayers to local hospitals or community centers, or 
spend time with friends or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy we have suffered by the loss of John and Carolyn  
and Lauren has taught us again how important it is to show care and 
concern for the people we love and for those who need our help and 
support,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and his son, Rep. Patrick  
Kennedy of Rhode Island, both returned to the Capitol on Monday 
night to cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate action was slow Tuesday, and Sen. Kennedy spent the  
morning in his private Capitol office, meeting with staff on policy 
issues senators are to consider before the summer recess begins 
Aug. 6. He also attended the Democratic senators' weekly private 
luncheon and then spent the afternoon in his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy has had more public events than his father over the  
past two days -- thanking the citizens of Rhode Island on Monday for 
their support over the previous week. Yet he declined media 
requests Tuesday for interviews, a rarity for the usually 
accessible lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take a little while to get back up to full speed,''  
said his top aide, Tony Marcella. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kennedy met Tuesday with staffers and outside groups,  
worked at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the 
fund-raising organization he chairs -- and attended the House 
Democrats' afternoon caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. and his passengers were killed July 16 when his private  
plane crashed into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Both lawmakers spent most of last week in Massachusetts.  
Together with Sen. Kennedy's older son, Edward Jr., they were 
aboard the Navy salvage ship USS Grasp when the bodies were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' expressions of sympathy, ``made an enormous  
difference in my family's ability to cope with this very tragic 
loss,'' Rep. Kennedy said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Fumes Sicken Controllers in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- More air traffic controllers called in sick today  
at the nation's busiest flight control center after a rash of 
illnesses blamed on chemical fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights across the Midwest were delayed Tuesday because so many  
controllers left work. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor flight delays were reported today but were blamed on  
isolated storms rather than the controllers' illnesses, said 
Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen controllers, or 10 percent of the staff on duty,  
called in sick this morning, said Ron Downen, president of the 
National Air Traffic Controllers Association local. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he feared even more would be absent from this  
afternoon's shift, leading him to renew his request that the 
Federal Aviation Administration temporarily close the Chicago Air 
Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora and reroute air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are in jeopardy because the controllers are being  
impaired,'' Downen said. ``We're being told by the FAA to work 
until you start to feel sick. I don't believe that is a safe 
position to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downen said his union also asked the FAA to stop air traffic in  
the region Tuesday for fear of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Tuesday that the agency did  
not close the center because it still had adequate staff to run it. 
</P>
<P>
	Downen said 50 controllers left work Monday and Tuesday and five  
went to a hospital complaining of nausea, blurred vision, headaches 
and rashes. He said one controller temporarily lost his sight while 
monitoring radar. The five were treated at Povena Mercy Center and 
released, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air traffic control center in Aurora, about 35 miles west of  
Chicago, is the country's busiest and directs all traffic in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The illnesses caused delays of up to two hours Tuesday for  
flights into Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, but outbound 
flights were not affected. Traffic flying through the area was 
mostly rerouted to the south, which extended some flight times. 
</P>
<P>
	The fumes came from a nontoxic sealant applied Monday in the  
center's attic, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergen said the agency stopped the sealing work after the  
problem was traced. When the odor remained Tuesday afternoon, 
administrative staff were asked to leave and the control room was 
reconfigured to avoid an area where the odor had concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aurora Fire Department has declared the center safe.

<HEADLINE> Small Business Plight Highlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Roscoe Bartlett says he wants to know why  
a building inspector hasn't taken the federal government to task 
because a granite step outside the Capitol doesn't meet local 
building codes. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing Tuesday that included a reading from the  
Declaration of Independence, Bartlett, R-Md., asked why some parts 
of that bottom step gradually rise to as many as three inches above 
the 7-inch height allowed by District of Columbia's building code. 
</P>
<P>
	A small business would have been ordered to correct it  
immediately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there a double standard applied in the enforcement of  
regulations when the violation is caused by government itself?'' 
Bartlett asked Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman, the man 
responsible for maintaining Capitol buildings and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett said he called the hearing to give small business  
owners a chance to show how heavy a burden excessive government 
regulation is. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those testifying before a Small Business Committee's panel  
on government programs and oversight was Jack Gullo Jr., an 
attorney and part-time mayor of New Windsor, Md. He said he had to 
replace a handicapped access ramp in front of his new law office 
after an inspector declared it was a quarter-inch short of the 
6-foot length required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of this lack of common sense -- $1,000 and one month  
of construction time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great story that illustrates the mindlessness of  
some of these regulations,'' Bartlett said. He quoted a passage 
from the Declaration of Independence, comparing unreasonable 
regulators with the ``swarms of officers'' the nation's founders 
accused King George III of sending to the colonies ``to harass our 
people, and eat out their substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman said that although he is not happy with the height of  
the Capitol step in question, it technically does not violate the 
city's building code. And although Capitol officials follow the 
D.C. government's building code, the city doesn't have the legal 
authority to enforce it on the Capitol, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman also said the stairs in question were replaced three  
years ago after 130 years of wear and tear, and officials intended 
to replicate them as they were originally designed. Construction 
started in 1993, before Congress passed a law making itself subject 
to many of the laws it passes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. code calls for a maximum height of 7 inches for steps for  
new buildings, not existing or historic ones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol grounds officials plan to raise the height of the  
adjoining sidewalk as part of a plan to build a Capitol visitor's 
center, but that project has been delayed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hantman said he could sympathize with small business owners.  
``Local building code officials vary in their interpretations and 
the rigor of their enforcement actions.,'' he said. ``This 
committee's call for a certain degree of common sense is certainly 
appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Rules on Trial Attendance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- In a ruling said to be the first of its  
kind in the nation, the California Supreme Court said a judge was 
wrong to exclude the media and public from parts of a trial over a 
lawsuit filed against actor Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
	In a unanimous decision Tuesday, the court said a California  
judge can close part of a civil trial only if the judge holds a 
special hearing and finds there is an ``overriding interest'' 
supporting closure. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that criminal  
trials must be open to the public and the media, the courts have 
not affirmed a similar constitutional right in civil proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ``will really be followed not only in California,  
but throughout the country,'' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a 
constitutional law professor at the University of Southern 
California. ``That's why it's such an important precedent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the ruling, Chief Justice Ronald George wrote that ``the  
public has an interest in all civil cases, in observing and 
assessing the performance of its public judicial system, and that 
interest strongly supports a general right of access in ordinary 
civil cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court overturned a decision in which Los Angeles Superior  
Court Judge David Schacter had closed part of the 1996 trial of a 
lawsuit filed against Eastwood by an ex-girlfriend, actress Sondra 
Locke. 
</P>
<P>
	Locke had filed a $2 million fraud and contractual interference  
lawsuit against the actor. She claimed her deal to direct films for 
Warner Bros. was a sham backed by Eastwood to get her to drop a 
palimony suit she filed against him. They had been lovers for 13 
years before their breakup in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood and Locke settled the highly publicized lawsuit for an  
undisclosed amount on the fifth day of jury deliberations. However, 
media organizations including the Los Angeles Times and an NBC 
affiliate appealed Schacter's order excluding the public from all 
parts of the trial in which the jury was not present. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that order, the public and reporters were not allowed to  
attend non-jury hearings on subjects such as what evidence should 
be admitted and motions by Eastwood to have the case dismissed. 
Schacter's reasoning was that jurors might learn through the media 
about inadmissible evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Sager, lawyer for the Los Angeles Times, said earlier this  
year that reporters were even excluded from the hearing at which 
she argued against the closure.

<HEADLINE> Smith Hopes Sanders Will Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Although the retirement of Barry  
Sanders makes Emmitt Smith the NFL's active career rushing leader, 
the Dallas Cowboys star hopes his statistical rival returns to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to leave the game, that's his choice,'' Smith  
said Wednesday. ``The only thing I can say is that I wish he 
wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's a back who has many, many more years in front  
of him. This is a very unfortunate situation. Maybe it's only 
temporary. Maybe he might reconsider and come back. Maybe they 
might trade him away. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders leaves with 15,269 career yards, the second-most  
all-time and 1,458 shy of breaking Walter Payton's record. Smith is 
No. 5 on the overall list with 12,566 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see him break the record,'' said Smith, who is  
only 694 yards from passing Tony Dorsett and Eric Dickerson to 
become No. 3. ``I think Barry would've been the first back to break 
the 20,000 barrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Smith is the leading favorite to top Payton. At his career  
average of 89.8 yards per game, he's about 30 games away, putting 
the target date at late in the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a selfish person and only a selfish person would look  
at it that way,'' Smith said. ``He has a great opportunity to do it 
this year. It would be exciting to watch. Hopefully, someday, my 
chance may come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either Smith or Sanders led the NFL in rushing from 1990-97,  
with each taking four titles. Sanders had the best year between 
them with 2,058 yards in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest difference in their careers is the success of  
their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has won three Super Bowls in nine seasons with the  
Cowboys, while Sanders has only advanced as far as the NFC 
Championship once in 10 years with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man has been everything Detroit wanted, but has Detroit  
been everything he needed? Probably not,'' Smith said. ``So, 
frustration and a lot of disappointment is on his side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he and Sanders had never talked about retirement.  
Smith didn't even know about Sanders' announcement until reporters 
asked for his reaction following a morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad for the NFL because they're losing one of the best  
backs in the game, period, and at a young age,'' Smith said. ``I 
wish him well, I really do. And, you know, he can call me any time. 
We can talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith knows what he'd say if Sanders calls.  
</P>
<P>
	``Come on back,'' he said. ``Don't leave me out here to be the  
Lone Ranger.''

<HEADLINE> Pacifica To Reopen Berkeley Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Public radio station KPFA, a longtime  
outlet for radical politics, will reopen Friday -- more than two 
weeks after the management closed it down amid passionate 
disagreements with the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The staffers claimed the station's parent company, the nonprofit  
Pacifica Foundation, wants to make KPFA more mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacifica's board voted Wednesday to reopen the station as a  
``goodwill gesture'' toward ``resolving the conflict'' said Mary 
Frances Berry, Pacifica's Chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacifica will remove itself from the management of the station  
for six months to one year while continuing to mediate some issues 
with the staff, the foundations said in a statement said. No 
details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	KPFA has been in an uproar for weeks, with staffers claiming a  
move is afoot to take their quirky community station mainstream. 
Managers responded by putting all workers on paid leave and locking 
up the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruckus has brought out scores of loyal listeners -- including  
singer Joan Baez and author Alice Walker -- who have demonstrated, 
marched and camped out on the street to show their support for 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Pacifica Foundation have repeatedly said they  
don't plan to sell KPFA, which has a 59,000-watt signal capable of 
reaching much of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, a member of the Pacifica board of directors,  
Pete Bramson, said his colleagues are secretly discussing such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Pacifica did not immediately return a telephone  
call from The Associated Press. Pacifica also owns stations in New 
York, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> 'Runway Incursions' Remain a Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In early April, the pilot of a Korean Air  
plane carrying 362 people had to swerve during his takeoff run to 
avoid hitting an Air China cargo jet that had strayed onto the 
wrong runway at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, an Icelandair jet taking off with 185  
passengers aboard came within 200 feet of an Air France cargo plane 
that had mistakenly turned onto the active runway at Kennedy 
Airport in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Both near-disasters highlight the danger of ``runway  
incursions,'' a problem that a new study finds is increasing 
despite Federal Aviation Administration efforts to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, according to a report by the Transportation Department  
inspector general, there were 325 runway incursions across the 
United States, up 11 percent over the year. The largest share, some 
183 incidents, were caused by pilot mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there were 292 runway incursions in the United States,  
132 of them caused by pilot mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 65 percent of the runway incursions in  
1998 were attributable to general aviation aircraft, which are 
noncommercial, nonmilitary airplanes and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Steketee, spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  
Association, the world's largest general aviation group, said 
Tuesday that the percentage of incursions is not surprising since 
it is roughly the same as the percentage of small aircraft 
operating at airports with control towers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that Los Angeles International Airport had  
the most incursions in 1998 -- 13. That same year, there were 
773,729 takeoffs and landings at the airport, the nation's 
fourth-busiest. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third consecutive year, Lambert Field in St. Louis was  
near the top of the list. It placed second in 1998 with eight 
incursions, up from seven in 1997 and 1996, when it led the list or 
was tied at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Lambert had 503,673 takeoffs and landings, making it  
the 11th busiest airport in the country, according to FAA data. 
</P>
<P>
	While the agency launched a program in 1995 to reduce runway  
incursions, it ``continues to be ineffective in reducing runway 
incursions,'' the inspector general found. 
</P>
<P>
	The report added: ``In our opinion, the FAA's progress in  
reducing runway incursions has been too slow. ... Without immediate 
progress in implementing its plan, it is unlikely that FAA will 
achieve its goal of reducing runway incursions by 15 percent by the 
year 2000 and mitigate the risk of a tragic runway accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA concurred with the bulk of the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're working internally to accomplish the goals of the action  
plan, which includes improvements in runway markings and pilot, 
ground-vehicle operator and controller awareness,'' said agency 
spokesman Fraser Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has started monthly meetings with  
her associate administrators to ensure top-level supervision for 
all facets of the agency's response to the problem, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an agency definition, an incursion occurs any time  
a plane, vehicle, person or object on the ground creates a 
collision hazard with an airplane that is taking off or landing at 
an airport under the supervision of air traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven such accidents dating back to 1972 have claimed 719 lives  
and destroyed 20 aircraft. The National Transportation Safety 
Board, which investigates airplane accidents, has placed reducing 
runway incursions on its annual ``Most Wanted'' list since its 
inception in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Aid Poison Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poison control centers, faced with a financial  
crisis that has forced many to close or reduce services in recent 
years, would benefit from stable funding under a bill a Senate 
committee approved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would authorize $138 million over five years to fund  
local poison control centers, pay for a national media campaign and 
create a nationwide toll-free telephone number for the sick or 
injured to access their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee  
approved the bill by voice vote, sending it to the full Senate for 
a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is pending in the House Commerce Committee.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 2.1 million poisonings were reported to poison centers  
in 1997, the most recent year for which figures are available, said 
Rose Ann Soloway, administrator of the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lack of reliable funding during the past two decades has  
forced many poison centers to cut services or shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is almost no federal money that supports poison centers  
right now and there is no direct federal funding to poison 
centers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Poison centers serving portions of Minnesota and western North  
Carolina closed within the past year because of funding 
difficulties, Soloway said. A third center, in South Dakota, closed 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trend has jeopardized the capacity of poison control  
centers nationwide to provide lifesaving services to all 
Americans,'' said DeWine. 
</P>
<P>
	There currently are fewer than 75 such centers, which get most  
of their funds from states and the hospitals that house them and 
use their services. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with fiscal year 2000, which begins Oct. 1, and running  
through fiscal 2004, DeWine's bill would authorize: 
</P>
<P>
	--$125 million, or $25 million annually, to award federal grants  
to certified regional poison control centers. These centers meet 
standards set by the American Association of Poison Control 
Centers, operate 24 hours a day and are staffed by professional 
toxicologists instead of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	--$10 million, or $2 million annually, to establish and maintain  
the national, toll-free telephone number to be used to access the 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	--$3 million, or $600,000 annually, for the public education  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 632.

<HEADLINE> Barry Sanders Says He Will Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders is quitting football despite  
the near certainty of becoming the NFL's career rushing leader this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to remain  
in it. I have searched my heart through and through and feel 
comfortable with this decision,'' Sanders said in a statement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Lions running back arrived in London today on a  
flight from Detroit and said at Gatwick Airport, ``I'm going into 
retirement and I don't see my plans changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he came to London, Sanders said, ``I don't know the  
right way to retire. This is just my way of doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old star said he would spend a couple days in London  
before going to Amsterdam and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lions spokesman said general manager Chuck Schmidt had been in  
contact with Sanders' agents. Sanders retired without speaking to 
Detroit coach Bobby Ross or anyone else on the team but said he 
leaves ``on good terms with everyone in the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference this afternoon, Ross refused to speculate  
on why Sanders retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're very, very disappointed because we lose a  
great player,'' Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news stunned the Lions.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge hole missing right now,'' wide receiver Johnnie  
Morton said at practice today. ``I think we're in a shock state of 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders will be put on the Lions' reserve list after notifying  
the club of his retirement. However, an NFL spokeswoman said he can 
be activated any time this season until Dec. 5. If he joins the 
team before then, he can play in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish he would have given a hint,'' quarterback Charlie Batch  
said. ``I'm sure the doors aren't closed. ... He's got a lot of 
good years left in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders would be in position for a return because he stays in  
top shape whether he is working out with the team or not. However, 
those who know Sanders regard him as a man of his word, and 
unlikely to waver once he makes a major decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I know about Barry, when he makes up his mind, he  
makes up his mind,'' Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by his agents to talk him out of retiring have been as  
futile as a defender trying to arm-tackle him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not involved in a salary dispute of any kind,'' Sanders  
said. ``If I had played this season, I would have earned a more 
than satisfactory salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997, all  
related to contract negotiations. He has played two years on a 
six-year, $36 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is only 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter Payton's NFL  
career rushing record. One of Sanders' agents, David Ware, said the 
prospect of the record was not enough to change his client's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual accolades have never been the things that motivated  
Barry,'' Ware told WWJ radio in Detroit today. ``Money has never 
been something that motivated Barry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders rushed for 1,491 yards last season, ending a streak of  
four consecutive 1,500 yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably  
would not return for the 1999-2000 season,'' he said. ``I also felt 
that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my 
feelings and make sure that my feelings were backed with 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about Sanders' reasons for leaving include the  
Lions' 5-11 finish last season, Ross' temperamental personality and 
local media reaction when it became known he was contemplating 
retirement. Also, Sanders supposedly questions the Lions' 
commitment to winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know at times, it was frustrating for him,'' Morton said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Sanders had only praise for the team and its  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly will miss playing for the Lions,'' he said. ``I  
consider the Lions' players, coaches, staff, management and fans my 
family. I leave on good terms with everyone in the organization. I 
have enjoyed playing for two great head coaches, Wayne Fontes and 
Bobby Ross, who are good coaches and leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Sanders' 10 seasons in Detroit, the Lions had a 78-82  
regular-season record and made the playoffs five times, winning one 
playoff game. Detroit had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched around a 9-7 
record in 1997 that earned a wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football is still a game; we're talking about this man's  
life,'' tight end Walter Rasby said. ``It'll be a distraction to 
some people but it'll tighten us up as a team. I'm glad I got my 
jersey signed (by Sanders) last year.''

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Profits Rise 19 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Profits at Deutsche Bank AG rose 19  
percent, even as the global investment bank saw adminstrative costs 
surge over its acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits rose for the first six months rose to $1.92  
billion compared to the same period last year, bolstered by a 
whopping 79 percent rise in trading profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrative costs, however, rose 26 percent to $5.94 billion,  
mostly because of employee bonuses and costs related to the bank's 
purchase of Bankers Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Rolf Breuer tried to allay concerns the bank's strategy  
would cost shareholders too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as our earnings are more than the bonuses we pay, it's  
good for shareholders,'' he said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to remain competitive abroad and with shrinking margins  
at home, Deutsche Bank has struggled to expand into the more 
lucrative investment banking field. Its November 1998 decision to 
acquire Bankers Trust for $9 billion is a cornerstone of that 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank integrated the U.S. bank's operations into its own  
as of June 4. It booked a $752 million restructuring charge for the 
acquisition in the first half -- including $100 million paid to 
former Bankers Trust chairman Frank Newman for him to leave his 
post.

<HEADLINE> Priceline.com, AutoNation Make Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- AutoNation Inc. and the online buying service  
Priceline.com joined forces Wednesday to sell new cars and trucks 
on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, bids that come to Priceline.com's  
name-your-own-price vehicle service will be referred to AutoNation 
dealerships first. AutoNation is the largest dealership chain in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement began in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region of  
Florida on Wednesday. The companies said they plan to broaden it as 
Priceline.com expands its new-vehicle buying service. The service 
previously was offered only in metropolitan New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After a customer proposes a price for a specific vehicle,  
Priceline.com will refer the bid to AutoNation dealers and then to 
other participating dealerships in the geographic area designated 
by the customer. The first dealership to accept the offer makes the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Priceline.com's unique way to buy a vehicle is  
ideal for today's convenience-driven Internet vehicle buyer,'' said 
Scott Barrett, senior vice president of AutoNation. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., recently announced  
plans to link its individual dealership sites through a new 
nationwide site at www.AutoNationDirect.com. It also receives sales 
leads from other online buying services.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Apologize for Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Disabled activists booed outside as nine UCLA  
football players apologized in court for using handicapped permits 
to get better parking spots around campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not realize the seriousness of our actions,''  
linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz said outside court after nine of 14 
Bruins charged in the case entered pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	Five more current and former members of the team face  
arraignment Aug. 25. Craig Walendy, one of the players, was at the 
San Francisco 49ers training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our faces have been posted on television and newspapers and we  
know we have embarrassed our school, our families and ourselves,'' 
Azziz said. ``We realize we exercised bad judgment and we're 
anxious to make amends for what we've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players who entered pleas on Wednesday and two who are to  
be arraigned next month are still with the team and will be 
suspended for two games next season, the school said. Six of the 
players are starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This behavior is particularly insensitive because it was  
carried out by student athletes, for they are among the most 
able-bodied of all,'' UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players pleaded no contest to illegally possessing  
state-issued handicapped placards. Each was placed on 24 months 
probation, must pay fines, penalties and restitution amounting to 
about $1,500, and complete 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the community service will be with the Special Olympics,  
which holds athletic games for the disabled. The other 100 hours 
were assigned to the city parks department or groups helping those 
with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes also must spend a day meeting and talking with the  
disabled and their advocates, assistant city attorney Brian 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for their pleas, the prosecutor dropped a second  
count of giving false information to the California Department of 
Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, the players were booed and harangued by about a  
dozen disabled activists in wheelchairs. Some held flyers with the 
Bruins football logo that read ``Park them on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were treated with kid gloves,'' said Lillibeth Navarro of  
the California Foundation of Independent Living Centers. `I feel 
that they were given light sentences because they're athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment is fair, prosecutor Williams said, and sends a  
``strong signal.'' If the players apply for a job and are asked if 
they ever have been arrested or convicted of a crime, they must say 
yes, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That'll follow them the rest of their lives,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've been punished not only adequately but more than the  
average citizen,'' said Harland Braun, a lawyer who represented 
several of the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the players submitted bogus applications to the  
DMV for the placards, which allowed them to park at metered zones 
for free and in spots reserved for the disabled. The applications 
listed complaints ranging from knee injuries to Bell's palsy and 
included the signatures of nonexistent physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told  
me that and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of 
them,'' said Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion and 
a Special Olympics board member who was at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo told a campus press conference he was  
``terribly disappointed in the players and what they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like your children,'' he said. ``I'm a surrogate father.  
I've got to scold them, I've got to discipline them, but I'm still 
going to love them. Unfortunately, this is going to be a pretty 
good chunk of our football team.''

<HEADLINE> Walks Help Boost Memory, Judgment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A new study suggests that taking an invigorating walk gives  
older people's brains a good workout, boosting memory and 
sharpening judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaerobic exercise -- stretching and weightlifting -- did not  
produce similar cognitive improvements. The experiment was 
conducted at the University of Illinois and reported in today's 
issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The mental benefits of walking were especially significant,  
researchers said, because the senior citizens had not exercised 
regularly before joining the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have chosen a lifetime of relative inactivity can  
benefit mentally from improved aerobic fitness,'' said the study's 
lead author, cognitive neuroscientist Arthur Kramer. ``It's never 
too late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many of his 88 years, Harry S. Truman left reporters gasping  
for breath as he offered sharp-tongued commentary during his brisk 
morning walk. John Glenn credits his celebrated return to orbit at 
age 77 to daily exercise, including a two-mile power walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers recruited 124 sedentary men and women ages 60 to  
75. They were randomly assigned to either a walking program or an 
anaerobic regimen of stretching and muscle-toning. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment lasted six months. Walkers eventually were  
completing an hour-long loop around the university's 
Urbana-Champaign campus three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer and others administered a variety of simple tests to  
gauge the participants' ability to plan, establish schedules, make 
and remember choices and rapidly reconsider them if circumstances 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurologists call these brain functions ``executive control  
processes'' because they help a person live independently. They are 
controlled in the brain's frontal and prefrontal lobes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These areas of the brain decline the earliest with aging,''  
Kramer said. ``So executive control is more severely affected by 
the normal aging process than other brain functions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, participants were shown alternating letters  
and numbers, and asked to quickly determine between vowels and 
consonants, and odd and even numbers. The exercise is known as task 
switching. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkers' ability to switch tasks improved by 25 percent,  
while the non-walkers' showed little improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that regular exercise may reduce the  
risk of developing Alzheimer's disease later in life, possibly 
because exercise enhances the production of certain hormones and 
other protective compounds in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	But those studies involved only people with long-term exercise  
habits. And Alzheimer's involves the death of brain cells, which is 
different from more generalized memory lapses that frequently 
accompany aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who reviewed the Illinois study said it is not clear how  
walking might stimulate memory and planning ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might just be more a function of people in the study  
interacting with other people,'' said Dr. William Thies of the 
Alzheimer's Association. ``Being isolated is bad for your health 
and bad for your day-to-day functioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering that question is the goal of the Illinois experiment's  
second phase, which began this week. Researchers are taking 
magnetic resonance images of participants' brains to see if there 
is enhanced blood flow in their executive control centers, and if 
it corresponds to the walkers' improved test performance.

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires appear to be big losers after  
the collapse of their threatened walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 68 major league umpires will lose their  
jobs, even after the withdrawal of all resignations Tuesday, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said. That's because the American 
and National leagues already have hired 25 replacements from the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the wrong strategy,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh  
insisted. ``I wish we weren't put in the situation where we had to 
do it. It's kind of like taking a hammer to hit someone as opposed 
to tapping them on the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials, 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires escalated their labor battle with baseball on July  
14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy began 
to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Froemming, a senior NL umpire who helped hire union head  
Richie Phillips in 1979, was angry that some umps didn't back the 
union stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' he said. ``Obviously they  
think they're going to get a better deal somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs.

Phillips will remain in charge because umpires voted 49-14 last 
spring in favor of giving him a five-year contract. Crawford also 
said it was too early to term the strategy a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't categorize it until after everything is all said and  
done,'' Crawford said. ``We were asked by a federal judge to 
withdraw our resignations to de-escalate the situation. We complied 
with what he asked. It is now in the hands of a judicial proceeding 
and we are willing to wait for the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires announced their mass resignations after a meeting in

	By last Friday, 14 of those 56 umpires had withdrawn their

Tuesday.

<P>
	The nine AL umps who were sent letters Monday accepting their  
resignations are Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia, Ed 
Hickox, Mark Johnson, Ken Kaiser, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy.

	The only NL umpires assured of keeping their jobs are Mark  
Hirschbeck, who never quit, and Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson, who 
withdrew their resignations last week. 
</P>
<P>

leaguers and the guys that jumped ship, they've got 13 guys, so 
they need 23 to fill out the staff,'' Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, one of the most respected and well-liked umpires in the  
game, said the split among the umpires doomed the union. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the guys don't stick together, I don't care what kind of  
time you've got, it's not going to work,'' he said. ``I'm 100 
percent behind Richie Phillips. He got us here. He got us 
everything we have. He's been loyal to us for 22 years. It's a 
shame the guys aren't loyal toward him.''

<HEADLINE> Some Worried by Euro's Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Since its inception, Europe's new single currency  
has mostly headed in one direction -- down -- prompting hand-wringing 
from European politicians and central bankers about the fate of 
their grand experiment in fiscal and political unity. 
</P>
<P>
	But in just a couple weeks, the euro has bounced back from a low  
of almost $1.01 to top $1.07, spurred largely by signs that Germany 
-- Europe's biggest economy -- is finally emerging from its economic 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of how quickly things can change in the hypersensitive  
world of global finance, some policy-makers are already worrying 
that the euro may be going too high, choking off the economic 
recovery that is fueling the rise in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want too strong of a euro, because that could weaken  
our export economy again,'' Ernst Welteke, president designate of 
the German central bank, told a German newspaper on Tuesday, 
sending the euro down half a cent. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro slipped again Wednesday after the European Central  
Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 11 countries sharing the 
euro, released figures showing money supply grew more slowly than 
expected in June. In late trading in New York, the euro was at 
$1.0659. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's mini-recovery began after ECB president Wim  
Duisenberg hinted at higher interest rates in the future at his 
regular news conference two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bigger impact came from better-than-expected economic  
figures out of Germany last week: a rise in industrial orders and a 
jump in the closely watched Ifo index of business confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Tietmeyer, whose term as German central bank president ends  
in September, said the good news from Germany has ``changed 
sentiment toward the euro in the past few days'' and raised hopes 
for an economic recovery in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining that optimism was the release of modest price growth  
evidence in Germany. While there remains little threat of inflation 
in Europe, the fear that its recent economic slowdown could spiral 
into a deflationary recession has also started to evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's projected growth rate for the year -- 1.5 percent -- is  
still well below the 4 percent projected for the United States. Yet 
with Europe looking less dismal than earlier in the year, many 
investors are starting to take another look at Europe as an 
alternative to the sky-high U.S. stock market, subsequently 
supporting the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	For the euro to develop further, politicians in the euro zone  
must tackle a number of structural and fiscal reforms, Tietmeyer 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	As a step in that direction, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's  
Cabinet last month approved an austerity budget for 2000 that 
includes $16 billion in across-the-board cuts and $4.2 billion in 
corporate tax relief. Parliament is to vote on the package in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy is also struggling to meet the budget deficit targets set  
out under the rules for Europe's single currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the big budget discussions still have to take place,''  
noted Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist for Europe at Bank of America 
in London. ``The euro is not out of the woods yet.''

<HEADLINE> People Retiring Closer to Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A familiar Marriott sign beckons to  
motorists whizzing down Pleasant Valley Way in this well-to-do town 
a half-hour's drive west of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sign isn't for a night's lodging in a Marriott hotel.  
The attractive white, three-story complex hard by the Watchung 
Hills and a town park with flowering pear trees is designed for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey, with an explosion of housing for the elderly being  
increasingly provided by such companies as Marriott, is coaxing 
more and more of its senior residents to stay at home rather than 
retire in the sun in the South or in the desert out West. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: those 60 and older have roots in the  
places where they bought homes after World War II, raised their 
families and sent their adult children off into the world. 
</P>
<P>
	So developers which provide housing especially designed for the  
elderly are setting up stakes in towns such as West Orange, Teaneck 
and Tinton Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Seabrook Village off the Garden State Parkway in Tinton Falls,  
near the Jersey Shore an hour south of New York, advertises 
``senior campus living'' in ``maintenance-free apartments'' for 
``the independent retirement you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyatt, a hotelier like Marriott that is increasingly moving into  
senior housing, offers ``retirement living with the Hyatt touch'' 
at its Classic Residence apartment complex in Teaneck, just across 
the Hudson River from Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	And to meet ``the changing needs of America's seniors,''  
Marriott offers 106 suites at its Brighton Gardens assisted living 
complex with ``all the pleasures and privacy of residential 
living'' in ``comfortable home-like surroundings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price? From $2,990 to $4,470 a month for a suite to a  
one-bedroom unit with den, including ``waiter-served'' meals, 
``some assistance with daily living activities such as bathing, 
dressing or grooming,'' medication help and housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	The demographics support such moves by the Marriott and Hyatt  
chains because aging baby boomers and increasing life expectancy 
means there will be 35 million Americans aged 65 or older next year 
-- about 14 percent of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend, aided by improved health, hygiene and nutrition, is  
similar elsewhere in a world trying to provide housing for 
increasing numbers of elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, which has the world's highest percentage of people over  
60 -- 23 percent; Japan, whose women have an average life expectancy 
of 83; and Sweden and Iceland, both of which have high numbers of 
elderly, face similar housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sekisui House of Osaka, Japan's largest home builder with 1.3  
million houses constructed since 1961, has designers working on 
models in its Nattoku Kobo studio that feature an innovative array 
of ``elderly friendly'' devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Tables are lowered -- a standard feature -- and bathtubs and  
toilets are similarly adjusted downward for the older population, 
many of whom suffer from osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitchens, too, are designed to be more user-friendly for the  
disabled, with grab bars at corners so the elderly can hold on in 
case they lose their balance. 
</P>
<P>
	At a U.N. conference on the elderly earlier this year, aging  
experts were told how the community of Ouda in Nara, southern 
Japan, altered the frequency of its traffic lights to give the 
elderly and infirm a minute to cross streets. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Del Webb Corp. hasn't moved that far, standard for its  
Sun City retirement communities are such safety items as a porch 
light that blinks in emergencies after 911 is called, lighted wall 
switches in critical locations and bathroom grab bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based Del Webb also features rounded wall corners and  
door and sink faucet handles that are easier on the elderly or 
those with hand problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Webb has made its Sun City communities for those ``55 and  
better'' the standard of the industry, selling homes almost as fast 
as they can be built at 10 Sun City developments from Palm Desert, 
Calif., to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Del Webb announced plans to move into the Snow Belt  
for the first time, building a Northern retirement community west 
of Chicago near Huntley, Ill. Construction of the 4,800 homes 
priced up to $300,000 started this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Webb officials say their research shows four out of every  
five people nearing retirement age prefer to stay near home when 
they retire, a trend builders and developers are picking up on in 
New Jersey and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	That appears to be just the case at Marriott's housing in West  
Orange. A visitor who recently asked for a tour of the facilities 
near dinner time was politely told no and to arrange another time 
to visit because ``this is their home.''

<HEADLINE> Players Lament Sanders' Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To those who played with him and those who tried to stop him,  
the retirement of Barry Sanders stripped the NFL of a true 
superstar -- and a whole lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at a player like Barry and say, `Wow!''' Dallas wide  
receiver Michael Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we realize how fortunate we were to see him  
play,'' said Cleveland linebacker Chris Spielman, a former teammate 
of the Detroit Lions' running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best way to describe Barry is that he did something every  
single week, whether it would be in practice or a game, that would 
absolutely amaze you. How did he do that? He did it consistently. 
Barry is in a class by himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said Wednesday he was retiring from the NFL after 10  
years and just 1,458 yards from the career rushing record set by 
Walter Payton. After averaging 1,500 yards a season, Sanders seemed 
certain to break the mark this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know him said surpassing Payton probably never entered  
into his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry was never much on records or stats. He was all about  
winning,'' Spielman said. ``For him to play just to break Payton's 
record would be very much out of character for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it wasn't important to him,'' said Terrell Davis, the  
NFL's Most Valuable Player and last year's league rushing leader 
with Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, who suffers from a rare liver disease and is awaiting a  
transplant, said he understood Sanders' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not about money. It is not about statistics, it is about  
the romance kindled by playing the game the way it was supposed to 
be played,'' Payton said. ``As I am engulfed in my personal trials, 
my family, friends and life are more important than any yard or 
touchdown ever scored. And in a sense, Barry is fighting for the 
same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For my own selfish reasons, I would like to see Barry come  
back and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis gained 2,008 yards in 1998 and Sanders rushed for 2,053  
the previous year. They are among just four players to top the 
2,000-yard mark in NFL history and were to meet for the first time 
in the Silverdome on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to play against Detroit without Barry so I am going  
to miss out on that opportunity,'' Davis said. ``I am like anyone 
else. I am disappointed. ... Barry's been doing things I wouldn't 
try to do. I'm a running back. Barry's an athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders running style was unique, combining the speed of a  
sprinter with the contortions of a gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could say I'm glad I don't have to play against him, but  
he's exciting to play against,'' said defensive tackle Mike Wells, 
now with Chicago. ``I was a teammate of his for four years, and I 
was a fan as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bears coach Dick Jauron said memories of playing against Sanders  
were ``all bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's no fun to play against,'' said Jauron, a Pro Bowl  
defensive back who plotted ways to stop Sanders on the coaching 
staffs at Green Bay and Jacksonville. ``He was fun to watch -- as 
long as you weren't the one he was making look bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 31, Sanders was in his prime and the retirement announcement  
was unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not retiring, is he? Y'all are joking. Please! That's got  
to be a joke,'' said Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys, who takes over as 
the leading active career rusher with 12,566 yards. ``I don't buy 
it just yet because the man has many, many, many more years left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions' failure to get to the Super Bowl, plus a pair of 5-11  
seasons the last two years, frustrated Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can certainly sympathize with his situation up there,''  
Smith said. ``I mean, the man has been everything Detroit wanted, 
but has Detroit been everything he needed? Probably not. So, 
frustration and a lot of disappointment is on his side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, Davis and others said they hoped that Sanders' absence  
would be short-lived, and that he would return for at least one 
more season of highlight-film runs. 
</P>
<P>
	For the time being, however, football is without perhaps its  
single most spectacular performer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My remembrance will be that you had a chance ... to be around  
sheer greatness, like Michael Jordan or Sam Snead or Jack Nicklaus 
or Dan Marino,'' said Miami Dolphins assistant coach Pat Jones, who 
recruited and coached Sanders at Oklahoma State. ``He has withstood 
the test of time. He'll go down as one of the greatest backs that 
has ever played the game.''

<HEADLINE>  All Umpires Rescind Resignations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires appear to be big losers after  
the collapse of their threatened walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 68 major league umpires will lose their  
jobs, even after the withdrawal of all resignations Tuesday, two 
high-ranking baseball officials said. That's because the American 
and National leagues already have hired 25 replacements from the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the wrong strategy,'' NL umpire Randy Marsh  
insisted. ``I wish we weren't put in the situation where we had to 
do it. It's kind of like taking a hammer to hit someone as opposed 
to tapping them on the shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine AL umpires on  
Monday accepting their resignations, according to the officials, 
who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters to as many as 13 NL umps will be sent by NL  
president Len Coleman later this week, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires escalated their labor battle with baseball on July  
14 by voting to resign en masse on Sept. 2, but the strategy began 
to falter when some of the umps began to take back their 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Froemming, a senior NL umpire who helped hire union head  
Richie Phillips in 1979, was angry that some umps didn't back the 
union stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned their backs on us,'' he said. ``Obviously they  
think they're going to get a better deal somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, umpires sued the AL and NL in federal court in  
Philadelphia, seeking a court order that would allow them to 
withdraw the resignations prior to the Sept. 2 effective date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for owners and umpires held a conference call Tuesday  
with U.S. District Judge Edmund V. Ludwig, who refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order to prevent owners from accepting the 
resignations, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such an order, the umpires not being taken back by  
baseball will be forced to spend years in court in an effort to 
regain their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over with yet. Our contract doesn't expire until Dec.  
31, so we will go on through the year and then negotiate a new 
deal,'' NL umpire Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig declined comment, spokesman Rich  
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips issued a statement saying ``a group of very fine  
umpires stand very tall and will hold their heads high forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are to be admired for their resolve and courage,''  
Phillips said. ``They are confident that they will eventually 
prevail in this very unseemly affair that was deliberately provoked 
by major league baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said ``unfair labor practice charges are being  
pursued before the National Labor Relations Board,'' the NLRB's

labor contract.

	``You need solidarity,'' NL umpire Angel Hernandez said. ``I'm

spring in favor of giving him a five-year contract. Crawford also

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Caught in Flap Over Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raised a ruckus with his  
raising of the Arkansas state flag over City Hall, a move critics 
denounced Wednesday as an abuse of power and insulting to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most flagrant abuse of mayoral authority I can  
recall,'' former Mayor Edward Koch said. ``This is a rank political 
act to help Giuliani. It's outrageous. It's despicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas flag was raised Tuesday while the Republican mayor  
was in Little Rock, Ark., seeking campaign donations and tweaking 
Hillary Rodham Clinton over her non-New York roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani is expected to run for the New York Senate seat that  
Mrs. Clinton is also eyeing, and said the flag-raising was nothing 
more than a gesture of thanks for the hospitality shown him by 
Arkansans. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's critics said he was playing politics by hoisting the  
red, white and blue flag on a City Hall pole. 
</P>
<P>
	City Council Speaker Peter Vallone ordered the flag immediately  
taken down, citing a law he said gave the council the final word on 
City Hall flags. The mayor, citing the exact same law, ignored him. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota insisted that the flag fly as planned  
and said Vallone showed ``a lack of graciousness.'' The flag was 
lowered Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were angry about the choice of flag. The Arkansas flag  
features a star commemorating the state's membership in the 
Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Displaying a flag that includes a star commemorating Arkansas'  
membership in the Confederacy is an insult to African-Americans and 
those who have struggled in the Civil Rights movement,'' said 
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani denied the move was political, saying he was so moved  
by the sight of the New York City flag being flown at a Little Rock 
hotel that he wanted the Arkansas flag flown from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	And Lhota said the mayor's visit with Arkansas Gov. Mike  
Huckabee had nothing to do with his possible senate campaign. 
Huckabee spokesman Jim Harris agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the mansion they weren't doing politics,'' Harris said.  
``He was just welcomed to the state like any other visiting 
dignitary would be. It was nonpolitical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the mayor's itinerary in Arkansas, including his visit  
with Huckabee, was released through his ``Friends of Giuliani'' 
committee, rather than from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	After their meeting, both Giuliani and Huckabee stood outside  
the mansion and poked fun at Mrs. Clinton's New York ``listening 
tour'' and the fact that she may run for office in a state where 
she has never lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Rock was the first stop in a two-day Southern  
fund-raising swing. He also had stops in New Orleans and the 
Alabama cities of Huntsville, Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you give the key to the city to someone who has made  
contributions that's one thing,'' said Rachel Leon, of Common Cause 
New York, a government watchdog group. ``But it would seem the only 
connection to Arkansas here is his senate campaign race. ... It 
just doesn't pass the smell test.''

<HEADLINE> Bailey Finally Runs at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At last, Donovan Bailey, the Pan  
American Games poster boy, was seen in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world record holder and 1996 Olympic gold medalist in  
the 100 meters, who was roundly criticized for not competing in his 
specialty, ran the opening leg on Canada's 400-meter relay team in 
Wednesday's semifinal heats, then said, ``I owe my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not feel, however, that he owed the games' organizers  
anything more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, who still is recuperating from Achilles' tendon surgery on 
his left leg last September. ``I'm not stung by the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Flynn, Bailey's financial adviser, also claimed the sprinter  
fulfilled his obligations to the Pan Am organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a misunderstanding,'' Flynn said. ``He signed an  
image contract 15 months ago to promote the games, not a 
performance-based contract. Nobody could tell he would get injured 
four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still recuperating from a serious injury. In his last  
race in Europe, he finished dead last in 10.42. He's trying to 
restore and re-establish his credibility. He wasn't ready to run 
the 100. He didn't want to embarrass himself on his own turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn also defended Bailey's absence at the opening ceremony. He  
said Bailey didn't attend the opening ceremony at both the 1995 and 
1997 World Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never asked to go the opening ceremonies,'' Flynn said.  
``It was never a snub to the games. It just means that the athlete 
is concerned with what he's trying to do and concentrate fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was shocked Canada's top rower, Marnie McBean, ripped him  
verbally. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the point when he decided that he was going to hold the  
games up for the little game he was playing with Athletics Canada, 
that's when I thought he began to disrespect the games and the 
athletes that were coming here,'' McBean was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably has earned more on interest on that $200,000  
($136,000 U.S.) than most of the athletes are going to make all 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said, ``I was upset by Marnie's comments ... because we  
are friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said McBean probably was unaware of all the circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances Wednesday were almost circus-like. Bailey was  
the center of attention, just like a ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Every move he made was closely followed by the electronic media,  
scrutinized by the print media and watched carefully by the small 
but boisterous crowd at the University of Manitoba stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	What everyone saw was not spectacular.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Cuba's Anier Garcia were about even after the first  
100 meters, then the Canadians took control when Cuba's Misael 
Ortiz dropped the handoff from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the Canadians went on to a 12-meter victory over  
Guatamela in 38.74 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Bailey felt relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``The relief is coming here and being with the fellas,'' he said  
after running the leadoff leg on a Canadian relay team for the 
first time in five years; he usually runs anchor. ``The leg feels 
fine. I've been training well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal heat, the United States team of Kaaron  
Conwright, Duane Phillips, 100-meter gold medalist Bernard Williams 
and Curtis Perry botched the first exchange and wound up finishing 
second to Brazil in 38.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The relay final is Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Only one final was held early Wednesday, and Cuba's Magalys  
Garcia was the winner, setting a Pan Ams record with 6,290 points 
in the heptathlon. Americans Shelia Burrell and Nicole Haynes 
finished 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine more finals were scheduled Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE>  Milburn Ready for Rebirth With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Chicago Bears coach Dick Jauron hopes  
to make Glyn Milburn somebody else's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, who spent the last four years as Jacksonville's  
defensive coordinator, remembers trying to find somebody -- anybody 
-- who could cover Milburn one-on-one in his days with the Denver 
Broncos. It never quite worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt we had to double him. We did not feel like we had a  
linebacker that could cover him alone,'' Jauron said. ``When you 
have that kind of problem defensively, it really opens up a lot of 
other things. So we want to use all of his talents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn will be returning kicks and punts again this season just  
as he's done his entire career. But he'll also spend some time in 
the backfield. He'll probably line up as a receiver, too. And with 
the way things are going for the Bears at quarterback, he might 
even toss a few passes. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, scratch that last part, Milburn isn't Kordell Stewart. But  
the running back/returner is going to be a big part of the Bears' 
new wide-open offense this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be in the backfield at times, but he won't be solely in  
the backfield,'' Jauron said. ``He gives us another dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn is known primarily as a return specialist, a tag he  
doesn't really like. Returns are what he does best; in his first 
season with the Bears last year, he returned three kicks for 
touchdowns and set Chicago records for kickoff returns (62) and 
yards (1,550). 
</P>
<P>
	But there's much more to his game than catching a kick and  
flying down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You become typecast into being one-dimensional and people  
think that's the only thing I can do,'' he said. ``Throughout my 
career, I've done some things that don't fit that tag. I played 
running back and receiver in Denver and had some success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milburn did a little bit of everything for the Broncos from  
1993-95. In his first season, he rushed for 231 yards and caught 38 
passes for 300 yards and three touchdowns. In his very first game, 
he had a career-long 50-yard reception, a 36-yard punt return and a 
25-yard TD catch. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the year he went to the Pro Bowl, he led the NFL with  
his 27-yard kickoff return average and was fifth in the league with 
11.4 yards per punt return. He also rushed for 266 yards, including 
a career-best 131 yards against Seattle, and averaged 11.4 yards 
per catch on 31 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears hoped to take advantage of that versatility when they  
acquired him from Green Bay a week before the first game last year. 
But things got a little tumultuous for Chicago's offense -- Curtis 
Enis blew out his knee and Erik Kramer missed the last half of the 
season -- and the Bears never did fit Milburn in. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Curtis and the running backs they had here, it was  
difficult to expect to be inserted right away,'' Milburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not this year. The Bears are opening up their traditional  
smashmouth offense, and Milburn can count on plenty of playing 
time. With Enis still recovering from reconstructive knee surgery 
and Edgar Bennett from off-season surgery, Milburn is getting a lot 
of work during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He might take a handoff from Shane Matthews in one drill, and be  
sprinting downfield for a catch on the next. And when the special 
teams practice begins, there he is again, sprinting up the field, 
zigging and zagging so no one can get a hand on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited. This is a great opportunity this year,'' he said.  
``It's a new offense, one that's more wide open, where players can 
line up at different positions. Defenses may not be able to expect 
one thing when I go into a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Jauron knows all too well, that's bad news for whomever's  
playing across from him.

<HEADLINE> Railroads Restoring Freight Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of widespread disruptions, the two  
railroads that spent two years planning how best to carve up 
Conrail's freight routes are finally showing signs of restoring 
reliable service. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goode, the chairman and chief executive of Norfolk  
Southern Corp., said Wednesday his company is spending heavily to 
resolve the logistical woes caused by the June 1 takeover, with CSX 
Corp., of Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to do what is required in the short term to  
realize the benefits of our transaction in the long term,'' Goode 
told financial analysts in New York. ``Admittedly this is a time of 
testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Computer coding errors and other setbacks have led to shipping  
delays that could mean higher prices for some consumer goods 
because manufacturers could not get raw materials or transport 
finished goods as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Both railroads believe the worst is over. But an important test  
-- pre-Christmas traffic this fall -- lies ahead. Shipping levels 
could be higher than usual as companies build up inventories to 
guard against suppliers' Year 2000 computer mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not resting on our laurels yet,'' said Bob Haulter,  
assistant vice president for integration planning at CSX, based in 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover has affected both company's profits: Second-quarter  
earnings dropped 59 percent for Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk 
Southern, while CSX's earnings went down 25 percent from the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroads have hired more crews, leased additional  
locomotives and run special trains for time-sensitive shipments. 
Norfolk Southern, which had the bulk of the setbacks, put its costs 
at $60 million in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry performance indicators show congestion dropping  
steadily and train speed picking up. Shippers have noticed 
improvements, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still having problems, but we're just not getting  
the volume of (complaint) calls we were getting early on,'' said Ed 
Rastatter, director of policy with the National Industrial 
Transportation League, a shipping group. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX and Norfolk Southern paid $10.3 billion for Conrail's  
routes, taking control of virtually all rail traffic east of the 
Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroads spent two years planning the Conrail split, hoping  
to avoid the prolonged service woes that followed Union Pacific's 
1996 merger with Southern Pacific. Those disruptions cost the U.S. 
economy at least $4 billion, by some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested our systems to the fullest we could in the testing  
environment,'' said Jon Manetta, senior vice president for 
operations at Norfolk Southern. ``Until you get to the real world, 
you can't tell how they are going to react in actuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CSX and Norfolk Southern have struggled to keep existing  
business while failing to capture more of the freight service that 
now moves on trucks -- traffic growth essential for repaying money 
borrowed to buy Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	Both railroads had problems with computers, which prompted some  
shipments to go in the wrong direction or to the wrong yards. 
Norfolk Southern also had trouble getting enough workers at the 
right place and time because of dispatching problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a seasonal freight decrease in July, as automakers shut  
down to prepare for a new model year and many coal miners take 
vacations, for the railroads to lessen the traffic backlog.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Is Off 6.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left  
financial markets unscathed and unimpressed Wednesday as he 
reasserted the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates at any 
sign of a rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes ended a quiet session with mixed results. The Dow  
Jones industrial average fell 6.97 points to close at 10,972.07. 
The blue-chip index spent much of the afternoon in positive 
territory before falling back in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, were modestly higher. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.56 to 1,365.40, and the Nasdaq 
composite index rose 26.51 to 2,705.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. Stocks slumped through Tuesday, when the Dow picked 
up 115.88 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated his concerns before the Senate Banking  
Committee on Wednesday. But traders said that this time around, 
they anticipated the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``But the sigh-of-relief rally was 
short-lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the next wave of government economic data should  
offer clues on whether inflation has encroached on the economy. 
Wednesday, a Commerce Department report said that orders to U.S. 
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent 
in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, and a fresh sign that 
the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, were mixed throughout the session. American 
Express, which rose Tuesday due to a strong profit report, gave up 
early gains to close down 1 1/8 at 141 1/4. Brokerage Charles Schwab rose 
2 1/2 to 48 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 4 3/4 to 35 1/2 a day after the company said it 
will spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Internet shares slipped, other computer-related  
companies rose amid growing sentiment that the market for personal 
computers is thriving. Chip makers Intel, up 2 3/4 to 70 5/16, and 
Micron Technology Inc., up 3 7/8 at 61 3/4, led the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	And the latest Internet retailer to make its initial public  
offering rose heartily. Drugstore.com, which was priced at 18, hit 
a high of 70 before trailing off again to close at 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks received a boost from the Financial Accounting  
Standards Board, which elected not to change the way companies 
account for research and development work acquired through 
acquisitions. Analysts said highly acquisitive technology companies 
could have been hurt by such an accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
the government releases its employment cost index and gross 
domestic product reports Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to be too enthusiastic,'' he said. ``Any  
rallies will be subdued until we get that out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 837.78 million 
shares, compared with 867.36 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 0.29 to 640.40, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.02 to 789.60. The 
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.13 to 446.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock  
average rose 0.67 percent. Germany's DAX index gained 0.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 
0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> MLB Lawyers Defeat Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After losing more court cases than the poor devil that Perry  
Mason clobbered week in and week out on TV for years, the lawyers 
for major league baseball finally won one. They beat the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it wasn't a fair fight.  
</P>
<P>
	The umps had Richie Phillips on their side.  
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the few times in recent memory -- Carmen Electra's  
brief marriage to Dennis Rodman being another -- when something that 
seemed too good to be true actually was. So if you happened to be 
one of the suits running baseball, Tuesday really was Christmas in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the umpires got together at a union meeting and  
threatened to walk out. Baseball's response? ``Walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The week after that, 56 of the 68 umpires submitted resignation  
letters, effective Sept. 2. There were defections almost 
immediately. By last Friday, 14 had asked for their jobs and their 
resignation letters back. Soon enough, the 42 holdouts made it 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's response? ``Keep on walking.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the umpires and Phillips, their union boss and chief  
legal strategist, sued the American and National Leagues in federal 
court. They basically threw themselves on the mercy of the court, 
asking for an order that would allow them to withdraw the 
resignations prior to Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the court unmercifully threw the umps out. During a  
conference call with lawyers for both sides, U.S. District Judge 
Edmund V. Ludwig denied the union's request for a temporary 
restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, about one-third of the 68 umpires will lose  
their jobs. Even now, some of the pink slips are already in the 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-ranking baseball officials told The Associated Press  
that AL president Gene Budig sent letters to nine umps accepting 
their resignations; his NL counterpart, Len Coleman, is expected to 
mail as many as 13 by the end of this week. The officials also said 
that the two leagues already have hired 25 replacements, all 
minor-leaguers, to fill the spots. 
</P>
<P>
	As is customary in such cases, the officials spoke on condition  
of anonymity. The real wonder is not that they leaked the 
information, but that they could speak at all -- given how hard all 
the baseball people must have been laughing after the lawyers 
called them to break the news. 
</P>
<P>
	What isn't funny is what happens next: Phillips keeps his job  
and a few good umps lose theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	One big loss will be the exit of Rich Garcia. He gained  
notoriety three seasons ago working right field in the AL playoff 
between the Orioles and Yankees, when a then-13-year-old New Yorker 
named Jeff Maier leaned over the railing and helped turn a 
warning-track fly ball into a hometown home run. But that's the way 
umpires always get remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that Garcia was a very solid, very mobile, very  
respected official who was ranked third-best in the league in a 
survey of players last winter. Fat lot of good that did him. 
</P>
<P>
	The flip side of that is some of the umps who managed to grab a  
chair when the music stopped, but didn't deserve to. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Hendry blew at least two memorable calls in playoff games  
last season, failed to get out of the way of a grounder in a third 
and was ranked 30th out of 32 AL umps in the player survey. But he 
will be back next season, because he got his resignation letter 
back early. So will the guy ranked behind him, Mr. No. 31, Durwood 
Merrill, for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shame, though, is that Phillips has four years left  
on a deal the umps gave him last year. He badly miscalculated his 
union's solidarity. As a result, his strategy for outmaneuvering 
baseball in advance of contract negotiations was to open the window 
and tell the rank-and-file: ``Jump. You'll get instructions on the 
way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires' contract was up Dec. 31. Phillips anticipated a  
lockout and hatched the resignation-letter scheme to get around a 
no-strike provision in the existing contract. All that did was move 
the umps outside the protective cushion that federal law extends. 
People who resign voluntarily have no job protection. Wouldn't it 
have been something to see Phillips face when he mouthed the word, 
``Ooops!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips' desperation move was the lawsuit filed Monday. People  
who have seen the complaint say it's notable only for the poor 
quality of the arguments. He asked a district court to do what the 
National Labor Relations Board or an arbitrator are more likely to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	The umps can only hope that District Judge Ludwig has a change  
of heart somewhere along the way, or that the NLRB or an arbitrator 
bails them out. Their odds don't look any better than they turned 
out for another bunch of low-flyers, the air-traffic controllers 
who went up against President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	And just like Reagan, commissioner Bud Selig won the staredown  
without batting an eyelash. That's not hard to do when the sidewalk 
is coming up fast on the guys you're staring down. And even better, 
Selig won't have to play the Grinch when the umps' contract 
expires, right around the real Christmastime. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Falcons in Camp, But Not Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons reported to training  
camp as NFC champions for the first time Wednesday, but their lofty 
status was overshadowed by the absence of star running back Jamal 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Anderson did not show up at Furman University along  
with the rest of his teammates and began facing fines of $5,000 per 
day. Negotiations on a new five-year contract broke down when a 
noon deadline passed without Anderson accepting the team's latest 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides downplayed the passing deadline, saying they were  
still willing to negotiate. Still, Anderson's future with the team 
was a top priority for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing we need to do is get Jamal in here as soon as  
possible,'' said linebacker Jessie Tuggle, the senior member of the 
team. ``He's definitely the key part of our football team. For us 
to be successful, we need to have Jamal Anderson in here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Anderson rushed for a team-record 1,846 yards and  
set an NFL mark with 410 carries. He becomes even more important to 
the Falcons' offense after the release of speedy receiver Tony 
Martin, who faces a federal trial on money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is wondering about the Jamal situation,'' said  
receiver Terance Mathis. ``Right now, we have a good team. We'll be 
a damn good team when he gets in here. Certainly, our success last 
year was due to Jamal's 1,800 yards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons offered a $7 million signing bonus in their latest  
proposal, an increase of $1 million but still short of the $8 
million that Anderson wants. Also, the two sides also are at least 
$1 million apart on the first three years of the proposed new 
contract, according to the player's agent, James Sims of Oakland, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're staying firm where they are and we're staying firm  
where we are,'' Sims said. ``I guess you could say we're at an 
impasse, a standoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims raised the possibility of a trade, saying that may be the  
best option if negotiations become more heated. But the agent also 
said Anderson would be willing to report to camp without a new deal 
if he was convinced that negotiations were moving in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said the noon deadline  
was ``not ironclad.'' For now, Anderson is set to make $2.6 million 
in the final season of a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offer is off the table, but you have to do that to protect  
yourself,'' Richardson said. ``What if he shows up three weeks into 
the season and says, `Yeah, I'll take the offer.' We didn't say we 
wouldn't negotiate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Anderson, offensive guard Gene Williams skipped minicamp  
earlier this month while trying to negotiate a new contract. He 
doesn't have a new deal but told the Falcons he would report before 
the midnight Wednesday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone else was expected to be in training camp for the  
Falcons, coming off their greatest season after being a 
laughingstock for most of the team's 34-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was 14-2 last season and won its first NFC title with a  
stirring overtime victory at Minnesota before losing to John Elway 
and the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be more pressure, more a sense of  
urgency,'' Mathis said. ``I've been there through some of the bad 
years and I don't want to go back. Once you get a taste of success, 
you want to keep that taste.''

<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Mixed; Dow Is Off 6.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan left  
financial markets unscathed and unimpressed Wednesday as he 
reasserted the Fed's willingness to raise interest rates at any 
sign of a rebound in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes ended a quiet session with mixed results. The Dow  
Jones industrial average fell 6.97 points to close at 10,972.07. 
The blue-chip index spent much of the afternoon in positive 
territory before falling back in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, were modestly higher. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.56 to 1,365.40, and the Nasdaq 
composite index rose 26.51 to 2,705.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. Stocks slumped through Tuesday, when the Dow picked 
up 115.88 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated his concerns before the Senate Banking  
Committee on Wednesday. But traders said that this time around, 
they anticipated the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his comments turned out to be moderate, and didn't  
include anything new on interest rates, the market was able to 
rally a bit,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, market analyst with A.G. 
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``But the sigh-of-relief rally was 
short-lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the next wave of government economic data should  
offer clues on whether inflation has encroached on the economy. 
Wednesday, a Commerce Department report said that orders to U.S. 
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose just 0.3 percent 
in June -- less than analysts had anticipated, and a fresh sign that 
the economy has not overheated. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to fluctuations in  
interest rates, were mixed throughout the session. American 
Express, which rose Tuesday due to a strong profit report, gave up 
early gains to close down 1 1/8 at 141 1/4. Brokerage Charles Schwab rose 
2 1/2 to 48 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 4 3/4 to 35 1/2 a day after the company said it 
will spend heavily to develop its business. While Mindspring beat 
analysts' expectations for its second-quarter earnings, the company 
warned that earnings will slide in the next three quarters as 
marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Internet shares slipped, other computer-related  
companies rose amid growing sentiment that the market for personal 
computers is thriving. Chip makers Intel, up 2 3/4 to 70 5/16, and 
Micron Technology Inc., up 3 7/8 at 61 3/4, led the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	And the latest Internet retailer to make its initial public  
offering rose heartily. Drugstore.com, which was priced at 18, hit 
a high of 70 before trailing off again to close at 50 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks received a boost from the Financial Accounting  
Standards Board, which elected not to change the way companies 
account for research and development work acquired through 
acquisitions. Analysts said highly acquisitive technology companies 
could have been hurt by such an accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Bryan said sluggish volume and modest share-price gains  
indicate that many investors are staying out of the market until 
the government releases its employment cost index and gross 
domestic product reports Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to be too enthusiastic,'' he said. ``Any  
rallies will be subdued until we get that out of the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 837.78 million 
shares, compared with 867.36 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 0.29 to 640.40, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.02 to 789.60. The 
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.13 to 446.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock  
average rose 0.67 percent. Germany's DAX index gained 0.1 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 
0.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Denies Rift With Rafter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pete Sampras downplayed any rift with Patrick  
Rafter and denied the Australian's assertion that he doesn't 
respect his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone goes out and outplays me, I say it,'' he said,  
``but if I feel like I didn't play well, I'm going to say I didn't 
play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said Tuesday in a conference call with reporters from his  
home in Bermuda that he didn't like Sampras' flippant comments 
about other players. Rafter took over the world's top ranking 
Monday; Sampras is No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter was the target of one of Sampras' remarks before he won  
his second U.S. Open title last year. Sampras, asked what the 
difference was between him and Rafter, said: ``Ten grand slams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He says some funny things at the wrong time,'' Rafter said.  
``Sometimes we're busting our guts and he doesn't give respect to 
others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, who lost to Sampras in the Wimbledon final,  
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete has always been more than respectful to me,'' he said.  
``He can mind his business with the best of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras said relations between him and Rafter chilled last year  
at the ATP Championships in Cincinnati. Rafter defeated Sampras in 
three sets for the title, winning on a disputed line call at match 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a tough line call on match point. Obviously I was very  
upset after the match and said a few things, got a little bit 
caught up in the situation,'' Sampras said. ``He didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras suggested he and Rafter discuss their feelings in  
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's got a problem with me and doesn't like the way I act  
on the court and I don't respect my opponents, I have no problem 
sitting and talking with him,'' he said Tuesday night after winning 
his first-round match at the Mercedes-Benz Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't have a problem. I don't have any issues with  
Pat,'' Sampras said. ``He's a great player that's going to get 
better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said he didn't use Sampras' attitude as a spur to reach  
the top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, that's something I've always wanted to do, but it's nice  
to beat Pete whether on court or in the rankings,'' Rafter said. 
``I get an incredible amount of enjoyment from getting on top of 
him and pretty much just annoying him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras said he was a bit shocked at Rafter's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get in a media war with Pat. It makes no  
sense,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hoogenband Wins 100-Meter Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Alexander Popov, after winning four  
straight gold medals in the 100-meter freestyle at the European 
Swimming Championships, was finally beaten Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieter Van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands defeated the world  
and European record holder, ending the Russian's nearly decade-old 
rule of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband won in 48.47 seconds, Popov was second in 48.82, and  
Lars Frolander of Sweden was third with a time of 49.40 in the 
highlight event at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Rolph won the women's 100-meter freestyle in 55.03 to become  
the first British woman to take a European title in 37 years. In 
doing so, Rolph also broke her own national record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband was ecstatic after his victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``A dream has come true for me -- for the first time at a major  
event I have beaten the great Alexander Popov,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband, who had the third fastest time in history and a new  
championship record, came within a quarter of a second to the 48.21 
world record in the event, set by Popov on June 18, 1994, in Monte 
Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoogenband, 21, got off in front and stayed there, leading all  
the way to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was not Popov's first loss at a meet, it was his  
first resounding defeat and second-ever silver medal at a European 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It was seen by many as a changing of the guard one year before  
the Sydney Olympics, with an up-and-coming swimmer defeating one of 
the sport's veteran stars. 
</P>
<P>
	A visibly disappointed Popov didn't see it that way, but did  
admit he would have to change his training regimen to deal with the 
inevitability of a major pretender for his Olympic crown at the 
summer games. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the way to the Olympics, sometimes you have to hold back in  
order to take a step forward. We tried to do some things 
differently this year, but they didn't seem to work. We have some 
things that we can try for next season,'' Popov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the event, Hoogenband had an impressive set of  
credentials from this championship alone. 
</P>
<P>
	He had already taken away Popov's championship record with a  
blazingly fast 48.70 seconds in the 100-meter semifinals Tuesday. 
Earlier that day Hoogenband nearly set a world record in the 
butterfly, clocking the world's third all-best time of 23.89. 
</P>
<P>
	European champion Agnes Kovacs of Hungary easily won the  
100-meter breaststroke in 1:08.75. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 1-meter springboard final, Vera Iliyna of Russia  
won with 283.41 points

<HEADLINE> Man Must Return Ted Williams' Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered that two  
championship rings which once belonged to Ted Williams be returned 
to the son of the baseball great. 
</P>
<P>
	Denying a motion seeking possession of the rings made by a man  
acquitted of extortion in connection with their sale, U.S. District 
Judge William Young ordered Wednesday that the rings be given to 
John-Henry Williams, according to Peter Sutton, a lawyer for the 
Williamses. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had been holding the rings until the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, former Maine State Police trooper Rodney Nichols was  
found guilty of transporting property he knew to be stolen across 
state lines. He was accused of selling the rings to settle a New 
Hampshire gambling debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said John-Henry Williams stored the rings at the  
home of Nichols' parents in Eliot, Maine, in 1991 and never came to 
retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
	John-Henry Williams and Nichols had apparently been friends at  
the time, and the younger Williams stored the rings and other 
personal belongings at the house shortly after his graduation from 
the University of Maine. He said he would return for them in one 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated that Williams' possessions were taking up space,  
Nichols' father told Williams he planned to sell them at a yard 
sale. While sorting through the items, he found the rings. 
</P>
<P>
	One ring honored the 1986 Boston Red Sox American League  
Championship. The other was a 1946 Red Sox commemorative American 
League championship ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Nichols said he told John-Henry Williams about the rings  
but Williams never asked for them back. He then offered the rings 
to a Portsmouth, N.H., man to settle a $33,000 gambling debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The rings made their way into the hands of a sports memorabilia  
dealer in Massachusetts, who was arrested in December 1997 and 
charged with extortion and sale of stolen property. He had tried to 
sell the rings to John-Henry Williams, who is now known for 
marketing his father's memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The dealer and two others were acquitted of extortion in March.  
Sutton did not say which man filed the motion seeking the rings.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Vargas Is a Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- The lawyer for IBF junior  
middleweight champion Fernando Vargas says his client was wrongly 
arrested and did not assault anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are receiving conflicting statements,'' Santa Barbara  
County sheriff's Sgt. Bill Turner said Tuesday without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas and four friends were arrested early Sunday, accused of  
beating up Doug Rossi. Sheriff's officials said Rossi stopped a 
fight between Vargas and the ex-boyfriend of a woman the boxer was 
visiting. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vargas' lawyer, Gregory Moreno, said the boxer did not  
assault Rossi or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, 21, was visiting a woman at a home in Summerland about 4  
a.m. Sunday when the unidentified ex-boyfriend arrived unannounced 
to visit her, Turner has said. 
</P>
<P>
	That man and Vargas argued, then got into a fight. The brawl was  
broken up by Rossi, a 23-year-old bouncer who was visiting the 
roommate of Vargas' companion. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the unidentified man left the home after the  
fight ended, but four of Vargas' friends came to the home an hour 
later, forced their way into the room occupied by Rossi and beat 
him with some kind of weapon, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas' handlers, however, said he was attacked by an uninvited  
guest in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fernando Vargas was in the wrong place at the wrong time,''  
said Rolando Arellano, the boxer's co-manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas is scheduled for arraignment Aug. 23, Turner said. It  
will take several months to complete the investigation, which will 
include forensic analysis of golf clubs and a wooden club found at 
the scene, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargas, who lives in Oxnard, retained his IBF junior  
middleweight title July 17 against Raul Marquez for his 17th 
consecutive victory.

<HEADLINE> Border Crackdown Blamed for Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALEXICO, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Singh drove along a darkened  
city street, a few feet from the steel rail fence that divides 
Mexico and the United States. The call of ``shots fired'' crackled 
over his radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The call would be run of the mill in most U.S. cities. But Singh  
is a watch commander for the Border Patrol, and his job is to catch 
illegal immigrants, not investigate reports of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	That's changing. Agents in Calexico are increasingly dodging  
bullets as tension and desperation mount along the California 
border, where arrests and deaths of illegal immigrants have 
skyrocketed over the course of a five-year crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be on our guard because we don't know what we're  
going to encounter out here,'' said Singh, who patrols a 26-mile 
stretch of border near Calexico, a community of 28,000 ringed by 
alfalfa fields and irrigation canals about 125 miles east of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the call Singh heard, the Border Patrol has  
received seven reports of shots fired at agents in the Calexico 
region so far this year, including a recent night with three in one 
hour. No injuries were reported. In all of last year, the agency 
received five reports of shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe drug or immigrant smugglers, frustrated by a  
crackdown that has all but closed a once reliable route into the 
United States, are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are just isolated cases of smugglers reacting to the  
increased patrols,'' said Carlos Luna Herrera, regional coordinator 
of Grupo Beta, a Mexican border police unit created to protect 
migrants. ``But they are unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the call came in at 10:04 p.m., Singh made a quick U-turn,  
racing to an open lot beside the 12-foot border fence, where the 
night glows orange from high-powered, stadium-style lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ely Lopez, a seven-year veteran of the patrol, was already there  
in his bulletproof vest. He had heard at least three shots from 
Colonia Puerto Nuevo, a poor neighborhood in Mexicali, the city of 
1 million that sprawls along the other side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh called Grupo Beta, which agreed to send a patrol. But  
quiet had returned and an arrest was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	Crossing illegally at Calexico used to be much easier. In 1996,  
81 agents were assigned to the area, with perhaps only a handful 
working at night, a popular crossing time for migrants trying to 
avoid daytime temperatures that can reach 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had groups of 150 rushing us and we had only six or seven  
agents working at a time,'' Singh recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 194 agents work in the area, including about 40 at night  
using motion detectors and night-vision scopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The agents apprehended 9,908 migrants in June, more than twice  
the number caught the same month in 1996. Arrests hit an all-time 
high in March, with 19,908. 
</P>
<P>
	The vigilance is costly. Last year, 145 people died trying to  
enter California illegally compared to only about 23 before the 
U.S. crackdown known as Operation Gatekeeper began in 1994, said 
Roberto Martinez, director of the Border Project of the American 
Friends Service Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has forced border crossers into remote, dangerous  
regions such as the cold mountains of eastern San Diego County and 
the All-American Canal, an 82-mile waterway that runs through the 
Calexico area where 10 migrants have drowned this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gotten more desperate for both the immigrants and the  
smugglers,'' Martinez said. ``And I think we are going to see it 
increase as they add more agents.''

<HEADLINE> Will Riot Spell End of Woodstock? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The idea of more Woodstocks -- or any other giant  
multi-day rock festival -- may have gone up in the flames stoked by 
rampaging rock fans this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The riot that ended the three-day Woodstock '99 over the weekend  
will probably make it difficult for anyone who wants to stage such 
a concert again, industry watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now you have to ask yourself whether any community would  
ever allow another Woodstock,'' said Bob Grossweiner, a concert 
industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's final act, Red Hot Chili Peppers, was performing  
before what was left of the 225,000 music fans at an abandoned 
military base in Rome, N.Y., when a mob began to set fire to 12 
tractor-trailers, a small bus and several portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bottles were hurled at police and vendor booths destroyed before  
the site was brought under control early Monday. Five people, 
including two state troopers, were injured, and seven people were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second Woodstock of the 1990s modeled after the  
original 1969 concert, known for its memorable music and 
counterculture vibes of peace and love. The rain-drenched Woodstock 
of 1994 is best remembered for its mud. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ugly ending to Woodstock '99, promoters weren't  
talking Tuesday about what this meant for their plan to repeat 
Woodstock every five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a lot of young kids in there, people in high school,''  
said Chris Connelly, who covered the event for MTV. ``You have to 
wonder if parents are going to be very concerned about letting 
their kids go to things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The melee will be remembered by any city that is considering  
allowing music festivals, said James Griffis, town supervisor of 
Saugerties, the last location of a Woodstock festival. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't say if the town would bid again for the next  
Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to make it any easier, that's for sure,''  
Griffis said. ``Communities that will want to host it, if there is 
another one in five years, are going to be a lot more cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A New York state senator said Tuesday she will propose  
legislation giving the state final say over any such mass 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be pretty hard for (promoters) to find a  
community that will accept things on the terms they dictated this 
time,'' said Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, a Syracuse Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock festivals that last several days are already a rarity in  
the United States, in part because promoters lost money on the 
first two Woodstocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were unable to explain what triggered the melee, but  
there was no shortage of theories: hot weather unrelieved by rain, 
dissatisfaction caused by filthy grounds and high food prices, or 
simple lawlessness propelled by peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock's most popular artists -- Limp Bizkit, Korn, Kid Rock  
and Rage Against the Machine -- specialize in an aggressive 
combination of rock and rap that some say encourages aggressive 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids like this are basically nonviolent unless somebody  
instigated them,'' Grossweiner said, ``and the instigation came 
from the stage.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Replacement Exposes Discontent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's decision to assign an Air  
Force general to the top NATO post in Europe signals a shift in 
U.S. thinking about the future U.S. military role in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Joseph Ralston will be only the second Air Force general to  
take over as Supreme Allied Commander-Europe, or SACEUR, as the 
post is called. All the rest have been Army generals, reflective of 
the Cold War strategy of massing large armies in Western Europe 
against a possible onslaught by the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in the Balkans has changed all that. Twice, most  
recently in its 78-day bombing campaign over Yugoslavia, NATO has 
unleashed air power to help quell a civil war in the multiethnic 
region. Army Gen. Wesley Clark commanded the latest campaign and is 
widely regarded to have succeeded in his strategy of graduated 
bombing pressure on the regime in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	But throughout the campaign, critics questioned the absence of a  
top Air Force general at the head of a campaign centered on air 
power. And Clark himself clashed with his superiors in Washington 
by arguing that ground troops should remain on the table as an 
option, something the Clinton administration was most reluctant to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Clinton has decided that Clark can step aside two months  
early next spring to make way for Ralston. Officially the move is 
pegged to the legal requirements surrounding the end of Ralston's 
tenure as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Unofficially, 
the move is widely interpreted as an expression of dissatisfaction 
with Clark, despite his success in the Kosovo campaign. It also 
signals the intent of the Clinton administration to underscore the 
waning importance of ground troops and the central importance of 
air forces as the key instrument of power in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects changing times,'' said retired Army Col. Kenneth  
Allard, a professor at Georgetown University's National Security 
Studies Program. ``It's a pretty strong signal, for anyone looking, 
that this is how the United States views its contribution to the 
alliance. It is not in large ground forces. It's much more likely 
to be in air forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signs were there all along that Clark was not clicking with  
his civilian superiors in the Clinton administration. He 
communicated with Defense Secretary William Cohen largely through 
other officers, including Ralston. The distance developing between 
Clark and Washington was most vividly illustrated in June when the 
White House hosted a major meeting of the president with the Joint 
Chiefs to discuss the Kosovo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, though he was in Washington at the time, was not included  
in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely unusual for that kind of discussion to take  
place without him being there,'' Allard said. ``He pointedly was 
not invited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark appeared to take the decision in stride. But officials  
close to him said he was miffed at how he was informed of it in a 
telephone call Tuesday from the current Joint Chiefs chairman, Army 
Gen. Hugh Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a soldier's journey is over, it's over,'' Clark said  
Wednesday, describing the action as a routine staff change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very proud of wearing this uniform. I love my job,'' he  
said in Vilnius, Lithuania, after a meeting with Lithuanian 
President Valdas Adamkus, according to Baltic News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was putting the best face possible on the  
abrupt change of command, praising Clark and saying that moving up 
the four-star Army general's departure by two months -- from July to 
May next year -- was done to accommodate Ralston, who must leave his 
Joint Chiefs post by early next year. By law, he must get a new 
four-star position within 60 days or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Clark is a superb commander. The president has the  
highest degree of confidence in him,'' Sandy Berger, Clinton's 
national security adviser, said Wednesday at a White House news 
conference. ``He did a superb job in the prosecution of the 
campaign in Kosovo. Witness the fact that we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger left open the possibility that Clark might serve his  
country in ``other ways'' after leaving the NATO post. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Link said he viewed the  
accelerated replacement of Clark as a political necessity in a 
19-member alliance that was often uneasy with the largely U.S.-led 
air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clark did a magnificent job of moving U.S. interests forward  
through a very complex arrangement of 19 NATO nations,'' Link said. 
``To me it was unlikely that he was able to do that without leaving 
some broken glass, and that broken glass will clutter the landscape 
for the U.S. and her NATO allies for months and years to come. ... 
What's the best way to clear away that broken glass? It'll be gone 
the day that Clark steps down.''

<HEADLINE> Group Calls for Stock Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The American Anti-Slavery Group is asking  
investors to sell their shares of a Canadian oil company it accuses 
of helping wage a campaign of slavery and genocide in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	The abolitionists claims the Khartoum government is using  
profits from oil sales to Calgary-based Talisman Energy to kill and 
enslave Sudanese villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company says the anti-slavery group is sensationalizing  
a complex problem and trivializing the meaning of ``slavery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one, including Talisman's top executive, disagrees horrible  
things are happening in the impoverished African country. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a 44-year civil war, Arab Muslim northerners have  
captured black villagers who practice Christianity and traditional 
tribal religions. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government banned trade with Sudan in 1997 because of  
its human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1998, Talisman bought a 25 percent stake in a  
consortium to drill for oil in southern Sudan, along with China's 
National Petroleum Company, Malaysia's Petronas and Sudan's 
national oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from that venture are being used to buy weaponry, build  
arms factories and fuel warplanes, said Jesse Sage, American 
Anti-Slavery associate director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not merely a case of business aiding a corrupt  
regime,'' said Charles Jacobs, the group's president. ``This is a 
business helping a regime commit genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The abolitionists say they sent letters to mutual fund companies  
and pension funds to sell off their shares in Talisman, the world's 
third biggest independent oil producer. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group, State Street,  
the State of New Jersey Division of Investment and the State of 
Wisconsin Investment Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, which holds Talisman shares in its Vanguard  
Specialized Energy Portfolio, believes divesting stock isn't the 
way to influence corporate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preference is to work with management to make change  
happen,'' said Brian Mattes, spokesman for Vanguard, which is based 
in Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many calls for divestiture of stocks in the  
past,'' he said. ``Let's see how effective they've been. Philip 
Morris made $5 billion last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, which is investigating the abolitionists' charge, has  
pressured companies it owns to improve their human rights record, 
said Mattes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin Investment Board seeks investments in  
organizations that respect human rights, said Vicki Hearing, the 
board's spokeswoman. But she said they haven't heard the 
allegations about Talisman and haven't received any letter from the 
abolitionists. Sage said it's probably in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Other mutual fund companies did not return calls seeking comment  
from The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Talisman CEO James Buckee denies the company has a poor human  
rights record and says American Anti-Slavery is getting the story 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a longstanding practice of hostage-taking which we  
wouldn't characterize as slavery. You abuse the words by calling 
this `slavery','' Buckee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckee added the government has no power to stop the  
decades-long violence. ``The government isn't in control of an 
awful lot,'' he said. ``It's not much good to blame the 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way to discourage violence and hostage-taking in Sudan is to  
create jobs and build infrastructure, he said, adding that Talisman 
has built a 60-bed hospital, roads and water wells, which have 
helped move the country's economy forward.

<HEADLINE> Senator Tells Marcos To Sell Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Imelda Marcos, the widow of former  
dictator Ferdinand Marcos, should sell her gems and other assets to 
compensate victims of abuse under her husband's rule, a Philippine 
senator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If her heart really bleeds for the poor, I suggest she start  
now disposing of her fabled jewelry, stretch limousines, posh 
condominium units and other assets from which she can easily raise 
$150 million,'' said Sen. Franklin Drilon, a former justice 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The lavish parties Imelda Marcos gave to celebrate her 70th  
birthday on July 2, at which she displayed diamond- and 
ruby-studded jewelry, show that ``the Marcoses have all the means 
to pay up their obligations to the poor human rights claimants,'' 
Drilon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos fled to Hawaii after he was toppled in a revolt in 1986.  
He died in Honolulu three years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 10,000 Filipinos were awarded $2 billion in a  
class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hawaii that demanded 
compensation for the murder, torture and disappearance of suspected 
dissidents under Marcos. Subsequent negotiations ended with court 
approval of a $150 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Tuesday, the Philippines' anti-graft court refused to  
transfer $150 million that the late dictator had formerly held in 
Swiss bank accounts to Hawaii for disbursal. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said there was no evidence the Marcoses did not have  
funds to satisfy the original $2 billion award and the agreement 
could end up wrongly freeing the Marcos estate from further 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $590 million in Swiss deposits, alleged to be part of  
Marcos' ill-gotten wealth, are in an escrow account in a Philippine 
bank. The government hopes to reach agreement with the Marcos 
family on sharing it out. The $150 million was to have come from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada said the government will appeal the  
ruling, and said he hoped the judges would change their position 
``for the benefit of the human rights victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One group of Marcos victims, Claimants 1081, denounced the  
ruling as ``completely inimical, unjust and callous to our 
interests.''

<HEADLINE> Sanders Begins Retirement in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Traveling alone and almost unrecognized in the  
bustling airport, Barry Sanders walked away from the NFL with a 
briefcase over his shoulder and two carry-on bags in tow. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed more than a little lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders looked like any other tourist who'd decided on a whim to  
take a few weeks off and kiss the job goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He slumped for 40 minutes at a rental-car counter at London's  
Gatwick Airport on Wednesday and searched for a hotel reservation 
at the height of the jammed summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hadn't slept, although a wrinkled, beige polo shirt  
suggested he'd tried. The Detroit Lions running back was clear why 
he was leaving the NFL, but was vague about why he'd come to 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you have to have a reason to come here?'' he quipped after  
arriving on a three-hour delayed, overnight flight from Detroit. 
``I don't say goodbye too well, I guess. I'm not a TV-camera-type 
of person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders initially was angered when a photographer and reporter  
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd appreciate it if you'd leave and stop taking pictures,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He changed money, complained briefly to airport security about  
the photographs, and seemed briefly disoriented. But he mellowed 
when 12-year-old David Groves approached and asked him to autograph 
his brown baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he wanted to be noticed,'' said the 12-year-old  
from Portage, Mich., who arrived in London with his family on the 
same flight from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders eventually became talkative as he trudged around the  
airport for 2 1/2 hours. But he added little more than he had in a 
prepared statement released by his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't plan to change his mind about retirement and said he  
would stay several days in London and then visit Paris or Amsterdam 
``with possibly some stops in between'' before returning home in 
``about two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years is a lot of football,'' he said. ``I'm just really  
not feeling like playing. It's just getting to that point. It's not 
the same game. Really, I've been battling for the last few years. 
As I've gotten older, the game has changed in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking about doing other things,'' he added. ``It's  
still fun, but not as fun. It just felt like it was time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he might change his mind, he shook his head.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not really thinking  
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said he was retiring before he became ``old and gray and  
can't run'' and got ``kicked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't feel ``unfulfilled'' about not playing in the  
Super Bowl. ``It didn't happen ... I didn't play in the Super Bowl, 
but I can still sleep at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to enjoy life. I have enough things to keep me  
busy. I'll do something productive, but I don't know exactly what 
it will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His main job Wednesday was to get to central London. He rented a  
manual-shift car, walked to the parking lot to test it, then 
returned it for an automatic. Driving on the left side of the road 
was challenge enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to have to learn how to shift with my left hand  
today. I'll have enough problems driving without learning how to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He joked he'd come to London to ``elope, and then said he'd  
``stay here for life and be buried in England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe when I'm 45 and too old to play, maybe I can come over  
here and play in Europe,'' he said as he got into the blue sedan 
for the congested 30-mile drive to downtown London. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want now is a good night's sleep and something to eat.''

<HEADLINE> Railroads Restoring Freight Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two railroads that embarked two months ago on  
an ambitious journey to break up Conrail's freight monopoly are 
only now beginning to dig out of the logistical and operational 
quagmire their takeovers caused. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer coding errors and other setbacks have led to congestion  
and shipping delays since early June. Manufacturers unable to get 
raw materials or send out finished goods have incurred expenses 
that may be passed on to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither railroad is willing to declare victory yet, particularly  
with pre-Christmas traffic expected to pose additional problems 
this fall, but CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. believe the 
worst is behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shippers seem to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are still having problems, but we're just not getting  
the volume of (complaint) calls we were getting early on,'' said Ed 
Rastatter, director of policy with the National Industrial 
Transportation League, a shipping group. 
</P>
<P>
	The setbacks have been costly: Driven partly by recovery  
expenses, CSX reported last week that second-quarter earnings 
dropped 25 percent, while Norfolk Southern said today that earnings 
went down 59 percent from the same period last year. The railroads 
have had to hire more crews, lease additional locomotives and run 
special trains for time-sensitive shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though results ... are not up to our standards or  
expectations, these transition expenses are necessary investments 
that will help us realize the long-term opportunities of our larger 
rail network,'' David R. Goode, Norfolk Southern chairman and chief 
executive, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX and Norfolk Southern together paid $10.3 billion to carve up  
and absorb Conrail's routes, taking control of virtually all rail 
traffic east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years went into the planning for the June 1 split in an  
effort to avoid the prolonged service meltdown that followed Union 
Pacific's 1996 merger with Southern Pacific, a disruption that cost 
the U.S. economy at least $4 billion, by some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the preparations, CSX and Norfolk Southern quickly  
found the most complex restructuring in modern railroading to be 
even more complex than thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from meeting their goals of capturing more of the freight  
traffic that now moves on trucks -- traffic growth essential for 
repaying money borrowed to buy Conrail -- the railroads have 
struggled to keep what business they had. 
</P>
<P>
	Many rail shippers turned to more costly trucks to meet tight  
schedules. Some manufacturers curtailed production or paid workers 
overtime to process delayed shipments. Norfolk Southern, which 
suffered more of the congestion problems, put its service expansion 
plans on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two months were spent trying desperately to keep what  
we have,'' said Tom Finkbiner, vice president for intermodal 
services at Norfolk Southern. ``If you can't service what you have, 
it's kind of ridiculous to try to ask for more and do new and 
different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems were primarily in the Northeast, although some of  
Norfolk Southern's yards in the Southeast suffered as well when the 
railroad began rerouting traffic there. 
</P>
<P>
	Both railroads had problems with computers, which prompted some  
shipments to go in the wrong direction or to the wrong yards. 
Norfolk Southern also had initial problems with dispatching its 
crews, getting enough workers to show up at the right places. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the problems were solved, traffic already had backed  
up. It took a seasonal freight decrease in July, as automakers shut 
down to prepare for a new model year and many coal miners take 
vacations, for the railroads to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	Freight levels will now pick up as merchants stock up for  
Christmas. This fall's shipping levels could be higher than usual: 
Companies will build up inventories of raw materials and other 
products to guard against suppliers' Year 2000 computer mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not resting on our laurels yet,'' said Bob Haulter,  
assistant CSX vice president for integration planning. ``Traffic 
levels are coming back. We will continue to refine our processes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Heimowitz of the Chemical Manufacturers Association said  
the key test for the railroads will come this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when things really pick up,'' he said. ``There may be  
incremental improvement, but what's going to happen next week, next 
month and the month after that?''

<HEADLINE> Senior Success Story: Palm Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- One hundred fifty miles east of Los  
Angeles and a few hundred yards off Interstate 10 lies a formerly 
forlorn tract of desert where the Del Webb Corp. can't build homes 
fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one little caveat to living at Del Webb's ultra-popular  
Sun City Palm Desert: you or your spouse must be at least 55 years 
``or better'' and no other occupant may live in homes that start at 
$132,000 and reach $400,000 can be under 19. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a small price to pay to live in one of the best retirement  
communities, according to New Choices magazine, which for five 
straight years has listed Sun City Palm Desert as one of the Top 20 
places for seniors to live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The amenities are appealing. Palm trees and desert life abound.  
There are golf courses galore and a beautiful view of Mount San 
Jacinto. In addition, residents enjoy the Coachella Valley and 
star-studded Palm Springs-Rancho Mirage-Palm Desert-La Quinta 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawbacks? The wind whipping over the San Gorgonio Pass can  
be pretty wicked, and incessant, around May; the summer heat -- 110 
degrees and upward -- can be relentless, and your neighbor across 
the way might be gone half the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sun City Palm Desert is a success any way you describe it:  
Nothing existed here 10 years ago. Now, sprawled across 1,500 acres 
are hundreds of newly built homes, so new tumbleweeds still grow 
where grass and rock gardens soon will be. When it's finished, 
10,000 people will live here. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 15 model homes in muted desert tones with such  
evocative names as Maui and St. Tropez are offered with 
elderly-friendly construction that includes grip bars in the 
bathtub, lower toilets and rounded wall corners. 
</P>
<P>
	Other features for seniors include larger faucets and door  
handles for those who have trouble gripping or turning them. A call 
to 911 turns on a flashing porch light so paramedics can quickly 
find the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Webb also has a popular option for seniors who buy at Sun  
City and might be expecting other elderly visitors: A 
253-square-foot guest house with wet bar and refrigerator is 
offered starting at $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertising material for Sun City makes a point of noting,  
too, the proximity to the famous Eisenhower Medical Center, which 
also houses the Betty Ford Clinic and Heart Institute of the 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded nearly four decades ago, Phoenix-based Del Webb is  
focused on housing for the elderly -- it has 10 Sun City communities 
across the United States. Construction of its first Northern-based 
Sun City, outside Chicago, started this spring.

<HEADLINE> Williams Late to Saints Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LACROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Ricky Williams was late for his first pro  
football training camp on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans Saints said their Heisman Trophy-winning rookie  
running back was expected about noon, but did not arrive until 
almost 5 p.m. Saints officials had said his flight from Austin, 
Texas, was canceled after the plane had mechanical trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, the flight was just too early,'' Williams said. ``I  
skipped it and drove to Dallas and caught a plane from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints had booked him on a flight leaving at 5 a.m.,  
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams came to the Saints after coach Mike Ditka agreed to  
trade the rest of his draft picks to get a shot at Williams, 
college football's career rushing leader while at Texas.

<HEADLINE> NATO Replacement Exposes Discontent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration decision to  
accelerate the replacement of Gen. Wesley Clark as NATO commander 
next year exposes rifts in the U.S. high command that persist 
despite the allied victory in the Kosovo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushing Clark aside paves the way to install Air Force Gen.  
Joseph Ralston, now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs and a 
confidant of Defense Secretary William Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was putting the best face possible on the  
abrupt change of command, praising Clark and saying that moving up 
the four-star Army general's departure by two months -- from July to 
May next year -- was done to accommodate Ralston, who must leave his 
Joint Chiefs post by early next year. By law, he must get a new 
four-star position within 60 days or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gen. Clark is a superb commander. The president has the  
highest degree of confidence in him,'' national security adviser 
Sandy Berger said Wednesday at a White House news conference. ``He 
did a superb job in the prosecution of the campaign in Kosovo. 
Witness the fact that we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger left open the possibility that Clark might serve his  
country in ``other ways'' after leaving the NATO post. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in Yugoslavia apparently was not enough to earn  
Clark a second extension of his term as the supreme allied 
commander in Europe. Of the 10 previous officers to hold the job -- 
all Americans -- only three served shorter terms than the two years, 
10 months Clark will have served by next May. One of those, Gen. 
John Shalikashvili, left the European command in 1993 because 
Clinton named him chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark appeared to take the decision in stride. But officials  
close to him said he was miffed at how he was informed of it in a 
telephone call Tuesday from the current Joint Chiefs chairman, Army 
Gen. Hugh Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a soldier's journey is over, it's over,'' Clark said  
Wednesday, describing the action as a routine staff change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very proud of wearing this uniform. I love my job,'' he  
said in Vilnius, Lithuania, after a meeting with Lithuanian 
President Valdas Adamkus, according to Baltic News Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Several U.S. administration and military officials, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, pointed to points of tension in Clark's 
tenure: 
</P>
<P>
	--He argued strenuously that the option of using ground troops in  
Kosovo not be removed from the table and he chafed at the graduated 
air campaign dictated by the 19-member NATO alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clark was not particularly close to Cohen and the two often  
communicated through an intermediary, often Shelton or Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
	--The former Rhodes scholar, first in his West Point class of  
1966, has a sometimes curt manner and he ruffled feathers by 
appearing to covet the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Former senior officers viewed the administration's move as  
something between a slight of Clark and a political necessity in a 
19-member alliance that was often uneasy with the largely U.S.-led 
air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clark did a magnificent job of moving U.S. interests forward  
through a very complex arrangement of 19 NATO nations,'' said 
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Link. ``To me it was unlikely 
that he was able to do that without leaving some broken glass, and 
that broken glass will clutter the landscape for the U.S. and her 
NATO allies for months and years to come.... What's the best way to 
clear away that broken glass? It'll be gone the day that Clark 
steps down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Army Col. Kenneth Allard, a professor at Georgetown  
University's National Security Studies Program, said Ralston's 
appointment reflects a concern at the Pentagon that arose during 
the Kosovo campaign over having an Army general leading an air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the 11 NATO military commanders has been an Army  
general; the exception was Air Force Gen. Lauris Norstad in the 
late 1950s. That was because NATO's strategy was based on a large 
land force in place to defend Western Europe from a Soviet attack. 
NATO's new role focuses on using air power to combat instability 
and civil war in Europe. Moreover, Allard said, the Ralston 
appointment reflects the U.S. view that its contribution in future 
conflicts may be limited to air power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly a slight. I don't see how you can spin it any  
other way, especially due to the fact that you had a successful 
outcome of that war,'' Allard said. ``What I read into this is the 
fact that Wes Clark was a very, very strong advocate for not only 
using ground forces but for being very aggressive in what he did, 
and I think he was basically fought at every turn.''

<HEADLINE> Man Indicted in More Church Arsons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A man accused of setting fires at 12  
churches in Indiana and Georgia has been indicted in the arson 
blazes at 17 other churches across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal indictment handed down Tuesday against Jay Scott  
Ballinger, 36, accuses him of burning 29 churches in California, 
Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and 
Tennessee since 1994. His girlfriend allegedly was with him at 16 
of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Steven Riggs said he had not seen the  
indictment.

	``Based on my understanding of the government's view of this  
case these charges are disappointing but not surprising,'' Riggs 
said.

	Ballinger, who has shown a fascination with the satanic,  
allegedly told federal agents he burned 30 to 50 churches in 11 
states between 1994 and 1998. He was arrested in February following 
an Ohio church fire that police said left him severely burned. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Judith Stewart said the investigation is  
continuing, but she declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit, Ballinger's girlfriend, Angela Wood,  
24, of Athens, Ga., and another accomplice told federal agents they 
helped Ballinger burn an Indiana church where they painted an 
upside-down cross on the steps as part of a satanic ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, grand juries in Atlanta and Indianapolis  
charged Ballinger with 12 church arsons, including a blaze that 
killed a volunteer firefighter in Commerce, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest indictment adds charges of conspiracy to commit arson  
and church arson for the other fires. If convicted, Ballinger could 
face up to 215 years in prison and a fine of $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the arsons is unclear. When Ballinger, who is  
white, was first charged, acting Assistant Attorney General Bill 
Lann Lee observed that the churches involved had predominately 
white congregations. The new indictment does not address the racial 
breakdown of the 29 congregations.

<HEADLINE> NATO Job a Second Chance for Ralston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force general who lost his chance to  
get the nation's top military job because of a controversy over 
military sex scandals and a perceived double standard is getting 
another shot at a top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Joseph Ralston is the Clinton administration's choice to  
succeed Army Gen. Wesley Clark as the NATO alliance's top commander 
next year. The Senate must confirm the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who know Ralston say the move is the general's reward for  
quiet efficiency and loyalty to Defense Secretary William Cohen, 
and for making a graceful exit when news of an old affair 
threatened to embarrass both him and his Pentagon bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It literally is true that we've got to do something for  
Ralston,'' said Retired Army Col. Kenneth Allard, professor at 
Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program. ``Joe 
Ralston is as good as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allard also noted that the selection of an Air Force general to  
what has traditionally been an Army general's job demonstrates the 
evolution of NATO from a ground army to an air power, as recently 
demonstrated in the Kosovo bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects changing times. It's also a pretty strong signal  
for anyone looking: This is how the United States views its 
contribution to the alliance,'' Allard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston, a combat pilot in the Vietnam War, would be promoted  
from his No. 2 position at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Although a 
prestigious job inside military circles, Ralston's is not a marquee 
posting. 
</P>
<P>
	He performs much of the day-to-day political and diplomatic  
back-and-forth among national security agencies, and occasionally 
stands in for Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Henry Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton has dispatched Ralston to a number of hot spots,  
including India and Pakistan in January, where Ralston, Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and others tried to persuade both 
countries not to repeat nuclear tests that they had conducted the 
previous May. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen trusts Ralston, likes his no-flash, no-frills approach and  
wanted badly to keep Ralston in the military despite a planned 
retirement next year, Pentagon sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, traveling in Japan, told reporters he admires the  
diplomatic skills of both Clark and Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston declined comment when reached at the Pentagon Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	He was in line to succeed Gen. John Shalikashvili as chairman of  
the Joint Chiefs when he admitted in June 1997 that he had had an 
affair 13 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The admission couldn't have come at a worse time.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon was under intense scrutiny after numerous reports  
of sexual misconduct and outright abuse in the ranks: The Army was 
rocked by disclosures of drill sergeants engaging in sexual 
relationships with young trainees, the Army's top enlisted man was 
accused of a series of sex-abuse and harassment charges and a Navy 
admiral was forced to step down in a sex harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cohen stood by Ralston, critics on Capitol Hill and  
elsewhere complained of a double standard for high-ranking male 
officers. Lt. Kelly Flinn, a female Air Force bomber pilot, had 
chosen a general discharge to avoid a court-martial for adultery, 
lying and disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, both Ralston and Cohen expressed dismay that  
Ralston could be disqualified by a long-past affair that occurred 
while he was separated from the wife he later divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to say that anybody who has a single blemish in  
their private life can never be confirmed for something, can never 
be promoted?'' Cohen asked then. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston was commissioned through the Air Force Reserve Officer  
Training Corps in 1965. He flew 147 combat missions over Laos and 
North Vietnam, then rose in rank through a series of management and 
planning jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Barry Sanders Will Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders' most elusive move might be  
his last as an NFL player. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's second-leading career rusher apparently has decided to  
retire without talking to Detroit coach Bobby Ross or anyone else 
in the Lions organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by the Lions to talk to the running back have been as  
futile as a defender trying to arm-tackle him. But his agents 
delivered the news Tuesday night that Sanders planned to announce 
his retirement today, according to ESPN, The Detroit News and the 
Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' Denver-based agent, Lamont Smith, told The Detroit News  
that a statement would be released through a friend of Sanders in 
Wichita, Kan., his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ESPN, Sanders told Smith and his other agent, David  
Ware, of his retirement plans on Monday. The agents were unable to 
dissuade him, even with the argument that he's only 1,458 yards 
away from breaking the NFL career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	He rushed for 1,491 yards last season, ending a streak of four  
consecutive 1,500-yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware told the Free Press that Sanders' statement was well  
thought out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a line that says, `I've determined that my ... desire  
to leave is greater than my desire to continue playing,' or words 
to that effect,'' Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware said Sanders would not be available for comment today on  
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions had no comment on the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we really have no comment on the various reports  
regarding Barry,'' Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Tuesday night. 
``If anything should materialize, there will be an announcement. To 
comment any further would be speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ware and Smith didn't return calls seeking comment from The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told ESPN that Sanders wants to retire for several  
reasons, including the Lions' 5-11 finish last season, Ross' 
temperamental personality, local media reaction when it became 
known that he was contemplating retirement and because he doesn't 
believe the Lions are committed to winning. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sanders' 10 seasons in Detroit, the Lions have a 78-82  
regular-season record and made the playoffs five of those years. 
They have won only one playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	A source told ESPN that Sanders still loves the game, but is  
disenchanted with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware told the Free Press he was shocked by Sanders' decision.  
Ware declined to speculate on the exact reasons for Sanders' 
decision, but said it was outlined thoroughly in the statement 
Sanders wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read the statement,'' Ware said. ``I didn't write it; he  
wrote it himself. It was very thoughtful, very well thought out, 
and he has come to a decision that he thinks is best for him. What 
can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told The Detroit News that the move was not a negotiation  
ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you retire, you retire from football,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders nearly retired two years ago, according to Ware.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Ross said the Lions would not trade Sanders. That  
came after a report that the Washington Redskins were interested in 
pursuing a trade for Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was the only veteran absent from the Lions' mandatory  
minicamp in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and other members of the front office had said they had not  
heard from Sanders in the offseason, and he missed the mandatory 
and voluntary minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been reports that Sanders was unhappy with the Lions,  
but Sanders has not spoken publicly -- to the Lions or the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans are scheduled to report to camp on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997. All  
were related to contract negotiations. Sanders has played two years 
on a six-year, $36-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, has 15,269 career rushing yards, trailing only  
Chicago Bears' Walter Payton's 16,726 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lions have had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched around a 9-7  
record in 1997 that earned them a wild-card spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sanders has not spoken publicly this offseason, others  
have expressed the depth of his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' father, William, of Wichita, Kan., raised the  
possibility of retirement with biting comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sick of them (the Lions),'' William Sanders said in May.  
``He's sick of losing.''

<HEADLINE> Barry Sanders Says He Will Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Barry Sanders is quitting football,  
despite the near certainty of becoming the NFL's career rushing 
leader this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire to exit the game is greater than my desire to remain  
in it. I have searched my heart through and through and feel 
comfortable with this decision,'' Sanders said in a statement 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Lions running back arrived in London today on a  
flight from Detroit and said at Gatwick Airport: ``I'm going into 
retirement and I don't see my plans changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he came to London, Sanders said, ``I don't know the  
right way to retire. This is just my way of doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old star said he would spend a couple days in London  
before going to Amsterdam and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his retirement statement would speak for him. Sanders'  
statement was posted on The Wichita Eagle's Web site. Sanders grew 
up in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lions spokesman said general manager Chuck Schmidt had been in  
contact with Sanders' agents. Sanders retired without speaking to 
Detroit coach Bobby Ross or anyone else on the team but said he 
leaves ``on good terms with everyone in the organization.'' The 
team scheduled an afternoon news conference for today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football is still a game; we're talking about this man's  
life,'' tight end Walter Rasby said at practice today. ``It'll be a 
distraction to some people but it'll tighten us up as a team. I'm 
glad I got my jersey signed (by Sanders) last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders will be put on the Lions' reserve list after notifying  
the club of his retirement. However, an NFL spokeswoman said he can 
be activated any time this season until Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders would be in position for such a return because he stays  
in top shape whether he is working out with the team or not. 
However, those who know Sanders regard him as a man of his word, 
and unlikely to waver once he makes a major decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by his agents to talk him out of retiring have been as  
futile as a defender trying to arm-tackle him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not involved in a salary dispute of any kind,'' Sanders  
said. ``If I had played this season, I would have earned a more 
than satisfactory salary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders was a training-camp holdout in 1989, 1991 and 1997, all  
related to contract negotiations. He has played two years on a 
six-year, $36 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders is only 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter Payton's NFL  
career rushing record. One of Sanders' agents, David Ware, said the 
prospect of the record was not enough to get Sanders to change his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual accolades have never been the things that motivated  
Barry,'' Ware told WWJ radio in Detroit today. ``Money has never 
been something that motivated Barry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders rushed for 1,491 yards last season, ending a streak of  
four consecutive 1,500 yard seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably  
would not return for the 1999-2000 season,'' he said. ``I also felt 
that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my 
feelings and make sure that my feelings were backed with 
conviction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about Sanders' reasons for leaving include the  
Lions' 5-11 finish last season, Ross' temperamental personality and 
local media reaction when it became known he was contemplating 
retirement. Also, Sanders supposedly questions the Lions' 
commitment to winning. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Sanders had only praise for the team and its  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly will miss playing for the Lions,'' he said. ``I  
consider the Lions' players, coaches, staff, management and fans my 
family. I leave on good terms with everyone in the organization. I 
have enjoyed playing for two great head coaches, Wayne Fontes and 
Bobby Ross, who are good coaches and leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Sanders' 10 seasons in Detroit, the Lions had a 78-82  
regular-season record and made the playoffs five times, winning one 
playoff game. Detroit had two 5-11 seasons sandwiched around a 9-7 
record in 1997 that earned a wild-card spot.

<HEADLINE> Conviction in Oracle Case Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An appeals court upheld on Wednesday the  
perjury conviction of a former Oracle Corp. worker who had been 
found guilty of forging an e-mail to back her claim that she was 
fired after a relationship with chairman Larry Ellison ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelyn Lee, 33, was convicted in January 1997 of perjury,  
falsifying evidence and breaking into a computer network after 
using the e-mail in suing Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced in May 1997 to a year in jail and four years  
probation. She also was ordered to pay Oracle $100,000 in fines and 
to have no contact with Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeal rejected Ms. Lee's arguments  
that the San Mateo County Superior Court trial was rife with 
errors, that her counsel was ineffective, that the trial court 
erred in ordering restitution and in instructions to the jury on 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Ms. Lee's attorney, Gordon Rockhill, was not  
immediately returned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found that Ms. Lee used her boss's old password to  
break into Oracle's e-mail system the morning after she was fired 
from her job as an executive assistant at Oracle in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellison is one of America's richest people, with an estimated  
net worth of more than $9 billion, according to Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., is the leading producer  
of database software for businesses using computers or desktop 
machines linked in networks.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Jim Abbott Retires at 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Abbott, born without a right hand, set  
fierce standards for himself in becoming a major league pitcher. 
And he knows he is no longer the pitcher he wants to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after struggling through a comeback the last six months, he  
has quit baseball at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you don't measure up to the standards that you'd like  
to, it's time to look at what you're doing,'' he said Wednesday by 
telephone from his Corona del Mar home. ``So with my inconsistency 
over the past few months, I've had the chance to think about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His decision to retire without fanfare comes less than a week  
after being released by the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott pitched for a decade, including a no-hitter against  
Cleveland in 1993 at Yankee Stadium. But he had been just 2-8 with 
a 6.91 ERA since signing a $600,000 free-agent contract with the 
Brewers six month ago. Lifetime, Abbott was 87-108 with an ERA of 
4.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate,'' former California Angels manager  
Marcel Lachemann said. ``But there comes a point for everyone in 
their career when they have to make this decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his career, Abbott was saluted by fans and the league  
as an inspiration. But he hopes to be remembered for his game, not 
his handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always sort of said 'I'm just a baseball player,''' he  
said. ``I just wanted to be the best pitcher I could be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that I had to overcome something, I always  
thought that I had to live up to something,'' he said. ``But I 
understand that, in looking back, that will be the first thing that 
is mentioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he begins a new stage, though he's not sure what's in store.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no game plan,'' he said. ``Instead of forcing something  
quickly, I'll take a step back with my wife to see how we feel, 
then follow our hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mocked as ``Crab'' by young playmates who were uncomfortable  
with his unformed right hand, Abbott learned to shut out adversity 
and focus when on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was too concerned about what I was doing on the field to be  
concerned about what people were thinking in the stands,'' he 
recalled. ``I always did the best I could in terms of winning that 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott's signature pitching style dazzled fans. He would brace  
his mitt under his right arm while pitching, then slip his hand 
into the glove after he released the ball and be ready to catch 
before the ball reached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I was curious to see how he did it,'' said New York  
Mets third baseman Robin Ventura, who met Abbott during tryouts for 
the 1988 Olympic team. ``But quickly it became this guy is a great 
pitcher and you don't think about the fact that he only has one 
hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he's sad about Abbott's retirement, ``but obviously  
what he accomplished was more than what a regular player did. He 
gave people who face similar problems every day hope and 
inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His handicap was obvious, but to do that at the major league  
level was very inspirational. It was a burden. It made the job even 
harder,'' Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for him,'' said Willie Fraser, who pitched with  
Abbott for the Angels in 1989-1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, he had had enough,'' Fraser said of his friend  
and neighbor. ``He had a great career. He had everything to be 
proud of. He wasn't having as much fun doing it, not this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott was California's pick in the first round of the 1988  
draft, but he did not join the team right away because he was busy 
pitching the Olympic team to a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the 1989 season with the Angels, one of only a few  
players never to spend a single day in the minors. He pitched for 
the Angels for four years before being traded to the Yankees for 
three prospects, then signed with the White Sox as a free agent in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was traded back to the Angels, who released him after a  
series of shaky starts in 1997 spring training. He signed a minor 
league deal with the Angels in 1998, then on Jan. 27, joined the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott didn't bat in a regular season game until he joined the  
Brewers. He got his first hit in June during a game with the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers manager Phil Garner called Abbott ``one class  
individual,'' adding, ``that doesn't belie his competitive nature, 
but he's very much a gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former teammate Mark Langston, now with Cleveland, called Abbott  
``one of my favorite people on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how anybody could not have rooted for a guy like  
Jim,'' Langston said. ``To overcome what he did ... what an 
unbelievable guy and what a great athlete.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Fall on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybeans futures prices continued to  
plunge Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for 
cooler, wetter weather in key Midwestern growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service forecasts released during trading  
showed temperatures tapering off in portions of the Midwest next 
week as rains were expected to move in, giving parched crops some 
relief. The forecasts -- delayed because of a computer glitch -- 
erased early gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices rose on expectations of increased demand,  
including possible exports to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybeans futures prices started the day on an upswing  
after dropping sharply earlier in the week. The return of scorching 
temperatures to the Midwest, expected to last for the next few 
days, fueled the early rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.73 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.07 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.13 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 6 1/2 cents to 
$4.28 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .03 cent to 65.17 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .08 cent to 77.47 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs fell .13 cent to 48.72 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
1.78 cents to 49.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> No Casualties in Alaskan Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- As shipwrecks go, the Spirit of '98's  
encounter with a rock in Alaska's Inside Passage was a civilized 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of injuries or fuel spills when the small  
cruise ship hit a shoal Tuesday morning. All 93 passengers were 
transferred to another tourist boat by inflatable rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 192-foot ship was about 100 yards from shore in the passage  
-- a long, narrow stretch that offers spectacular views of glaciers, 
fjords, mountains and wildlife -- when it struck the rock about 9 
a.m. and began taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, the starboard side went up a little bit,''  
said Mike Sixtus of San Diego. ``I heard a little bit of a grind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Shrader, a Hinsdale, Ill., woman in her 80s, recalled  
not fear, but irritation at having to travel in an open boat in the 
mist and rain that often blanket southeastern Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody panicked, nobody screamed or yelled,'' Mrs. Shrader  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were taken to the Sea Lion, a similar cruise ship,  
and then to Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the ship's 27 crew members remained aboard to operate  
pumps. The ship's morning distress call reported flooding out of 
control. But by this morning, the ship had been patched and emptied 
of water and was ready to be towed to Ketchikan for more permanent 
repairs, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spirit of '98 is one of seven small cruise ships operated by  
Seattle-based Alaska Sightseeing-Cruise West. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, which has an 1890s decor and is built to resemble the  
old-time coastal cruising vessels, was on its way from Seattle to 
Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident site is 16 miles into Tracy Arm, a long, narrow  
fjord popular for sightseeing boats, about 40 miles southeast of 
Juneau, Alaska's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Wetherell, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said an  
accident investigation will include testing the crew for drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third small cruise ship to run aground this summer.  
The Wilderness Adventurer grounded last month in Glacier Bay 
National Park and Reserve, spilling more than 200 gallons of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Wilderness Explorer, owned by the same company as  
the Wilderness Adventurer, ran aground in an inlet 70 miles west of 
Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no injuries in either accident.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose in morning trading Thursday as  
investors snapped up high-technology issues. The dollar gained 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average advanced 189.52  
points, or 1.08 percent, to finish the morning session at 
17,769.43. On Wednesday, the average closed up 117.19 points, or 
0.67 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.69 yen at midday, up 0.17 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 116.12 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices continued their advance as investors  
bought high-technology blue chips amid optimistic economic data 
released earlier in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony gained $5.88, or 4.9 percent, to $127.06 after the consumer  
electronics giant said it smoothly reduced inventory during the 
April-June quarter. Sony announced quarterly earnings after the 
market close Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sony's group net profit dropped 55 percent on year to  
$160 million as sales declined 8.4 percent to $12.83 billion 
because of a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares also received a boost after the Ministry of International  
Trade and Industry Thursday morning said production at Japanese 
factories and mines increased 3.0 percent in June from May after 
adjustment for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump was the highest month-on-month rise since January 1997  
and far exceeded economists' predictions. MITI attributed the 
increase to economic recovery around Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section finished the morning session up 13.72 points, or 0.95 
percent, to 1,464.05. The TOPIX closed up 16.22 points, or 1.13 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar slid lower from its late New  
York level, which prompted further warnings from Japan's Finance 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the ministry's international bureau,  
reiterated that Japan would take action to stop any rise in the yen 
before its economy recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has bought dollars in recent weeks to try to  
stop the yen's rapid rise and aid the country's fledgling economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.30 yen, down  
from 123.54 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7900 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7000 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.08 yen from 100.86 yen.

	Compaq To Cut Up to 8,000 Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. plans to slash up to 8,000  
jobs, or 12 percent of its workforce, as it struggles to cut costs 
amid a $184 million loss in the second quarter brought on by 
computer price wars and slowing sales. The cuts unveiled today are 
the first major move by chief executive and president Michael D. 
Capellas, promoted to the post just last week to turn around the 
No. 1 PC maker's flagging business. The workforce reduction comes 
on top of 17,000 jobs that Compaq already is axing after Compaq 
acquired Digital Equipment last year.

	Einhorn Ordered To Pay $907 Million  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A counterculture guru convicted in absentia  
of killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a steamer trunk 
22 years ago was ordered by a jury today to pay her family $907 
million. The wrongful-death verdict in the civil case against Ira 
Einhorn came after a two-day trial in which Einhorn -- who lives as 
a free man in France, where he is fighting extradition -- put up no 
defense. Holly Maddux was bludgeoned to death in 1977, but her body 
was not found until 18 months later in a closet in Einhorn's home.

	Judge Rules FDA Restricts Co. Speech  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today struck down as  
unconstitutional a law allowing the government to restrict 
information drug companies can give doctors about unapproved uses 
of medicines. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the 
Food and Drug Modernization Act illegally restricts the free speech 
of drug companies. In question is the distribution of research 
reports and medical journal articles focusing on using drugs for 
illnesses other than the ones they were originally approved for. 
Many drugs have more than one use and doctors often learn of such 
``off label'' uses through such studies.

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- World nations and aid organizations  
promised more than $2 billion today to rebuild war-ravaged Kosovo -- 
a sum that far exceeds the immediate need, officials said. Pledges 
from more than 60 countries, dozens of aid agencies and regional 
groups totaled nearly four times the amount needed to make 
immediate repairs and restore order in the region, said Johannes 
Linn, World Bank's vice president for Europe and Central Asia.

nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region and Russia saying it is 
close to doing the same. The pledges came at the close of a 
three-day gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
India and China's consents were a victory for ASEAN, which has been

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Tillman Franks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Tillman Franks grew up in a world of  
honky-tonks and hillbilly tunes, that triangle between Louisiana, 
Texas and Arkansas that he still calls the ``country soul of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He fell in love early on with the kind of music that celebrates  
hard lives, lost loves, bad men who go out carousing and the good 
women who wait at home for them -- the kind of music that pays 
tribute to the rough-edged folks who listened to church songs and 
torch songs with equal fervor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has always been the best place in the world for music,  
the holy triangle,'' Franks says. ``You can find any kind and every 
kind -- country, blues, rock 'n' roll, anything -- and it's all 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks, 79, went on to find fame in the world of country music.  
But not the kind of fame that sent shrieking girls after him or 
caused theaters to sell out when he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks is the kind of famous where a lot of famous people know  
him. The kind of famous that existed when big things were 
happening. He was part of building the legends around countless 
country music stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone in country music knows Tillman,'' says Merle Kilgore,  
manager of Hank Williams Jr. ``And those of us who've been around 
for a while have stories about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks' little office is crowded with a very special brand of  
memorabilia. A musician, songwriter, manager and producer, Franks 
has done everything from back-up groups to book talent to lend 
money or supply groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	The walls are hung with records he helped write, pictures of  
people he helped launch -- including a young Elvis Presley and Hank 
Williams -- awards he's won and letters from people he's known. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. postage stamp of Hank Williams shows the singer wearing  
one of Franks' suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so poor when he was starting out he didn't have a  
suit,'' said Franks, who booked Williams for many of his early 
gigs. ``So we cut one of mine down to fit him. It's my photo of him 
that was used for the stamp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks is also the man who booked a young Presley onto the  
Louisiana Hayride when Presley was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship that still pays dividends was Franks' long  
association with Johnny Horton, who had Top-10 country hits like 
``Battle of New Orleans,'' ``North to Alaska'' and ``Sink the 
Bismarck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Franks and Horton were both down and out when they  
got together. Franks had been fired by the Hayride and Horton, who 
then billed himself as ``The Singing Fisherman,'' was spending more 
time fishing than singing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Tillman, if you'll manage me I'll hit No. 1,''  
Franks recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	And Horton promised they'd make some money on the way.  
</P>
<P>
	Franks had enough faith in Horton to sell some of the songs he'd  
written to pay off Horton's mortgage and to finance a 1955 trip to 
Nashville to record ``Honky-Tonk Man,'' which Franks and Horton 
wrote with Howard Hausey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the playback and said, `Johnny, this is it. You've  
done it with this one.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The song flew into the Top 10, as did ``I'm a One Woman Man,''  
recorded at the same session, and Horton became known as the 
Honky-Tonk Man rather than the Singing Fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	At Franks' urging, Horton recorded ``When It's Springtime in  
Alaska,'' a song used in Horton's stage show. That was followed by 
``Battle of New Orleans,'' and ``North to Alaska,'' the theme song 
of a John Wayne movie. 
</P>
<P>
	But Horton suddenly started holding seances and became  
fascinated with the supernatural. He feared air travel, telling 
Franks he was convinced he was about to die violently. 
</P>
<P>
	Horton's prediction came true as he drove back from an  
appearance in Austin, Texas, on Nov. 5, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to get back to Shreveport because duck season was  
starting,'' Franks says. ``He was driving pretty fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a bridge near Milano, Texas, a pickup truck swerved into  
Horton's car, shearing the driver's side. Horton died on the way to 
the hospital; Franks, who was asleep in the seat next to Horton, 
had only cuts to his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a loss,'' Franks says. ``He was just getting into  
his own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horton's music lives on, however.  
</P>
<P>
	His records have regained popularity and young singers are  
discovering his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm making a living today because of the songs I wrote for  
Johnny Horton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks also performs, playing bass for gigs in Texas, Louisiana,  
Arkansas, and anywhere else he can. He was honored at the 50th 
Anniversary show for the Louisiana Hayride. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a pretty funny life I guess, but it's always been  
interesting,'' Franks said. ``I've had the pleasure of knowing a 
lot of people and enjoying most of them.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Caused Lawn Mower Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Ala. (AP) -- A bomb caused a mysterious back yard  
explosion that killed both a man on his lawn mower and his dog, 
investigators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've requested a forensic chemist to come in since this is  
now considered a homicide,'' said Jaime Reyes, chief federal 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no suspects in the bombing and investigators had not  
determined what kind of explosive device was used or where it was 
placed, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monday afternoon blast ripped the mower apart and instantly  
killed 52-year-old James Larry McAnnally, who worked for a 
construction company in Birmingham. His dog was killed also. 
</P>
<P>
	The mower's steering wheel was blown over the house into the  
front yard, and other pieces of machinery were flung on the roof 
and in neighbors' yards.

<HEADLINE> Source: American, BA To Scrap Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Airlines and British Airways plan to  
withdraw their application to the U.S. Department of Transportation 
to set up a global aviation alliance, after reaching gridlock with 
British regulators, a U.S. government official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday  
the move came after the department indicated it was likely to 
dismiss the petition because talks between the airlines and 
Britain's Office of Fair Trade have been deadlocked for many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines are expected to make an announcement by the end of  
the week, ending their three-year effort to merge their 
organizations, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the Office of Fair Trade's demand that British  
Airways give up hundreds of takeoff or landing spots at London's 
Heathrow Airport, thus opening it up to competition. The airport is 
popular with business travelers and serves as an international 
gateway to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Access to Heathrow has also proved to be a sticking point in  
negotiations between the U.S. and U.K. governments over a new 
aviation agreement. The current treaty, called Bermuda II, allows 
access to Heathrow by only two U.S. carriers, currently American 
and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials want more access for other carriers, with the aim  
of reducing airfares. The United States has already concluded 30 
such ``open skies'' agreements around the world. U.K. officials 
have balked at the request and sought, in exchange, a drop in 
current prohibitions against foreigners owning U.S. airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department has firmly stated that it would  
not approve the airline alliance without the concession of better 
access to Heathrow. Some U.S. airlines have accused the British 
government of protecting British Airways, a former state airline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said that access to Heathrow and an open skies  
agreement would be necessary for approval of an alliance, but we 
have not predicated open skies upon such approval,'' the government 
source said. ``We will continue to work with the U.K. government 
towards an open skies agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The petition by American and British Airways for antitrust  
immunity would have allowed the carriers to engage in certain kinds 
of information sharing that airlines are banned from doing without 
the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	The two carriers planned to coordinate pricing and schedules,  
and share revenue on transatlantic flights. Their partnership was 
to form the basis of the world's most powerful airline group, 
called Oneworld. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneworld, which also includes Qantas of Australia, Canadian  
Airlines, Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong, Iberia of Spain and Finnair, 
was established to challenge the increasing power of groups such as 
the Star Alliance, led by Lufthansa of Germany and United Airlines 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways told the Financial Times of London in a story  
published in Thursday's editions that it still wanted to pursue the 
American alliance.

<HEADLINE> You and the Yachting World / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You know the U.S. economy is booming by the  
privately owned megayachts in the harbor. They're getting even 
bigger, costlier and more numerous. 
</P>
<P>
	And the ultimate is yet to come. That's indicated by the rapid  
growth of power yachts, from about 100 feet or 125 feet three years 
ago to 150 feet to 200 feet in today's market. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the biggest to cruise under the U.S. flag is the  
315-foot, 11-inch Limitless, owned by Leslie Wexner, head of The 
Limited, but several owners are said to be thinking of challenging 
for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, size isn't everything in megayacht society, where  
opulence knows no maximum, such as 39 bathrooms and 300 tons of 
marble in the Japanese-Turkish owned Savarona. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexner's yacht is the only football stadium-size owned by an  
American -- Sakura, property of Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison, for 
example, is only 192 feet -- but boatyards never have been busier. 
</P>
<P>
	It suggests bigger things to come. From a tiny percentage just  
10 years ago, American yards now are responsible for 34 percent to 
36 percent of the world's megayacht construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Such information comes from Power &AMP; Motoryacht magazine, where  
senior editor Diane Byrne haunts the world's somewhat secretive 
boatyard operators and owners in search of information. 
</P>
<P>
	The spurt in U.S. construction is significant, because glamor  
yacht construction was mainly an endeavor of yards in Greece, which 
is still No. 1, and such countries as Holland, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in fact, most of the very large owners were foreigners too.  
Limitless is still only No. 8 in the magazine's world listing, just 
behind the 325-foot Christina O, formerly owned by Aristotle 
Onassis. And Mipos, being built in Germany, will measure 465 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	But interest among Americans is growing fast, and construction  
activity too, enough so for Ms. Byrne to declare Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., the yachting capital, and Palmer Johnson of Sturgeon Bay, 
Wis., one of the world's top builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Since yachting takes big money, there's little question that  
such growth emanates from the rapid rise of individual wealth in 
the 1990s, much a result of entrepreneurship and rising stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	We're talking here about castles, the like of which old royalty  
seldom enjoyed. A hypothetical 130-foot yacht with a fine interior 
might sell for $13 million, but it could run a great deal more. 
</P>
<P>
	Size is important for reasons of ego, but it isn't everything;  
the design, and the lavish interiors and powerful machinery, can 
mean a price difference of as much as $10 million, says Ms. Bryne. 
Some yachts have accessories such as automobiles and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial cost, therefore, is merely the beginning. A rule of  
thumb suggests one-tenth the price is needed to maintain a big boat 
for a year, meaning a $3.5 million bill as the cost of owning a $35 
million yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	For corporate owners, many such expenses are tax-deductible,  
but, alas, not so for those who own for pleasure only. While their 
fate is hardly lamentable, they do have to put forth some effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Such owners must be endowed with not just assets but income too,  
and therefore many of the newer owners have to work to support the 
yacht. Work eats up time; it doesn't leave many days for sporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this, some of the world's best yachts are rented out  
-- pardon, offered for charter. Christina O charters for a 
half-million dollars a week, but don't get any ideas. Ms. Byrne 
says it's booked from April through October for the next eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	So, you say, you'll build instead. Well, you'll just have to  
wait. Ms. Byrne reports that every custom shipbuilder worldwide is 
booked two years out.

<HEADLINE> Technique Helps Terrify Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Blair Witch Project'' is turning out to  
be a spellbinder that has some moviegoers asking for a reality 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's mock-documentary technique follows three young  
filmmakers who vanish in the woods near Burkittsville, Md., as they 
track a 200-year-old legendary witch. It's scary stuff for some -- 
and apparently realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy wrote us to say he went driving around Burkittsville  
and he felt this strange presence had surrounded him,'' said 
filmmaker Eduardo Sanchez, who created ``Blair Witch'' with Daniel 
Myrick. ``Then he was afraid to get out of his car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's no accident. Believability in ``The Blair Witch Project''  
is central to its success, with the film's Web site, 
blairwitch.com, helping to embroider the tale. The site has a 
timeline of events that begins with the witch's rumored origin, and 
ends with details of the search for the missing film crew. It never 
explicitly states the story is fiction, which it is. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more.  
</P>
<P>
	On cable television's Sci-Fi Channel, an ``Unsolved  
Mysteries''-style promotion provides interviews with family and 
friends of the film's missing characters. A traveling museum making 
the rounds at theaters exhibits ``Blair Witch'' lore. And a novel, 
purportedly written by a private detective who searched for the 
film crew, includes excerpts from one of their journals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advertising is like a companion piece to this film,'' said  
Amorette Jones, a marketing director at Artisan Entertainment. ``We 
never lied to anyone, but we tried to make it scarier by creating 
an element of truth in the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing scheme has resulted in days of sold-out ticket  
sales at the 31 locations showing ``Blair Witch.'' The film earned 
$2 million last weekend -- only slightly less than the total for 
``Muppets from Space,'' which was showing at more than 2,200 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Such breakout success has Sanchez and Myrick wondering just how  
much the film's legend will spread when ``The Blair Witch Project' 
goes into wide release on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a fan has written the filmmakers to criticize a  
purported tale of an 1886 search party that was found murdered 
after its members apparently fell prey to the forest-dwelling 
witch. 
</P>
<P>
	``That letter started out, `It's all a lie. It's a big hoax,'''  
said Myrick, 35. ``And I thought, `Well, this guy figured it out.' 
Then he went on to say, `You had it wrong. Here's the real way they 
were found.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some believers have organized search parties to look for the  
fictional documentary crew, who vanished in 1994. Still others have 
ventured into the Maryland woods with hopes of being spooked by the 
witch, the filmmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate for them to waste their time,'' Myrick said. ``But at  
the same time you're really excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez, 30, added: ``Everybody is getting something out of it  
on a lot of different levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they spoke at a Beverly Hills restaurant, a waitress  
volunteered she'd been duped by the ``Blair Witch'' tale, and 
admitted she'd spent an hour arguing with a friend who told her the 
film isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, it's real, right?'' she asked the pair.  
</P>
<P>
	Myrick glanced at Sanchez and said: ``We're not telling you one  
way or the other.''

<HEADLINE> Web Sites Ignore Privacy Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few Web site operators are abiding by federal  
guidelines designed to protect the personal information of Internet 
users and Congress should pass legislation to crack down on privacy 
violations, a watchdog group says. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Senate committee chairman and the Federal Trade Commission  
disagree, saying the Internet is changing too quickly to determine 
whether private industries can police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on prior reports on Internet users and Web sites, the  
Center for Democracy and Technology said Congress should pass 
legislation to force compliance with FTC guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of privacy protection on the Internet contributes to a  
pervasive ``unease that someone's watching you,'' Deirdre Mulligan, 
counsel for the center, told the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet privacy on the Internet should be the rule rather  
than the exception,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns,  
R-Mont., has introduced legislation to require Web site operators 
to post privacy policies on their pages and allow consumers to 
direct that their private information not be shared. 
</P>
<P>
	But Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has sided  
with the FTC, saying it's too soon to move legislation. That stance 
virtually kills Burns' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet changes daily, if not hourly,'' McCain said in a  
statement. ``Any regulation imposed today may be ineffective in 
protecting consumers tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned ``the industry should not be misled into thinking  
that these results represent some type of pass on future 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said a study by Georgetown University found that 94 of  
the 100 most frequently used Web sites have privacy disclosures, as 
do two-thirds of randomly visited sites. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mulligan and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic  
Privacy Information Center, told lawmakers that many of those 
disclosures do nothing else -- such as explain how a consumer might 
refuse to allow personal information to be sold or shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy policy is not the same as privacy protection,''  
Rotenberg told the panel. If Congress does not provide better 
enforcement and clearer guidelines, consumers will be left with a 
choice to ``use the Internet and give up their privacy, or stay off 
the Net.''

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Boosts U.S. Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the U.S. Postal Service decided to  
sponsor an internationally competitive cycling team, it never 
foresaw how its red, white and blue insignia would be etched into 
the minds of millions of sports fans just as deeply as the 
race-leader's yellow jersey worn by the Tour de France winner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high profile victory of 27-year old Lance Armstrong did  
just that, bringing the agency an unexpected publicity boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's comeback from testicular cancer that had spread to  
his lungs and brain three years ago made his victory in the 
2,286-mile, three-week race a human interest story the American 
media trumpeted for days. Armstrong is only the second American to 
win the world's highest profile cycling event. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your logo and your brand is associated with a champion of  
this caliber, and you hear about his heroic comeback from cancer -- 
I can't say that in our wildest imagination we ever felt that 
promotion would be that successful or give so many rich rewards,'' 
USPS spokesman Norm Scherstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service decided to sponsor a cycling team because it  
saw a unique advertising opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would portray the brand over a long period of time in a  
very positive light and connect it with a type of operation that is 
postal in nature -- the teamwork, and the commitment of meeting a 
deadline and getting a job done well,'' Scherstrom said. ``We liked 
that association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service put the team together in 1996 partly because  
the Tour de France draws a large international crowd, particularly 
in Europe, where competitive biking is popular and the race is an 
international event watched by millions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the idea of a government agency sponsoring a sports team  
seems strange, Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House 
Government Reform postal subcommittee, points out that the Postal 
Service pays for its own operations -- including its promotion -- and 
is not subsidized with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
	``All postal products do benefit by seeing the USPS logo on Mr.  
Armstrong's jersey, and there's no question the average mailer 
could benefit by increased volume generate by this advertising 
campaign,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Postal Service won't reveal how much it spends  
sponsoring the cycling team because of ``proprietary reasons,'' the 
agency insists the expenditure is a fraction of its $254 million 
advertising budget. Most of its advertising money goes toward 
promoting its Priority Mail service, Scherstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service works with an overall budget of $60 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Scherstrom said he doesn't know what the marketing department  
will do next. He noted that the Postal Service was a sponsor of the 
1992 Olympics but said, ``This is a unique thing for us and I 
really don't know where it might go from here.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Additive Alert Raises Cost Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy experts cautiously predict that  
Americans are unlikely to see much higher gasoline prices because 
of the Environmental Protection Agency's wish to curtail use of a 
common fuel additive. 
</P>
<P>
	But confusion about what would replace the methanol-based  
additive in a federal program that requires ``reformulated 
gasoline'' to be sold in areas with the most severe air pollution 
leaves unclear what might happen at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA advisory panel, in a report released Tuesday, recognized  
that reformulated gas has improved air quality in several 
metropolitan areas. The 1990 Clean Air Act mandates that 
reformulated gas contain a higher amount of oxygen, and MTBE has 
become the most widely used oxygenate additive to accomplish that. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical is in gasoline sold in at least 16 states, or  
altogether in about a third of the nation's motor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel said concerns are growing about MTBE's appearance  
in groundwater, where it causes a foul smell and taste while not 
yet posing a health risk, and recommended its use be substantially 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Administrator Carol Browner responded by saying the agency  
would work with Congress on legislation to maintain the 
reformulated-gas program but phase out MTBE. She also a promised a 
crackdown on leaking underground storage tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested removing the oxygenate requirement to allow  
more alternatives to MTBE to emerge and reduce the chances of 
disruptions in the nation's fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Perciasepe, EPA's assistant administrator for air and  
radiation, stressed that any changes to the program must safeguard 
water supplies without sacrificing air quality gains. A reduction 
in MTBE must also protect consumers from gas price fluctuations and 
preserve the use of renewable fuels, such as corn-based ethanol, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	How the EPA would propose to meet all those goals was unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel suggested MTBE use be gradually decreased over four  
years so refiners could find other ways to reduce toxic chemical 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given enough time for a transition ... the impact on  
(gasoline) prices should be very small or not noticeable,'' said 
Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Boston-based Health Effects 
Institute and chairman of the advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy analysts tend to agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who this is really traumatic for are the refiners  
who've invested production money into MTBE,'' said analyst Tim 
Evans at Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	If many refiners go bankrupt from their investments in MTBE, a  
reduction in overall production capacity could lead to spot 
gasoline shortages and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Evans said: ``I wouldn't expect to see any immediate  
impact of prices at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious replacement for MTBE would be ethanol, but it  
costs more to make. It also evaporates more readily, particularly 
in hot summer months, releasing organic pollutants. For that 
reason, to be used in the summer it must be blended with a more 
expensive, cleaner-burning gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	And ethanol is primarily manufactured in the Midwest, making it  
difficult now to get it to key West Coast and Northeast markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bruce Knight, chief lobbyist for the National Corn Growers  
Association, said ethanol plants produce enough of the fuel now to 
meet the needs of the large California market. They could quickly 
grow their capacity -- outside the Midwest, if needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possible alternative is a blend of alkalytes and  
aromatics, which are derived from crude oil, though neither is an 
oxygenate. Aromatics are slightly less expensive than ethanol, but 
pose risks of increased toxic emissions. Alkalytes, though clean 
burning, are low-octane and would require pricey capital 
investment.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 23.43; Nasdaq Up 0.35 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower today, failing to  
follow through on yesterday's gains, as traders awaited the latest 
indications of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest 
rates later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 23.43 at 10,955.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 2.66 at 1,360.18, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 0.35 at 2,679.68. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing support behind stocks on Tuesday, sending the Dow  
up 115.88 points, investors shied away today in advance of Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, Greenspan surprised Wall Street by telling the  
House Banking Committee the Fed remains on watch for inflationary 
pressures, and may be willing to raise interest rates again to hold 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments today were expected to closely mirror last  
week's remarks, but traders were gearing up to listen closely to 
the question-and-answer period following his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were mostly lower today. Mindspring, an Internet  
service provider, dropped 4 7/16 to 35 13/16 a day after the 
company said it will spend heavily to develop its business. While 
Mindspring beat analysts' expectations for its second-quarter 
earnings, the company warned that earnings will slide in the next 
three quarters as marketing costs increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where early volume came to 90.2 
million shares, behind Tuesday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.36 at 639.33, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 0.68 at 793.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas indexes were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei stock  
average rose 0.67 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX 
index was up 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.5 percent, 
and France's CAC-40 was up 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Suggests Delaying Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
today that Congress ``probably would be better off'' delaying a tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the uncertainty of projecting future government  
surpluses, which some members of Congress want to use to finance a 
tax cut and others want to earmark for various new programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut  
immediately, largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are 
doing a great deal of good to the economy,'' Greenspan said in 
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank chairman's warning, which he has made before,  
was renewed as the Senate prepares to debate a $792 billion 
Republican tax cut proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, however, said he would prefer a tax cut over  
committing surpluses to spending on new government programs, such 
as the expansion of Medicare benefits President Clinton has 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very strongly would argue against using the surplus for new  
spending,'' said Greenspan. ``If that appears to be coming, I would 
favor tax cuts even in the short term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said his first preference, for now, is to use any  
surpluses to pay down the national debt. Lower government debt, he 
said, would help pull down interest rates for consumers and 
businesses and put the nation in a better position to afford the 
looming baby boom retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections for huge surpluses in coming years are precarious,  
the Fed chairman said, because the government's current flush 
circumstances cannot be entirely explained by the booming economy 
or lawmakers' actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are happening which we call technical factors, which is  
another way of saying we don't have a clue and they could just as 
easily go in the other direction,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a tax cut is agreed to, he said, lawmakers must be prepared  
for the possibility that expected surpluses won't materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, Greenspan said, pushing taxes back up again could  
be destructive to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress has got to be prepared to cut spending and not raise  
taxes back,'' Greenspan said. ``The one thing we don't want to do 
is to create tax policies that are uncertain and variable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also renewed warnings today that the nation's central  
bank will move ``promptly and forcefully'' to raise interest rates 
again to counter inflation if the economy shows signs of 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers already have increased interest rates modestly  
once this year, in June, as a preemptive strike against possible 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan appears before Congress twice a year, at separate  
House and Senate hearings, to provide an update on the central 
bank's views. The assessment he gave senators today was nearly 
identical to what he told members of the House Banking Committee 
July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices have retreated from all-time highs since that  
warning -- which Greenspan repeated today -- that the Fed is ready to 
nudge interest rates higher if the economy shows signs of 
overheating, such as rising consumer prices or labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also raised concerns about overconfidence among stock  
market investors who may think that the nation's 8-year economic 
expansion -- the longest in peacetime history -- can continue 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed chairman said that, so far, 1999 has been ``an  
exceptional year for the American economy,'' with almost 1.25 
million jobs created and no pickup yet in consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers are predicting a slight slowdown in economic  
growth for the rest of this year and a bigger slowing in 2000 with 
a modest pickup in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan stressed the need for ``pre-emptive  
policy-making,'' by the Fed should there be signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on June 30 pushed up its federal funds rate -- the  
interest that banks charge each other -- by a quarter point, to 5 
percent. That triggered banks to make an immediate quarter-point 
increase in their own prime lending rate, the benchmark for 
consumer and small business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rallied after the rate increase because Fed  
policy-makers at the same time announced a shift in their policy 
bias -- an indication of future moves -- to neutral from leaning 
toward rate increases. That had investors convinced that the Fed 
would be slow to boost interest rates further. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts now say the tone of Greenspan's report to  
Congress is a strong indication that the Fed still may raise 
interest rates again before the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Infinity Reports Higher Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Infinity Broadcasting Corp., the radio company  
owned mainly by CBS Corp., reported a sharp rise in second quarter 
earnings due to advertising gains and the inclusion of revenues 
from a radio company it acquired a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 30, Infinity earned $100  
million, or 12 cents a share, edging out Wall Street estimates of 
11 cents per share. In the same period a year ago, the company 
earned $67 million, or 10 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results in the latest quarter included American Radio  
Systems, which Infinity acquired a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the period rose 31 percent to $597 million from  
$456 million including ARS. Not counting the new stations, revenues 
still rose a hefty 15 percent. Infinity did not provide comparable 
figures for profits that excluded the acquired stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity is one of the largest radio companies in the nation,  
with 163 stations in major markets. It also has a major outdoor 
advertising operation, which grew even larger with the acquisition 
announced in May of Outdoor Systems, the nation's leading company 
providing billboard and other outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Infinity earned $147  
million, a 33 percent rise from $98 million in the same period a 
year ago. Revenues rose 36 percent to $1.07 billion from $785 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Infinity fell 93 3/4 cents to $27.87 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> BMW Earnings Down 26.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- BMW posted a 26.8 percent drop in  
first-half profit, blaming the decline on sluggish sales and model 
changes in its British unit, Rover. Analysts had expected a larger 
earnings decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The German automaker said Wednesday that earnings fell to 191  
million euros, or $203 million, from 261 million euros in the first 
six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 3.3 percent to 16.35 billion euros, or $17.3  
billion, in the first half from 15.8 billion euros a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW and the British government have launched a  
multibillion-dollar rescue package for the struggling Rover unit, 
which includes phasing out Rover's 600 and 800 models and 
introducing a new model, the Rover 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Those changes, plus poor sales of Rover models in Britain, hurt  
profits in the past six months, Munich-based Bayerische Motoren 
Werke AG said. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW said deliveries of Rover passenger cars dropped 33.5 percent  
to 114,364 units compared to the same period last year while its 
Land Rover offroad vehicle posted a 26.7 percent rise to 90,957 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	But BMW said Rover's performance should improve in the year's  
second half, adding that it expects the unit to break even in 2002 
-- even if the pound continues strong against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also repeated its forecast that full-year earnings  
will match 1998 levels as restructuring measures at Rover start to 
have a positive impact on group earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts who had predicted a 32 percent profit drop for the  
period attributed the performance to strong sales of BMW models. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand posted a 13.4 percent rise in first-half sales, mainly  
due to strong sales in Europe and North America, the group said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is proposing new de-icing  
procedures for 17 types of planes frequently used by commuter 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday a rule it has  
drafted would require the immediate use of equipment known as 
de-icing boots at the first sign of ice formation anywhere on the 
aircraft or upon alert of the aircraft's ice detector system, 
whichever occurs first. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would require continued use as long as icing conditions  
are present. The rule would take effect after an industry comment 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots now often delay using the boots to avoid ice bridging.  
Those are ice formations above the boots, which typically occurs 
with older equipment that is not powerful enough to completely shed 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Research since the mid-1990s has found that modern de-icing  
boots do an effective job in both shedding ice and preventing ice 
bridging, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule change would affect 3,018 U.S. registered aircraft.  
Compliance would cost the industry an estimated $181,080. Most U.S. 
regional airlines would be affected by the rule change given their 
heavy reliance on modern turboprop aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The airplanes affected by the proposed rule are: Aerospatiale  
Model ATR-42 and ATR-72; Bombardier Model DHC-7 and DHC-8; British 
Aerospace Model HS 748; CASA C-212 and CN-235; Cessna Models 500, 
501, 550, 551, and 560; Dornier Model 328-100; and Fairchild Model 
F27 and FH227. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Fokker Model F27 Mark 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and  
700; Fokker Model F27 Mark 050; Gulfstream Aerospace Model G-159; 
Gulfstream American (Frakes Aviation) Model G-73 (Mallard) and 
G-73T; Jetstream Model BAe ATP and Model 4101; Lockheed Model L-14 
and L-18 and Model 1329-23 and 1329-25; and McDonnell Douglas Model 
DC-3 and DC-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Mitsubishi Model YS-11 and YS-11A; Saab SF-340A, 340B and  
Saab 2000; Sabreliner Model NA-265-40, NA-265-60, and NA-265-80; 
Short Brothers SD3-30, SD3-60, SD3-Sherpa and SD3-60 Sherpa.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Judge Johnson Eulogized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALEYVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Frank M. Johnson Jr. was laid to rest in  
the same northern county where as a boy he gained the independence 
and strength to later confront racism as a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite threats and social ostracism, Johnson fearlessly issued  
rulings in the 1950s and '60s that ended the era of segregated 
buses, schools, parks and restaurants in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Johnson spent his life vindicating American values and  
the values of these hills,'' U.S. Attorney Redding Pitt said 
Tuesday after a graveside service held under a scorching summer 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of about 100 that gathered around the grave included  
friends, relatives, judges and attorneys. Johnson's former law 
clerks served as pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson died Friday of pneumonia at age 80. His wife of 61  
years, Ruth, was presented the folded U.S. flag that draped his 
silver casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was raised in fiercely independent Winston County, which  
was staunchly anti-slavery in Civil War days and attempted to 
secede from Alabama after the state joined the Confederacy. Signs 
around town still proclaim the county as the ``Free State of 
Winston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and relatives said it was this heritage that gave  
Johnson the strong sense of justice and racial fairness exhibited 
in a string of landmark rulings in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole Johnson family is from here. They are independent  
and they are proud of it,'' said brother-in-law Jim Harvill. 
</P>
<P>
	``His actions as a judge stood for what he believed,'' said  
Larry Albright, a friend and the town clerk in Haleyville, where a 
plaque honoring Johnson was dedicated a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson made a pivotal 1956 decision that marked a victory for  
the Montgomery bus boycott, outlawing segregation across a wide 
spectrum -- on public transportation and in parks, restaurants, 
libraries and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he signed an order to integrate the University of  
Alabama. Later rulings guaranteed basic human rights for patients 
in Alabama's mental health and inmates in its prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's rulings led to threats against him and his family and  
in some ways made him a social outcast in Alabama's capital. A 
cross was burned on his lawn, and his mother's Montgomery house was 
bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending the service was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wrote  
a book about Johnson in the mid-1970s. ``He is as much an American 
hero as the leaders of the Revolutionary War and the Civil War,'' 
Kennedy said after the service.

<HEADLINE> GM Car Sales Plunge in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- General Motors Corp. said its car sales in Russia  
dropped more than 90 percent in the first half of 1999 from the 
same period last year, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the onset of the latest economic crisis last August, sales  
of new foreign cars dropped dramatically in Russia. The crisis has 
stripped away many of the gains of the nascent middle class, and 
made foreign-made cars have become much more expensive due to the 
ruble's devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's official dealer network in Russia sold just 242 cars in the  
six months to June, down from 2,546 cars in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the GM's Moscow office went unanswered Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	GM sold 115 Chevrolet Blazers assembled at its Yelabuga Yelaz  
joint venture, 81 Opels, 41 assorted Chevrolet cars and four 
Cadillacs, ITAR-Tass said, citing GM's Moscow representative 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month GM plans to open a new subsidiary in Moscow, General  
Motors CIS, which will coordinate car sales through its official 
dealer network.

<HEADLINE> Einhorn Ordered To Pay $907 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A counterculture guru convicted in absentia  
of killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body in a steamer trunk 
22 years ago was ordered by a jury Wednesday to pay her family $907 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful-death verdict in the civil case against Ira Einhorn  
came after a two-day trial in which Einhorn -- who lives as a free 
man in France, where he is fighting extradition -- put up no 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's heard loud and clear in Champagne-Mouton,'' said  
Elizabeth Hall, one of Holly Maddux's sisters, referring to the 
small town where Einhorn lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hall said she does not expect to collect any of the award.  
James R. Beasley, the family's lawyer, said the point was not 
necessarily to get the money but to prevent Einhorn from profiting 
from any book or movie deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the murder case was the subject of an NBC  
mini-series, ``The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer.'' Einhorn did not 
profit from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Maddux was bludgeoned to death in 1977, but her body was not  
found until 18 months later in a closet in Einhorn's home. A 
prominent antiwar campaigner and activist in the 1960s, Einhorn, 
now 58, fled the United States and was sentenced to life in prison 
following his 1993 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After 16 years in hiding, he was tracked down and arrested at  
his home in the French countryside in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn failed to respond to numerous legal papers delivered to  
his home in the wrongful-death case, leading Judge Sandra Moser 
Moss to rule that he had effectively admitted liability. 
</P>
<P>
	She told jurors that their only decision was to determine how  
much Einhorn should have to pay. The jury awarded the family $752 
million in punitive damages and $155 million in compensatory 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Ms. Hall testified that she was ``infuriated  
and horrified'' at the thought Einhorn could make millions from his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn could not immediately be reached for comment on the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the syndicated radio talk show Radio  
America on Wednesday morning, he said he was interested in writing 
a book but had no intention of making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent of the crime as charged, and I will declare that  
until my dying breath,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Titans Release Linebacker Marts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans released veteran  
linebacker Lonnie Marts on Wednesday to create some room under the 
salary cap, then set about trying to work out a new contract with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marts, a nine-year veteran, was due to be paid $1.6 million this  
season. The move nearly came on Tuesday when the news was included 
on a release but quickly withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans had to create some room to finish their one-year deal  
with quarterback Neil O'Donnell and sign top draft pick Jevon 
Kearse, who received a five-year, $6.1 million contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Fisher said he has spoken with Marts and that general  
manager Floyd Reese has spoken with his agent to try and re-sign 
him for a lower deal before Sunday's first practice for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do, however, want to get it done as quickly as possible. ...  
I don't want to risk losing another linebacker,'' Fisher said.

<HEADLINE>  New Owner Meets Avs, Nuggets GMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Shrugging off jet lag, the new owner of the Denver  
Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Pepsi Center met Wednesday with 
officials of those entities in a get-acquainted session that lasted 
nearly six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuggets general manager Dan Issel and Avalanche GM Pierre  
Lacroix both said the meetings were cordial and they were excited 
to be working with their new boss, Donald Sturm. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a low-key billionaire Denver businessman, submitted a  
winning bid of $461 million to acquire those properties from Ascent 
Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm won the right to engage in a bidding war with Bill and  
Nancy Laurie, whose $400 million offer in April was set aside when 
Ascent shareholders sued, saying the price was too low. The 
Lauries, however, said Tuesday they would not participate in a new 
auction of the sports assets. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Sturm is the new owner, pending approval by the city  
of Denver and by the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm met at the Pepsi Center with Issel; Lacroix; Tim Romani,  
who is overseeing construction of the $160 million Pepsi Center; 
and other officials. Sturm whizzed past reporters without comment 
as he left the complex, waving from his blue Mercedes convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm tentatively planned to hold a news conference on Monday,  
according to Chuck Neinas, acting chairman and CEO of Ascent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm and his wife, Nancy, returned from France at 2 a.m.  
Wednesday, but that didn't deter them from holding the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more social than anything else,'' Lacroix said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very nice meeting,'' Issel said. ``We talked about  
some specifics, but it was more of a getting-acquainted meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he sensed that he and Sturm were on the same page in  
terms of their plans for the Nuggets, Issel smiled and said, 
``They're nice people and I think they're going to be terrific 
owners for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they look at this as a community project. These are  
community assets. They're Denverites and they want both teams to do 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was surprised that the Sturms almost immediately  
plunged into meetings after their long flight, Issel said, ``Pretty 
impressive, huh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neinas said the Sturms, accompanied by adviser Erik Grabli,  
``met with various management personnel to get an overview of the 
whole operation so they can begin working on the transition. I 
would call it a very constructive, very positive meeting, mostly a 
get-to-know-you type session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting it is 64 days until the Pepsi Center's scheduled opening,  
Neinas said both Ascent and the Sturms were intent on a smooth, 
rapid transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technically, the sale is dependent upon getting approval from  
the city and the two leagues,'' Neinas said. ``It's not our 
timetable. But we have committed ourselves to make it as smooth as 
possible. Technically, Ascent owns the properties until the 
approvals are obtained. We will continue to operate the teams, but 
obviously we need to establish good communications with the Sturm 
group because basically now we're spending Mr. Sturm's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any attempts by the Nuggets or Avalanche to sign free agents,  
particularly Issel's determination to re-sign point guard Nick Van 
Exel, will be run past Sturm, Neinas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the Sturms' plans for the remainder of the day,  
Neinas said, ``I think they're going to go home and go to bed. They 
were a bit tired, and I'm surprised they stayed this long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, 67, who owns four banks but whose wealth comes primarily  
from stock ownership in telecommunications pipeline companies, 
outbid the Borgen Group, in partnership with John Elway, and Thara 
Saud, a purported Saudi Arabian princess, in the first round of the 
action, advancing to the aborted showdown with the Lauries, who 
three months ago celebrated their apparent ownership of the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm's net worth was cited as $1.7 billion in the 1998 edition  
of Forbes' 400 richest Americans list. In a more recent edition of 
the magazine, Sturm's wealth was estimated at $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond stating a desire to keep the teams locally owned, Sturm  
has not revealed much about his motivations for buying the teams 
and the arena.

<HEADLINE> Study: Nasal Radium Put Vets at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Navy submariners may be at higher risk for  
cancer if they got nasal radium treatments in the 1940s through 
1960s, according to a new study from the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was the first done on veterans who were given nasal  
radium and represents one of the government's strongest indications 
that the treatment -- also administered to an estimated 2 million 
civilians for ear, sinus or similar problems -- could cause health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But the number of deaths counted in the survey was too small to  
offer conclusive evidence of a link between the treatment and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``raises some troubling questions,'' said Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, D-Conn., who requested the study and released it 
Tuesday. ``We owe the men who faithfully served our country some 
answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasal radium was given to thousands of military submariners,  
divers and pilots who were troubled by drastic changes in 
atmospheric pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated as  
many as 2 million civilians were also treated, mostly as children 
for colds, tonsillitis, ear infections and sinus or adenoid 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, applicators containing 50 milligrams of radium were  
used to shrink tissues at the entrance of the eustachian tubes. 
Those tubes help drain and balance pressure on the inner and outer 
ear. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical military regimen consisted of three to four  
treatments, of six to 12 minutes each, a few weeks apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, radium treatments were abandoned as antibiotics were  
developed, the military went to pressurized aircraft cabins and 
questions were increasingly raised about radiation's health 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, former radium patients have come forward to  
complain of tumors, thyroid and immune disorders, brittle teeth and 
reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA, in its study, compared deaths among 1,214 submariners  
who had the treatment with deaths in a control group of 3,176 
randomly selected veterans who were not treated. 
</P>
<P>
	It found a 47 percent increased risk of deaths from head and  
neck cancers in submariners who were treated, as well as a higher, 
overall death rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The department cautioned that the findings were not  
statistically significant due to the relatively small number of 
deaths: 307 in the treated group compared with 605 in the untreated 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the finding suggests World War II veterans who received  
nasal irradiation while in submarine school ``may be at increased 
risk for deaths due to head and neck cancers,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treated veterans were identified from a log book kept at the  
U.S. naval base in Groton, Conn., where submariners are trained. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA is conducting a follow-up study on the health of living  
veterans who had radium treatments. That is due early next year. 
Other studies, by private researchers, have found increased cancer 
incidence in treated children compared with children who did not 
have radium. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a law passed by Congress in 1998, the VA is offering free  
medical examinations and treatment to veterans who have head or 
neck cancer and were treated with radium.

<HEADLINE> Technique Helps Terrify Viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Blair Witch Project'' is turning out to  
be a spellbinder that has some moviegoers asking for a reality 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's mock-documentary technique follows three young  
filmmakers who vanish in the woods near Burkittsville, Md., as they 
track a 200-year-old legendary witch. It's scary stuff for some -- 
and apparently realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``One guy wrote us to say he went driving around Burkittsville  
and he felt this strange presence had surrounded him,'' said 
filmmaker Eduardo Sanchez, who created ``Blair Witch'' with Daniel 
Myrick. ``Then he was afraid to get out of his car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's no accident. Believability in ``The Blair Witch Project''  
is central to its success, with the film's Web site, 
blairwitch.com, helping to embroider the tale. The site has a 
timeline of events that begins with the witch's rumored origin, and 
ends with details of the search for the missing film crew. It never 
explicitly states the story is fiction, which it is. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's more.  
</P>
<P>
	On cable television's Sci-Fi Channel, an ``Unsolved  
Mysteries''-style promotion provides interviews with family and 
friends of the film's missing characters. A traveling museum making 
the rounds at theaters exhibits ``Blair Witch'' lore. And a novel, 
purportedly written by a private detective who searched for the 
film crew, includes excerpts from one of their journals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advertising is like a companion piece to this film,'' said  
Amorette Jones, a marketing director at Artisan Entertainment. ``We 
never lied to anyone, but we tried to make it scarier by creating 
an element of truth in the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing scheme has resulted in days of sold-out ticket  
sales at the 31 locations showing ``Blair Witch.'' The film earned 
$2 million last weekend -- only slightly less than the total for 
``Muppets from Space,'' which was showing at more than 2,200 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Such breakout success has Sanchez and Myrick wondering just how  
much the film's legend will spread when ``The Blair Witch Project' 
goes into wide release on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a fan has written the filmmakers to criticize a  
purported tale of an 1886 search party that was found murdered 
after its members apparently fell prey to the forest-dwelling 
witch. 
</P>
<P>
	``That letter started out, `It's all a lie. It's a big hoax,'''  
said Myrick, 35. ``And I thought, `Well, this guy figured it out.' 
Then he went on to say, `You had it wrong. Here's the real way they 
were found.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some believers have organized search parties to look for the  
fictional documentary crew, who vanished in 1994. Still others have 
ventured into the Maryland woods with hopes of being spooked by the 
witch, the filmmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate for them to waste their time,'' Myrick said. ``But at  
the same time you're really excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez, 30, added: ``Everybody is getting something out of it  
on a lot of different levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they spoke at a Beverly Hills restaurant, a waitress  
volunteered she'd been duped by the ``Blair Witch'' tale, and 
admitted she'd spent an hour arguing with a friend who told her the 
film isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, it's real, right?'' she asked the pair.  
</P>
<P>
	Myrick glanced at Sanchez and said: ``We're not telling you one  
way or the other.''

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Sees Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch, led by continued strong  
performance in domestic beer sales, saw earnings rise 10 percent in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based company, maker of Budweiser, Bud Light,  
Michelob and other beers, is the world's largest brewer. 
Anheuser-Busch earned $431 million, or 90 cents per share, for the 
quarter ending June 30. That compared to earnings of $391 million, 
or 80 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have achieved our third consecutive quarter of solid  
double-digit earnings per share growth since implementing our 
revenue enhancement strategy of selective, market-by-market price 
increases or discount reductions,'' said August A. Busch III, 
chairman of the board and president. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, earnings were up 14  
percent, to $750 million, or $1.56 per share, from $656 million, or 
$1.34 per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales during the six-month period were up 4.6 percent, to $5.8  
billion from $5.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch's domestic beer market share for the first six  
months was 46.1 percent, an increase of 0.8 percent, the company 
said. Domestic beer shipments were 47.9 million barrels, up 4.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	International beer volume declined 1.2 percent in the second  
quarter and grew 0.4 percent for the first six months of 1999. The 
company said gains in Canada, Latin America and continental Europe 
helped offset continued weakness in Asia and a slowdown in the 
United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Apple To Invest $100M in Samsung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. will invest $100  
million in Samsung Electronics Co. in a deal aimed at securing an 
adequate supply of advanced flat-panel screens for its iBook and 
other laptop computers, a Samsung statement said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract calls for Apple to buy $100 million worth of  
Samsung Electronics' convertible bonds that have a maturity of 
three years. The bonds can be converted to common shares or deposit 
receipts beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung Electronics, the flagship company of South Korean  
conglomerate Samsung, said it would use the money to expand its 
facility to produce larger thin-film transistor liquid crystal 
displays, or TFT-LCDs for short. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung already is the world's leading producer of such  
high-quality screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our new iBook and fast selling Powerbooks, Apple will  
need more flat displays then ever going forward,'' Apple CEO Steve 
Jobs was quoted as saying in a statement released by Samsung 
Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Apple a key supply source in one of the fastest  
growing markets in the multimedia hardware industry. Flat-panel 
screens are increasingly used in wall-hung televisions, cars, 
handheld devices, and military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other South Korean big businesses hit by a severe economic  
recession, Samsung has been selling assets and wooing foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands agreed  
to buy a 50-percent stake in another South Korean flat-panel 
display maker, LG LCD Co., for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's Samsung, Hyundai and LG conglomerates moved into  
the TFT-LCD business in the early 1990s and have since expanded its 
facilities aggressively, expecting huge demand for flat-panel color 
screens. The global market reached $8 billion last year and is 
rapidly growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Samsung said its flat-panel screen sales were expected to grow  
125 percent to $1.8 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Every tiny dot on the TFT-LCD screens has a small transistor  
behind it to increase the contrast and speed of the display. But 
that makes the screens very difficult and expensive to make.

<HEADLINE>  Space Shuttle Did Leak Hydrogen Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA found three little holes  
Wednesday in an engine nozzle of space shuttle Columbia after its 
return to Earth, confirming fears that the ship leaked hydrogen 
fuel during liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's engine manager called the leak ``too close for comfort,''  
and the space agency vowed to find out how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that there was never any danger of an explosion  
but that if the leak had been bigger, it could have caused an 
engine shutdown and forced an unprecedented emergency landing in 
either Florida or Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned about it, very concerned,'' said George  
Hopson, manager of NASA's shuttle main engine program. He added: 
``We fully intend to find out what happened to this nozzle and make 
sure it doesn't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, engineers were perplexed when Columbia ended up seven  
miles short of its intended orbit after liftoff Friday. They 
checked photographs of the launch and found that a hydrogen leak 
probably was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	After Columbia touched down Tuesday night, NASA got a look, and  
the damage was immediately visible: three holes, no more than a 
quarter-inch in size, in three side-by-side steel tubes in the 
right engine nozzle. 
</P>
<P>
	The holes were big enough for as much as five pounds of hydrogen  
fuel to leak each second of Columbia's 8 1/2-minute climb to orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too close for comfort,'' Hopson said.  
</P>
<P>
	The nozzle may have been struck by a rock or a piece of the  
brick flame trench underneath the spacecraft when the rocket 
ignited, Hopson said. The area is supposed to be clean of debris. 
It's also possible the tubes were damaged well before the 
countdown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopson said it is extremely unlikely a structural defect caused  
the holes, since all three tubes had the same kind of flaw in 
basically the same place. The main engines -- including the 1,080 
tubes that constitute each nozzle -- are made in Canoga Park, 
Calif., by Rocketdyne, a division of Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	A full engine leak check was last performed more than a year  
ago, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has seen such hydrogen leaks before, but they were so small  
they went undetected until after touchdown. This was much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopson said he expects it will take at least a couple of weeks  
to determine what happened, following microscopic analyses. ``We 
sure want to find out before the next flight, that's for sure,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Endeavour is scheduled to blast off in September on a  
radar-mapping mission. NASA will double-check all the tubes, Hopson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nozzle problem is more serious, Hopson said, than an  
unrelated short circuit five seconds into the flight. Both problems 
happened on the first U.S. space flight to be commanded by a woman, 
Air Force Col. Eileen Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, using binoculars, saw the holes as she walked around  
Columbia shortly after the smooth touchdown at Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to get back home and find out really what they  
found,'' she said before leaving for a Houston celebration attended 
by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her crew did not learn about the hydrogen leak until  
they were well into their five-day mission to release the $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. They knew immediately, however, 
when the short circuit occurred, because warning lights flashed in 
the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said she braced for a possible emergency landing back in  
Florida or Africa, something never before attempted. ``If we lose 
an engine, where are we going to go?'' she recalled wondering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am just amazed that I don't think my stress level was any  
different, other than I heard the call and I went, `Wow, I'm 
surprised that happened,''' the 42-year-old Air Force colonel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers have yet to pinpoint the location of the short  
circuit. The short knocked out the main computers for two of the 
three main shuttle engines. Backups promptly kicked in.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Was Never Ordinary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Barry Sanders never adhered to conventional wisdom, either on  
the field or off it. That's why his retirement announcement 
probably should be taken more seriously than that of the average 
star who ``retires'' for negotiation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	If Barry Sanders says he's tired of football, chances are he is.  
And it doesn't matter that he only needs 1,458 yards -- an average 
season for Sanders -- to break Walter Payton's career rushing 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was astounded when I heard he was retiring with the record  
so close,'' former Buffalo coach Marv Levy said Wednesday, an 
opinion echoed by almost everyone in football. ``But when you think 
about it, he's never been a guy who postures. There's nothing phony 
about him, so if he says he's retired, maybe he's retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, Barry Sanders doesn't like posturing.  
</P>
<P>
	Go back to training camp in 1992, after Detroit lost 41-10 to  
Washington in the NFC title game, the closest Sanders ever got to a 
Super Bowl in 10 years with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Side-by-side were two lockers, shrines to offensive linemen Mike  
Utley, paralyzed on the field the year before, and Eric Andolsek, 
killed in an offseason accident. That's the way Wayne Fontes, the 
team's emotional coach, thought was the best way to pay tribute to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders didn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I like that,'' Sanders said, looking at the  
lockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys weren't gods. They were real people. They have  
families, and those families have feelings. No, I don't like it. 
Mike's still very much alive and I think we should be reminded of 
Eric's positive contributions, not his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, there was no one like Sanders, either.  
</P>
<P>
	He regularly led the league in losses -- his style was zigzag,  
not straight ahead, and when he zigged for a hole that wasn't 
there, he'd get trapped 2, 3, 4 yards behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	But a play or two later, he'd break for 30 or more, sometimes  
bending his body at a 45-degree angle from the ground, then 
bouncing up to dart through a small hole. At 5-foot-8, 200 pounds, 
he had the flexibility of a gymnast, the ability to twist and turn 
in ways an Emmitt Smith or a Terrell Davis, the best of his 
contemporaries, wouldn't even attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry did things I wouldn't try to do,'' said Davis, who ran  
for 2,008 yards for Denver last season and is now the game's 
preeminent running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a running back. He's a great athlete. If he were a  
lineman, he'd be the best lineman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why did he retire? Sanders said in his statement it was the  
culmination of a thought process that began after last season. And 
his father suggested in May that his son was upset by the 
mediocrity of the Lions and the inability of Detroit to trade him 
because of the multimillion-dollar salary cap hit they would take. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sanders' 10 years, his team was 78-82 in regular-season play  
and 1-5 the five years they made the playoffs. In the Fontes era, 
which covered Sanders' first eight seasons, the Lions were 
constantly changing coordinators and systems -- from the 
run-and-shoot, to a one-back system with no blocker, to a more 
conventional pro-set. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd gain his 1,500 or 1,700, or 1,800 yards in whatever system  
and got 2,058 in Bobby Ross' first year, 1997, carrying Detroit to 
the playoffs in a brilliant final regular-season game. Naturally, 
they lost their first postseason game, 20-10 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Lions had finished 5-11 last season, Sanders  
apparently had enough. He'd had an ``off'' year, 1,491 yards, and 
there were no Super Bowl rings in sight. So he stayed silent until 
he shocked the football world on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that what I think of first is how what I do helps the  
team out,'' Davis said. ``So I can see his disappointment. The last 
10 years have been for naught. But I feel bad because people won't 
get to watch him anymore. I'm like anyone else. I'm disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Sanders, he seemed a little lost outside the confined  
world of football. So while his agents were releasing his 
retirement statement, he was flying to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the right way to retire,'' he said when he landed  
in London. ``This is just my way of doing it.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Cautions Against Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged  
Congress on Wednesday to delay any big tax cuts until budget 
surpluses materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan also  
renewed a warning issued to House lawmakers last week that the Fed 
was prepared to raise interest rates again if necessary to hold 
inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	On tax cuts, Greenspan said Congress should proceed slowly and  
cautiously. ``Probably we would be better off holding off on a tax 
cut immediately, largely because of the fact that it is apparent 
that the surpluses are doing a great deal of positive good to the 
economy,'' Greenspan told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony came as the Senate began debating the  
Republicans' proposed 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank chairman has said repeatedly that he's not  
against tax cuts. Indeed, he has long opposed capital gains taxes. 
But he expressed concern that given the uncertainty of projecting 
future government surpluses, all the money needed to finance such a 
cut may not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be cautious in the beginning,'' he said, adding that  
there's ``no problem in delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Projecting budget surpluses over a long period is dubious  
because the country's economic boom cannot be entirely explained, 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are happening which we call technical factors, which is  
another way of saying we don't have a clue, and they could just as 
readily go in the other direction,'' he said. ``And, if you start 
to simulate a number of these things that could go wrong, those 
surpluses evaporate fairly rapidly -- at least the size of them 
shrinks dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said, however, he would prefer a tax cut over using  
the expected surpluses to pay for new government programs, such as 
the expansion of Medicare benefits President Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said his ``first preference'' was to use any surpluses  
to pay down the national debt. That would help pull down interest 
rates and better prepare the nation for the looming baby boom 
retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	And a tax cut always could come in handy as an economic stimulus  
if the now-robust economy should weaken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan made his remarks after giving the committee his  
midterm report on the economy, the same report he gave last week to 
the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He renewed last week's warning that the Fed will move ``promptly  
and forcefully'' to raise interest rates again to counter inflation 
if the economy shows signs of overheating. The Fed raised rates 
June 30 as a pre-emptive strike against possible inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that  
orders for big-ticket manufactured goods expected to last at least 
three years rose just 0.3 percent in June, less than many analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said June's report shows that the nation's battered  
manufacturing sector is still feeling the lingering effects of a 
global financial crisis. ``The industrial sector is still 
struggling,'' said Merrill Lynch economist Stan Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase reflected gains in orders for cars and auto parts,  
and electronic and electrical equipment, and came despite a decline 
in orders for aircraft and airplane parts.

said, when parents and teachers struggle to address youth rage and 
prevent more school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long interview with The Associated Press on  
Wednesday, Bauer grew most animated when discussing the April 20 
rampage at a Colorado high school by teen gunmen Eric Harris and 
Dylan Klebold, who were reportedly known among classmates as Nazi 
sympathizers. The pair killed 12 fellow students and a teacher 
before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did adults in that school feel that they couldn't grab  
Eric and Dylan and say 'You know, if I see you give the Nazi salute 
again, if I don't break your arm, you're going to be out of this 
school for the rest of this year.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to his boyhood home, Bauer added: ``That's what would  
have happened in Newport, Ky., 30 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not advocating violence as a response to  
violence, and was also not proposing to outlaw certain unruly or 
offensive gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say, ``Throw 'em in jail.' I say you discipline a kid  
that gives the Nazi salute. I mean, if the kid goes down the hall 
and gives you the finger you ought to do something about it,'' 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-shot candidate, who called GOP rival George W. Bush's  
fund-raising juggernaut ``devastating'' to his own bid, rejected 
for the first time the idea of a third-party run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should never say never, I guess,'' Bauer, a conservative  
activist, said in an interview saturated by his references to 
Ronald Reagan and his unabashedly conservative party of ``bold 
colors not pale pastels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to spend 25 years building something from  
scratch,'' Bauer said. ``I'd rather stay in this party and make it 
the party of Lincoln and Reagan than bail out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boasting a tie clip from his days working in the Reagan White  
House, Bauer joked of also sporting Reagan underwear. ``Anything I 
can do to fortify me for the long road ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he put to rest recent speculation that he would bolt the  
GOP to test third-party prospects, Bauer harshly accused Republican 
congressional leaders of ``hesitancy ... lack of direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have, he said, effectively given President Clinton free  
rein over policy, particularly on trade with China. On that issue, 
the Republican-led Congress also ``couldn't free itself'' from the 
influence of lobbyists, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next month's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, Bauer  
said he hoped to finish among the top five of 10 Republicans. He 
acknowledged Bush's formidable status as front-runner but called 
the Texas governor's campaign ``pitiful so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I envious that the guy can go into a state and flip some  
pancakes and be on the front pages of all the state newspapers? 
Yeah, I'd love to be able to do that,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how does that help somebody who's trying to figure out how  
to make their schools better?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who reported a $500,000 campaign deficit as of June 30,  
said he and his staff of 40 are prepared to run in the red until 
January, when federal matching funds become available.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Leader Still Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic  
emerged from a military court Wednesday and said the government has 
decided not to arrest him while they investigate whether he dodged 
the draft during NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, who is leading protests against Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic, said the proceedings were inconclusive, but 
that the investigation against him would continue with no set date 
for another court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour military hearing was closed, and no official  
information was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic's lawyer, Strahinja Kastratovic, said the military  
prosecutor had withdrawn his request for the politician's arrest, 
removing for now the possibility of imprisonment while the 
investigation goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the intention of the regime is to keep him as long  
as possible under threat,'' Kastratovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, denounced the  
proceedings as a ``political trial,'' and said his sentencing would 
only speed up the demise of Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morally, it is really cynical to summon me, the president of a  
(political) party that ... has warned against the catastrophic 
policy of this regime,'' Djindjic told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers say proceedings against him are baseless because he  
never received his draft papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, 46, fled to Montenegro, Serbia's small and more  
liberal partner in the Yugoslav federation, during the nearly 
three-month long NATO airstrikes, which started in March. He said 
he feared for his life because of his fierce opposition to 
Milosevic's autocratic regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after he left Belgrade, military authorities in the  
capital tried to serve him with a draft notice, but associates at 
his party's headquarters refused to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic's party is working with a pro-democracy umbrella group,  
the Alliance for Change, to topple the Yugoslav leader. The 
alliance has been holding a series of anti-Milosevic demonstrations 
across Serbia demanding his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 of Djindjic's supporters chanted ``Zoran, Zoran'' and  
waved Democratic Party flags as he entered the downtown court. 
</P>
<P>
	If indicted, tried and found guilty of dodging the draft,  
Djindjic could face up to 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Will Probe Burglaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The police chief has reversed a decision to  
reduce home burglary investigations in the city after Mayor Susan 
Golding intervened and advised him not to change the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Tuesday that Chief Dave  
Bejarano was considering eliminating home burglary investigations 
unless there was a known suspect, a compelling lead or extensive 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejarano based the proposal on a study of some of the  
department's annual 7,000 home burglary cases and found that about 
only 12 percent were solved. Few resulted in arrests and even fewer 
garnered convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejarano said resources would be better spent by sending  
officers to neighborhoods where drugs are widely sold and used 
since drug habits drive many people to steal. 
</P>
<P>
	Golding, who learned of the proposal when reading the newspaper  
article, criticized the idea in a terse letter to the city manager 
and a phone call to the chief. She held a news conference Tuesday 
to publicly denounce the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be clear that this departmental change of policy ...  
is unacceptable to me,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejarano later held his own news conference to say the policy  
would not change.

<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Magicalmysterycat, trained by D.  
Wayne Lukas, remained undefeated Wednesday by winning the $109,500 
Schuylerville Stakes in the opening feature of the Saratoga meet. 
</P>
<P>
	In a race for 2-year-old fillies, the California speedster won  
by three-quarters of a length and showed the same grit she 
displayed in taking her first four career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Joseph Iracane and Padua Stable, Magicalmysterycat  
covered six furlongs in 1:10:4 on a fast track. This was her third 
stakes victory following Hollywood Park's Cinderella and Landaluce 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat, ridden by Pat Day and carrying highweight of  
122 pounds, raced on or near the lead while in company with Regally 
Appealing in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Circle of Light, the favorite, ran gamely through the stretch  
and finished second. Regally Appealing was another nose back. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat returned $9.20, $3.90 and $3.30 and earned  
$65,780 for her owners. Circle of Light paid $3.30 and $2.60 and 
Regally Appealing showed at $4.60. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the fifth time Lukas won the Schuylerville. His other  
victories were by Sacahuista (1986), Over All (1987), Wonders 
Delight (1988) and Golden Attraction (1995).

<HEADLINE> Report: Troopers Posed With Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Eight state troopers evacuating concertgoers  
at the end of Woodstock '99 urged two young female fans to strip 
and then posed for photos when they were naked, The Post-Standard 
of Syracuse reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, I saw you do it all day today. Why not for us?'' one  
trooper said to the women, the newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day music festival, which ended Sunday night, was  
generally peaceful until a mob set fire to tractor-trailers, a bus 
and several toilets during the closing act. Troopers in riot gear 
helped restore order before dawn Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women laughed and disrobed, posing with several troopers  
as other officers took pictures, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little odd for us to get naked for the police, but  
hey, that's Woodstock,'' one of the women told the newspaper. 
``Everybody just mellows out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State police are investigating. Lt. Jamie Mills said Tuesday  
that ``obviously, such allegations are disturbing and would be 
considered inappropriate.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lauren Bacall is returning to Broadway -- and on  
Noel Coward's 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress will star in a revival of Coward's 1960 comedy  
``Waiting in the Wings.'' It will open in New York on Dec. 16, a 
century after the English playwright was born in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacall, who has won Tonys for her performances in such musicals  
as ``Applause'' and ``Woman of the Year,'' will take the show to 
Boston first, trying it out there at the Colonial Theater Nov. 
11-28. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, set in a retirement home for actresses, is about the  
arrival of a newcomer whose appearance reignites old rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacall, who has starred in such movie classics as ``Key Largo,''  
``To Have and Have Not'' and ``The Big Sleep,'' portrays the new

<HEADLINE>  O'Donnell Starting Over With Titans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Neil O'Donnell stepped up to the ball  
Wednesday during his first practice with the Tennessee Titans and 
slipped into some old habits. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the count with the cadence he used while with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers, the New York Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
His slips pointed out, he laughed and switched cadences. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not bad for someone who arrived Tuesday night and had  
only a couple of hours with the 4-inch thick playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head's swimming a little bit, but I'm ready to go,'' said  
O'Donnell, who agreed last week to a one-year, $1.1 million 
contract to back up Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nine-year veteran knows he will need every day of  
training camp to study the Titans' offense. That is why he was on 
the field Wednesday for the first practice with rookies and 
selected veterans. The rest of the team reports Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals signed O'Donnell shortly before camp last year, and  
he learned quickly enough to start 11 games, including the season 
opener against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 2,216 yards and 15 touchdowns with just four  
interceptions but was benched after the Bengals lost eight of their 
first 10 games, 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell became expendable in April when Cincinnati drafted  
Akili Smith. That left the man who helped the Steelers to the 1996 
Super Bowl looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to start but took the one-year stint backing up McNair  
after being lobbied by tight end Frank Wycheck and his former 
receiver Yancey Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair and O'Donnell haven't had much time to talk about  
anything other than football. But the Titans have made it clear 
McNair is their starter and O'Donnell their insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no pressure on me, no pressure on O'Donnell,'' McNair  
said after practice. ``We're in the mode that whatever it takes to 
help this team we'll make the sacrifice to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans have four quarterbacks in camp. The odd man out may  
be Steve Matthews, who spent last season as the No. 3 quarterback 
and failed to impress during minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell needed only one practice to show offensive coordinator  
Les Steckel he is ready to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking a language that's totally unfamiliar. But the  
good news is he's a veteran and very bright. Boy, he's a very 
conscientious guy,'' Steckel said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell plans to prepare as if he is starting.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know how this crazy game is. Anything can happen,'' he  
said. ``I respect Steve and his ability. If we're winning and 
everything's going smooth, we'll be fine.''

<HEADLINE>  Smith Hopes Sanders Will Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Although the retirement of Barry  
Sanders makes Emmitt Smith the NFL's active career rushing leader, 
the Dallas Cowboys star hopes his statistical rival returns to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to leave the game, that's his choice,'' Smith  
said Wednesday. ``The only thing I can say is that I wish he 
wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's a back who has many, many more years in front  
of him. This is a very unfortunate situation. Maybe it's only 
temporary. Maybe he might reconsider and come back. Maybe they 
might trade him away. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders leaves with 15,269 career yards, the second-most  
all-time and 1,458 shy of breaking Walter Payton's record. Smith is 
No. 5 on the overall list with 12,566 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see him break the record,'' said Smith, who is  
only 694 yards from passing Tony Dorsett and Eric Dickerson to 
become No. 3. ``I think Barry would've been the first back to break 
the 20,000 barrier.''

<HEADLINE>  Smith Hopes Sanders Will Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) -- Although the retirement of Barry  
Sanders makes Emmitt Smith the NFL's active career rushing leader, 
the Dallas Cowboys star hopes his statistical rival returns to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he chooses to leave the game, that's his choice,'' Smith  
said Wednesday. ``The only thing I can say is that I wish he 
wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he's a back who has many, many more years in front  
of him. This is a very unfortunate situation. Maybe it's only 
temporary. Maybe he might reconsider and come back. Maybe they 
might trade him away. Who knows?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders leaves with 15,269 career yards, the second-most  
all-time and 1,458 shy of breaking Walter Payton's record. Smith is 
No. 5 on the overall list with 12,566 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to see him break the record,'' said Smith, who is  
only 694 yards from passing Tony Dorsett and Eric Dickerson to 
become No. 3. ``I think Barry would've been the first back to break 
the 20,000 barrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Smith is the leading favorite to top Payton. At his career  
average of 89.8 yards per game, he's about 30 games away, putting 
the target date at late in the 2000 season.

<HEADLINE> Noted Mare Fanfreluche Dies at 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Fanfreluche, the broodmare whose 1977  
theft and recovery was one of the more bizarre episodes in 
thoroughbred history, has died. She was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Stolen from a pasture at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., while she  
was in foal to Triple Crown winner Secretariat, Fanfreluche was 
found 5 1/2 months later in the southwestern Kentucky town of 
Tompkinsville. Farmer Larry McPherson had found the bedraggled mare 
walking a nearby road, taken her home, renamed her Brandy and was 
using her as a riding horse. 
</P>
<P>
	A Paducah, Ky., man, William Michael McCandless, was later  
convicted of stealing the mare, who had been valued at $500,000. 
However, those involved with the case said a motive has never been 
established. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a missing link in there: How and why did it happen to  
us?'' Claiborne manager John Sosby said Wednesday after learning 
Fanfreluche had been euthanized last week at Big Sink Farm near 
Versailles, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports listed the cause of death as the infirmities  
of old age. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before she was ``horsenapped,'' Fanfreluche was a champion  
filly in the United States and Canada, winning 11 times and 
finishing in the money in 20 of 21 starts as a 2- and 3-year-old in 
1969-70. In 1970, she was the Canadian Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	She went on to a successful broodmare career in which she bore  
20 foals, five of whom went on to be stakes winners. But it was her 
theft for which Fanfreluche was best known. 
</P>
<P>
	She was being boarded at Seth Hancock's Claiborne Farm after  
being bred to Secretariat when a thief, or thieves, cut through a 
series of fences and spirited her away from her pasture on June 24, 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI quickly involved itself in the search for the missing  
mare, which eventually extended overseas, and theories abounded as 
to a motive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believed the thieves were targeting Fanfreluche's owner,  
Canadian financier Jean-Louis Levesque. New York Times columnist 
Red Smith suggested the thieves had copied the plot of the Dick 
Francis novel ``Blood Sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was eventually traced to McPherson's farm, where she was  
being kept as a saddle horse on a lot enclosed by a single strand 
of electric fence. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry McPherson had found Fanfreluche the day after she was  
stolen, wandering on a nearby road with rope burns on her ears and 
neck and ankles. She had evidently broken loose from her captor. 
When no one turned up to claim the horse his family named Brandy, 
McPherson kept her as a saddle horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls from informants inspired by a $25,000 reward posted  
by Levesque and Hancock helped investigators track Fanfreluche to 
McPherson's farm in December. Just the week before, McPherson had 
turned down a $200 offer for the horse from a horse trader. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosby went with Hancock to get the horse.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to see her,'' he said. ``We thought we'd never see  
her again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCandless was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the theft  
in 1978 but jumped bail and wasn't recaptured until 1981. He was 
convicted in 1983, though his trial failed to shed much light on 
his motive or any accomplices he might have had in pulling off the 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanfreluche gave birth to her Secretariat foal in February 1978.  
Levesque named the colt Sain et Sauf -- French for ``safe and 
sound'' -- and he went on to win three races and $34,836. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great finish would have been if the colt had won the  
(Kentucky) Derby,'' Sosby said. ``That would have been the ending 
of a fairy-book story.''

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Mourn Slain Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRACKO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Laying flowers on the coffins as a  
NATO helicopter buzzed overhead, hundreds of villagers mourned 14 
Serb farmers today and demanded better NATO protection from ethnic 
violence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers, meanwhile, detained four men for questioning in  
the killings, the worst attack in the violence that has plagued the 
NATO-led mission trying since June to enforce peace in the Serb 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Jan Joosten of Denmark, a mission spokesman, said the four  
men, seized in dawn raids on houses in and around Gracko, the slain 
farmers' home village, had not been charged. He did not disclose 
the ethnicity of the men. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 wooden coffins, each topped with a black cross and a  
piece of cardboard with the victim's name, were laid out on an 
asphalt court in the middle of a sports field in Gracko, a village 
15 miles southwest of Pristina, the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are criminals,'' wailed one woman in the crowd of some  
350 mourners, cursing the gunmen who mowed down the 14 men with 
automatic weapons fire in a wheat field near the village. Kosovo's 
Serbs accuse ethnic Albanians in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was heavy, and British soldiers checked all cars  
entering the village. Troops and armored personnel carriers were 
stationed around the sports field, and a helicopter circled 
overhead as weeping mourners placed flowers, wreaths and prayer 
cards on the coffins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly they depart this world, but their only consolation is  
they didn't depart this world like criminals, like the ones who 
took their fields and are burning our houses,'' said Patriarch 
Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who led the service. 
</P>
<P>
	A local man, Stefan Lalic, urged fellow Serbs not to flee the  
village. ``We must stay so that our church doesn't become Muslim,'' 
he told mourners, referring to the predominant religion among 
Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a demonstration of sorrow for the dead and a protest''  
for the living, said Father Milorad of Pristina, before the 
service. Serbs, he said, ``are not satisfied with the protection 
from KFOR.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new U.N. administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner of  
France, who attended the service, insisted, ``We must find the 
truth, and justice must pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the stadium, a procession headed for the main cemetery to  
bury the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 100,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo since Yugoslav troops left  
the province and the peacekeeping force -- known by the acronym KFOR 
-- began moving in. The Serbs are fleeing attacks by ethnic 
Albanians seeking revenge for massacres and expulsions committed 
against them by Serb troops. The ethnic Albanian rebel group, the 
Kosovo Liberation Army, has denied any role in the Gracko slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence in Kosovo over the past six weeks has included almost  
200 killings, hundreds of house burnings and other unrest, mostly 
in revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians on the Serb minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb and Yugoslav forces killed an estimated 10,000 people, and  
more than 860,000 ethnic Albanians fled or were expelled from 
Kosovo before and during the 78-day NATO air campaign, which began 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	As Serbs have left Kosovo, more than 720,000 ethnic Albanian  
refugees have returned to homes they fled during the yearlong 
crackdown by Serb security forces in the province.

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Campaign Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the 2000 presidential candidates, there's  
no place like home. 
</P>
<P>
	While California and New York continue to be fund-raising  
meccas, the candidates also found open wallets in their home 
states, according to an analysis of presidential fund raising 
released Tuesday by the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonpartisan research group. 
</P>
<P>
	For example:  
</P>
<P>
	--Texas Gov. George W. Bush raised $10.6 million from Texans --  
more than twice as much as the $4 million he raised in California, 
his second-best state. Third was Florida, where his brother, Jeb 
Bush, is governor. 
</P>
<P>
	--After California and New York, both Vice President Al Gore and  
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey looked homeward. Gore's No. 
3 state was Tennessee, which he represented in the House and 
Senate, raising $1.2 million there. Bradley raised $1.4 million in 
his No. 3 state, New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen. John McCain of Arizona raised $799,570 from his home  
state, more than from New York and California combined, his next 
two best states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who cut back his  
campaign due to fund-raising problems, raised $446,350 from his 
home state, 17 times more than from his second-best state, Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined contributions to the Democratic and  
Republican presidential candidates between Jan. 1 and June 30. Bush 
set a record by raising $37 million, and had $30 million in the 
bank at midyear. Gore raised $17.5 million, plus an additional $2 
million for legal and accounting expenses, and had $9.4 million in 
the bank. Bradley reported raising $11.7 million and had a balance 
of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's did well with Hollywood, taking in $479,245 from the  
entertainment industry. Bush got the second-highest amount from the 
entertainment industry, with $357,802, and Bradley was third at 
$320,874. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush led the way in Silicon Valley, taking in $379,200 from  
computer companies. Gore was second at $178,085 and Bradley a close 
third at $166,975. Among Bush's contributors: the Technology 
Network political action committee, which spent $5,000 on a 
newspaper ad featuring high-tech executives backing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's best state was New York. A former consultant to  
financial companies, he raised $1.6 million, right behind Bush's 
$1.8 million. Bradley's top five contributors all were financial 
firms, led by employees and executives of Lehman Brothers and their 
families, who gave him $81,500. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain raised $51,663 from gambling interests, more than the  
other candidates combined. McCain backed legislation in 1995 paving 
the way for gambling cruises and strongly supports Indian casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest contributors to Bush, Gore and Bradley were lawyers.  
Bush and Gore raised $2.9 million each from members of law firms, 
while Bradley raised $1.8 million. Bush's top contributors were 
members of the law firm of Vinson &AMP; Elkins and their families, who 
gave him a total of $189,850. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore raised $435,625 from lobbyists; Bush was second at  
$345,594.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Bank Cuts Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Central Bank cut its  
benchmark interest rate from 21 to 19.5 percent late Wednesday, 
with officials citing a downward trend in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates have been gradually lowered since March as Brazil  
recovers from the financial instability which rocked it after the 
devaluation of its currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark rate was raised as high as 45 percent in early  
March, amid fears of sky-high inflation, but analysts now believe 
inflation will only be in single digits this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict that the interest rate will continue to fall in  
the second half of the year, ending 1999 at between 17 and 18.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, were surprised by the size of Wednesday's cut  
after a few election-year investor jitters this month in Argentina, 
a major trading partner for Brazil.

<HEADLINE>  19 Die Canyoning in Swiss Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Authorities were searching for  
two people still missing today after a flash flood smashed into a 
group of adventure-seeking tourists in the Swiss Alps, killing 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred Tuesday while a party of 45 tourists and  
eight guides were plunging down waterfalls and rapids on the 
Saxeten brook. A sudden storm swelled the mountain stream into a 
raging torrent, engulfing the adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors said the group had no warning as the wall of water  
came barreling down upon them, carrying uprooted trees and 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the dead, six people were injured, one critically.  
</P>
<P>
	The young victims were from Britain, South Africa, Australia,  
New Zealand and Switzerland, investigating magistrate Martin Trapp 
told reporters. The injured were from New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident near the central Alpine resort of Interlaken was  
believed the worst ever to afflict the sport known as 
``canyoning,'' in which participants slide, jump or rappel down 
waterfalls and mountain streams into gorges without rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers today found the body of a 19th victim, police said.  
More than 150 police and rescue experts were searching for two 
others missing and feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists from the United States and Canada had been in the tour  
group, but officials said none were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapp did not list any Americans among the dead, contradicting  
an earlier account by a Swiss diplomat in Australia who had said at 
least one American had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Len Brajkovich of Australia said his 21-year-old daughter Kelly  
narrowly missed being caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said the water was crystal clear one minute and just murk,  
mud and logs the next,'' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
in Perth. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went under and somebody grabbed her and she grabbed  
somebody else and they just clambered straight up the sides and 
back out of reach of the water,'' Brajkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Daniel Hall, 22, a Wellington University student, was swept  
down the river over a series of waterfalls, said his mother, Ann. 
He was hospitalized with a concussion and an injured back. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all he said a smallish wave of water came by and he  
said that was quite fun,'' Mrs. Hall British Broadcasting Corp. 
television. ``But then a massive great big wall of water came along 
and they just couldn't cope with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They just tumbled and rolled with the water down the river and  
down the canyon. He was upside down hitting his head against the 
rocks,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapp said it was impossible to tell immediately whether the  
dead -- 14 men and four women -- had drowned or had been killed by 
striking rocks and debris. The gender of the 19th victim was not 
immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Identification of the dead would likely take days because the  
adventurers stripped off all personal items before putting on life 
jackets and helmets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday afternoon, a jogger saw bodies floating into Lake  
Brienz, a lake on the outskirts of Interlaken, a picturesque 
tourist town about 40 miles southeast of the Swiss capital of Bern.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Cut Up to 8,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. plans to slash up to 8,000  
jobs, or 12 percent of its work force, as it struggles to cut costs 
amid a $184 million loss in the second quarter brought on by 
computer price wars and slowing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts unveiled Wednesday are the first major move by chief  
executive and president Michael D. Capellas, promoted to the post 
just last week to turn around the No. 1 PC maker's flagging 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The work force reduction, ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 jobs,  
comes on top of 17,000 jobs that Compaq already is axing after 
Compaq acquired Digital Equipment last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said its second-quarter loss came to 10 cents a share,  
slightly less than the 11 cents-a-share forecast by analysts polled 
by First Call. Compaq had warned last month it would lose up to 15 
cents a share, compared to initial predictions of a 20-cents 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss compared to a profit of $32 million, or 2 cents a  
share, in the April-June quarter a year ago, not counting a $3.63 
billion charge related to Compaq's acquisition of Digital Equipment 
and other one-time costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly sales rose 17 percent to $9.42 billion from $8.02  
billion of a year ago. The year-ago figure was restated as if 
Compaq had already bought Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	The company tied its loss to intense price competition with  
rival sellers of desktop computers to businesses, which eroded 
profit margins. At the same time, Compaq's operating expenses rose 
16 percent to $2.2 billion from $1.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Compaq blamed the higher spending on increased advertising, costs 
associated with its AltaVista Web site and discontinued business 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Acree, an analyst with Southwest Securities in Dallas said  
he's optimistic about Compaq's future and that Capellas seems to 
have a strong vision about modernizing the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Capellas) has got to find a way to make money,'' Acree  
said. ``But the demand is still very strong for a Compaq product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer was ousted last April  
after Compaq posted a first-quarter profit that came in at less 
than half of expectations, followed by the departure of several 
other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man interim management team led by chairman Ben Rosen  
assumed control until last week, when Compaq promoted Capellas from 
chief operating officer, a post he'd held for less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has said it will shave $2 billion in annual costs and  
reorganize its business groups to improve financial accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas said the company also intends to strengthen its direct  
sales, hoping to increase from 15 percent to 25 percent of total 
sales by the end of 1999. Dell and Gateway have captured large 
segments of the market by marketing directly to end customers, 
while Compaq traditionally has relied on resellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq expects its restructuring, including the job cuts and  
related facility closings, to cost from $700 million to $900 
million over the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an aggressive schedule for meeting our realignment  
goals and reducing our cost structure,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq released its results at the close of financial markets  
Wednesday. Compaq shares were up to $26 in after-hours trading, 
after rising 56 1/4 cents a share to $25.93 3/4 in regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  19 Die Canyoning in Swiss Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Authorities were searching for  
two people still missing today after a flash flood smashed into a 
group of adventure-seeking tourists in the Swiss Alps, killing 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred Tuesday while a party of 45 tourists and  
eight guides were plunging down waterfalls and rapids on the 
Saxeten brook. A sudden storm swelled the mountain stream into a 
raging torrent, engulfing the adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors said the group had no warning as the wall of water  
came barreling down upon them, carrying uprooted trees and 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the dead, six people were injured, one critically.  
</P>
<P>
	The young victims were from Britain, South Africa, Australia,  
New Zealand and Switzerland, investigating magistrate Martin Trapp 
told reporters. The injured were from New Zealand and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident near the central Alpine resort of Interlaken was  
believed the worst ever to afflict the sport known as 
``canyoning,'' in which participants slide, jump or rappel down 
waterfalls and mountain streams into gorges without rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers today found the body of a 19th victim, police said.  
More than 150 police and rescue experts were searching for two 
others missing and feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists from the United States and Canada had been in the tour  
group, but officials said none were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapp did not list any Americans among the dead, contradicting  
an earlier account by a Swiss diplomat in Australia who had said at 
least one American had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Len Brajkovich of Australia said his 21-year-old daughter Kelly  
narrowly missed being caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said the water was crystal clear one minute and just murk,  
mud and logs the next,'' he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
in Perth. 
</P>
<P>
	``She went under and somebody grabbed her and she grabbed  
somebody else and they just clambered straight up the sides and 
back out of reach of the water,'' Brajkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Daniel Hall, 22, a Wellington University student, was swept  
down the river over a series of waterfalls, said his mother, Ann. 
He was hospitalized with a concussion and an injured back. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all he said a smallish wave of water came by and he  
said that was quite fun,'' Mrs. Hall British Broadcasting Corp. 
television. ``But then a massive great big wall of water came along 
and they just couldn't cope with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They just tumbled and rolled with the water down the river and  
down the canyon. He was upside down hitting his head against the 
rocks,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trapp said it was impossible to tell immediately whether the  
dead -- 14 men and four women -- had drowned or had been killed by 
striking rocks and debris. The gender of the 19th victim was not 
immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Identification of the dead would likely take days because the  
adventurers stripped off all personal items before putting on life 
jackets and helmets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday afternoon, a jogger saw bodies floating into Lake  
Brienz, a lake on the outskirts of Interlaken, a picturesque 
tourist town about 40 miles southeast of the Swiss capital of Bern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw huge pieces of wood in the water,'' said Andreas  
Haesler. ``Then I saw bodies -- one on its stomach, one on its back. 
They were all wearing life jackets but it was clear they were 
dead,'' he told Swiss television.

<HEADLINE> Hunter To Retire From Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dale Hunter, a center who spent 12 of his 19  
NHL seasons with the Washington Capitals, was expected to announce 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals scheduled a news conference for Thursday involving  
Hunter, who was expected to move into the club's front office and 
work with player development. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was the Capitals' captain for several seasons and was one  
of the club's emotional leaders. Kelly Miller and Michal Pivonka 
were the only players to have had longer careers with the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington general manager George McPhee traded Hunter to the  
Colorado Avalanche late last season to give him one final chance to 
earn the Stanley Cup ring that had eluded him since entering the 
NHL in the 1980-81 season with the Quebec Nordiques. Colorado was 
eliminated from the playoffs, the 18th playoff team for which 
Hunter played that failed to win hockey's top title. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who turns 39 Saturday, finished with 323 goals and 697  
assists for 1,020 points and 3,565 penalty minutes in 1,407 games 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 181 goals and 375 assists for 556 points in 872  
Washington games, and racked up 2,003 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter came to Washington from Quebec on June 13, 1987, with  
goalie Clint Malarchuk in exchange for Gaetan Duchesne, Alan 
Haworth and the Capitals' first pick in that year's entry draft.

<HEADLINE> NATO Job a Second Chance for Ralston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after his hopes to head the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff died in the political furor over military sex 
scandals -- including his own -- Gen. Joseph Ralston is getting 
another chance at a top job. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston, an Air Force general with a reputation for low-key  
efficiency, is the Clinton administration's choice to succeed Army 
Gen. Wesley Clark as the NATO alliance's top commander next year. 
The Senate must confirm the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who know Ralston say the move is the general's reward for  
loyalty, especially to Defense Secretary William Cohen, and for 
making a graceful exit when news of an old affair threatened to 
embarrass both him and his Pentagon bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It literally is true that we've got to do something for  
Ralston,'' said Retired Army Col. Kenneth Allard, professor at 
Georgetown University's National Security Studies Program. ``Joe 
Ralston is as good as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allard also noted that the selection of an Air Force general to  
what has traditionally been an Army general's job demonstrates the 
evolution of NATO from a ground army to an air power, as recently 
demonstrated in the Kosovo war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reflects changing times. It's also a pretty strong signal  
for anyone looking: This is how the United States views its 
contribution to the alliance,'' Allard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston, a combat pilot in the Vietnam War, would be promoted  
from his No. 2 position at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Although a 
prestigious job inside military circles, Ralston's is not a marquee 
posting. 
</P>
<P>
	He performs much of the day-to-day political and diplomatic  
back-and-forth among national security agencies, and occasionally 
stands in for Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Henry Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton has dispatched Ralston to a number of hot spots,  
including India and Pakistan in January, where Ralston, Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and others tried to persuade both 
countries not to repeat nuclear tests that they had conducted the 
previous May. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen trusts Ralston, likes his no-flash, no-frills approach and  
wanted badly to keep Ralston in the military despite a planned 
retirement next year, Pentagon sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, traveling in Japan, told reporters he admires the  
diplomatic skills of both Clark and Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston declined comment when reached at the Pentagon on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in line to succeed Gen. John Shalikashvili as chairman of  
the Joint Chiefs when he admitted in June 1997 that he had had an 
affair 13 years before. 
</P>
<P>
	The admission couldn't have come at a worse time.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon was under intense scrutiny after numerous reports  
of sexual misconduct and outright abuse in the ranks: The Army was 
rocked by disclosures of drill sergeants engaging in sexual 
relationships with young trainees, the Army's top enlisted man was 
accused of a series of sex-abuse and harassment charges and a Navy 
admiral was forced to step down in a sex harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cohen stood by Ralston, critics on Capitol Hill and  
elsewhere complained of a double standard for high-ranking male 
officers. Lt. Kelly Flinn, a female Air Force bomber pilot, had 
chosen a general discharge to avoid a court-martial for adultery, 
lying and disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, both Ralston and Cohen expressed dismay that  
Ralston could be disqualified by a long-past affair that occurred 
while he was separated from the wife he later divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to say that anybody who has a single blemish in  
their private life can never be confirmed for something, can never 
be promoted?'' Cohen asked then. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington on Wednesday, White House national security  
adviser Sandy Berger called Ralston ``a particularly exceptional 
follow-on commander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston was commissioned through the Air Force Reserve Officer  
Training Corps in 1965. He flew 147 combat missions over Laos and 
North Vietnam, then rose in rank through a series of management and 
planning jobs at the Pentagon and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Option Perez to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Left-hander Carlos Perez, who has struggled  
through a horrendous season with the Los Angeles Dodgers after 
signing a $15.5 million, three-year contract last winter, was 
optioned to the minor leagues on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 28, is 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA in 17 games for the  
disappointing Dodgers, 16 of them starts. He was sent to 
Albuquerque of the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez was traded to the Dodgers by Montreal on July 31, 1998. He  
had an 11-14 record, a 3.59 ERA and seven complete games while 
pitching for the Expos and Dodgers last season. He was 4-4 with a 
3.24 ERA in 11 starts after the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also placed second baseman Eric Young on the 15-day  
disabled list due to a sprained left ankle. Young, 32, is hitting 
.263 with two homers, 27 RBIs and 34 stolen bases in 81 games this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Perez and Young on their roster, the Dodgers recalled  
right-hander Robinson Checo and left-hander Jeff Kubenka from 
Albuquerque. Checo started Wednesday night's game against 
Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE>  49 Dead From Heat in Nine Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The death toll climbed to 49 today as  
temperatures rose to above-normal temperatures again from the 
Plains to the East, and no relief was forecast at least through 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities urged people to watch out for anyone who might be  
reluctant to use air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine living for prolonged periods without air  
conditioning, but some people did without it all their lives and, 
for reasons of pride, don't want to change,'' said Dr. Phillips 
Burch, deputy St. Louis medical examiner. ``Others don't want to 
spend the money or can't afford it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least 49 heat-related deaths since July 19:  
18 in Missouri, 16 in Illinois, 10 in Ohio, two in North Carolina 
and one each in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Maryland. In addition to 
Pennsylvania's one death in this heat wave, Philadelphia had 60 
heat-related deaths earlier in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered rain helped cool some parts of the Midwest, including  
St. Louis, where Tuesday's high of 90 was 12 degrees cooler than 
the previous day. Another shower today held the city's early 
afternoon temperature to the low 80s. However, highs of 98 are 
forecast for St. Louis from today through Saturday, with a 
possibility of 97 on Sunday. Kansas City hit 98 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some potential that next week we could see  
temperatures back to near normal,'' said National Weather Service 
meteorologist Mark Britt in St. Louis. The average high for this 
time of year is about 89 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cincinnati, where 10 deaths have been attributed to the heat,  
the temperature reached 86 -- ending a streak of eight consecutive 
days of 90-plus temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little relief on the East Coast, where temperatures  
rose into the 90s again. It was 92 in New York City on Tuesday -- 
the fifth straight day over 90 -- and highs around 90 are forecast 
through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	That made Tuesday the 12th day of readings in the 90s in New  
York state this year -- that's typically the number of 90-plus 
readings for the entire summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat index, a measure of how hot the humidity and  
temperature together make it feel, was expected to be above 100 for 
many regions this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Des Moines, Iowa, workers at an air-conditioned shelter were  
keeping a close eye on the forecast to determine whether to keep 
the shelter open over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get some advice from emergency management about the  
heat index, then we'll institute the plan,'' Pat Breckenridge, a 
disease prevention specialist with the Polk County Health 
Department, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility companies braced for continued heavy demand to run air  
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, warned some  
industrial customers their power could be turned off. These 
customers receive discounted rates with the understanding that 
their service could be temporarily interrupted on days of high 
demand.

<HEADLINE> Weather Service Completes Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- For meteorologist Dennis McCarthy, the  
National Weather Service's 12-year, $4.5 billion modernization 
proved itself worth every penny on May 3, when deadly tornadoes 
swept down on Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were able to study the storms from different radar  
stations simultaneously, blend in other weather data on the same 
computer terminal, and issue warnings at least 13 minutes before 
the storms hit -- and much earlier in some cases -- saving hundreds 
of lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``With AWIPS we could divide the storms among forecasters and  
focus on multiple tornadoes,'' McCarthy said Wednesday, 
demonstrating the forecasting equipment at the National Weather 
Service office here. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, more than 150 AWIPS -- Advanced Weather Interactive  
Processing Systems -- are operating in Weather Service offices 
across the nation. It is the crown jewel in the agency's 
long-running modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Service held a demonstration of its new technology  
to celebrate the completion of the modernization project, which 
also includes 311 automatic weather observing systems, 120 new 
Doppler radars and three modern weather satellites, as well as 
retraining of the weather forecasting staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, said Weather Service director Jack Kelly, is ``to turn  
your Weather Service into America's no-surprise weather service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their success in approaching that goal was illustrated for  
McCarthy, meteorologist-in-charge of the Weather Service office in 
Norman, Okla., by a humanitarian award presented to his forecasters 
by Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. 
</P>
<P>
	While 45 people died in the storms in Oklahoma and six more in  
Kansas, researchers estimate the timely warnings saved hundreds of 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Average warning time was 18 minutes in these tornadoes, McCarthy  
said. Not so many years ago, warnings weren't issued until a 
tornado was actually seen on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the old days a lot of times we had to depend on spotters,''  
said McCarthy. ``Today our warnings are more frequently radar 
based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma effort topped the current Weather Service average  
of 11 minutes for tornado warning times, which itself is up from 
six minutes in 1993. Improvement has come as use of the new 
technology became more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	The modernization has boosted flash flood warning times from 22  
minutes in 1993 to 52 minutes today on average, said Deputy 
Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett. And warnings of severe 
thunderstorms have edged up from 16 minutes to 18 minutes, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	And overall, today's forecast of three or four days is as  
accurate as the two-day forecast was 15 years ago. It is those 
Weather Service forecasts that form the bases for predictions 
provided on television, radio and in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	AWIPS is the last part of the modernization to be completed, and  
it is the key to combining the other technologies -- but those were 
already having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, before the modern radar reached the Chantilly  
weather office, which forecasts for the Washington-Baltimore 
region, false alarms outnumbered correct warnings. That changed in 
1991, and today the warnings are correct more than 80 percent of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	While the modernization is now complete, Kelly stressed that  
improvement will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new equipment is designed to be upgraded as necessary, he  
said, and research is underway on ways to improve it. To 
illustrate, Pete Stamus of the Forecast Systems Laboratory 
demonstrated a new computer terminal that combined upper air data 
and radar readings to create a three-dimensional view of a storm 
that can be rotated and viewed from any angle.

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Linebacker Peterson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts' list of  
holdouts was cut in half when linebacker Mike Peterson agreed to a 
four-year contract, his agent said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Steve Weinberg said the deal for the second-round pick was  
completed in the afternoon and that Peterson was en route from 
Florida to join the team for its trip to Champaign, Ill., where it 
will practice and scrimmage with the St. Louis Rams this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Bill Polian was out of town and no team  
representative was available to confirm the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg said substantial progress was made Tuesday during talks  
involving himself, Polian, senior vice president Bob Terpening and 
David Canter, Peterson's co-agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically a big breakthrough. It shows what can happen  
when four guys put their heads together,'' Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, the 36th overall pick in the draft, will earn in  
excess of $3 million for the length of the contract,'' Weinberg 
said, adding that the agreement called for a signing bonus of more 
than $1 million and a reporting bonus of about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to this contract is it will allow for Mike to be paid  
incentives depending on how he plays. That's what Mike wanted. He 
wants the chance to show the Indianapolis fans what he can do and 
is ready to go to work,'' Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fair contract for both sides. It gives Mike the  
chance to prove himself. If he does produce, he'll be the highest 
paid second-rounder in this year's draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Mora didn't confirm the signing, but said Peterson  
will be behind his teammates when he joins the team for Thursday's 
two practice sessions. The 6-foot-2, 229-pound former Florida star 
missed nine practices since the team reported to training camp 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A starter in 11 games for Florida last season, Peterson had 249  
tackles in 42 games with the Gators. He is expected to challenge 
veteran Andre Royal for the starting weak-side linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was no news of progress in talks to get  
first-round draft pick Edgerrin James into camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg, James' agent, said Wednesday night he and  
Polian are talking regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our next talks are Thursday,'' Steinberg said. ``We both want  
to get it done quickly. I think we're getting closer and we want to 
get Edgerrin in camp as quickly as possible,'' he said.

<P>
	GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Dan Dutko, a major Democratic

Tuesday of head injuries suffered in a mountain biking accident 
over the weekend in Aspen. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko was in Aspen for a Democratic fund-raiser attended by  
President Clinton on Saturday. He was co-chairman of Leadership 
2000, the DNC's top finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He held many other high-level political positions including vice  
chairman of finance for Clinton-Gore in 1995; finance chairman of 
the 53rd inaugural ball and vice chairman of finance for the DNC in 
1996; and national finance chairman for Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen 
Kennedy Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko had also been chief of staff for Sen. Donald Stewart,  
D-Ala., and Rep. Bob Krueger, D-Texas.

<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Harry ``Sweets'' Edison, a jazz trumpeter  
who accompanied singers such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and 
Billie Holiday, died Tuesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison joined the Count Basie Orchestra in the mid-1930s when he  
was 18 and became a featured soloist. Basie saxophonist Lester 
Young dubbed him ``Sweets'' because of the pleasing tone of his 
horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison stayed with Basie until about 1950 before heading off to  
perform with his own quintet. He recorded his own albums -- notably 
``Sweets For The Sweet Taste Of Love'' -- accompanied Frank Sinatra 
as a studio musician and worked with Benny Carter on movie sound 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years he played with most of the famous big bands,  
including those of Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, Louis Bellson, Henry 
Mancini and Nelson Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison taught music seminars at Yale University in the Duke  
Ellington Fellowship Program and he was honored as a ``master 
musician'' with a 1991 National Endowment for the Arts Award.

	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Sandra Gould, who played nosy neighbor  
Gladys Kravitz on TV's ``Bewitched,'' died July 20 of a stroke. She 
was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Gould appeared on the ABC series from 1966 to 1972. From  
1964 to 1966, Gladys Kravitz was played by Alice Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Gould's other television credits included ``I Love Lucy,''  
``The Twilight Zone'' and ``My Three Sons'' and, most recently, 
guest appearances on ``Friends'' and ``Veronica's Closet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was also in movies including ``The Ghost and Mr. Chicken''  
and ``The Barefoot Executive.'' On radio, she was Miss Duffy on 
``Duffy's Tavern.''

                         *Kelvin Lancaster    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Kelvin Lancaster, whose writings helped reshape  
the economics profession's views of industrial structure, 
regulation and trade, died Friday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Lancaster's two powerful contributions to economic  
theory, ``The General Theory of Second Best,'' came in an article 
he wrote with R.G. Lipsey for Review of Economic Studies (1956-57). 
</P>
<P>
	Before the theory was posed, economists generally agreed that  
society's best option for consumers would be unregulated, perfect 
competitive markets, which would force prices to their lowest 
points. That's why economists used to reflexively call for the 
removal of tariffs and other barriers to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster's work showed that tariffs could be used, for example,  
to increase consumer demand for foreign cars and offset the impact 
of unions on auto industry wages and production. Lancaster's 
proposition was that economists should carefully determine what 
policies work best in a world in which some markets work well but 
others don't. 
</P>
<P>
	His second major contribution was a revision of the economic  
tool for analyzing consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists used to study demand for a whole product -- how much  
consumers were willing to pay for a car compared with a van. But 
Lancaster developed the theory for analyzing simpler preferences -- 
for something's underlying characteristics: with cars, for example, 
analyzing demand for horsepower against fuel economy and weight.

<P>
	CLAIBORNE, Md. (AP) -- Dr. Harrison Holt Richardson, a member of  
Richard Byrd's Antarctic expedition in 1939 and 1940, died July 17. 
He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson served as a dog-team driver and a meteorological  
observer. He took the first color movie films of the polar region. 
He also served as medical officer in U.S. Navy expeditions to the 
Arctic and the Antarctic.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mala Rubinstein, a beauty expert and longtime  
executive at Helena Rubinstein Inc., died Thursday. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rubinstein, a niece of company founder Helena Rubinstein,  
moved from Poland to Paris when she was 18 to learn the business. 
She worked in her aunt's company from the 1920s to the 1970s, when 
it was sold. L'Oreal now owns it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rubinstein, as vice president in charge of creative  
services, trained beauty consultants in department stores. She 
wrote several books on beauty and traveled extensively with her 
aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped Japanese women disfigured by the Hiroshima atomic  
bomb learn how to use skin care products and cosmetics. In 1959, 
she visited Russia to show women there how to apply makeup.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell Starting Over With Titans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Neil O'Donnell stepped up to the ball  
Wednesday during his first practice with the Tennessee Titans and 
slipped into some old habits. 
</P>
<P>
	He started the count with the cadence he used while with the  
Pittsburgh Steelers, the New York Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
His slips pointed out, he laughed and switched cadences. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not bad for someone who arrived Tuesday night and had  
only a couple of hours with the 4-inch thick playbook. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head's swimming a little bit, but I'm ready to go,'' said  
O'Donnell, who agreed last week to a one-year, $1.1 million 
contract to back up Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nine-year veteran knows he will need every day of  
training camp to study the Titans' offense. That is why he was on 
the field Wednesday for the first practice with rookies and 
selected veterans. The rest of the team reports Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals signed O'Donnell shortly before camp last year, and  
he learned quickly enough to start 11 games, including the season 
opener against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for 2,216 yards and 15 touchdowns with just four  
interceptions but was benched after the Bengals lost eight of their 
first 10 games, 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell became expendable in April when Cincinnati drafted  
Akili Smith. That left the man who helped the Steelers to the 1996 
Super Bowl looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to start but took the one-year stint backing up McNair  
after being lobbied by tight end Frank Wycheck and his former 
receiver Yancey Thigpen. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair and O'Donnell haven't had much time to talk about  
anything other than football. But the Titans have made it clear 
McNair is their starter and O'Donnell their insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no pressure on me, no pressure on O'Donnell,'' McNair  
said after practice. ``We're in the mode that whatever it takes to 
help this team we'll make the sacrifice to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans have four quarterbacks in camp. The odd man out may  
be Steve Matthews, who spent last season as the No. 3 quarterback 
and failed to impress during minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell needed only one practice to show offensive coordinator  
Les Steckel he is ready to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking a language that's totally unfamiliar. But the  
good news is he's a veteran and very bright. Boy, he's a very 
conscientious guy,'' Steckel said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell plans to prepare as if he is starting.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know how this crazy game is. Anything can happen,'' he  
said. ``I respect Steve and his ability. If we're winning and 
everything's going smooth, we'll be fine.''

<HEADLINE>  Bailey Pays Dividends to Pan Ams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At last, Donovan Bailey, the Pan  
American Games poster boy, was seen in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world record holder and 1996 Olympic gold medalist in  
the 100 meters, who was roundly criticized for not competing in his 
specialty, ran the opening leg on Canada's 400-meter relay team in 
Wednesday's semifinal heats, then said, ``I owe my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not feel, however, that he owed the games' organizers  
anything more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, who still is recuperating from Achilles' tendon surgery on 
his left leg last September. ``I'm not stung by the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Flynn, Bailey's financial adviser, also claimed the sprinter  
fulfilled his obligations to the Pan Am organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a misunderstanding,'' Flynn said. ``He signed an  
image contract 15 months ago to promote the games, not a 
performance-based contract. Nobody could tell he would get injured 
four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still recuperating from a serious injury. In his last  
race in Europe, he finished dead last in 10.42. He's trying to 
restore and re-establish his credibility. He wasn't ready to run 
the 100. He didn't want to embarrass himself on his own turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn also defended Bailey's absence at the opening ceremony. He  
said Bailey didn't attend the opening ceremony at both the 1995 and 
1997 World Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never asked to go the opening ceremonies,'' Flynn said.  
``It was never a snub to the games. It just means that the athlete 
is concerned with what he's trying to do and concentrate fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was shocked Canada's top rower, Marnie McBean, ripped him  
verbally. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the point when he decided that he was going to hold the  
games up for the little game he was playing with Athletics Canada, 
that's when I thought he began to disrespect the games and the 
athletes that were coming here,'' McBean was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably has earned more on interest on that $200,000  
($136,000 U.S.) than most of the athletes are going to make all 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said, ``I was upset by Marnie's comments ... because we  
are friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said McBean probably was unaware of all the circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances Wednesday were almost circus-like. Bailey was  
the center of attention, just like a ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Every move he made was closely followed by the electronic media,  
scrutinized by the print media and watched carefully by the small 
but boisterous crowd at the University of Manitoba stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	What everyone saw was not spectacular.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Cuba's Anier Garcia were about even after the first  
100 meters, then the Canadians took control when Cuba's Misael 
Ortiz dropped the handoff from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the Canadians went on to a 12-meter victory over  
Guatamela in 38.74 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Bailey felt relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``The relief is coming here and being with the fellas,'' he said  
after running the leadoff leg on a Canadian relay team for the 
first time in five years; he usually runs anchor. ``The leg feels 
fine. I've been training well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal heat, the United States team of Kaaron  
Conwright, Duane Phillips, 100-meter gold medalist Bernard Williams 
and Curtis Perry botched the first exchange and wound up finishing 
second to Brazil in 38.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The relay final is Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also finished second in their semifinal heat of  
the men's 1,600 relay, beaten by the Bahamas 3:00.73 to 3:00.83. 
Still, they advanced to Friday's final. Jamaica won the other 
semifinal in 3:00.05, the second-best time in the world for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States collected two golds, with Marla Runyan, who is  
legally blind, winning the women's 1,500 at 4:16.86, edging 
Canada's Leah Pells, who had the identical time. And 1991 men's 
discus champion Anthony Washington took his second title, at 210 
feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men's winners were Brazilians Eronilde Araujo, who  
captured his third 400-meter hurdles title at 48.23, the 
fourth-fastest time in the world this year, and Claudinei Silva in 
the 200 at 20.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining women's winners were Damai Pernia in the 400  
hurdles at 53.44, a Pan Am and Cuban record; Juana Rosario in the 
high jump at 6-4, giving the Dominican Republic its first-ever 
track and field gold at the games; and Nora Rocha of Mexico in the 
10,000 in a games record 32:56.51. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Bailey Pays Dividends to Pan Ams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- At last, Donovan Bailey, the Pan  
American Games poster boy, was seen in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world record holder and 1996 Olympic gold medalist in  
the 100 meters, who was roundly criticized for not competing in his 
specialty, ran the opening leg on Canada's 400-meter relay team in 
Wednesday's semifinal heats, then said, ``I owe my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not feel, however, that he owed the games' organizers  
anything more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a commitment to the Pan American Games people and the  
fans of Winnipeg to run the relay and that's what I did,'' said 
Bailey, who still is recuperating from Achilles' tendon surgery on 
his left leg last September. ``I'm not stung by the criticism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Flynn, Bailey's financial adviser, also claimed the sprinter  
fulfilled his obligations to the Pan Am organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a misunderstanding,'' Flynn said. ``He signed an  
image contract 15 months ago to promote the games, not a 
performance-based contract. Nobody could tell he would get injured 
four months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still recuperating from a serious injury. In his last  
race in Europe, he finished dead last in 10.42. He's trying to 
restore and re-establish his credibility. He wasn't ready to run 
the 100. He didn't want to embarrass himself on his own turf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynn also defended Bailey's absence at the opening ceremony. He  
said Bailey didn't attend the opening ceremony at both the 1995 and 
1997 World Track and Field Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never asked to go the opening ceremonies,'' Flynn said.  
``It was never a snub to the games. It just means that the athlete 
is concerned with what he's trying to do and concentrate fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was shocked Canada's top rower, Marnie McBean, ripped him  
verbally. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the point when he decided that he was going to hold the  
games up for the little game he was playing with Athletics Canada, 
that's when I thought he began to disrespect the games and the 
athletes that were coming here,'' McBean was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably has earned more on interest on that $200,000  
($136,000 U.S.) than most of the athletes are going to make all 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said, ``I was upset by Marnie's comments ... because we  
are friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said McBean probably was unaware of all the circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances Wednesday were almost circus-like. Bailey was  
the center of attention, just like a ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Every move he made was closely followed by the electronic media,  
scrutinized by the print media and watched carefully by the small 
but boisterous crowd at the University of Manitoba stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	What everyone saw was not spectacular.  
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Cuba's Anier Garcia were about even after the first  
100 meters, then the Canadians took control when Cuba's Misael 
Ortiz dropped the handoff from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the Canadians went on to a 12-meter victory over  
Guatamela in 38.74 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Bailey felt relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``The relief is coming here and being with the fellas,'' he said  
after running the leadoff leg on a Canadian relay team for the 
first time in five years; he usually runs anchor. ``The leg feels 
fine. I've been training well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal heat, the United States team of Kaaron  
Conwright, Duane Phillips, 100-meter gold medalist Bernard Williams 
and Curtis Perry botched the first exchange and wound up finishing 
second to Brazil in 38.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The relay final is Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also finished second in their semifinal heat of  
the men's 1,600 relay, beaten by the Bahamas 3:00.73 to 3:00.83. 
Still, they advanced to Friday's final. Jamaica won the other 
semifinal in 3:00.05, the second-best time in the world for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States collected two golds, with Marla Runyan, who is  
legally blind, winning the women's 1,500 at 4:16.86, edging 
Canada's Leah Pells, who had the identical time. And 1991 men's 
discus champion Anthony Washington took his second title, at 210 
feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	The other men's winners were Brazilians Eronilde Araujo, who  
captured his third 400-meter hurdles title at 48.23, the 
fourth-fastest time in the world this year, and Claudinei Silva in 
the 200 at 20.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining women's winners were Damai Pernia in the 400  
hurdles at 53.44, a Pan Am and Cuban record; Juana Rosario in the 
high jump at 6-4, giving the Dominican Republic its first-ever 
track and field gold at the games; and Nora Rocha of Mexico in the 
10,000 in a games record 32:56.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cuba's Magalys Garcia won the heptathlon with a Pan Ams  
record 6,290 points; Cuba's Yamile Aldama in the triple jump at 
48-5 1-2, another games record; and Debbie Ferguson of the Bahamas 
in the 200 at 22.83.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Gay, Lesbian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of gay and lesbian elected officials  
from the state and local level discussed education, hate crime 
prevention and job discrimination with President Clinton Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen officials met with the president at a closed  
meeting in the White House, which lasted more than an hour and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials expressed their concerns about protections for gay  
and lesbian young adults in the classroom. They also suggested the 
need for greater diversity and sensitivity training for teachers, 
officials said after the event. 
</P>
<P>
	More broadly, the leaders said they were worried about the  
epidemic of violence in schools, targeted toward those who are 
perceived in some way as different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had a chance to talk to our kids about having  
negative feelings about other people,'' said state Rep. Liz Malia, 
a Democrat from Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials also said they want to see job discrimination  
based on sexual orientation to be made illegal and crimes based on 
sexual orientation to be categorized as hate crimes. They also 
expressed hope for seeing a balance struck between protections for 
religious liberty and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders said they were pleased with the discussion, which  
focused on general policy issues as well as those affecting members 
of the gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a national  
organization dedicated to increasing the number of gay and lesbians 
in office, this is the first time a sitting president has convened 
a gathering of openly gay and lesbian elected officials.

<HEADLINE> FBI Looks Into Stayner's Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI has assembled a team of  
investigators to find out whether a hotel handyman who confessed to 
killing a Yosemite National Park naturalist and three sightseers 
can be tied to other unsolved crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 37, is charged with beheading Joie Ruth Armstrong  
on July 21 and is a suspect in the February killings of Carole 
Sund, her daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner confessed to all four slayings during interviews by the  
FBI, law enforcement sources have told the Associated Press. He 
also described the crimes in a jailhouse interview with a 
television reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to follow up on all logical investigative leads,  
which includes developing information about his history,'' FBI 
agent Nick Rossi said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unsolved crimes in the area include the beheading of a  
prostitute and the stabbing death of a woman whose body was burned 
afterward. The bodies of Carole Sund and Ms. Pelosso were also 
burned; they had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	And investigators in Merced County are re-examining the 1990  
death of Stayner's uncle Jesse, who was shot with his own shotgun 
in the farm town of Atwater. Cary Stayner was living with his uncle 
at the time. No suspect was found. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, there was no reason to suspect Cary and no  
indication he was a violent person,'' Sheriff Henry Strength said. 
``Now we're taking another look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner was being held in Sacramento pending transfer to Fresno,  
where federal prosecutors will handle the Armstrong case because 
they have jurisdiction over Yosemite. He is scheduled to be 
arraigned Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI team examining whether Stayner can be linked to other  
crimes includes local investigators and agents who have worked on 
the case since the sightseers disappeared on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton Van Zandt, a former FBI behavioralist and serial killer  
expert, said the team may have a difficult task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not normal to wake up at age 37 and decide to kill three  
women,'' Van Zandt said. ``That's relatively old for a serial 
killer. What has this guy been doing for the last 10 or 15 years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that Ms.  
Armstrong struggled doggedly with Stayner and almost got away, 
creating enough confusion to force him to hurriedly dispose of her 
body in a nearby stream and flee. 
</P>
<P>
	In his haste, he left behind footprints and the distinctive  
tracks of his sport utility vehicle, which had a different brand of 
tire on every wheel, sources told the newspaper. Those unique 
tracks led investigators to Stayner. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement issued Tuesday, Stayner's parents offered  
their ``heartfelt condolences'' to the families of the victims, 
saying they ``understand their pain.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Looks to 2000 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- For all the attention given to Gov. Jesse  
Ventura, the Reform Party appears to be a long, long way from the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third party has a star in the Minnesota governor  
and nearly $13 million in federal matching funds to hand to a 
presidential candidate next year. It has little else. 
</P>
<P>
	The party looks to the 2000 election coming off a fractious  
convention weekend where activists chose Jack Gargan of Cedar Key, 
Fla., as chairman to succeed Russ Verney, an ally of Reform Party 
founder H. Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic issues that used to focus third-party anger are  
dormant, the relationship between Ventura and Perot is chilly, and 
the party has no presidential strategy yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are they a major force in American politics? Are they offering  
answers to vexing problems that aren't arising elsewhere? No,'' 
said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the 
nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan was Ventura's pick for chairman, and a key Minnesota  
leader said Gargan's election will open the party as never before 
for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's a long way to go.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial Tuesday with a picture  
of Ventura and the words ``among the zanies'' below it. Despite the 
pro wrestler's surprising victory last year, analysts say the 
Reform Party isn't in a position to do well in elections anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party founder Dean Barkley, now director of the  
state agency in charge of long-range policy and planning, literally 
laughed off the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amused with all these pundits writing our obituary and the  
election is still a year and three months out,'' Barkley said. 
``It's the same ones who would have given us no chance that Ventura 
could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mann, however, said the party has only three things going for  
it: ballot access in 19 states, the federal matching funds and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no image for the Reform Party. There's no serious  
identification of citizens for the party. There's not much of an 
organizational base, so there's not much to it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third parties tend to struggle without economic discontent or  
ideological extremism in the major parties. The Reform Party 
originally appealed to voters on the issues of a balanced budget, 
trade protectionism and term limits, but those no longer register. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll released  
last week showed no single burning issue concerning voters. Shortly 
before Perot first ran for president in 1992, more than four out of 
10 voters surveyed named the economy as the top issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal editorial said the party runs the risk of being  
``taken over by a faction lured primarily by the $13 million in 
federal funds that Reform has coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the money, no candidate has emerged to lead the ticket  
and Ventura's status only helps the party so much. He doesn't 
credit the party for his own victory, he hasn't spoken with Perot 
in months and doesn't plan to become a party builder. Ventura has 
also ruled out a presidential bid himself.

<HEADLINE> Yosemite Probe Raising Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PORTAL, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators say they have evidence  
supporting a motel handyman's confession that he killed three 
sightseers in Yosemite National Park earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good sense of what happened,'' said Tuolumne County  
prosecutor Timothy Clancy, adding that for the first time 
investigators have specific details on how the three were marked 
for death, killed and disposed of. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are building a case to charge Cary Stayner with the  
murders of Carole Sund, daughter Juli Sund and family friend 
Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 37, already is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 6 in last  
week's decapitation of naturalist Joie Armstrong, 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who was arrested Saturday, allegedly told the FBI that  
he was responsible for all four slayings. He repeated the 
confession to a television reporter on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Stayner knows too much and there is too much  
evidence to back up his statements for him not to be a killer, the 
San Francisco Chronicle reported today, citing a source close the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	According to several newspaper reports, Stayner knew information  
about what was taken from the sightseers' motel room and the 
conditions of the bodies. Stayner also knew that knives were used 
in the killings, a detail that has not been released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, Juli, 15, and Silvina, 16, vanished on Feb. 15  
from the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, on Yosemite's western doorstep. 
Stayner had worked and lived at the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bodies were found more than a month later.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have begun looking into unsolved killings in and  
around Yosemite. Among them is the slaying of a woman whose 
headless body was found five years ago in Calaveras County. 
</P>
<P>
	Another case being investigated is the 1990 shooting death of  
Stayner's uncle at his home in Merced.

<HEADLINE> China Destroys Sect's Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Piles of tapes crunched by bulldozers. Mounds of  
books shoveled onto conveyor belts and dumped into swirling vats of 
pulp. 
</P>
<P>
	These scenes on today's evening news in China showed the  
government's determination to wipe out the words of the leader of 
Falun Gong, a popular meditation group banned last week as a threat 
to communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, the government-controlled TV news in recent  
days has expanded its evening program from 30 minutes to about 60 
and devoted nearly all of the shows to a single topic -- denouncing 
Falun Gong. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong, founded by China-born Li Hongzhi, who now lives in  
the United States, draws on martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism. The 
group says its goals are physical and mental fitness and high moral 
standards, and denies it has any religious or political role. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Communist Party, however, saw the group as a  
challenge to its monopoly on power and a threat from inside. 
Communist Party members openly participated in Falun Gong's 
meditation and exercises before the ban was ordered on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Large amounts of the group founder's materials have been  
confiscated nationwide. The state-run Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday 
gave examples: more than 73,000 books in Tianjin, a port city near 
Beijing; 130,000 books and 27,000 audio and video tapes in Wuhan, a 
major industrial city in central China; and 3,200 books and 
thousands of tapes in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang in the 
country's far west. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's TV news included footage of party members condemning the  
group. One of them, an unidentified woman, said, ``We don't believe 
in Falun Gong. Our belief is in Marxism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party's main newspaper, People's Daily, said today that Li  
preached that the Earth would explode and that he had power no 
government could match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deceived a lot of people by deifying himself with the aim  
of taking the place of the government and rule the world,'' it said 
and went on to accuse Li of having an ``evil aim of developing 
Falun Gong into a political force'' that could be used against the 
ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the ban, Falun Gong was one of many schools of qigong, a  
traditional practice that uses exercise, meditation and attempts to 
channel unseen forces to improve health. Qigong has been hugely 
popular in China for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	An official estimate said 70 million people in China practiced  
Falun Gong before the ban, but later government reports put the 
group's membership at 2 million.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Cut Up to 8,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. plans to slash up to 8,000  
jobs, or 12 percent of its work force, as it struggles to cut costs 
amid a $184 million loss in the second quarter brought on by 
computer price wars and slowing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts unveiled Wednesday are the first major move by chief  
executive and president Michael D. Capellas, promoted to the post 
just last week to turn around the No. 1 PC maker's flagging 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The workforce reduction, ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 jobs, comes  
on top of 17,000 jobs that Compaq already is axing after Compaq 
acquired Digital Equipment last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said its second-quarter loss came to 10 cents a share,  
slightly less than the 11 cents-a-share forecast by analysts polled 
by First Call. Compaq had warned last month it would lose up to 15 
cents a share, compared to initial predictions of a 20-cents 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss compared to a profit of $32 million, or 2 cents a  
share, in the April-June quarter a year ago, not counting a $3.63 
billion charge related to Compaq's acquisition of Digital Equipment 
and other one-time costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly sales rose 17 percent to $9.42 billion from $8.02  
billion of a year ago. The year-ago figure was restated as if 
Compaq had already bought Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	The company tied its loss to intense price competition with  
rival sellers of desktop computers to businesses, which eroded 
profit margins. At the same time, Compaq's operating expenses rose 
16 percent to $2.2 billion from $1.9 billion in the first quarter. 
Compaq blamed the higher spending on increased advertising, costs 
associated with its AltaVista Web site and discontinued business 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer was ousted last April  
after Compaq posted a first-quarter profit that came in at less 
than half of expectations, followed by the departure of several 
other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man interim management team led by chairman Ben Rosen  
assumed control until last week, when Compaq promoted Capellas from 
chief operating officer, a post he'd held for less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has said it will shave $2 billion in annual costs and  
reorganize its business groups to improve financial accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq expects its restructuring, including the job cuts and  
related facility closings, to cost from $700 million to $900 
million over the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an aggressive schedule for meeting our realignment  
goals and reducing our cost structure,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq released its results at the close of financial markets  
Wednesday. Compaq shares were up to $26 in after-hours trading, 
after rising 56 1/4 cents a share to $25.93 3/4 in regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Junior Seau To Play Tight End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Every so often during San Diego Chargers  
practices, Junior Seau switches sides, pulls on a white jersey and, 
presto, the All-Pro linebacker turns into a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes he makes great catches. Other times, he simply looks  
like a linebacker trying to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	What in the name of Polynesia are the Chargers doing? The team  
now has what it calls its ``coconut package'' in which Seau, from 
Samoa, and tight end Alfred Pupunu, from Tonga, would be on the 
field at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing 31 games in three seasons, the Chargers think they  
can only gain from experimenting with their best player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you if we had the No. 1 offense, this would never  
come up,'' said Seau, the Chargers' live-wire leader who's entering 
his 10th NFL season. ``The fact here is we need identity on 
offense. If I can add a spark to the offense, then let's do it. I 
have no problems about it. We're going to put the best players on 
the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers had the 24th-ranked offense and the overwhelming  
number of blunders by quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan 
repeatedly undid the work of the NFL's top-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Chargers' 5-11 debacle, Seau urged the team to sign a  
veteran quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he played some tight end during his eighth straight Pro  
Bowl appearance. He was the primary receiver on the play during 
which John Elway threw his final scoring pass, but couldn't get 
open and Elway dumped off a 3-yarder to Sam Gash. 
</P>
<P>
	Seau later spoke to new coach Mike Riley, who wants to have some  
fun while trying to win. Riley agreed to give him a look at tight 
end beginning with minicamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletically, you can do nothing but agree with him,'' said  
Riley, who made the jump from Oregon State to his first NFL job. 
``I think he'd be great. If he played that full time, he'd probably 
be Pro Bowl at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, Seau is being used as an H-back, a hybrid tight  
end/fullback who lines up in different spots and goes in motion a 
lot more. He is used as a receiver and blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	If this experiment works, Seau can expect to be in for about 10  
plays on offense during the regular season. The way he looks at it, 
an improved offense will mean the defense will be on the field for 
12-14 fewer plays this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New starting quarterback Jim Harbaugh had his doubts during  
spring workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really taking it a lot more seriously now,'' Harbaugh  
said. ``He can really make us better on offense. We've got good 
tight ends, don't get me wrong, but Junior, he just has a spark to 
him or something. He comes over there and he just makes plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're firing all our bullets, and damn the torpedoes. I kind  
of like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh then uttered these magic words: ``We've got an  
open-minded coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau knows this never would have been possible under Kevin  
Gilbride, the stubborn former head coach who was 6-16 when he was 
fired six games into last season. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only one not excited about seeing Seau at tight end is  
defensive coordinator Joe Pascale, who doesn't want the two-way 
duties interfering with his concentration and zest on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I'm the first to say that if it deteriorates what  
I've done, and the bread and butter of who I am and what I stand 
for, I'll definitely step aside,'' Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
	And what if Seau gets hurt playing offense? The coaching staff  
is all too familiar with New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn. 
He injured his knee on a kickoff return during an exhibition game 
last year and was out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	That hardly sways Seau, who has missed only three games in his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I play this game is 100 percent, full out, smash  
someone in the mouth, get up and get back in the huddle,'' he said. 
``When I have the ball in my hand it's not going to change 
anything. They're going to have to come after me rather than me 
going after them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches are chronic worriers, but this staff wants to give it a  
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves that,'' offensive coordinator Geep Chryst said.  
``If anyone has equity in this team, it's Junior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers plan to use Seau mostly inside the opponents'  
20-yard line and in other short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good to have him out there,'' tight end Freddie  
Jones said. ``He brings an energy that we need over there.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Bill Moves to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now it's the Senate's turn to deal with a  
major tax-cut bill. Senators begin debate today on a nearly $800 
billion package that would cut the lowest income tax rate and get 
rid of the so-called marriage penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are attacking the GOP tax package, insisting it would  
leave Medicare and other key programs without they money they need. 
But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott insists there will be plenty 
of cash on hand. He says Republicans worked hard to set aside $1.9 
trillion of an estimated $3 trillion surplus for Social Security 
because those funds come from payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott says American taxpayers deserve to get back 25 cents of  
every dollar they've paid in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats sparred Tuesday on the eve of Senate  
debate over tax cuts, with Vice President Al Gore accusing the GOP 
of ignoring Medicare and Majority Leader Trent Lott saying Congress 
should return budget surplus money to taxpayers to let them 
``choose how to use it best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., predicted passage of the $792 billion, 10-year  
tax cut measure before the week is out, and on that, there was 
little doubt. President Clinton has vowed a veto, though, and a 
final compromise, if there is one, is weeks or months away. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the GOP proposal would reduce the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is currently taxed at 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the measure provides relief from the so-called  
marriage penalty and contains tax breaks for education, IRAs, 
long-term care insurance, small businesses and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they would counter with a cut less than half the  
size of the GOP measure, or slightly under $300 billion over 10 
years. That and other amendments were designed to showcase their 
claim that Republicans were placing Medicare's future in peril. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said that beginning in  
2005, the GOP proposal would begin siphoning money away from Social 
Security, despite a Republican pledge to safeguard the program. 
``Even worse, Republicans don't save one dime of the surplus for 
Medicare,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton criticized Republicans at the White House, while Gore  
journeyed to the Capitol. ``The option that is being offered by the 
Republican leadership, disguised by phony bookkeeping, is to take 
virtually all of the surplus and just blow it on a risky tax scheme 
that would not save one penny for Medicare or Social Security, and 
toward what end?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's remarks drew an unusually sharp response  
from Lott. ``It is deep on demagoguery and shallow on substance,'' 
the majority leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters that Republicans had ``worked assiduously'' to  
set aside $1.9 trillion of an estimated $3 trillion surplus for 
Social Security because those funds come from payroll taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also have funds that are available for Medicare, for  
Medicare reform and for the provision of prescription drugs for 
those that really need it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we feel very strongly that of that $3 trillion, 25 cents  
on the dollar ought to go back to the people that actually paid the 
taxes -- the tax overpayment,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath the rhetoric, though, some lawmakers in both parties  
displayed concern about the tax-cutting exercise and its impact on 
the nation's economy and key programs such as Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of lawmakers of both parties was crafting a  
compromise that would cut taxes in the range of $500 billion, far 
more than Clinton has proposed, but well below what the GOP 
leadership wants. The group included Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a 
senior Republican on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, as 
well as Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who also 
sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, signaled he  
might oppose any tax cut, noting that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan was less than enthusiastic about such proposals in a 
recent appearance before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned the surplus estimates  
that underpin calls for tax cuts. They come from economists ``who 
can't remember their phone numbers or their home addresses'' yet 
are projecting huge surpluses, he said in remarks on the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Senate rules, time for debate on the tax cut bill is  
limited, and a final vote was expected Thursday night or Friday. 
Lott told reporters he hoped for compromise talks beginning this 
weekend with the House, which approved a different measure last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts to fashion a quick compromise may run into  
resistance in the House, where some Republicans favor keeping the 
issue unresolved to increase political pressure on Clinton to agree 
to a larger tax cut and to enhance GOP leverage in year-end 
negotiations on spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, while the same size as the Senate measure,  
includes an across-the-board tax cut and a reduction in capital 
gains taxes. Neither provision is in the Senate measure.

<HEADLINE> Suit Begins Against Fugitive Ex-Guru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A counterculture guru convicted of killing  
his girlfriend before he fled the country should not be allowed to 
profit from the case through book or movie deals, an attorney for 
the victim's family told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that Ira Einhorn does not in any way  
profit from this,'' said James R. Beasley, an attorney representing 
the family of Helen ``Holly'' Maddux in a wrongful death lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn, 58, wasn't in court as the civil trial began Tuesday  
and there was no one to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Maddux was bludgeoned to death in 1977, and her remains  
were found 18 months later in a closet in Einhorn's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn is free in France while he appeals a French court's  
decision that he should be extradited to the United States for a 
criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Einhorn fled the United States in 1981 shortly before he was to  
go on trial. He was convicted in absentia of murder in 1993 and 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley said Einhorn killed Miss Maddux as she was trying to  
escape an abusive relationship. Einhorn maintained that Miss Maddux 
told him she was going shopping and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley said Einhorn's refusal to answer any legal papers,  
including a request that he either admit or deny that he killed 
Miss Maddux, was equivalent to an admission of liability, which the 
court accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1997 in response to rumors that Einhorn  
was talking to publishers about a book. Beasley noted that stories 
about Einhorn already have appeared on major TV newsmagazine shows, 
and there was a television miniseries about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will consider whether to award damages.  
</P>
<P>
	A prominent antiwar activist in the 1960s who once ran for mayor  
of Philadelphia, Einhorn spent 16 years in hiding before he was 
arrested in 1997 at his home in the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	A court refused to extradite him because French law does not  
allow for trial without the defendant being present. After 
Pennsylvania passed a law promising a retrial, Einhorn was 
re-arrested in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a French court ordered him extradited provided that  
he be retried and not face the death penalty. He is appealing that 
order.

	Senate Blocks Lesser Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate rejected a  
Democratic call for scaled-down tax cuts today and pushed a larger, 
$792 billion measure toward passage despite a veto threat from the 
White House. The vote was 60-39 against a Democratic proposal for 
cuts of $290 billion over 10 years, an amount that supporters said 
would leave enough money to safeguard Social Security, Medicare and 
other domestic priorities.

came as gasoline and food stocks were dwindling seriously in many 
areas of Brazil because of thousands of truckers' vehicles blocking 
main supply routes, officials said. The strike, which union leaders 
said involved half the country's 1.5 million trucks, was called to 
protest poor roads, high tolls and the price of gas, among other 
things.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Leaves Iraq, Destroys Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A U.N. team of independent experts left  
Baghdad today, ending a controversial mission that involved the 
destruction of the deadly VX nerve agent, U.N. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the experts destroyed a small quantity of VX after  
receiving orders from the U.N. Security Council to do so, said the 
sources, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The council ordered the destruction after Iraq's allies failed  
to convince the U.N. Security Council to hold the samples for 
further analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Iraqi News Agency said today that the destruction  
of the VX was done under U.S. pressure ``to erase evidence'' that 
U.N. inspectors were ``involved in contaminating a number of 
scrapped (Iraqi) missile warheads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scrapping and neutralizing of VX gas and other toxic  
materials, which were left behind in a U.N. laboratory when weapons 
inspectors pulled out of Iraq in mid-December, were carried out 
``in a very safe manner,'' the U.N. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mandate of the four experts from the Organization for the  
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and a German biological expert ran 
into trouble the first day they arrived in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Their original mission to destroy chemical agents and mustard  
gas was first delayed over disagreements on how to enter the 
building with Iraq insisting that Russian, French and Chinese 
diplomats should oversee the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Their discovery of small quantities of VX agent in the  
laboratory a few days later led to a protracted fight at the U.N. 
Security Council with Iraq's supporters -- Russia, France and China 
-- demanding an investigation to determine whether inspectors from 
the U.N. Special Commission did not use the gas to contaminate 
Iraqi missile warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States, Britain and the majority of the 15-member  
council backed UNSCOM inspectors who said the small quantities of 
VX which could only be used to calibrate equipment, posed no 
danger, and should be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the current council president, Malaysia's U.N.  
Ambassador Hasmy Agam, ruled that there was no consensus to change 
the mandate of the team of experts in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. sources in Baghdad said the process of destroying the  
poisonous materials ``proceeded smoothly and safely'' and no 
precautionary measures were necessary to protect the nearly 150 
U.N. relief staff in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said the team left in two four-wheel vehicles early  
today heading to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Americans Stun Cubans in Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- For the first in 12 years, the U.S.  
baseball team beat the world champion Cubans, scoring five runs in 
the ninth inning Wednesday for a 10-5 victory at the Pan American 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States did it with a group of minor leaguers, few of  
whom are top major league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	One player who will get a long look from the highest level,  
though, is Marcus Jensen. His three-run homer broke a 5-5 tie and 
helped the Americans clinch a berth in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also soothed some of the pain from an opening 7-6  
loss to Canada, a game the Americans led 6-3 in the 11th inning. 
And it showed the United States has as good a shot as anyone to 
make the baseball finals here, which would secure a berth in the 
2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Cubans, who split two exhibition games with the  
Baltimore Orioles earlier this year, it was a stunning defeat. 
Their last loss to the United States was on July 4, 1996, 8-4 in 
Norfolk, Va., during a pre-Olympic tour. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last significant loss was in the 1987 Pan Ams at  
Indianapolis, a 6-4 American win in the preliminary round. Cuba 
went on to win the gold there, beating the Americans in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the U.S. team led almost all the way. When Cuba tied  
it 3-3, Craig Paquette's two-run homer in seventh gave the 
Americans another lead. But Cuba's Isacc Martinez hit a wind-aided, 
two-out two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. right fielder Peter Bergeron then made a key play when he  
threw out a potential go-ahead run at the plate after an overthrow 
down the right field line. German Mesa tried to score from first on 
the play and the throw to catcher Jensen left the game tied. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette led off the ninth with a single and Milton Bradley  
bunted. Paquette was called out at second on a throw from pitcher 
Maels Rodriguez, even though Mesa bobbled the ball. U.S. manager 
Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Zuber then walked and Jensen, who hit two home runs in a  
victory over Mexico on Tuesday, delivered his long shot to right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Run-scoring singles by Dave Roberts and Adam Kennedy made it  
10-5.

<HEADLINE> Athletes Sue Over Hidden Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Athletes at eight universities say they were  
secretly videotaped in locker rooms and the tapes were sold through 
Internet sites advertising ``hot younger dudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Goldstein, one of the attorneys representing the athletes  
in a lawsuit, said he has eight tapes and believes the practice of 
secretly taping athletes in locker rooms is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a whole industry,'' he said Tuesday. ``They send  
people all over the country to do videotaping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes, with names such as ``Straight Off the Mat'' and  
``Voyeur Time,'' came to light in April, when the Chicago Tribune 
reported that hidden-camera tapes -- including footage taken during 
a 1995 wrestling tournament at Northwestern University -- were being 
marketed online and by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidden-camera videos are also known to have been made at  
Illinois State University, Eastern Illinois University and the 
University of Pennsylvania, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, alleges  
invasion of privacy, unlawful use of the plaintiffs' images for 
monetary gain, and mail and wire fraud under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, who have been granted anonymity by the court,  
are described in the lawsuit as 28 ``John Does'' and ``unknown 
Illinois State University football players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says they are past or present athletes at  
Northwestern, Illinois, Illinois State, Eastern Illinois, Indiana, 
Penn, Iowa State and Michigan State. It names several companies, 
people and Internet service providers as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is full of sites offering secretly made videos,  
many purportedly shot in women's rest rooms or health club locker 
rooms. Others offer so-called ``upskirt'' or ``down blouse'' videos 
taken secretly in public places. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's got to realize they've allowed a Wild West to  
develop on the Internet,'' Goldstein said.

<HEADLINE> European Runner Cleared of Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- European 200 meters champion Doug  
Walker has been cleared of a drug-use charge which threatened to 
keep him out of the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	UK Athletics said today that the Scotsman's suspension has been  
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem arose when he flunked a random drug test in  
December, testing positive for the steroid Nadrolene. 
</P>
<P>
	A UK Athletics spokesman said the ruling would be clarified  
Thursday and neither Walker nor the sport's British governing body 
would comment until then. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Ken Kesey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANT HILL, Ore. (AP) -- A smile of dreamy delight plays over  
Ken Kesey's face as he clicks a computer mouse to play home movies 
of his 1964 bus trip across America, chronicled in ``The Electric 
Kool-Aid Acid Test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feeling dropped off in the dust by his publisher with no new  
best seller in sight, the author of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest'' and ``Sometimes a Great Notion'' is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hitting the road again with his band of pals, the Merry  
Pranksters, taking the latest incarnation of his magic bus on a 
``Search for Merlin'' tour of Britain to celebrate the last solar 
eclipse of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like (Jerry) Garcia said, 'The '60s ain't over 'til the  
fat lady gets high,''' the 63-year-old Kesey says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting before a pair of video monitors where he edits the film  
that's been transferred to tape from the bus trip that became an 
icon of the 1960s, Kesey still gets a kick out of watching the 
stream-of-consciousness rap-babble of ``On the Road'' wheelman Neal 
Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about Cassidy that keeps this nation moving  
and meeting itself,'' Kesey marvels as he watches the man 
immortalized in Jack Kerouac's novel of another cross-country 
ramble get up from the wheel, leaving the bus to find its own path 
through the desert for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an avatar,'' the embodiment of those bygone times, says  
Kesey. 
</P>
<P>
	For Kesey, the ``Search for Merlin'' tour continues the same  
journey, though in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, the nation was still mourning the death of President  
Kennedy. Kesey was a literary lion fresh from the blockbuster 
success of ``Cuckoo's Nest,'' and had just finished ``Sometimes a 
Great Notion.'' Filled with hope despite the demise of Camelot, 
Kesey and pals painted an old school bus with psychedelic swirls of 
color. The destination sign on the front of the bus was inscribed 
with the word ``Further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They headed east to the New York World's Fair with jugs of LSD  
punch to light the way. Using these same home movies, Tom Wolfe 
chronicled the trip in his book, ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid 
Test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kesey hasn't produced a solo novel since ``Sailor Song'' in 1992  
(he co-authored ``Last Go Round: A Dime Western'' with Ken Babbs in 
1995), and the only publisher he has ever known turned loose his 
longtime editor. Camelot died with Kennedy, and Kesey and his pals 
are looking for the lost wizard. 
</P>
<P>
	Viking Penguin still has most of Kesey's titles in print, and  
plans to bring out his jail journals from a 1965 drug bust in the 
fall of 2000, said Viking's Paul Slovak, who has taken over as 
Kesey's editor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the author feels alienated by the loss of editor David  
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting a divorce or buying a new tractor,'' says  
Kesey, taking a break from mowing hay at his farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford is still working on Kesey's manuscript for ``Seven  
Prayers by Grandma Whittier,'' a fictional encounter with his 
grandmother as she slides into Alzheimer's disease. An agent is 
shopping the manuscript around. Kesey also wants to write an 
autobiography told through the voices of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no new novel growing inside his head or his heart.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am a homeless author since they fired my editor,'' he says.  
``They continue to want me to do another `Cuckoo's Nest.' It will 
just be another `Cuckoo's Nest.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In the subversive spirit of ``Cuckoo's Nest'' hero R.P.  
McMurphy, Kesey likes the idea of publishing on the Internet, 
bypassing the publishing houses, and broadcasting smaller pieces of 
performance art on pirate radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to wash the foundation out from under L.A. and  
New York and what they say,'' he says. ``If Shakespeare were 
writing today, he wouldn't use a quill pen, he would use the best 
tool he could find. Right now, the best tool is the video camera, 
and these pirate stations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On bus trips, Kesey uses a little portable transmitter to  
broadcast songs and commentary to passing motorists, letting them 
in on the gig by flashing a sign telling them to tune to KBUZ 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be long before, from this little place, we will be  
able to broadcast pirate TV,'' he says in the cluttered former 
motel room that serves as headquarters of the ``Search for Merlin'' 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already got the big antenna out there. The stuff we need  
to do doesn't stand up under too close a scrutiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those interested in closer scrutiny, Cafe Productions  
Limited of London, which specializes in anthropological subjects, 
is wrapping together the 1964 bus trip and the 1999 ``Search for 
Merlin'' tour in a documentary for British independent television 
Channel 4. Their tentative title is ``Tripping.'' The title Kesey 
prefers, though, is ``The Pranksters Look for a Cool Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original Further lies a-mouldering in the swamp on Kesey's  
farm, replaced by a newer model that couldn't fool the Smithsonian 
Institution when Kesey tried to give it to the nation's attic. 
</P>
<P>
	When the California Highway Patrol pulled his bus over 35 years  
ago, they didn't bother to look for drugs, never suspecting the 
bunch of giggling college kids on vacation. But before shipping the 
new Further to England, Kesey hired a drug-sniffing dog to go 
through it to be sure there would be no surprises at customs. 
</P>
<P>
	The merry crew -- most of them still live near Kesey's farm -- is  
scheduled to board the bus in Brighton, England, on Aug. 6. The 
next day they visit Stonehenge and give their first performances in 
the village of Podimore. Then it's on the road for 17 more gigs 
around England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland before returning home 
Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight will be Aug. 11, when the final solar eclipse of  
the millennium occurs over Britain. Kesey and the Pranksters, 
dressed in onion sacks for chain mail, will do their ``Search for 
Merlin'' thing portraying knights of the Not-So-Round Table in the 
dramatic outdoor setting of the Minack Theater, overlooking the 
Atlantic on the rocky coast near Land's End. 
</P>
<P>
	The gig -- starting at the 11th minute of the 11th hour of the  
11th day of the 11th month -- will feature the Thunder Machine, the 
melding of an old Thunderbird fender, piano strings, smoke maker 
and remix gear that is a Prankster standby and veteran of Grateful 
Dead concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't be able to bring the bus on stage, but this we  
will,'' Kesey says, showing off a clip of a boisterous Thunder 
Machine jam session. ``Once that thing is playing, everything is up 
for grabs.''

<HEADLINE> Travel Back to `Urban Cowboy' Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Who's the father of country music? ``The  
Singing Brakeman'' Jimmie Rodgers? Bill Monroe? Hank Williams? 
</P>
<P>
	How about John Travolta?  
</P>
<P>
	Mel Tillis was joking when he cited Travolta in the introduction  
to a song on a new boxed set tracking the ``Urban Cowboy'' era of 
country music in the early 1980s. But there is a kernel of truth in 
his comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta ignited an explosion of country music's popularity with  
his 1980 film ``Urban Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the film, set largely at Gilley's country music club in  
Houston, bars all over the country transformed themselves into 
honky-tonks, complete with back-wrenching mechanical bulls. Men who 
never had been near a horse started dressing like cowboys. Sales of 
country music doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Travolta was responsible for making country come alive in  
this country,'' said Mickey Gilley, the namesake and star 
attraction at the Houston club. These days, he owns and performs at 
a Gilley's in Branson, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, Rosanne Cash's classic ``Seven Year Ache''  
was a hit; gritty singer Lacy J. Dalton sang about ``Hard Times''; 
and Razzy Bailey scored with the soul-influenced ``I Keep Coming 
Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 56 songs on four CDs, ``Live at Gilley's'' tracks the  
``Urban Cowboy'' era from its epicenter. Included are vintage 
performances by Tillis, Willie Nelson, Johnny Lee, Lacy J. Dalton, 
Ed Bruce, Loretta Lynn and Freddy Fender. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also rock 'n' rollers like Jerry Lee Lewis (Gilley's  
cousin), Carl Perkins and Fats Domino, and old heroes like Ernest 
Tubb and Faron Young in some of their last performances. 
</P>
<P>
	In its heyday, Gilley's packed in 6,000 people a night. Most of  
the top country music stars played there, and Gilley recorded the 
performances for his weekly radio show ``Live From Gilley's.'' The 
show was syndicated to 500 radio stations from 1981 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	After a dispute with his partner, Gilley removed the tapes from  
the premises, which saved them from the 1989 fire that destroyed 
Gilley's. 
</P>
<P>
	He held onto the tapes for years, unable to release the music  
because he didn't have clearances from the performers. Three years 
ago, he sold the tapes to New Jersey record producer Chuck Enslin, 
who got clearances and negotiated a deal to release the tapes with 
QVC, the cable television home shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has also culled tapes for full-length live CDs on  
Perkins, Lewis, Johnny PayCheck, the Bellamy Brothers, Fats Domino 
and Bobby Bare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearances weren't obtained for all the best Gilley's  
performances. Conway Twitty's estate, for one, refused, citing the 
late singer's penchant for control of how his music was presented. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has no financial interest, Gilley is helping promote  
the set. ``It's good for me, too, because it carries my last 
name,'' he said. ``And to salvage this music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After selling ``Live at Gilley's'' on QVC, the CD was released  
to record stores through subsidiary Q Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Live at Gilley's'' is part of a small boom of live country  
music being released. Billy Bob's Texas Club in Fort Worth, Texas, 
has a similar series of live CDs, including an album recorded this 
year by Merle Haggard. Charlie Daniels has two CDs on his Blue Hat 
Records made from performances spanning back to the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilley thinks the album provides a glimpse of a neglected era  
and gives newer country music fans a look at some of the stars of 
yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gilley's -- it's gone. But here's some of the magic.''

<HEADLINE> Residents Pack Fenway Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- More than 200 people packed a public meeting  
Wednesday night held by the Boston Red Sox, many criticizing the 
team's plan to build a new stadium across from Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has said that renovating the 87-year-old park would not  
be feasible and has instead proposed a $545 million stadium project 
just across Yawkey Way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned about residents' quality of life, the traffic,  
the trash, the garbage, the gridlock, the asthma and the asphalt,'' 
said James Morgan, of the Fenway Action Coalition, which opposes 
building a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact the park is already there ``doesn't give them the right  
to expand beyond their existing borders,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's meeting, hosted by the Red Sox and the Boston  
Redevelopment Authority, was held at the Boston Architectural 
Center, a Back Bay venue Morgan said was inappropriate since the 
new Fenway proposal will affect neighborhoods around Fenway Park. 
The Red Sox said they chose the center because it had the largest 
air-conditioned room in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 protesters, many holding signs with sayings blasting  
the team's plans, stood outside the building before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said it held the meeting to discuss a number of issues,  
including traffic, transit and parking. Similar meetings are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 40 people who stepped up to the microphones shot  
down the proposal, but some supported the team's plan, saying they 
looked forward to the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this new ballpark will not be met with anger because it  
must come to be,'' Elizabeth Dooley said. ``If you're not going to 
have it in this area, I don't know where you're going to put it. 
The tradition is to play ball in this neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox hope to break ground on the project in the fall of  
2000, with the first game possible in the 2003 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be worked out is financing. The Red Sox say they'd like  
to keep public aid to a minimum. But they may need $200 million for 
infrastructure work in addition to the $350 million they plan to 
spend on the stadium. They also must obtain land now occupied by 24 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There would be about 100 luxury boxes, and the current capacity  
of 33,871, lowest in the majors, would be boosted to about 45,000. 
That would provide money for a team that hasn't won the World 
Series since 1918.

<HEADLINE> TWA Shakes Up Its Executive Ranks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Several high-ranking officials at Trans World  
Airlines will be changing jobs in the company's first major 
personnel moves since union workers agreed to a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline announced the moves Tuesday, just days after workers  
announced they had accepted the 18-month contract agreement 
negotiated by company officials and union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA elevated two key employees to vice president and gave two  
other vice presidents new responsibilities. The airline announced 
two more top managers are leaving as part of the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``In taking this action, we are recognizing the achievement of  
some of our best performers and presenting new challenges to the 
senior managers we expect to lead TWA to a successful future,'' 
President William F. Compton said. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA is based in St. Louis and uses Lambert Field as its main  
hub. 
</P>
<P>
	The new labor contracts with the International Association of  
Machinists affect about 16,000 mechanics, baggage handlers, flight 
attendants and other workers. The airline negotiated a new contract 
with its pilots last year. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA is hoping the agreements will serve as the foundation for a  
closer, more cooperative relationship with its unionized employees, 
who are part owners of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA promoted Lisbeth Lee Beth Mack to vice president for  
in-flight services. She will oversee TWAs 3,900 flight attendants 
and supervise the planning and execution of its on-board programs. 
Mack succeeds Joyce Coleman, whose retirement takes effect Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline promoted William P. Scott Bush to vice president for  
sales. He will be responsible for all North American sales 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph R. Vilmain, who had been vice president for sales, is now  
vice president for cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Uttmark, who had headed TWAs cargo operations, has left the  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA also promoted Norma H. Kaehler to vice president for  
government affairs. She is based in Washington, D.C., and oversees 
the airline's relations with federal and state agencies.

<HEADLINE> Weather Service Completes Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) -- One computer screen divided itself into  
quarters, giving meteorologists four views of the same storm. 
Nearby, another screen showed the violent winds moving toward and 
away from the viewer -- a sure sign of a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the technology of modern weather forecasting -- a far cry  
from Benjamin Franklin's kite and the ancient rhyme ``red sky in 
morning, sailors take warning; red sky at night, sailors' 
delight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest in forecasting tools went on display Wednesday at the  
National Weather Service forecast office in celebration of the 
agency's completion of a 12-year, $4.5 billion modernization 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	For meteorologist Dennis McCarthy, that effort paid for itself  
on May 3, when deadly tornadoes swept down on Oklahoma and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were able to study the storms from different radar  
stations simultaneously, blend in other weather data on the same 
computer terminal and issue warnings at least 13 minutes before the 
storms hit -- and much earlier in some cases -- probably saving 
hundreds of lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``With AWIPS, we could divide the storms among forecasters and  
focus on multiple tornadoes,'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, more than 150 AWIPS -- Advanced Weather Interactive  
Processing Systems -- are operating in Weather Service offices 
across the nation. It is the crown jewel in the agency's 
long-running modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Service modernization also includes 311 automatic  
weather observing systems, 120 new Doppler radars and three modern 
weather satellites, as well as retraining of the weather 
forecasting staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal, said Weather Service director Jack Kelly, is ``to turn  
your Weather Service into America's no-surprise weather service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their success in approaching that goal was illustrated for  
McCarthy, meteorologist-in-charge of the Weather Service office in 
Norman, Okla., by a humanitarian award presented to his forecasters 
by Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating. 
</P>
<P>
	While 45 people died in the storms in Oklahoma and six more in  
Kansas, researchers estimate the timely warnings saved hundreds of 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Average warning time was 18 minutes in these tornadoes, McCarthy  
said. Not so many years ago, warnings weren't issued until a 
tornado was actually seen on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma effort topped the current Weather Service average  
of 11 minutes for tornado warning times, which itself is up from 
six minutes in 1993. Improvement has come as use of the new 
technology became more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	The modernization has boosted flash flood warning times from 22  
minutes in 1993 to 52 minutes today on average, said Deputy 
Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett. And warnings of severe 
thunderstorms have edged up from 16 minutes to 18 minutes, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, today's forecast of three or four days is as accurate  
as the two-day forecast was 15 years ago. Those Weather Service 
forecasts form the bases for predictions provided on television, 
radio and in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	AWIPS is the last part of the modernization to be completed, and  
it is the key to combining the other technologies -- but those were 
already having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	While the modernization is now complete, Kelly stressed that  
improvement will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new equipment is designed to be upgraded as necessary, he  
said, and research is under way on ways to improve it. To 
illustrate, Pete Stamus of the Forecast Systems Laboratory 
demonstrated a new computer terminal that combined upper air data 
and radar readings to create a three-dimensional view of a storm 
that can be rotated and viewed from any angle.

<HEADLINE> Questions Raised About Yen Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Just weeks after Japan's financial authorities drew  
criticism for intervening too much in currency markets, those same 
authorities now seem to have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	In their absence, the yen has risen against the dollar to a  
level economists say could smother Japan's fledgling economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials deny there is any change in policy. ``We are not  
seeking a rapid rise in the yen,'' Zembei Mizoguchi, the head of 
the international bureau at the Ministry of Finance, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders and analysts point out that financial officials are  
not exactly backing up their words with action. 
</P>
<P>
	After jumping into markets at any hint of a yen rise last month,  
financial authorities have mostly stood by in July as the yen 
marched ahead. The Japanese currency climbed to a five-month high 
of 115.52 yen to the dollar on Wednesday. In late New York trading, 
it had dropped slightly to 116.12. 
</P>
<P>
	Any shift may indicate that authorities are losing faith in the  
effectiveness of intervention to control currency rates, analysts 
said, though they may simply be timing their next move for maximum 
impact. It's hard to tell, given the secrecy surrounding the 
Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, their inaction has been surprising because the  
stakes are so high. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy emerged early this year from its longest postwar  
recession, shooting ahead 1.9 percent in the first three months of 
the year after a year and a half in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	That unexpected growth has been the main reason for the yen's  
rise. Such growth, generating optimism about corporate prospects, 
has brought a flood of investors' cash into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	That has economists worried. Too strong a yen ``could be a  
factor derailing the fragile recovery we have right now,'' said 
Darrell Whitten, strategist for ABN Amro Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem,'' agreed Robert Feldman, economist for  
Morgan Stanley. ``If the yen stays at its current level that would 
put some pretty significant pressure on company earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, finance officials have mostly given up on  
trying to influence the direction of the dollar, arguing that 
intervention is expensive and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus in Japan has to be on strengthening the fundamentals  
... not seeking to manipulate currencies,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When the dollar slipped below 120 yen last month, financial  
authorities moved quickly, selling some $20 billion worth of yen in 
a series of market interventions. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive selling drove down the yen's value, pushing the  
dollar up to 122.59 yen on July 5. But as optimism about Japan's 
economy has grown, so has investors' hunger for yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the currency's increasing strength in recent weeks,  
Japan has intervened just twice and spent only about $2 billion to 
drive the yen lower.

<HEADLINE> Corn-Fed Beef Label Debuts / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Some Nebraska beef producers don't mind being  
labeled one bit. In fact, they lobbied for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxed beef came off the production line at Hastings Meat Supply  
this week labeled for the first time as Nebraska Corn-Fed Beef. 
</P>
<P>
	And producers with the Nebraska Corn-Fed Beef program hope their  
label does as much for them as it did for Florida orange growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nebraska beef is known worldwide,'' said Sallie Atkins with  
the Nebraska Beef Board. ``We feel we have a great product, and 
we're confident to sell it with our name on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The corn-fed label, featuring the state emblem and a cowboy, is  
an effort by those in the beef industry to reverse downward trends 
in market share and prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The program moves live cattle pricing away from the commodity  
beef market into a consumer-driven market. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of just producing cattle for their weight, producers in  
the corn-fed labeling program will produce cattle for the quality 
of their meat. The program sets requirements on how much corn the 
animals are fed and how they are raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Each animal's progress is chartered from birth through  
slaughter, and the records are used to help producers market better 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Most American beef is sold as a commodity and shipped in lots to  
restaurants and supermarkets with no clues about its origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so with Nebraska Corn-Fed Beef.  
</P>
<P>
	``Retailers are asking for it, and the industry is responding,''  
said Ken Angermeier, director of retail marketing for the National 
Cattlemen's association in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Nebraska is synonymous with corn-fed beef, and the new  
labeling can do nothing but enhance that positive image. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Milton, the corn-fed beef program's executive director,  
said 50 feedlots ranging in size from 100 to 40,000 head are 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton said the goal has been to build the program slowly and  
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	The labeled products are now being marketed through mail-order  
operations, like Nebraska Famous Steaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Janzen of Henderson, a Corn-Fed Beef Council member, hopes  
to then get into restaurant chains first and then retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen said the product will be marketed in Nebraska, Arizona  
and New Mexico to start. Milton hopes to have labeled products in 
stores by late fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The program's labeled package was proposed by the Nebraska  
Cattlemen association three years ago. Now that the product has 
become available, those in the industry hope it does not take as 
long to become popular with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge in retail is to have consumers purposely seek out  
the branded product, and not mind paying more for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Strict standards and tracking will help ensure the safety of  
meat sold under the Nebraska label. But officials said producers 
still may have to have patience until the product catches on. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will help advertise Nebraska's beef across the  
world, said Gov. Mike Johanns. But, he added, ``I wish I could tell 
you it's going to raise cattle prices a nickel tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Sony Posts Big Loss in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sony Corp. reported Wednesday that its  
group net profit dropped 55 percent in the three months ending June 
30, with earnings hurt by a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's profits fell to 18.43 billion yen ($160 million) in the  
first quarter of the fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2000, as 
sales declined 8.4 percent to 1.482 trillion yen ($12.83 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen, which makes Japanese products more costly  
abroad, was particularly damaging to export-reliant Sony. The yen 
averaged 120 yen to the dollar during the period compared with 135 
yen to the dollar a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits fell 55 percent to 42.24 billion yen ($366  
million) and pretax profits for the group fell 54 percent to 42.82 
billion yen ($371 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Sony said that sales in its electronics division fell 8.7  
percent, while game sales declined 16 percent, music sales dropped 
2.5 percent and movie sales decreased 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic sales rose 4.1 percent to 465.65 billion yen ($4.03  
billion), but U.S. sales dropped 11 percent to 434.58 billion yen 
($3.76 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	European sales fell 13 percent to 344.35 billion yen ($2.98  
billion) and sales in other areas declined 17 percent to 237.68 
billion yen ($2.06 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Sony also said Wednesday it will make another issue of warrant  
bonds as a financial incentive for directors, corporate executive 
officers and group executive officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been issuing bonds as warrants for officials as  
an incentive since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Denounces Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to fashion a gun control compromise  
inched forward in Congress on Wednesday despite a defiant speech 
from newly independent Sen. Bob Smith urging voters to defeat 
senators who support such legislation, regardless of their party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who bolted from the Republican Party this month, likened  
the Senate's gun control supporters to agents of Fidel Castro's 
government in Cuba, whom, he said, went door to door confiscating 
guns after they gained power. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is interesting,'' Smith said. ``Tyrannical governments  
taking our guns, members of the Senate and the media taking our 
guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire senator, who is expected to run for the White  
House on a third-party ticket, twice appealed to ``my fellow 
Americans'' in his lengthy remarks, and vowed to filibuster any gun 
control compromise that returns to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of gun control legislation is unclear in the  
Republican-controlled Congress despite a surge in public support in 
the wake of last spring's shootings at Columbine High School in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a statement urging Congress to ``get  
back to work and pass a bill with strong gun provisions as our 
children go back to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Democratic women in the House were crafting a letter asking  
House Republicans to expedite efforts at a compromise. ``Action is 
long overdue,'' they wrote Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved legislation in May to crack down on juvenile  
crime, with a handful of gun control provisions attached. These 
include a requirement for instant background checks on all sales at 
gun shows, a requirement that safety devices be sold with all 
handguns and a ban on the importation of certain high-capacity 
ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure contains none of those provisions, although  
efforts at negotiating a compromise are expected. For more than a 
week, Smith had blocked the Senate from taking the routine 
parliamentary steps needed to begin those talks. Lawmakers voted 
77-22 to go ahead, though, and the New Hampshire lawmaker announced 
he would fall back and wait for compromise talks to conclude before 
taking his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, parliamentary rules required the Senate to  
delete at the last minute the provision relating to high-capacity 
ammunition clips. It is expected to be reinserted by House and 
Senate negotiators in a final compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has been treated gently by the Senate's GOP leadership  
despite his recent defection in what aides say is a calculated bid 
by Majority Leader Trent Lott and others to avoid turning him into 
a magnet for conservative voters the Republican Party needs. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on the Senate floor, Smith appealed to voters to  
begin paying close attention to what he said were attempts to 
trample on the Second Amendment's guarantee to possess arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you need to start throwing those people out of here,'' he  
said. ``That's what you need to do. I don't care what party they 
are. It's irrelevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also spoke scathingly of the news media, which he said is  
solidly aligned with the forces advocating gun control. ``It would 
be interesting to take a little poll to find out how many of these 
news media pack a little sidearm somewhere to protect themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also made a passing reference to O.J. Simpson, who was  
acquitted in 1995 on charges of murdering his wife. Simpson, he 
said, should have gone to jail.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Wants To Stay With Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen says he wants to come back for a  
second season with the Houston Rockets despite speculation since 
the end of a disappointing year last year that he is on the trading 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to it,'' he told Houston television station  
KRIV Tuesday night. ``Right here is where I feel like is going to 
be my home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until that time comes for me to make a decision to do  
something else, then I'm still a Houston Rocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have denied wanting to deal the 12-year veteran but  
the trade talk heightened last month at the time of the NBA draft 
after Pippen's former coach with Chicago, Phil Jackson, took the 
coaching job at the Los Angeles Lakers, fueling rumors the two 
would be re-united. There was talk Pippen would be dealt to the 
Lakers for Glen Rice and former Rocket Robert Horry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, that's all speculation,'' Pippen said. ``I haven't sat  
down and talked with the Rockets organization at this moment. ... 
When the time comes, we both will sit down and will be fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who will turn 34 in September, was traded from the  
Chicago Bulls at the start of last year's abbreviated season but 
averaged only 14 points in an up-and-down year as he struggled to 
fit in. The scoring output was the lowest since his second year in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ran into trouble with the law, getting arrested in April  
on a drunken driving charge. The charge eventually was dismissed 
after prosecutors determined there wasn't enough proof he was 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking forward to a better season,'' Pippen said.  
``The expectations of last year didn't quite meet the standards 
that we wanted them to. We look forward to try and do better in the 
future.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Worker Killed by Propeller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An airline general manager was killed  
Wednesday when he walked into the spinning propeller of a parked 
plane at Little Rock National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	A Continental Express Airlines turboprop had flown in from  
Houston and passengers were preparing to exit when J.R. Stults, 60, 
walked into one of the plane's two propellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible, terrible sight,'' passenger Marie Simmons  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline spokeswoman Michele King said Stults was helping with  
the unloading process. The National Transportation Safety Board was 
investigating the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Stults, of Lonoke, had worked for Continental since 1983 and  
been general manager at Little Rock since 1993, Ms. King said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Defends Accounting Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are using accounting devices  
that mask proposed spending that threatens to eat into Social 
Security surpluses, though GOP leaders say that in the end they 
won't touch that program's money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there is no way that we would ever find ourselves  
willing to go beyond'' spending the non-Social Security part of the 
surplus, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $161 billion budget surplus the Congressional Budget  
Office projects for next year, all but $14 billion is supposed to 
come from Social Security. But budgetary techniques the GOP is 
using in its initial plans seem to eat up more than $14 billion of 
the surplus already, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like if the bills go through the way they're  
currently drafted, the $14 billion has already been committed to 
these various uses,'' said Susan Tanaka, associate communications 
director for CBO, Congress' official budget scorekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
	And that excludes an emergency bill to help cash-strapped  
farmers that both parties concede will become law later this year. 
Democrats want it to cost nearly $10 billion, and Republicans are 
expected to propose at least $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also excluded are costs for whatever natural disasters may occur  
this year, such as earthquakes or hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving Social Security surpluses untouched has been a defining  
political pledge for both parties this year. GOP leaders insist 
that by the time their spending bills are finished, they will not 
use any Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my intent to keep us from doing that,'' said House  
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some moderate and conservative Republicans have  
criticized the accounting techniques used to spend the surplus 
funds. With support uncertain, some GOP leaders are trying to pare 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
	To abandon some of the budget devices and avoid spending Social  
Security money, however, Republicans might have to cut spending 
further, which they may not have the votes to do. Armey said 
Republicans would not shrink their tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone expects that at year's end, Congress and  
President Clinton will negotiate spending bills that are more 
expensive than the ones Republicans are now writing. And the 
bargainers may figure out a way to avoid spending Social Security 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they do, the budget devices Republicans are using let  
them claim right now that they are living within spending limits 
set two years ago, while they are actually exceeding them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did the same thing in his budget earlier this year. He  
proposed spending $30 billion above the spending limits, but 
claimed to honor them by proposing to pay for the extra spending 
with cigarette tax increases and other proposals Congress 
steadfastly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Republicans' use of next year's surplus includes:  
</P>
<P>
	--$4.5 billion for next year's piece of their $792 billion,  
10-year tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	--$10 billion for budget ``emergencies,'' meaning spending limits  
can be ignored and the surplus spent, that they would declare for 
the 2000 Census, veterans' health care and disaster relief. Of the 
$10 billion, several billion may end up not being spent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	--$15 billion so far by ordering the Congressional Budget Office  
to use the White House Office of Management and Budget's lower 
spending estimates for several programs. That in effect lets them 
squeeze $15 billion more into several bills, mostly for the Defense 
Department.

<HEADLINE> Packers, Freeman Continue Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- By NFL standards, the Green Bay Packers'  
high-stakes contract negotiations with All-Pro wide receiver 
Antonio Freeman have been downright congenial. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Freeman and the Packers are hoping to keep things that way  
now that Thursday's reporting date for Green Bay veterans is upon 
them and Freeman, the team's designated franchise player, is 
officially a holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it's all over, both sides expect Freeman to become the  
league's highest-paid receiver. The only question is how long the 
negotiations will take. 
</P>
<P>
	But the length of Freeman's holdout could be considerably  
shortened if the two sides are able to continue the progress they 
say has been made in the last few weeks. The Packers and Freeman's 
agent, Joel Segal, have been in daily phone contact which Segal 
said has been amicable and constructive -- ``so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segal finished fine-tuning Dolphins wide receiver O.J.  
McDuffie's contract on Wednesday in Miami. He said he is ready to 
travel to Green Bay to complete a deal for Freeman ``if it gets 
real close,'' though he didn't speculate on when that might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Segal also met with Freeman in Miami, where the wide receiver  
was taking care of some personal business. Freeman said earlier in 
the year he hoped to be in Green Bay for the start of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations have had a civilized tone, with none of the  
threats, name-calling and media grandstanding that often result 
when players seek dramatic increases in pay. Freeman made $1.153 
million last season on a one-year tender offer and is believed to 
be seeking a deal worth more than $6 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who set career-highs with 84 catches for 14 touchdowns  
and a league-best 1,424 yards last season, wants to play only in 
Green Bay and has said he realizes the limitations of playing for a 
small-market club. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, even the Packers seem to think Freeman, an  
unrestricted free agent before being slapped with the franchise 
tag, has every right to get the best deal, even if it means holding 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, you're going to work that situation as hard as  
possible,'' coach Ray Rhodes said last week. ``You've got to look 
out for yourself ... and that's all Antonio is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Segal and Lance Lopes, the Packers' general counsel and chief  
negotiator on contracts, have reported progress on major issues in 
the contract, but the sides are still apart on a few key issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations have not been contentious, but we've got  
quite a bit of work to do,'' Lopes said. ``We're not close (to a 
deal), I guess would be the best way to put it.''

<HEADLINE> HP Christens High-Tech Spin-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. unveiled a name for  
its new technology spin-off on Wednesday that reflects the parent 
company's goal to create a more agile competitor: Agilent 
Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard plans to split off its high-tech measurement  
business into a separate entity, with its own publicly traded 
stock, from its core computer and imaging operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will create a computer and imaging company with roughly  
$40 billion in annual revenue, and a smaller Agilent that includes 
testing and measuring, components, chemical analysis and medical 
components, with about $7 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer and imaging businesses will retain the  
Hewlett-Packard Co. name. The split gives investors a clearer 
choice when deciding which stock to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agilent symbol -- a series of circles that form an  
eight-point starburst -- represents a ``spark of insight.'' The 
company color is the blue HP used before it entered the computer 
and printing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	HP was founded 60 years ago in a Palo Alto garage by Stanford  
University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, first gaining 
notoriety as a maker of electronic testing gear. It is now the 22nd 
largest company in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Call Network Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Felix Sanchez says that a hurtful message is  
delivered when network television viewers don't see Latinos in 
prominent roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tells Hispanics you don't belong,'' said Sanchez, president  
of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts. ``It says Latinos 
are outside the mainstream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To combat that message, a coalition of national Hispanic  
organizations has called for a weeklong Hispanic boycott of the 
four major TV networks starting Sept. 12 to protest the 
``brownout'' of Hispanics in television. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Nogales, spokesman for the National Hispanic Media  
Coalition, said the boycott will be the opening salvo in the fight 
for greater diversity on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition said Latino leaders will meet in Washington, D.C.,  
on Sept. 12, National Hispanic Heritage Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There the group will launch the brownout,'' asking Hispanics  
to turn off their televisions to protest the ``virtual absence of 
Latino images on television,'' a coalition statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they plan no action against sponsors, only  
against the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez's organization and nine other Latino groups announced  
the move at the annual convention of the National Council of La 
Raza, a coordinating organization whose 240 affiliate groups claim 
a membership of 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the NAACP at its national conference said it was  
going to monitor how network shows incorporate minority roles in 
their programs. That organization, the nation's oldest and largest 
civil rights group, threatened boycotts and legal action to make 
its point for greater diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hispanic coalition plans to meet advertisers, look for legal  
and regulatory remedies and start buying stock in publicly owned 
media companies to influence stockholder meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting with small incremental steps,'' Nogales said.  
``But if these networks don't want to hire us, we don't have to 
watch their product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nogales suggested that the nation's 31 million Hispanics rent  
Latino-themed films or read Latino literature during the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hispanics constitute 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
they make up less than 2 percent of the characters on prime-time 
television shows, said Lisa Navarrete, a spokeswoman for La Raza. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarrete said that only one Latino actor, Martin Sheen on NBC's  
West Wing, has been cast on a new network show set to premiere in 
the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, ABC said it began efforts in May to make its  
programs more inclusive and on Tuesday said it was adding minority 
characters to at least five of its shows. Sanchez said he was happy 
about the move, but it falls short of what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are glad they are looking at these issues, but we are still  
going to be underrepresented,'' Sanchez said. ``It isn't even a 
first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said in a statement that minority representation ``continues  
to remain a top priority'' and expressed pride in minority actors 
on shows including ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' The statement added: 
``We realize there is still work to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Television Network's president, Patricia Fili-Krushel, said  
she wanted to ``reaffirm ABC Network's commitment to finding 
lasting solutions to make our network more diverse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said progress was made during the five years she was  
president of ABC Daytime in adding minority characters to programs, 
as well as hiring minorities for jobs behind the camera, including 
writers, technicians and stagehands. She said the problem existed 
in ``different parts'' of the network and was a ``personal 
commitment'' for her. ``I think you will see change,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also noted that it had sponsored an entertainment special in  
June, ``The 1999 ALMA Awards,'' honoring the achievements of Latino 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez said including more minorities in shows like  
``Friends,'' which features an all-white cast living in New York 
City, would better reflect the nation's cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are there no amigos in New York?'' Sanchez joked.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Boosts U.S. Postal Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the U.S. Postal Service loaned its emblem  
to the nation's cycling team, it never foresaw how its red, white 
and blue insignia would be etched into the minds of millions of 
sports fans just as deeply as the race-leader's yellow jersey worn 
by the Tour de France winner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the high profile victory of 27-year old Lance Armstrong did  
just that, bringing the agency an unexpected publicity boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's comeback from testicular cancer that had spread to  
his lungs and brain three years ago made his victory in the 
2,286-mile, three-week race a human interest story the American 
media trumpeted for days. Armstrong is only the second American to 
win the world's highest profile cycling event. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your logo and your brand is associated with a champion of  
this caliber, and you hear about his heroic comeback from cancer -- 
I can't say that in our wildest imagination we ever felt that 
promotion would be that successful or give so many rich rewards,'' 
USPS spokesman Norm Scherstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service decided to sponsor a cycling team because it  
saw a unique advertising opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would portray the brand over a long period of time in a  
very positive light and connect it with a type of operation that is 
postal in nature -- the teamwork, and the commitment of meeting a 
deadline and getting a job done well,'' Scherstrom said. ``We liked 
that association.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service specifically picked a team training for the  
Tour de France because the race draws a large international crowd, 
particularly in Europe, where competitive biking is popular and the 
race is an international event watched by millions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the idea of a government agency sponsoring a sports team  
seems strange, Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House 
Government Reform postal subcommittee, points out that the Postal 
Service pays for its own operations -- including its promotion -- and 
is not subsidized with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
	``All postal products do benefit by seeing the USPS logo on Mr.  
Armstrong's jersey, and there's no question the average mailer 
could benefit by increased volume generate by this advertising 
campaign,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Postal Service won't reveal how much it spends  
sponsoring the cycling team because of ``proprietary reasons,'' the 
agency insists the expenditure is a fraction of its $254 million 
advertising budget. Most of its advertising money goes toward 
promoting its Priority Mail service, Scherstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service works with an overall budget of $60 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Scherstrom said he doesn't know what the marketing department  
will do next. He noted that the Postal Service was a sponsor of the 
1992 Olympics but said, ``This is a unique thing for us and I 
really don't know where it might go from here.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged for Smuggling Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A former immigration inspector has pleaded  
innocent to charges he smuggled three illegal immigrants through a 
border checkpoint while he worked at the San Ysidro port of entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Johnson, 38, was arrested Wednesday by federal agents at  
the San Diego home of his girlfriend, an illegal immigrant from 
Mexico, said Joseph Artes, special agent in charge of the Office of 
the Inspector General for the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other illegal immigrants were also found living at the  
home. The immigrants and the girlfriend were taken into custody by 
immigration authorities for eventual deportation, Artes said. They 
are not suspects in the smuggling case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson pleaded innocent at his arraignment Wednesday and  
remained jailed without bond, assistant U.S. Attorney Paul C. 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the first one we've had like this, but, thankfully,  
these types of cases are rare,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Ysidro port of entry at Tijuana, Mexico, 15 miles south  
of San Diego, is the busiest land border port in the world, 
according to the U.S. Customs Department. Last year, 7.2 million 
people crossed at San Ysidro on foot, and another 34 million 
crossed in cars and buses. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 28, 1998, Johnson had Mexican smugglers bring three  
migrants to the pedestrian crossing section of San Ysidro, 
authorities said. They said they observed him meeting the group and 
leading them past inspection points to the U.S. side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Once across the border, Johnson gave the three women bogus  
immigration documents, authorities said. The women each paid the 
smuggler between $1,600 and $2,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all charges, Johnson faces a maximum of 35 years  
in prison.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Get Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine of 14 UCLA football players accused of  
illegally possessing handicapped parking permits pleaded no contest 
today and were sentenced to 200 hours of community service, fines 
and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Arraignment of the other five players was delayed to Aug. 25.  
Two of those players were away at the Washington Redskins and San 
Francisco 49ers training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	A Municipal Court judge ordered that half the community service  
be done with the Special Olympics. The other 100 hours were 
assigned to various charities, groups dealing with cerebral palsy, 
multiple sclerosis, and the parks and recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
	The court dismissed one of the two counts that had been filed  
against each. 
</P>
<P>
	All were fined $500 apiece and also ordered to pay $100 in  
restitution as well as other penalties and assessments. All were 
given 24 months probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion who now is a  
Special Olympics board member, was present at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``These athletes made a mistake, and every one of them have told  
me that and have said that to everyone within hearing distance of 
them,'' Johnson said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were said to have used the placards to avoid paying  
for parking on campus or in the area around the UCLA campus, where 
parking problems are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of 6 months in  
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The case sparked outrage among advocacy groups for the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began Jan. 16 when a UCLA police officer  
spotted a car with an improperly placed handicapped placard. The 
driver told the officer he had borrowed the placard from a football 
player, and an investigation was launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen defendants were each charged with a count of illegally  
possessing a handicapped placard and a count of giving false 
information to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. One 
person allegedly obtained two placards so he was charged with four 
misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than an embarrassment to UCLA, which starts its  
football season on Sept. 4, because several of the defendants are 
starters or key reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Toledo had said the players also would be disciplined  
by him, but he was on vacation and unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The players allegedly submitted applications to the DMV with the  
signatures, addresses and medical license numbers of nonexistent 
physicians. They listed a litany of complaints: knee injuries, back 
injuries, back surgery, a torn ligament, Bell's Palsy, asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	All the claims were bogus, said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the  
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuse of the handicapped parking law is not uncommon, officials  
said, although usually it involves simply taking the parking space 
or using the permit of a friend or relative.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics Boosting Ga. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- For centuries, Georgia has been split along  
one racial line, between blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands of Hispanic immigrants -- legal and illegal -- have  
flooded into the heart of the New South recently, providing 
powerful muscle to the state's humming economic engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Migration from Mexico and Central America, once concentrated  
from Texas to the West Coast, started turning toward the Southeast 
in the past decade. The job market around Atlanta, one of the 
fastest-growing U.S. cities for much of the past 20 years, has 
drawn Hispanics like a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started in Houston, but some of the jobs, you don't make  
much money,'' said Ernesto Alvarez, assistant manager at a 
McDonald's in this Atlanta suburb. ``Some friends tell me about 
Atlanta, and how good it was here, so I came four years ago and I 
like it a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after slavery, blacks in Georgia were stuck in  
backbreaking, low-paying jobs. Since the 1960s, a thriving black 
middle class has emerged -- especially in Atlanta -- and it became 
more difficult for employers to find cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics have helped filled that void by taking jobs hanging  
drywall, planting shrubs, flipping burgers or plucking chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group is essentially taking the jobs that Georgians don't  
want to do but need to have done,'' said University of Georgia 
sociologist Doug Bachtel. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that is why hardly anyone has complained about the  
influx of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, the state's Hispanic population has at least  
doubled, hitting 207,000 in 1997, according to the Census Bureau. 
Researchers and immigration officials say the real number is 
probably closer to 750,000 with illegal immigrants thrown in. 
Estimates call for the numbers to exceed 1.5 million by 2005, or 
about 12 percent of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
	State unemployment levels have steadily dropped as the  
population has grown, reaching 3.5 percent in May, a 28-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	``The additional labor supply is one of the main things that is  
helping Georgia sustain its tremendous economic growth,'' 
University of Georgia economic forecaster Jeffrey Humphreys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers say they wouldn't be able to stay afloat without the  
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Immigration and Naturalization Service began deporting  
illegal immigrants last year during the Vidalia onion harvest, Sen. 
Paul Coverdell intervened. Farmers said the onions would rot in the 
field if Mexican laborers were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, most Hispanic immigrants took jobs in  
agriculture. But Hispanics have been taking more visible jobs in 
the construction and service industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Dobbs, director of operations for Alvarez's restaurant and  
eight others in northeast Georgia, said about half of her work 
force is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome all applicants, but these people really want to  
work,'' said Ms. Dobbs, who said the average wage at Alvarez's 
store is $8.16 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction companies pay as high as $15-$20 an hour, but it's  
backbreaking work in sometimes brutal heat. Without Hispanics, 
builders could not meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say unequivocally that the Hispanic labor market has  
saved the building industry in metro Atlanta,'' said Rick Porter, 
owner of Richport Properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the immigrants are young men, who send much of their pay  
home to wives or parents. Few have cars and most share small 
apartments with eight or nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their quality of life is that they are working,'' said Mexican  
Consul General Teodoro Maus. ``They go job to job, and sleep a 
little while and go work again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez said that when he first got to Atlanta, it was the same  
for him, though he works exclusively for McDonald's now that he has 
learned English and earned a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would work here then work across the street,'' said Alvarez,  
nodding his head to a nearby Wendy's. ``I didn't really have the 
time to go out and do much -- always working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the more established immigrants are able to have their  
wives and children to join them. In some schools, Hispanics have 
become a significant portion of student bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Hispanic leaders began complaining about some racist  
attitudes in suburban Gwinnett County, where a large number of 
immigrants have moved. 
</P>
<P>
	At North Gwinnett High School, the principal recalled yearbooks  
after 15-year-old Mike Castro was identified as ``Spic Rodriguez'' 
in the junior varsity football team photo. In Norcross, a Hispanic 
specialty food store was fined for violating a law requiring 
business signs to be at least 75 percent English. The law was later 
repealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an element of culture shock,'' Maus said. ``Here are  
these people of a different color with a different language coming 
into their communities, and it sends shock waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The image of the Mexican or Latino worker is changing, but  
some cities and communities have clearly said `We don't want them 
here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez says he's grateful to the area for providing him an  
opportunity, which he now shares with his four older brothers. He 
lives with them in a two-bedroom apartment, while serving as 
supervisor and translator for them at the same McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to bring my mom and dad up next,'' Alvarez said.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Cubans Seek Asylum in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Two more Cubans -- a shooter and a  
softball coach -- have sought asylum in Canada, sources close to the 
Cuban team told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two members of the Cuban delegation to the Pan American  
Games left the team earlier this week, according to the sources, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources would not provide the names of the Cubans, who would  
be the third and fourth members of the delegation to seek asylum at 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The two went to the Royal Canadian Mountain Police seeking to  
defect and were turned over to Canadian immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban sports federation officials repeatedly have denied anyone  
has defected. However, Canadian immigration authorities have said 
three people have, indeed, sought asylum since July 20, although by 
law, they can't release any details. There was no immediate word 
from immigration about the fourth asylum-seeker. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the games began, pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked  
for asylum. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has 
sought to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Cuban delegation deny that a second shooter  
defected, claiming he didn't come to Canada with the team. But the 
sources said the shooter did, indeed, accompany the Cubans to 
Canada, then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans have been livid about what they perceive as media  
attempts to ``incite desertion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba President Fidel Castro said in a speech Monday: ``We have  
never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan American Games. 
We are competing in enemy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cuban officials complained about stories in the  
Winnipeg Sun, contending the newspaper was encouraging Cubans to 
defect. On Wednesday, the Sun, saying it bore no hard feelings, 
started a ``count the defectors contest.'' The tabloid printed an 
entry form for readers to guess the number of defectors during the 
Pan American Games, with the winner to receive a one-week trip for 
two -- to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion ran on Page 3, right below an article recounting  
criticism by Castro and other Cubans of media coverage of 
defections. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cuban spokesman would not comment on the Sun's contest.

<HEADLINE> Germany 2, New Zealand 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Michael Preetz and Lothar Matthaeus  
scored goals as Germany beat New Zealand 2-0 on Wednesday and kept 
alive its hope of advancing to the Confederations Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany played slowly and methodically, marking the New  
Zealanders closely across the field. When a New Zealand player got 
the ball, he often found two or three defenders guarding him -- and 
still had trouble finding an open man. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's few bursts of offense were effective. Five minutes  
into the game, Mehmet Scholl punched a free kick off the right 
post, and Preetz knocked in the rebound. In the 32nd minute, 
Matthaeus easily dribbled around the goalkeeper and tapped in the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss virtually eliminated New Zealand from semifinal  
contention, while it gave hope to Germany, which lost 4-0 to Brazil 
on Saturday. Brazil and the United States, which beat New Zealand 
2-1 on Saturday, played in the second game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four teams based in Guadalajara will advance, along  
with the top two of the Mexico City group -- Mexico, Egypt, Bolivia 
and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Legally Blind Runner Wins 1,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Being legally blind hasn't stopped  
Marla Runyan from some noteworthy achievements, the most impressive 
of which might have been Wednesday night's victory in the women's 
1,500 at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan barely won a photo finish with Canada's Leah Pells. When  
the judges went to determine the winner, they found that Runyan's 
torso crossed the finish line just ahead of Pells, even though both 
had identical times of 4 minutes, 16.86 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun,'' the 30-year-old Runyan said, after the biggest  
victory of her career, which has been hampered by visual 
impairment. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan has had a juvenile form of macular degeneration since she  
was 9. The retina has degenerated to the point where her best 
correctable vision now is 20/300. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sight should be the same for the rest of my life now,''  
she said. ``I don't think about it anymore. I've learned to 
adapt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan's vision is so poor she has difficulty seeing things  
straight in front of her. Her peripheral vision is only somewhat 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	When she had to sign the document for doping control after her  
race, she almost put her nose onto the paper. When someone walked 
in front of her, she couldn't distinguish whether it was a man or a 
woman. She has a problem seeing faces. 
</P>
<P>
	She competed in the 1992 Paralympics, winning the 100, 200 and  
400 meters and the long jump -- ``the only events available for the 
legally blind during the games,'' she said. She also won the 
pentathlon during the 1996 Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She was not satisfied. She wanted to be among the world's elite  
runners, and she knew she couldn't do it by competing in the 
Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night's race was only her fifth at 1,500 meters. Her  
sixth will be at next month's World Track and Field Championships 
in Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan was a soccer player and a gymnast as a youngster, when  
she had better vision. She began running track as a freshman at 
Adolfo High School in Camarillo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	She doesn't have a problem during races unless the pace is  
exceptionally fast, like in the USA Championships last month, when 
Regina Jacobs ran the first quarter-mile in 60 seconds and Runyan 
went out in 64. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 15 runners between us,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Runyan rallied to finish fourth. She presently has the  
berth on the world championship team because she met the qualifying 
standard at a recent race in Maine, while the second- and 
third-place finishers have failed to qualify. If the other two 
don't run 4:06 or better by Aug. 10, Runyan will go. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, she probably will travel with the rest of the team,  
avoiding one of her scariest situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst feeling in life in general is being lost,'' she  
said. ``When I'm in an airport situation by myself and I turn 
around and can't see where to go ... I can't read signs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan's attitude has improved dramatically since she was a  
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in total denial when I was 14,'' said Runyan, who was  
born in Santa Maria, Calif., and now lives in Eugene, Ore., where 
she is coached by 1972 Olympic steeplechaser Mike Manley. ``I 
didn't think I could do anything. But I was fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was fast enough down the stretch to beat Pells in the most  
dramatic women's race of the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew after the first lap, it would come down to me and Leah,  
and who had the best kick,'' Runyan said. ``I could feel it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can feel people's movements. I can feel their fatigue or  
lack of fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pells, who led into the stretch, was fatigued just enough so  
that Runyan could catch her at the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Runyan couldn't tell for sure. Neither could hardly anyone esle.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Cautions Against Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged  
Congress on Wednesday to delay any big tax cuts until budget 
surpluses materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan also  
renewed a warning issued to House lawmakers last week that the Fed 
was prepared to raise interest rates again if necessary to hold 
inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	On tax cuts, Greenspan said Congress should proceed slowly and  
cautiously. ``We probably would be better off holding off on a tax 
cut immediately, largely because of the fact that it is apparent 
that the surpluses are doing a great deal of positive good to the 
economy,'' Greenspan told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony came as the Senate began debating the  
Republicans' proposed 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank chairman has said repeatedly that he's not  
against tax cuts. Indeed, he has long opposed capital gains taxes. 
But he expressed concern that given the uncertainty of projecting 
future government surpluses, all the money needed to finance such a 
cut may not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be cautious in the beginning,'' he said, adding that  
there's ``no problem in delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Projecting budget surpluses over a long period is dubious  
because the country's economic boom cannot be entirely explained, 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are happening which we call technical factors, which is  
another way of saying we don't have a clue, and they could just as 
readily go in the other direction,'' he said. ``And, if you start 
to simulate a number of these things that could go wrong, those 
surpluses evaporate fairly rapidly -- at least the size of them 
shrinks dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said, however, he would prefer a tax cut over using  
the expected surpluses to pay for new government programs, such as 
the expansion of Medicare benefits President Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said his ``first preference'' was to use any surpluses  
to pay down the national debt. That would help pull down interest 
rates and better prepare the nation for the looming baby boom 
retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	And a tax cut always could come in handy as an economic stimulus  
if the now-robust economy should weaken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan made his remarks after giving the committee his  
midterm report on the economy, the same report he gave last week to 
the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He renewed last week's warning that the Fed will move ``promptly  
and forcefully'' to raise interest rates again to counter inflation 
if the economy shows signs of overheating. The Fed raised rates 
June 30 as a pre-emptive strike against possible inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday that  
orders for big-ticket manufactured goods expected to last at least 
three years rose just 0.3 percent in June, less than many analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said June's report shows that the nation's battered  
manufacturing sector is still feeling the lingering effects of a 
global financial crisis. ``The industrial sector is still 
struggling,'' said Merrill Lynch economist Stan Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase reflected gains in orders for cars and auto parts,  
and electronic and electrical equipment, and came despite a decline 
in orders for aircraft and airplane parts.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Victorious on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a battle pitting environmentalists against  
Western industry, Republicans say they will try reviving at least 
some of the four provisions that Democrats have knocked out of a 
Senate spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats forced removal of the items Tuesday, using a Senate  
rule that Republicans only Monday succeeded in reinstituting after 
a four-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	All four provisions were sponsored by Republicans. The rule  
makes it harder to include language changing the law in spending 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the deleted provisions was one sponsored by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that for the fourth time would delay the 
Interior Department from forcing oil companies to pay higher 
royalties to the government for drilling on federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll come back with language written so it will fit,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for the mining industry, Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,  
and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, killed an effort by Sen. Patty Murray, 
D-Wash., and others to leave intact an Interior Department ruling 
that limits the size of the waste sites that hard-rock mining 
companies can establish on federal lands they use. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against Murray's proposal was 55-41. That left alive  
language by Craig that would block the Interior Department ruling, 
a victory for hundreds of gold and other hard-rock mines in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed version of the bill would require adherence to  
the 1997 Interior Department ruling, which limits the size of the 
waste dumps to five acres per 20-acre claim. That leaves the final 
status of the ruling uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The action came on a $14.1 billion measure financing the  
Interior Department and several smaller agencies for the coming 
fiscal year. The Senate seemed unlikely to complete the measure 
until at least next week, because senators are expected to use the 
rest of this week debating a proposed Republican tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides have threatened a veto of the overall bill  
because it would cut spending for park land purchases, cultural 
programs and other programs below the levels President Clinton 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they object to eight other provisions they consider  
anti-environmental -- including the mining language -- remaining in 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Removed from the bill were provisions prohibiting the  
reintroduction of grizzly bears to federal lands in Idaho and 
Montana; blocking new energy efficiency rules for federal agencies; 
allowing lead mining to continue in the Mark Twain National Forest 
in Missouri; and the oil royalty language. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department proposal would base the royalties on the  
oil's market value, instead of today's system that uses a lesser 
value. Blocking the change would save oil companies $68 million in 
taxes next year, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, House-Senate negotiators agreed on an $8.4 billion  
measure for next year's military construction projects. The mostly 
uncontroversial bill would be the first of the 13 annual spending 
bills ready for final House and Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	And the House approved, 420-8, a $20.2 billion measure financing  
energy and water projects. The administration has threatened to 
veto it because it contains language they say would threaten 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also withhold $1 billion from the Energy  
Department until Congress restructures the department's nuclear 
weapons program. The proposal is in response to recent revelations 
of Chinese spying at U.S. nuclear weapons labs.

<HEADLINE> El Presidente Still in Uniform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Dennis Martinez greets the opposing  
players from Panama with a warm handshake, slings his bag over his 
shoulder and heads out to a city sidewalk for a short jaunt to his 
downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	He crosses the street and breezes past onlookers in his full  
baseball attire. The uniform, his choice of dress for most of his 
life, now has nothing but a small ``N'' on the front for his 
beloved homeland of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	El Presidente, the winningest Latin pitcher in major league  
history, is still in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 45, he's in the third base coaching box instead of on the  
mound; he's managing in the Pan American Games instead of pitching 
in the majors, where he won 245 games during a career that began in 
1976 and ended last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least with this I will be able to maintain contact and not  
let the withdrawal from all those years I was playing ball catch up 
with me,'' Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason this happened and maybe it happened for the  
best. I'm really not missing at all that I'm not able to pitch 
anymore. With this, I keep myself busy and hopefully it is for the 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Nicaragua got ready to enter the nine-team Pan Am  
tournament, team officials needed a manager with professional 
experience. The choice was easy. Just ask the most famous player 
the country has ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
	President Arnoldo Aleman last year renamed Managua's national  
stadium for Martinez, the first Nicaraguan to play in the major 
leagues, calling him ``the maximum glory of national sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one on the coaching staff has that professional experience  
and I was the only one who did,'' Martinez said. ``So they asked me 
if I was able to occupy that role and I said if there was no other 
choice, I will definitely do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Managing, he is learning, is demanding, requiring more than just  
making out lineup cards and plugging in the right players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of enjoying it, to see what it takes to deal with 25  
guys,'' Martinez said. ``Now I can see why Earl Weaver had gray 
hair and smoked about 20 packs of cigarettes a game. It can drive 
anybody crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago Wednesday, Martinez pitched the game of his  
life, a perfect game for the Montreal Expos against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``After seeing (David) Cone the other day it came back to my  
mind,'' Martinez said. ``I will celebrate. It's been eight years 
already and it's just like it was yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez is one of the featured attractions of the Pan Am  
baseball tournament, where his young team is not expected to win a 
medal. What most people would like to see is the trim Martinez on 
the mound, maybe showing again the form he once had pitching for a 
Canadian team, the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He would consider it, but only if he could contribute to a  
victory, not just to show he can still throw well at an advanced 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if the situation arrived and it was the right  
moment,'' El Presidente said, ``I would be able to get out there 
and help my team.''

<HEADLINE> The Circus Still Comes to Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Dawn was just breaking over the soft green  
hills of western Connecticut and several hundred spectators, some 
in prams and strollers, a few on walkers, had turned up for an 
event as old as the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfazed by the competing allure of TV, video games or ``Tarzan''  
at the multiplex, and undaunted by the protests of animal-rights 
crusaders, the circus had come to town. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus had arrived during the night  
at the site of the old Danbury fair, now a shopping mall, with 70 
huge trailer trucks, 43 RVs and mobile homes, and an elongated 
pickup truck carrying what in classic circus hyperbole was billed 
as ``the world's largest cannon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of roustabouts set about unfolding the several acres of  
canvas that would rise as the big top. Four hours later came the 
climactic moment circus buffs of all ages journey many miles to 
witness and photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Elephant superintendent Brad Jewell proudly led Petunia, Helen  
and Bessie, enormous Asian elephants, freshly self-showered and 
placidly plodding in trunk-to-tail lock step, to the task of 
tugging at stout ropes to lift the big top high, taut and 
wrinkle-free. Two Chinese acrobats, practicing their lion dance, 
and Yevgeni, a Russian juggler tossing up a dozen dinner plates, 
paused to watch. Enrique Macias, the tent master, joined the crowd 
in applauding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elephants do this better than a tractor or forklift. They can  
go into forward or reverse gear a lot faster,'' remarked Jewell, 
who is from Hugo, Okla., and ``married into elephants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My first wife,'' he explained, ``worked elephants, and her dad  
trained elephants for 45 years for Carson &AMP; Barnes,'' a rival tent 
circus among a vanishing breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite vanished yet. Small fry still delight in the  
live spectacle of tightrope walkers edging out onto the high wire, 
clowns tumbling out of a miniature fire truck and fierce tigers 
obediently climbing onto stools. 
</P>
<P>
	But in these days of working parents, it's likely to be grandma  
and grandpa buying the balloons and cotton candy and joining the 
kids in the howdah basket for the rolling ride on Petunia's back. 
</P>
<P>
	While the roustabouts were setting up the three rings and  
bleachers to accommodate 3,140 spectators, Josip Marcan was at the 
nearby Stop &AMP; Shop loading three shopping carts with chickens, pork 
butts, chuck steak -- whatever was on sale -- to feed his 10 Bengal 
tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The big cats, all bred on the tiger trainer's ranch near Panama  
City, Fla., ranged from the rare snow-white tiger to the even rarer 
golden-furred tabby. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very expensive to shop for,'' Marcan, a Croatian,  
said as he doled out breakfast briskets to his greedily grinning 
menage. ``Each tiger eats 15 pounds of raw meat a day. They love 
horse meat, but it's hard to find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a golf cart, circus owner John Pugh roamed the ``backyard,''  
the enclave of parked house trailers where circus families live on 
the road, and ``the pasture,'' where the animals are caged or 
corralled. 
</P>
<P>
	He was making a morning call on his ``extended international  
family.'' Numbering over 120, they included Russian aerialists, 
acrobats from Beijing, a clown from Ecuador, a brother-and-sister 
high-wire motorcycle act from Bulgaria, Portuguese tightrope 
walkers and the human cannonball, a Bulgarian woman. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pasture, broadening the international flavor, were  
Peruvian llamas, Arabian horses, camels from the Sahara and a 
miniature Argentine stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pugh also was purposely circling the wagons on the lookout  
for the biggest problem traveling circuses encounter these days. 
``They'll be out there soon with their placards and leaflets. They 
usually are,'' he grunted. 
</P>
<P>
	He meant the animal rights campaigners, who are credited with  
the demise of many circuses, particularly in England where Pugh 
began his career, and with the disappearance of animal acts from 
many surviving shows. 
</P>
<P>
	None showed up in Danbury, but a group from Friends of Animals  
was out picketing when the show moved down the road to Norwalk. 
Activists claim that captive wild animals suffer physical and 
psychological pain from confinement in trucks and cages and from 
cruel trainers forcing them with whips, sharp hooks and electric 
shock prods to perform tricks that don't come naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	From news clippings they document a number of incidents in the  
past decade of ``enraged, stressed out'' zoo and circus animals 
breaking their bonds to stomp and claw their handlers and panic 
spectators, and rebellious elephants smashing cars and store 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Out front at zoos and circuses and on the internet, various  
animal rights groups urge the public to ``boycott any form of 
entertainment using animals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To which Pugh angrily responds, ``Any legitimate circus would be  
out of its mind to abuse their animals. We love our animals. Some 
have been with this show longer than I have. Each elephant is worth 
about $100,000. They're irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abusing them ``would be like me entering a brand-new Mercedes in  
a demolition derby,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sawdust in your veins,'' is how operations vice president  
Elvin Bale characterizes the dynastic nature of circus life. ``I'm 
fourth generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is also dangerous. Bale has ridden a motorized wheelchair  
since suffering a trapeze accident 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was a ringmaster and tiger trainer. Mother was a  
trapeze artist. Great-grandfather Bale was a trick cyclist more 
than a century and a half ago when the circus moved along dirt 
roads in painted horse-drawn wagons. When the roads ran out, they 
rolled their wagons onto steamboats and played landings along the 
Ohio and Mississippi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circus fans, he notes, ``came in all ages and from all  
backgrounds: lawyers, doctors, farmers, factory hands, even a 
Pope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only aerialist ever to perform inside the Vatican,''  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	How did that come about?  
</P>
<P>
	As Bale tells it, John Paul II, who had his own childhood  
memories of the circus in his native Poland, heard that he was 
performing in Rome, and invited him to hang his trapeze in the 
baroque Aula delle Benedizioni, the hall of blessings. Bale flew 
through the sanctified air for a select audience of cardinals, 
diplomats, monks and nuns. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuses, after all, were a Roman invention. Almost at the very  
site of Bale's act, the Emperor Nero uncaged famished lions to gnaw 
on Christians in keeping with his imperial policy of placating the 
populace with ``panem et circenses'' -- bread and circuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian tradition has since enshrined St. Jerome as the patron  
of lion tamers. The 4th-century hermit translated the Bible from 
Greek and Hebrew into the Latin vulgate with a tamed lion at his 
feet. When he died in Bethlehem, the bereft beast pined away and 
expired on his grave. 
</P>
<P>
	A circus with a lion tamer toured colonial America as early as  
1716. George Washington, as president, attended Billy Ricketts' 
touring British show in Philadelphia and sold one of his horses to 
the equestrian act. Hachaliah Baily in 1815 introduced the first 
elephant, ``Old Bet,'' to American audiences. The show closed after 
a terrified farmer shot the beast. 
</P>
<P>
	William Cole, patriarch of the Cole clan, first hit the road  
with a tent show in 1872. By 1910, the peak year for circuses 
before radio and movies syphoned off much of the audience, there 
were more than 80 big-time touring shows. Their names glitter like 
spangles in the affections of circus buffs: P.T. Barnum and his 
elephant, Jumbo, whose name entered the dictionary as a synonym for 
outsized. Ringling Brothers, all seven of them, before the mergers 
with Barnum and Bailey. Sells-Floto. Spaulding &AMP; Rogers. Gollmar 
Bros. Hagenbeck &AMP; Wallace. Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show featuring 
100 Indians on 100 palominos and Annie Oakley in the center ring 
soloing on the Winchester repeating rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Depression, followed by TV, further thinned their ranks.  
Urban traffic jams did away with their best sales come-on: the 
arrival parade of bands, gilded wagons and cavorting clowns down 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's maybe 10 to 15 big shows still around, playing in  
domes and arenas, but we and Carson &AMP; Barnes are the last of the 
big ones still under canvas,'' Pugh said. ``A few small, 
family-operated shows still roam about, and circus acts have always 
been big in Vegas. But this vast country can't compare with tiny 
Holland or neighboring Mexico, which has 10 times as many. 
Sometimes two or three show in town at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bale, Pugh turned to administration after a tumbling  
accident ended his acrobatic career. Injuries on the job are still 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the ``Russian Air Force,'' the eight-member troupe of  
ex-Soviet trapeze artists, are grounded with ailments ranging from 
torn ligaments and hernias to a damaged jaw suffered by ``the main 
catcher.'' His job is to catch his somersaulting partners in the 
air, but a few nights ago he also caught a flying bar in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids don't run away from home to join the circus like they used  
to. Nowadays they'd have trouble with the labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't hire anyone under 18,'' said Pugh. ``Everyone is  
under Social Security and pays income taxes. It's not like the old 
days when you could hire anyone who wandered onto the lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic change in personnel came with the demise of  
Europe's communist regimes. ``All those performers from 
Communist-bloc countries traveling with state-supported circuses 
found themselves suddenly unemployed,'' said Pugh. ``We used to 
import acts from South America. Now we get a lot of Russians and 
Bulgarians. Very talented people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This circus travels about 10,000 miles through 20 states,  
starting out from its winter headquarters in Deland, Fla., in the 
second week in March and wending its way north to Maine. The season 
ends back in Florida in the last week in November. Most are 
two-night stands. ``We survive because we made moving an art 
form,'' concludes Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much follow the weather,'' said elephant boss  
Jewell. ``Last year we ran away from two hurricanes in Louisiana. 
Storms scare the animals, and they scare us even more. Most of our 
hops are quite short -- 100 miles would be our longest haul. We 
don't roll as a convoy. Each act packs up and takes off as soon as 
they finish the last show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friendly farmers ``quite frequently invite the elephants into  
their fields to graze and browse under the trees,'' Jewell 
continued. ``We turn 'em loose, and the farmer runs for his camera 
and gathers the family. It's not every day you get six elephants to 
mow and fertilize a couple of acres in a couple of hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz around the lot, as the show packed up and headed into  
Massachusetts, was that the year 2000 would be very competitive. 
Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey would be hitting the road with a 
new tent show after four decades of playing domes and arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe tent circuses are not heading for the elephant graveyard  
after all,'' Jewell remarked hopefully, as Petunia, Helen and 
Bessie pulled up stakes.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Sees Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch, led by continued strong  
performance in domestic beer sales, saw earnings rise 10 percent in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based company, maker of Budweiser, Bud Light,  
Michelob and other beers, is the world's largest brewer. 
Anheuser-Busch on Wednesday reported earnings of $431 million, or 
90 cents per share, for the quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slightly better than the 89 cents per share forecast by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. In the year-ago quarter, the 
company earned of $391 million, or 80 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Anheuser-Busch closed up 31 1/4 cents, at $77.75, on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 2 percent to $3.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have achieved our third consecutive quarter of solid  
double-digit earnings per share growth since implementing our 
revenue enhancement strategy of selective, market-by-market price 
increases or discount reductions,'' said August A. Busch III, 
chairman of the board and president. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, earnings were up 14  
percent, to $750 million, or $1.56 per share, from $656 million, or 
$1.34 per share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales during the six-month period were up 4.6 percent, to $5.8  
billion from $5.5 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch's domestic beer market share for the first six  
months was 46.1 percent, an increase of 0.8 percent, the company 
said. Domestic beer shipments were 47.9 million barrels, up 4.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	International beer volume declined 1.2 percent in the second  
quarter and grew 0.4 percent for the first six months of 1999. The 
company said gains in Canada, Latin America and continental Europe 
helped offset continued weakness in Asia and a slowdown in the 
United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Programs May Curb Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giving new teachers a good grounding in the  
job they face can make the difference between whether they stay in 
the job or quit. But many such introductory programs are 
underfunded or otherwise lacking, a nonprofit teacher recruiting 
group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, more than 20 percent of public school teachers quit  
within three years, and 9.3 percent leave before the end of their 
first year, the Education Department says. 
</P>
<P>
	About 93 percent of teachers who go through such introductory  
programs are still on the job after three years, according to the 
report from Recruiting New Teachers, Inc., a nonprofit educational 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet just 25 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia  
have so-called induction programs for their new teachers, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher retention is especially important these days. The  
Education Department estimates the nation's schools will need to 
hire 200,000 new K-12 teachers a year to ease shortages due to 
rising student enrollments and increasing teacher retirements. Some 
wealthy suburban districts have a glut of applicants, but poor 
urban and rural districts are expected to have trouble filling 
about 700,000 empty slots over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The induction programs differ greatly in what is required, who  
must participate and how much they must participate, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some other teacher training routines, induction programs  
allow rookie instructors to observe and consult with experienced 
teachers on matters such as setting up their classrooms, filling 
out attendance forms and preparing their students for standardized 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying the programs' quality levels ranged from ``comprehensive  
to cursory,'' Elizabeth F. Fideler, vice president of Recruiting 
New Teachers and the report's co-author, said, ``What new teachers 
experience is in stark contrast to the experiences of medical 
residents, law associates and even rookie baseball players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funding for the 17 states that pay for new-teacher induction  
range from a low of $150,000 in Virginia, which has 1 million K-12 
students, to a high of $80.2 million for California's two programs, 
which serve almost 6 million students. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states leave funding to local districts, which often  
manage the new-teacher programs alone, without teacher colleges or 
other partners. 
</P>
<P>
	All states with the programs require or emphasize mentoring or  
coaching for the new teacher, but less than a quarter require 
schools to offer some incentive for participating. One mentoring 
teacher in Chicago routinely gave up her planning period and lunch 
break to help the dozen novices assigned to her, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 10 of 27 states require that induction programs be  
evaluated; 11 simply recommend evaluation. And just over half, 17, 
require all school districts to use induction programs, but 10 of 
those states do not fund the programs. Another 10 states fund the 
programs without requiring school districts to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, new teachers are rarely required to sign up. Just  
over half of first-year teachers participate in an induction 
program, but that rate rises to 60 percent for first-year teachers 
in urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	As of August 1996, the ending year of the study, the following  
states had a new-teacher program or policy: 
</P>
<P>
	California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of  
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South 
Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Sign McDuffie to $20M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- When Dan Marino reports to training camp  
Friday, his favorite receiver will be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	O.J. McDuffie, who led the NFL last year with 90 receptions,  
averted a possible holdout by signing a six-year, $20 million 
contract Wednesday with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie's old contract had two years remaining and would have  
paid him $1.3 million this year. The new deal averages $3.3 million 
per season through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want O.J. to be a Dolphin forever,'' coach Jimmy Johnson  
said. ``He's a great team player. He helps you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie's agent, Joel Segal, threatened a holdout unless a new  
deal was reached by Friday, when veterans report for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my agent's game plan,'' said McDuffie, 29. ``I was  
fighting the whole way about that. I'm under contract, and I'm not 
a guy who wants to miss out on anything. I'm not a guy who likes to 
hold out, and I'm glad it didn't turn out that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDuffie's contract falls well short of Detroit receiver Herman  
Moore's new contract. Moore signed a five-year extension last week 
averaging $5.6 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	``O.J.'s deal is fair considering he had two years left on his  
old contract,'' Segal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year McDuffie became the first Miami player to lead the NFL  
in catches. He had a career-high 1,050 receiving yards and scored 
seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to reward a player who has been outstanding in all  
areas,'' Johnson said. ``Not only did O.J. lead the league in 
receptions, but in our offseason work the past few years, he has 
set an example for all of the young players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, Marino and McDuffie have combined on 309  
completions, an average of 52 per year. The past two seasons, 
McDuffie's teammates chose him the Dolphins' most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	But McDuffie admitted that with two years left on his old  
contract, he had limited leverage. He said he was relieved to reach 
an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that had been wearing on me, and it's awesome  
the Dolphins would be kind enough to sign me to an extension this 
early,'' he said. ``They really didn't have to do anything.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Push On With Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans began pushing their $792 billion  
tax cut through the Senate on Wednesday, despite a fresh word of 
caution from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, the 
opposition of most Democrats and a formal veto threat from the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a happy day,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., anticipating passage by Friday of a 10-year bill 
containing tax breaks for individuals, families, education, IRAs, 
long-term care insurance, small businesses and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be talking about allowing the people to keep  
just a little bit more of their own hard-earned money,'' he said. 
House-Senate negotiations on a compromise were possible by the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,  
countered that the GOP measure would harm the economy and 
shortchange Medicare, Social Security and domestic priorities such 
as education. Democrats were ready with a $290 billion tax cut, and 
Daschle told reporters there was ``zero room'' for compromise on 
that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	A new nationwide poll suggested that support for a tax cut  
lagged behind a desire to safeguard Social Security. Given four 
choices for the use of projected surpluses, 47 percent in an ABC 
News survey picked Social Security, 22 percent selected a tax cut, 
19 percent wanted to reduce the national debt and 10 percent 
favored domestic programs. The survey had a margin of error of 
three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy forecast to produce unexpectedly large  
surpluses -- an estimated $2.9 trillion over 10 years -- Republicans 
stressed they were proposing to return roughly 25 cents for each 
dollar to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure the American people that Congress' tax plan will  
not overheat the economy,'' the Senate Budget Committee chairman 
said in comments designed to blunt Greenspan's caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``By saving nearly all of the surpluses over the next two years,  
our plan should postpone the amount'' of interest rate raising the 
Federal Reserve feels obligated to take, added Sen. Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who wins bipartisan praise for his stewardship of the  
nation's central bank, appeared a short while earlier before the 
Senate Banking Committee, and repeated words of caution he had 
uttered previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut  
immediately, largely because it is apparent that the surpluses are 
doing a great deal of good to the economy,'' he said. Greenspan 
said his first preference would be to allocate surplus funds to 
retire the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said he would prefer a tax cut over using the  
surplus for spending on government programs, and Republicans said 
that was precisely what Clinton and the Democrats intended to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The debate here is not between reducing the debt and cutting  
taxes, '' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``The debate is between 
taxpayers spending money and Washington spending money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 55 votes, Republicans expressed confidence they had the  
support to brush aside any Democratic amendments, as well as a 
bipartisan plan for a $500 billion tax cut, and ultimately to 
prevail on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	As debate began, Clinton administration issued a statement  
saying the president ``strongly opposes the package of tax cuts'' 
crafted by the Republicans and ``would veto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To head off a Democratic attack that could have torpedoed the  
entire bill under the Senate's arcane budget rules, Republicans 
were forced at mid-afternoon to agree to have the tax cuts expire 
in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While the development marked a retreat, one outside expert,  
Robert Reischauer, predicted ``it will have no practical 
significance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pressures will build as we reach 2009 to extend the tax  
provisions,'' said Reischauer, former head of the Congressional 
Budget Office and a senior fellow at Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	As written, the proposal called for reducing the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is currently taxed at 28 percent. Together, those provisions 
account for nearly $300 billion of the $792 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del, chairman of the Senate Finance  
Committee and chief architect of the measure, said that ``for a 
middle-income family of four, these two changes will mean a tax 
savings of over $450 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the legislation includes relief from the so-called  
marriage penalty that forces some couples to pay more in taxes than 
if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, a champion of individual retirement accounts, also  
inserted several provisions to assist taxpayers saving for their 
retirements. One would raise contribution levels; another would 
permit individuals who are at least 50 years old to make larger 
contributions to their retirement plans than are otherwise allowed. 
Republicans stressed the benefit of that provision for women, in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Another element of the measure would provide a tax credit for  
employer-provided child care. 
</P>
<P>
	The allowable deduction for interest on student loans would be  
increased and a temporary tax break for employer-provided education 
would be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurance tax breaks would be made more generous, and a  
new deduction would be created for the cost of long term care 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Estate taxes, which were cut in the tax measure Clinton signed  
in 1997, would be cut again. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of special interest breaks was also included in the  
bill. One would increase the tax deduction for business meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation does not include any capital gains tax cut, as  
was contained in the bill passed by the House last week. Nor does 
it include a phased-in 10 percent across the board cut, as the 
House approved.

<HEADLINE> IPOs Growing More Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange is considered by  
many as something of an exclusive club where the rich get richer. 
Soon, however, investors of all stripes may get a chance to become 
owners of the hallowed Wall Street institution. 
</P>
<P>
	An increasingly competitive business environment -- especially in  
the financial services industry -- has led a number of well-known 
privately owned companies and organizations to consider public 
stock offerings as a way of fending off potential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for initial public offerings, or IPOs, has  
traditionally been the home of start-up companies looking to raise 
cash for future development. But recent announcements by the NYSE 
and the National Association of Securities Dealers that both are 
considering selling stock has signaled a sea change in the types of 
entities that might consider an IPO, as well as in how those 
organizations will conduct business in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynics might suggest that greed is the primary motive for an IPO  
in the midst of the longest bull market in U.S. history. But market 
observers say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	No one denies that the market's heights serve as a strong  
incentive for companies to go public. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the major, overriding factor is that the landscape is  
changing,'' said Scott Marcouiller, a vice president at St. Louis 
brokerage firm A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, competition is emerging from areas that didn't  
even exist just a few short years ago, Marcouiller said. For 
example, the proliferation of electronic stock trading systems, 
which allow investors to bypass the cumbersome and frequently 
costly exchange systems, have forced the traditional stock 
exchanges to consider alternative trading methods. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, a handful of longtime privately held companies have  
also either completed IPOs or plan to go public. Wall Street 
investment bank Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., for example, completed an IPO 
in May. And household name United Parcel Service Inc., the largest 
package delivery company in the world, filed last week to sell 
shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, New York-based LaBranche &AMP; Co. said last month it  
plans to become the first NYSE specialist firm to go public. 
Specialist firms provide orderly trading markets for NYSE-listed 
shares. They ensure all transactions are filled by matching buyers 
and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE said last week that it is considering an IPO by the end  
of the year, ending over 200 years of private ownership. And NASD 
board members are expected to vote on Thursday whether to spin off 
the NASD's Nasdaq Stock Market operations into a separate, 
for-profit company, with an IPO expected to follow some time next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Wall Street observers believe the NYSE and the NASD will  
use the stock created through an IPO to buy some type of 
alternative trading system, both as a way of increasing investors' 
trading options and eliminating competition. Publicly traded stock 
gives the exchanges a tangible and valuable currency with which to 
make acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The motivations are likely similar in the cases of Goldman  
Sachs, UPS and LaBranche &AMP; Co., according to David Menlow, 
president of the IPO Financial Network, a Millburn, N.J., research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at privately owned companies are increasingly  
concerned that their internal growth rates can't be sustained at 
the rates seen over the last decade or so, Menlow said. Future 
growth is expected to be fueled primarily through acquisitions, he 
said, and the currency for those acquisitions will be publicly 
traded stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth-through-acquisition trend is especially noticeable  
among upstart Internet companies that have recently completed 
public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	As investors have consistently placed astronomical valuations on  
new Internet stocks during the past year, officials at those newly 
minted public companies haven't hesitated to use the highly valued 
stock to acquire additional assets. The same principle is now being 
applied by the owners of longtime private companies looking to stay 
competitive in a marketplace increasingly marked by mergers and 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the fact remains that stock valuations are at all-time  
highs in most sectors, and any company or entity considering 
selling stock has undoubtedly taken that into account. ``Goldman 
Sachs, the New York Stock Exchange -- all of these entities are 
taking advantage of the fact that public equity markets are willing 
to pay pretty good prices right now,'' said Jay Ritter, a finance 
professor at the University of Florida who specializes in IPOs.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Money Goes to Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- More than half of the tobacco settlement  
money that states have planned to use is earmarked for health care 
services, a new report says, but an anti-smoking group said too 
little is going to programs to keep people from starting the habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine states have not decided how they will spend the  
money from the historic settlement with cigarette makers. The other 
21 have authorized the use of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that, about 10 percent has been earmarked for tobacco-control  
and smoking-cessation initiatives, drawing the ire of an 
organization that has been lobbying states to spend more on such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a problem with the fact that not nearly enough of the  
money is being spent on what it was intended for in the first 
place, which is using tobacco money to fix the tobacco problem,'' 
said Bill Novelli, president of the Washington-based Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine states have not decided how they will spend the  
money from the historic settlement with cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Novelli's organization advocates spending 20 to 25 percent of  
the money on tobacco education and smoking cessation efforts, but 
he said only about a dozen states are doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that some states are spending it on children's health  
insurance programs, college scholarships and biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are all laudable efforts and there is enough money to go  
around, but unless the states put a good portion of the money into 
tobacco programs, what will happen is they'll be paying out more 
and more over the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies agreed to pay $40 billion over 25 years to  
settle four state lawsuits and another $206 billion in a broader 
deal reached with the other 46 states last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal -- the biggest civil settlement in U.S. history --  
the tobacco company payments will be distributed beginning in 2000 
and will also help finance anti-smoking research and education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Health Policy Tracking Service at the National  
Conference of State Legislatures shows that nearly 20 percent of 
the $1.3 billion states have authorized so far will be spent on 
childhood development, elementary and secondary education and 
college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Six percent will go to services for the elderly and the  
remaining funds -- about 11 percent -- will be spent on assorted 
state needs. In all, more than half the money is being spent on 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost $7 billion of the initial settlement funds remain to be  
authorized or appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
	Many states have had to choose or are still deciding on how best  
to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, Louisiana and Minnesota have established endowments,  
which continue to grow while only the interest is spent, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Montana and Wyoming have  
established separate accounts within their budgets and appropriated 
tobacco funds for health care, tobacco cessation and education 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio and  
Pennsylvania have task forces or commissions seeking public input. 
Louisiana's governor is required to establish a separate tobacco 
fund section in his annual budget proposal to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Conference of State Legislatures is a clearinghouse  
of information for the states and their lobbying arm in Washington. 
The organization held its annual conference in Indianapolis this 
week.

<HEADLINE> HP Christens High-Tech Spin-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. has named its  
technology spin-off Agilent Technologies, reflecting the company's 
goal to create a more agile competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard will split off its high-tech measurement  
business into a separate entity, with its own publicly traded 
stock, from its core computer and imaging operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The move will create a computer and imaging company with roughly  
$40 billion in annual revenue, and a smaller Agilent that includes 
testing and measuring, components, chemical analysis and medical 
components, with about $7 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer and imaging businesses will retain the  
Hewlett-Packard Co. name. The split gives investors a clearer 
choice when deciding which stock to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agilent symbol -- a series of circles that form an  
eight-point starburst -- represents a ``spark of insight,'' the 
company said Wednesday. The company color is the blue HP used 
before it entered the computer and printing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	HP was founded 60 years ago in a Palo Alto garage by Stanford  
University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, first gaining 
notoriety as a maker of electronic testing gear. It is now the 22nd 
largest company in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Broadcast.com Founder Weighs Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- It took the Gulf War to make CNN famous. For  
broadcast.com, its first million-hit audience was President 
Clinton's grand jury testimony about Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The hits have just kept coming for the Internet broadcaster --  
sporting events, a lingerie fashion show, an American hero's return 
to space. 
</P>
<P>
	But even more significant, in the view of broadcast.com  
co-founder and chief executive Todd Wagner, was an event that 
wasn't hyped on the Internet: a parade for last year's World Series 
champion New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the last-minute production -- the company wasn't sure it  
would be able to transmit the pictures until an hour before the 
parade -- the event still drew 100,000 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It told me, behavior modification,'' Wagner said. ``People are  
coming, they're looking for something and finding it. ... People 
started realizing, 'Wow, there's cool stuff there every day.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner's ``behavior modification'' could be just another term  
for brand loyalty. Wagner said he considers it is a force that 
already is taking hold on the Internet and will frustrate 
latecomers -- even those with deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is a dead-out sprint to get there first,''  
Wagner said. ``Look at all the companies that sat back and were 
patient. Look at how expensive it has become to get market share on 
the Internet. Look at most of the leaders now; they were the ones 
that got there first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Wagner, 38, and his partner, Mark Cuban, 40, have  
reason to gloat a little. What started in 1995 -- with $4,000 in 
equipment in Cuban's spare bedroom -- as a way for the two Indiana 
University graduates to hear Hoosiers basketball games from Dallas, 
the company now operates out of a 28,000-square-foot converted 
warehouse equipped with satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio 
signals from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner and Cuban sold $30,000 shares in the company themselves  
until finding a private underwriter and trading equity to Motorola, 
Intel, Yahoo! and other partners. When the company went public last 
July, Wall Street went wild. From an opening price of $18 a share, 
the stock shot to $72 before closing its first day at $62.75. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the perfect Internet IPO,'' said Gail Bronson, senior  
analyst with IPO Monitor, an online tracking service for new 
stocks. ``They had a good name, they were first to the market, and 
they had a very engaging, novel technology that was going to offer 
a solution to a perceived need in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bronson said the company also had strong underwriters and  
management with good marketing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Cuban is a very engaging speaker and very good  
salesman,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the stock price began climbing again, and  
went over the $100 mark after reports circulated that the company 
would be bought by Yahoo! Inc., based in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Cuban and Wagner agreed to sell to Yahoo in a deal  
then valued at $5.7 billion. But that was nearly four months ago, 
and a slump in Yahoo's stock drove the value of the deal down to 
about $5 billion when it closed July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner insisted he didn't lose sleep over the deal's declining  
worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is out of our control and out of our hands,'' he  
said in an interview at a Dallas country club. ``We don't pay much 
attention to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, broadcast.com has yet to earn a nickel. After losing  
$14.9 million last year, the company posted a $3.8 million loss (11 
cents per share) on revenue of $10.3 million in the first quarter 
of 1999. Revenue is growing but not as quickly as costs, mostly for 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner declined to predict when the company will turn a profit.  
But he noted that analysts suggest it will happen in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a navy suit, red tie and starched white shirt, Wagner  
looks more like a young law firm associate -- which he used to be -- 
than an Internet pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban, who founded and led technology companies before  
broadcast.com, is usually portrayed as the technical and marketing 
genius, Wagner as the money guy. Wagner hesitated when asked if 
that characterization flattered or offended him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're two different people,'' he said. ``My background was  
obviously going to be more appropriate to be doing deals, and 
Mark's background was going to be a lot more appropriate to worry 
about the technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, broadcast.com carries about 400 radio stations, 55  
television and cable systems, and exclusive deals with the National 
Hockey League, Major League Baseball and the largest 100 companies 
on the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Nasdaq says something else about broadcast.com:  
Although the grunts and glitz of sports and lingerie shows draw 
attention, the company makes most of its money on business 
teleconferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner and Cuban pitch CEOs this way: Why spend big bucks flying  
people to meetings or paying for expensive satellite time and 
equipment when you can broadcast a speech or meeting to workers at 
their desktops? 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner insists that broadcast.com won't change now that it is  
Yahoo Broadcast Services. He promises that the company will stick 
to ``the things that got us here and that we do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its last big acquisition before broadcast.com, Yahoo laid off  
two-thirds of the work force at GeoCities and moved its 
headquarters to Yahoo's home in Santa Clara, Calif. Wagner 
predicted that won't happen to his company, which has more than 300 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs ``are not contemplated in this transaction,'' he said.  
``We'll run as a separate division within Yahoo. We will continue 
to grow here in Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts such as Daniel King of LaSalle Street Capital Markets  
in Chicago say the deal is a good fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcast.com has a great deal of content but they really need  
a lot more traffic to grow their client base,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner sees growth in the Internet dependent on making the  
medium more interactive, personal and useful. He predicted that 
people will pay to get Web sites without advertising and even pay 
per-view, although broadcast.com has mostly steered clear of that 
format because it would have to refund customers who caught a poor 
signal or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will change radically in the next few years as  
wireless and faster broadband connections spread and as people surf 
the Web with televisions and other appliances -- breaking the tether 
that ties the Internet to desktop PCs. Wagner said better 
technology will replace today's jerky, grainy Internet video with 
high-definition pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 1998 and 1999 have been as good as it gets in the  
careers of Cuban and Wagner. July 17 marked the first anniversary 
of the IPO that made them very rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a very great day, no question,'' he said with a  
laugh.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Questions Siege at Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Evidence held by the Texas Rangers may call  
into question the U.S. government's claim that it did not use 
incendiary devices when it moved into the Branch Davidian compound, 
which was consumed by fire during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's leader, David Koresh, and about 80 followers died in  
the 1993 inferno at outside Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities denied using incendiary devices during their  
assault, and investigators concluded that sect members set the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But a researcher for a 1997 documentary critical of the  
government's conduct was says the evidence may prove otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 12 tons of evidence was gathered in the aftermath of  
the disaster and much of it is stored in Waco. A probe by the Texas 
Rangers became the backbone of a 1994 criminal trial in which eight 
Branch Davidians were convicted of charges ranging from 
manslaughter to weapons violations for the inferno. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael McNulty, who is preparing a new documentary on the  
standoff, said he found that at least six items listed in Ranger 
inventories as silencers or suppressors were actually 
``flash-bang'' devices, commonly used by law enforcement to stun 
suspects, The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McNulty said the devices sometimes ignite fires in enclosed  
spaces because the loud bang and flash they emit are driven by a 
small pyrotechnic charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers' evidence logs indicate the devices were found in  
areas of the Davidian compound in which the fires broke out, 
McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our belief that these pieces of ordnance could and  
probably did have an impact on the fire on April 19th,'' he told 
the Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin called the allegations  
``nonsense'' and said they ignore evidence that the fire was set in 
several places at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know of no evidence that any incendiary device or  
flash-bang device was fired into the compound on April 19,'' Marlin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Francis Jr., chairman of the Texas Department of Public  
Safety, said Wednesday he has asked a federal judge to take control 
of the evidence, which despite being held by the Rangers is under 
the Justice Department's control. The judge has not yet ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the evidence may be problematic but I'm not an  
expert,'' Francis said. ``I think an expert ought to take a look at 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Davidians and authorities became locked in a 51-day standoff  
after agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were 
fired upon when they tried to arrest Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings have pointed to mistakes by the law  
enforcement officers, but none has been charged with a crime. A 
lawsuit filed by surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead 
challenges the conclusion that the Davidians started the fire and 
shot first during the raid.

<HEADLINE> Phone Tower in National Park Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The warbling in Washington's Rock Creek  
national park won't all be from the birds if a senator has his way. 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle has pushed through legislation 
allowing two cellular phone towers to rise amid the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle successfully amended a spending bill for the District of  
Columbia earlier this month, requiring the National Park Service to 
permit the towers in the long, narrow park that bisects much of the 
nation's capital -- despite opposition of local political leaders 
and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the bill, scheduled for a vote this week,  
does not have the cell phone tower provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's legions of commuters bristle with warbling cell  
phones, and Bell Atlantic says many have complained about losing 
their signal when driving through the relative wilds of Rock Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said park and city police want cellular technology in  
Rock Creek so they can respond more quickly to crimes and accidents 
there. A road running through the park is a major commuting route. 
</P>
<P>
	He offered his amendment shortly after the cellular telephone  
industry contributed $50,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee, Federal Election Commission records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic gave $25,000 on June 22, nine days before  
Daschle's amendment. Bell Atlantic Mobile has been waiting for more 
than five years for permission to build the cell towers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tallest of the towers is 130 feet, no competition for the  
555-foot Washington Monument that dominates the skyline. But with 
the park never more than a mile wide and often a mere swath, some 
worry that towers will spoil the sense of nature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about preventing an antenna farm,'' said Libby Kelley,  
an activist who came all the way from San Francisco to protest the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle spokeswoman Molly Rowley said the South Dakota senator  
was unaware of the donations to the Democratic committee. She said 
he called Bell Atlantic after hearing from officials concerned 
about safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Daschle,  
complained to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt about delays in 
approving Bell Atlantic's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cell phones provide a real measure of safety,'' Daschle said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also said federal law requires federal property to be leased  
to cellular companies if the technology is environmentally safe. 
``This application has passed every environmental requirement,'' 
Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has arisen in other national parks, vast ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Cellular companies are currently upgrading wireless equipment in  
Grand Teton National Park, and officials there are considering an 
application to build a new tower. Yellowstone National Park has 
three cell towers.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Co. Cabot Cuts 250 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Cabot Corp., a chemicals and energy company,  
announced Wednesday it has cut 250 jobs, about 6 percent of its 
work force, as part of a broad plan to increase earnings and reduce 
costs by $30 million to $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based company employs about 4,500 people, a  
spokeswoman said. Cabot is the world's largest producer of carbon 
black, which is used in printing and tire manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabot also said it plans to make an initial public offering of  
about 15 percent of its microelectronic materials business and 
separate its liquefied natural gas unit from the rest of the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the initiatives announced today will produce  
an increase in shareholder value and will allow us to refocus 
managerial resources on our core businesses,'' said Samuel Bodman, 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabot on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of  
$22.4 million, or 30 cents per share, down from $33.3 million, or 
44 cents per share, the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended June 30, Cabot earned $87.4 million,  
or $1.18 per share, down from $102.2 million, or $1.35 per share, 
in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the April-June quarter were up, nearly 13 percent,  
to $424.6 from $377.3. For the first three quarters, Cabot's 
revenue was fell $1.4 million to $1.27 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabot has 45 manufacturing facilities in 23 countries.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sabres' Hasek Quits in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek, who helped the Czech  
Republic win an Olympic gold medal and the Buffalo Sabres reach the 
NHL finals, will retire at the end of next season, according to 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old goaltender scheduled a news conference Thursday  
in Prague, and was expected to say he'd retire after next season 
rather than play out the remaining two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	WKBW-TV and WGR radio both said Hasek had decided to play one  
more season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL said in a statement that Hasek and the Sabres planned a  
news conference in the Czech Republic capital ``to discuss the 
future of Hasek's hockey career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, the league's most valuable player in 1997 and 1998 and a  
five-time choice as its best goalie, struggled much of last season 
with a groin injury. Despite that, he helped the Sabres reach the 
Stanley Cup finals, losing to Dallas in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Press said that Rich Winter of Edmonton, Hasek's  
agent, was en route to Prague and unavailable for comment. Sabres 
general manager Darcy Regier wasn't scheduled to be present in 
Prague, CP said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, known for flopping to the ice to block shots and even  
releasing his stick so as to have two hands to grab the puck, was 
paid $7 million last season. Only Patrick Roy of the Colorado 
Avalanche, who made $7.5 million, had a higher salary among 
goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of his NHL accolades, however, Hasek's career highlight  
came not in the playoffs but in the 1998 Winter Olympics, when he 
helped his native Czech Republic win the gold medal at Nagano, 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo acquired Hasek in 1992 in a trade from Chicago, where he  
had been a backup to Ed Belfour.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Prevention Effort Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surgeon general today declared suicide a  
serious public health threat for the first time, launching an 
effort to educate school counselors, parents and even hairdressers 
on how to spot signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United  
States, claiming about 30,000 lives in 1997, compared with fewer 
than 19,000 homicides. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a national tragedy and a public health problem  
demanding national leadership,'' said Tipper Gore, the vice 
president's wife, an advocate for mental health issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's talk about the reality of suicide in our national  
life,'' she said. ``Let's encourage all Americans to get the help 
they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She joined Surgeon General David Satcher in releasing a ``call  
to action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We must act now,'' Satcher said in his report.  
</P>
<P>
	Beyond actual suicides, there are many more failed attempts:  
About a half-million Americans are treated in an emergency room 
each year after trying to kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	White men age 65 and older are the most likely to commit  
suicide, accounting for 20 percent of the cases. And the suicide 
rate has doubled since 1980 among children ages 10 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time a surgeon general has taken up suicide --  
or even mental health -- as an issue. A full and comprehensive 
report on all facets of mental health is expected by the end of the 
year, and a comprehensive national suicide strategy is expected in 
early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's report grew out of a conference on suicide prevention in  
Reno, Nev., last October. Experts compiled 81 recommendations, some 
of which needed further refinement. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were 15 ideas that were broadly accepted, so Satcher  
opted to begin work on those now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling was, this is too important to wait for the  
full-blown, comprehensive strategy,'' said Damon Thompson, 
Satcher's spokesman. ``It's simple, it's understandable, and 
there's near universal agreement that these 15 steps can prevent 
suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the recommendations involve educating the public to  
recognize when someone seems at risk of suicide and how to get that 
person help. That includes doctors and nurses, but also clergy and 
others who interact with people and hear about their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want coaches, we want school teachers, we want  
hairdressers, we want people who interact with the community,'' 
Thompson said. ``It's going to take outreach, it's going to take 
training. It's going to take communities to realize it's got to be 
a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher also announced a new outreach campaign to many of these  
groups to raise awareness of the issue, develop strategies to 
identify people at risk and improve quality of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	More specifically, the Clinton administration planned to help  
distribute a PBS video called ``Depression: On the Edge'' to school 
counselors to help them detect teen depression. Mrs. Gore and 
Satcher are also working with the Ad Council and MTV to develop a 
campaign reducing the stigma of mental illness. That isn't expected 
until late this year or early next. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Department of Health and Human Services plans to work  
with organizations like Meals on Wheels to identify people who may 
be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Other recommendations include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Educating the public that suicide is preventable and working to  
diminish stigma of mental illness, substance abuse and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Helping primary care doctors and nurses learn how to recognize  
and treat depression, substance abuse and other mental problems 
associated with suicide and increasing referrals to specialists 
when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Working with news and entertainment media to present balanced  
portrayals of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing research on suicide risk and prevention programs.  
</P>
<P>
	--Formally evaluating suicide prevention programs to determine  
what works.

<HEADLINE> Duval Unhappy With Ryder Cup Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROMWELL, Conn. -- David Duval swears he never used the ``b''  
word, but he's not happy with how money from the Ryder Cup is 
disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said there would be a boycott,'' Duval said Wednesday,  
the day before the Greater Hartford Open. ``I don't think it will 
change unless four or five players get together and talk to the PGA 
of America and say, `We need to revisit this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup players are not paid, and Duval and others want to  
designate where profits go. For that to happen, he says the players 
must get the attention of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is the top money winner on the PGA Tour. He also leads in  
points for the Ryder Cup, which will played in September at the 
Country Club in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament has been billed as the most profitable event in  
golf history. According to Golf Digest, this Ryder Cup could take 
in about $63 million while its organizers, The PGA of America, are 
expected to net roughly $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The players get a $5,000 stipend to play and qualify for the $5  
million World Golf Championships. The winner will earn $1 million 
from that event played in Akron, Ohio, next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, who has earned more than $3 million this year, said  
players need a say in doling out the Ryder Cup revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be given some money to designate to go where we want  
-- to my local charity back home or to some program I feel strongly 
about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, second in Ryder Cup points, also advocates money  
going to charity. Others have questioned the system over the years, 
including Mark O'Meara, Lee Janzen, Scott Hoch and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a sensitive issue among players. Tom Lehman on Wednesday  
was reluctant to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be a boycott. Tom Lehman will never  
boycott,'' Lehman said. ``I would pay to play in the Ryder Cup. 
That's all I want to say about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen said money would be less of an issue if the match were  
played without television and business sponsorships. The Ryder Cup, 
he said, was intended to be simply competition between two sides. 
But once money is involved, he said, it makes sense to pay the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the product,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Janzen added that each player should be given ``a couple of  
hundred thousand dollars'' to donate to a charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Jim Awtrey, the chief executive officer of the  
PGA of America, were not returned Wednesday. The organization has 
defended the system in the past, pointing out it pays for several 
golf and education programs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The money issue aside, Duval said he is looking forward to the  
Ryder Cup and the opportunity to bring the trophy back to America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, pride does come into play,'' he said. ``I  
certainly didn't enjoy getting beat at the Presidents' Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.5 million GHO at the TPC at River Highlands has a field  
that includes five of the tour's top money winners. This year's 
first prize is $450,000. Olin Browne a 15-year veteran is the 
defending champ. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne will try to become the first back-to-back champion of the  
tournament, sponsored by Canon. Last year's GHO title was Browne's 
first on tour. He picked up his second tour title in May at the 
Colonial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning made me feel like I had earned my spot out here,''  
Browne said. ``When you first get out here, your main concern is 
keeping your card ... but there's no substitute for achieving 
success.''

<HEADLINE> Deputies Free Youths From Utah Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELBERTA, Utah (AP) -- Two teen-agers who were exploring a popular  
cave south of Salt Lake City became stuck Wednesday in a narrow 
passage 120 feet underground. It was hours before they were freed 
by rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Hale, 17, was freed about 10:30 p.m. and Chris Marrow, 17,  
was freed two hours later, Utah County sheriff's Lt. Ron Fernstedt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both youths had minor abrasions from their ordeal in the Nutty  
Putty Cave. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens had camped in the area Tuesday night and entered the  
popular cave at about 9 a.m. Wednesday. They became stuck about 90 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were well prepared. It is not like they were going into  
something they were not prepared for,'' Fernstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutty Putty is known for its narrow passages and the youths  
became stuck in a portion called the Birth Canal, where hikers have 
to suck in their stomachs to get through. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernstedt and rescuers could not remember anyone having become  
so badly stuck before. ``They were just too big for the area they 
tried to go through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said they were freed by ``a tug here, a tug there'' until  
they could move a little. It took a long time, he said, because it 
was difficult to get leverage and ``you have to be gentle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elberta is 55 miles south of Salt Lake City.

	19 Die Canyoning in Swiss Alps  
</P>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Authorities were searching for  
two people still missing today after a flash flood smashed into a 
group of adventure-seeking tourists in the Swiss Alps, killing 19. 
The accident occurred yesterday while a party of 45 tourists and 
eight guides were plunging down waterfalls and rapids on the 
Saxeten brook. A sudden storm swelled the mountain stream into a 
raging torrent, engulfing the adventurers. The victims were from 
Britain, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. Two 
of the dead were reportedly guides from Adventure World, the tour's 
organizers.

	Fumes Sicken Ill. Air Controllers  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- More air traffic controllers called in sick today  
at the nation's busiest flight control center after a rash of 
illnesses blamed on chemical fumes. Flights across the Midwest were 
delayed yesterday because so many controllers left work. Minor 
flight delays were reported today but were blamed on isolated 
storms rather than the controllers' illnesses, a spokeswoman for 
Chicago's Department of Aviation said. A dozen controllers, or 10 
percent of the staff on duty, called in sick this morning, said Ron 
Downen, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Association local. He said he feared even more would be absent from 
this afternoon's shift.

	Senate Begins Debate on Tax Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate began debate today on a  
Republican-backed bill offering the biggest tax cut in nearly two 
decades. Supporters of the 10-year, $792 billion tax cut were 
immediately confronted by a rival plan put forth by a bipartisan 
group of senators that would lower the size of the reduction to 
$500 billion. ``We probably would be better off holding off on a 
tax cut'' because of the uncertainty of budget surplus projections 
said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying today 
before the Senate Banking Committee today. White House officials 
say President Clinton will veto the GOP bills because they are too 
large.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jurors began deliberations today on a  
lawsuit demanding that the fugitive convicted in absentia of 
killing his girlfriend pay at least $4.28 million in damages to 
counter whatever profits he could make from selling his story. A 
judgment against Ira Einhorn ``has got to be so substantial that it 
will be a shot heard around the world,'' attorney James R. Beasley 
said this morning in closing arguments. Beasley represents the 
family of murder victim Helen ``Holly'' Maddux in a wrongful death 
lawsuit against Einhorn, a former counterculture guru who is 
fighting extradition from France. Einhorn did not send anyone to 
defend himself.

	Surveys Show Frustration With HMOs

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers and doctors both report widespread  
trouble getting needed care from HMOs, according to two surveys 
today. Nearly nine in 10 doctors and one in four consumers 
complained they had trouble getting needed services, but more 
managed care plans are willing to report results of evaluations, 
according to the annual report on the quality of HMOs that includes 
customer satisfaction data. Separately, the Kaiser Family 
Foundation found 87 percent of doctors said their patients had 
experienced some type of denial of coverage over the last two 
years.

	GRACKO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Laying flowers on the coffins as a  
NATO helicopter buzzed overhead, hundreds of villagers mourned 14 
Serb farmers today and demanded better NATO protection from ethnic 
violence in Kosovo. Peacekeepers, meanwhile, detained four men for 
questioning in the killings, the worst attack in the violence that 
has plagued the NATO-led mission trying since June to enforce peace 
in the Serb province. Maj. Jan Joosten of Denmark, a mission 
spokesman, said the four men, seized in dawn raids on houses in and 
around the slain farmers' home village, had not been charged.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders  
is quitting football, despite the clear chance he would have had of 
becoming the NFL's all-time career rushing leader. The 31-year-old 
star retired without talking to Detroit coach Bobby Ross or anyone 
else in the Lions organization. ``My desire to exit the game is 
greater than my desire to remain in it,'' the NFL's second-leading 
all-time rusher said in a statement released today. Sanders arrived 
in London this morning on a flight from Detroit. The team has 
scheduled a news conference for this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> NFL Training Camp Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Donovan McNabb hasn't thrown a single pass  
for the Philadelphia Eagles, and already there's trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's stalled contract negotiations were tainted by the worst  
kind of controversy Tuesday with assertions by his agent that race 
might be playing a role in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles denied it, and McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith,  
tempered his comments on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McNabb remained absent from training camp, two days  
after the No. 2 pick in the draft was supposed to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the questions that has come up is the race issue,  
mentioned about Donovan McNabb's situation,'' Eagles coach Andy 
Reid said. ``I would like to address that. I think that's absurd. 
Race will never be an issue. Not now, nor never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview aired Tuesday on Philadelphia's Comcast  
SportsNet, Smith raised the possibility that the Eagles were 
reluctant to give McNabb a contract without voidable years because 
he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much history with black quarterbacks, but you  
definitely don't want to see Tim Couch, Peyton Manning, Ryan Leaf, 
Kerry Collins get the kind of deals they got, and it was no issue. 
We'll pay these guys,'' Smith said in the cable TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why pull the plug now when for the past couple of years you've  
been consistently doing it for the white quarterbacks?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that the issue  
of race has never come up in his negotiations with Joe Banner, the 
Eagles' executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not brought up race with them,'' Smith said. ``I have  
always negotiated based on Donovan McNabb's talents, not the color 
of his skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, also on Comcast, said the issue ``has been blown way out  
of proportion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really on the verge of trying to make me look bad, and I  
haven't set foot on the field,'' McNabb said. ``This is not a 
racial issue and we don't want anyone to think that. ... We want to 
continue to work with this contract deal, get it over so I can 
report to camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles and McNabb are believed to be discussing details of a  
$50 million, seven-year contract, including a signing bonus of up 
to $12 million. Banner and Smith agree that the deal is 60 percent 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is hung up on the issues of voidable years and a buyback  
clause. The Eagles don't want to include them, while McNabb wants 
to be able to renegotiate after three or four seasons -- and 
possibly get another huge signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb was due in camp Sunday night and missed a second day of  
practice for rookies and selected veterans Tuesday. McNabb is the 
projected backup to starting quarterback Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	Banner cited Steve McNair, the No. 3 pick in the 1995 draft, as  
a quarterback who benefited from not having voidable years and a 
buyback clause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a structure that we think has some problems with it,''  
Banner said. ``And thus, we're asking somebody to have both the 
courage and the foresight to do something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the AP he had no reason to believe race was the  
reason the Eagles opposed such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't think race is an issue in this contract  
negotiation,'' Smith said. ``Prior to drafting Donovan, voidable 
years was an issue they did not care to deal with. And knowing Andy 
Reid's history, Brett Favre didn't have a voidable deal. I just 
think that they truly feel it's not in the best interests of the 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
                               *Rams    	
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams have hiked their contract offer to holdout  
running back Marshall Faulk to more than $40 million for seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams have practiced for five days without Faulk, the NFL's  
best all-purpose back last year, and coach Dick Vermeil said 
Tuesday it's time to come to terms and get down to business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough,'' Vermeil said. ``The time is now, let's go  
to work. That's the way I feel about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Jevon Kearse, the Tennessee Titans' top draft pick, and his new  
agent, Leigh Steinberg, agreed to a five-year, $6.1 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans hadn't expected any negotiating problems with  
Kearse's first agent, William ``Tank'' Black. But Kearse fired 
Black last spring after he was accused by the NFL Players 
Association of providing cars and money to former Florida players, 
including Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearse, 16th pick, was nicknamed ``The Freak'' for his play at  
linebacker and defensive end at Florida. He earned All-American and 
All-Southeastern Conference honors as a junior last season when he 
totaled 16.5 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans, who had one of the worst pass rushes in the NFL last  
season, plan to keep Kearse at left defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Miami Dolphins rookie running back J.J. Johnson, their top draft  
pick, received a $980,000 signing bonus as part of a four-year, 
$2.65 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among six rookies signing contracts Tuesday. The first  
practice for the newcomers is today, with the entire team taking 
the field for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Rod Konrad also signed a four-year contract. Signing  
three-year deals were running back Cecil Collins, center Grey 
Ruegamer, punter Brent Bartholomew and guard Joe Wong. 
</P>
<P>
	All seven Miami draft choices are now under contract.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys top pick Ebenezer Ekuban recognized the  
importance of his first NFL training camp, so when his agent told 
him late Monday that his contract was almost done, Ekuban was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1:45 a.m. Tuesday, he boarded team owner Jerry Jones' private  
jet in Maryland, and seven hours later was sweating through 
practice with his new teammates after signing his contract: a 
five-year, $5.65 million deal that includes a $3,525,000 signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he becomes a great player and fits in with this team, he  
probably won't ever see the end of this contract,'' said Jones, who 
negotiated Ekuban's deal with agent Marvin Demoff. ``We've 
historically extended guys like that and kept them. That's our 
strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round choice Solomon Page, an offensive lineman from West  
Virginia, is the only unsigned draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie quarterback Cade McNown is still an absentee in Chicago  
Bears camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to decide what our next move should be since  
they made no move off their original offer,'' Jim Miller, the 
Bears' director of business operations, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bears made a revised contract offer to McNown and agent  
Tom Condon over the weekend, they figured they would get a 
counteroffer. When Condon faxed his response Monday, however, he 
simply put into writing the same deal he'd been asking for all 
along: a seven-year contract that voids after three years, with the 
Bears able to buy back the fourth through sixth years with another 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the Bears will not accept that deal.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville Jaguars linebacker Bryce Paup was the first  
casualty of training camp, tearing a pectoral muscle while lifting 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
	He will likely miss Jacksonville's first preseason game, Aug. 13  
against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Paup was second on the team with 6 1/2 sacks last season after  
being signed as a free agent from the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Aaron Brooks and punter Josh Bidwell, Green Bay's  
two fourth-round draft picks, signed contracts and reported to camp 
on Tuesday, a day after their fellow rookies and free agents. 
Brooks and Bidwell were the last of the Packers' 12 picks to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks looks like a leading contender in the race to be one of  
Brett Favre's backups, although veteran Rick Mirer is the likely 
No. 2. Brooks was a starter at Virginia for two years.

<HEADLINE> GOP To Ask States To Return $6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Desperately seeking cash for routine spending  
bills, House Republican leaders intend to ask the nation's 
governors to return up to $6 billion in welfare money accumulated 
by the states in recent years, according to congressional 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
idea was broached most recently by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the GOP 
whip, at a leadership meeting. It was approved by Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., as part of a months-long struggle by the GOP to 
win approval of all 13 regular spending measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to having an impact on Congress' spending battles,  
the proposal could pose a dilemma for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
who is not only the elected leader of the nation's second-largest 
state, but also the front-runner for the GOP presidential 
nomination. Karen Hughes, an aide to Bush, said there had not yet 
been any contact with the governor's office. Moreover, she said, 
``we may, in fact, end up not having a substantial surplus'' for a 
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking the return of money would be an irony for a political  
party whose oft-articulated philosophy is to ship money and power 
to the states. In addition, some GOP aides acknowledge, it could 
require Republican governors to choose between tax cuts at home and 
spending needs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Under welfare reform legislation enacted in 1996, the nation's  
governors were guaranteed preset levels of funding for five years. 
Governors lobbied for the guarantee, saying they were assuming a 
risk; namely, that the demand for welfare money would outstrip the 
supply of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides in the House, though, say the opposite has  
happened -- that the federal government has been giving money and 
power back to the states and welfare rolls have gone down, leaving 
the states flush with money. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, several lawmakers and aides expressed doubt that the  
governors would be willing to voluntarily send money back to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat was harshly critical. ``Why should we be surprised  
that the House Republicans want to pay for their tax cut, 
two-thirds of which goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of the people 
in this society, by kicking the props out once again from 
low-income families and children with some of the toughest problems 
in the country,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the senior 
Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to find money outside Washington comes at a time when  
House Republicans are struggling mightily to win approval for all 
13 regular spending bills, while being able to claim at least the 
appearance of living within spending restraints imposed in the 1997 
balanced budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, they have resorted to a number of budgetary artifices  
to avoid the spending limits. Republicans recently declared $4.5 
billion for the 2000 Census to be an emergency -- meaning it would 
be above and beyond the spending limits in place and be paid for 
out of budget surplus funds. 
</P>
<P>
	This and other devices still leave Republicans an estimated $12  
billion short of funds they estimate will be needed to permit 
passage of legislation financing programs at the departments of 
Health and Human Services, Education and Labor. Work on the bill 
was recently sidetracked until September.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Sign Pitcher Sirotka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Left-hander Mike Sirotka and the Chicago White  
Sox agreed Wednesday to a contract extension covering at least the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirotka, 28, is 7-9 with a 3.47 ERA with two complete games and  
one shutout in 20 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is eligible for salary arbitration, he would receive $1.4  
million in 2000 with a chance to earn an additional $475,000 in 
performance bonuses. He also would receive retroactive pay to 
increase his salary this year from $285,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is not eligible for arbitration, Sirotka still would  
receive the retroactive pay but would earn $550,000 for 2000 with 
$325,000 in incentives. In 2001, he would receive a base salary of 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the White Sox are buying out his first year of  
salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no desire to go through that process,'' Sirotka said.  
</P>
<P>
	It won't be known until November if Sirotka is eligible for  
arbitration. He needs to be in the top 17 percent by service time 
among those players with 2-3 years in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be one of the five pitchers who helps us get to the  
point where we can be competitive,'' Sirotka said. ``It's been a 
long journey to get here. Now, I'd like it to be the beginning of 
great things with this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In five seasons with Chicago, Sirotka is 26-28 with a 4.43 ERA  
in 81 games, including 67 starts. He led the White Sox with 14 wins 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has done everything we could ask of him, both on and off  
the field,'' White Sox general manager Ron Schueler said. ``He 
really stepped up to become a leader on our pitching staff in 1998 
and has continued that consistency this season. He battles and 
gives us a chance to win every time out.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Modernization Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Success stories touted by the National Weather Service to  
illustrate the value of improved forecasts: 
</P>
<P>
	--Grand Canyon, Ariz., July 14-15: Modern Doppler radar detected  
rain of up to three inches falling over the area, threatening 
flooding of Bright Angel Creek. The advance warnings allowed park 
officials close hiking trails and keep visitors away from mud 
slides. 
</P>
<P>
	--Beebe, Ark., Jan. 21: A girl's basketball game was called at  
halftime after the school superintendent heard a tornado warning on 
National Weather Service radio. Thirty-minutes later the now empty 
gym was leveled by the twister. 
</P>
<P>
	--Zion National Park, Utah, July 27, 1998: Forecasters used new  
technology to pinpoint which drainage areas will flood in heavy 
rains, and park rangers persuaded most hikers to vacate the area. 
Two hikers who ignored the warnings were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Camp Springs, Md., June 17, 1997: For the first time  
forecasters correctly predicted the arrival of the El Nino weather 
phenomenon, six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cincinnati, March 25, 1997: Advance flood warnings saved  
opening day for the Cincinnati Reds by giving managers of Cinergy 
Field time to close flood gates and activate pumps to prevent 
flooding of the new $2 million Astroturf field. 
</P>
<P>
	--Honolulu, July 16, 1994: Using new technology to track and  
forecast the path of Hurricane Emilia, forecasters were able to 
avoid issuing an unnecessary warning, saving millions of dollars in 
evacuation costs.

<HEADLINE> Umps Likely To Fight Over Phillips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that they've lost their fight with baseball,  
look for umpires to battle with each other over the future of union 
head Richie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	In spring training, umpires voted 49-14 to give him a new  
five-year contract, with most of the opposing votes from the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
	When a dozen AL umps refused to go along with Phillips' strategy  
of mass resignations last week, the umpires' position crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Now baseball knows it is dealing with a divided union, and it's  
hard to envision umpires uniting as long as Phillips remains in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously didn't turn out to be the right move because we  
had defectors,'' said AL ump Richie Garcia, a Phillips backer who 
appears to have lost his job. ``Most of the stuff a union does, 
anything a union does, will not work if the body doesn't stick 
together. And we didn't stick together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players achieved their tremendous gains by maintaining a nearly  
solid front through eight work stoppages since 1972, increasing the 
average salary from $34,000 to $1.72 million in the past 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Miller, who masterminded the players' position for many  
of those years, can't fathom Phillips' strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where he's going,'' Miller said Wednesday. ``It's  
so ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By resigning en masse, then suing baseball and attempting to  
withdraw the resignations, the umpires lost all job protection 
under federal law, according to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at an extreme disadvantage,'' he said. ``They've put  
themselves in a very difficult position, mostly because they've 
given the owners and the leagues so many options and so many 
weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's clear that somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of the  
union won't follow Phillips. More than a dozen umpires issued a 
statement Wednesday night criticizing their leadership for ``a 
flawed and doomed strategy'' that ``made no sense at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, as long as Phillips heads the union, umpires  
won't have any power, according to lawyers who are involved with 
major league baseball through the player's union, agents and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our association fell apart when the American League guys went  
the other way, and it totally devastated our negotiations,'' NL ump 
Randy Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The events of the last two weeks have left NL umps angry at  
their AL counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in the minors, I looked up to the major league  
umpires and how they did their job,'' the NL's Angel Hernandez 
said. ``I would never have thought that a couple of guys would take 
out a personal vendetta to try to break us apart. But that was what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips called for the resignations at a meeting in  
Philadelphia on July 14, a day after the All-Star game, wanting to 
seize the initiative and not wait until the expiration of the 
current labor contract Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Because that tactic backfired, umpires will finish the contract  
and wonder if they'll be locked out next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But 22 -- nine in the AL and 13 in the NL -- are losing their  
jobs, replaced Sept. 1 by 25 new hires from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the pro- and anti-Phillips factions will fight for the  
votes of the new union members. Phillips' chief backers are union 
president Jerry Crawford, Bruce Froemming and Terry Tata in the NL 
and Garcia in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction has sought advice from Ron Shapiro,  
the agent for Cal Ripken. This group says that after 22 years, it's 
time to replace Phillips with a less confrontational leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``His expertise in negotiating is what got us where we are,''  
Garcia said. ``He's been successful in negotiating and we're 
getting punished for it.''
