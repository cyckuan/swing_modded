COWBOYS STILL ON LOOKOUT AS SAINTS OBTAIN KENNISON

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' search for a receiver continues
after their attempt to trade for the St. Louis Rams' Eddie Kennison
fell through yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams traded Kennison to the New Orleans Saints for a
second-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cowboys officials, who are in Indianapolis for the
NFL's scouting combine, are looking for another receiver to
complement starter Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was unavailable for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the early talk centered on unrestricted free-agent
receivers Carl Pickens of the Cincinnati Bengals and Raghib Ismail
of the Carolina Panthers. Both, however, would cost more than the
Cowboys are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens turned down a deal for $3.5 million a year from the
Bengals because he wanted $5 million a year. He is also the
Bengals' franchise player, and would cost the Cowboys two high
draft picks as well as the high salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had also shied away from Ismail for similar reasons.
market, ]Ismail is coveted by several teams and is sure to get a
deal for at least $4 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have also evaluated Green Bay Packers restricted
free agent Derrick Mayes. Other possibilities are restricted free
agents Bobby Engram of the Chicago Bears and Reggie Barlow of the
Jacksonville Jaguars. After that the free-agent pool is thin. The
original team of a restricted free agent has the right to match any
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could be viewing their options this weekend at the
scouting combine, as they may have to land a receiver in the draft.
Among the players who could be available when the Cowboys pick 22nd
are Troy Edwards from Louisiana Tech and Peerless Price from
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the Cowboys are not trying to a find a
receiver to replace Irvin as the team's primary option. Jones said
earlier in the week that the team's evaluation found that Irvin is
not declining, even though he caught only one touchdown pass last
season. Jones said the Cowboys believe Irvin is still a weapon and
blamed his poor production on Irvin's being doubled-teamed ``90
percent'' of the time last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find someone to make teams pay for so much
concentration on Michael, somebody who can win the one-on-one
battle when Michael is double- teamed,'' Jones said.

A SYMBOLIC VISIT TO THE STATE THAT RE-LAUNCHED THE `COMEBACK KID' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs with updates on evening speech by adding new grafs 8-12;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Seven years ago, the voters of New Hampshire
threw Bill Clinton a lifeline when it looked as if he were sinking
for the third time under the weight of disclosures about his draft
record and his private life.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton returned to thank the people of
New Hampshire for their indulgence, spending a day here discussing
health care, greeting old friends and raising money for the state
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit Thursday to Dover, Merrimack and Manchester was
his first domestic trip out of Washington since his acquittal by
the Senate last Friday on two articles of impeachment charging him
with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Gennifer Flowers affair that almost doomed
his candidacy in 1992 was just a tantalizing preview of the vastly
more damaging Monica Lewinsky scandal that consumed the sixth year
of Clinton's presidency and has permanently altered his place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The president was not gloating Thursday over his escape from the
impeachment ordeal, not exactly. But the symbolism of the trip was
unmistakable. It was here in the early days of the 1992 campaign
that Clinton earned the nickname the Comeback Kid, a bold bit of
spin by his handlers after he survived the sex and draft
disclosures to finish a strong second in the New Hampshire primary
seven years ago Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that his second-place finish, to former Sen.
Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, ``proved I can take a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing, Clinton's appearance here Thursday said.
In the past year, he has taken everything the Supreme Court, a
relentless independent counsel and bitterly partisan Congress could
throw at him.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity mocks his enemies, and he exults in talking about
how he intends to spend his remaining two years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling, sentimental speech Thursday night to state
Democrats at the National Guard Armory in Manchester, Clinton
recalled the dark days of the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when many
pundits had written him off. But he recalled the line he delivered
at an Elks Club meeting in Dover on Feb. 12, 1992, promising,
``I'll never forget who gave me a second chance and I'll be there
for you until the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Clinton said, ``if you had listened to the
experts, the dog would have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the people of New Hampshire gave his faltering
campaign a boost that propelled him to the White House. ``We've
seen a lot of dogs killed,'' the president said, ``but at least the
last one is still living.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the occasion to plug the presidential
candidacy of Vice President Al Gore. At the mention of Gore's name,
the crowd rose with a roar and waved ``Gore 2000'' placards.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover on Thursday morning, Clinton presided over a discussion
of his proposals to expand health-care programs to cover part of
the cost of nursing home care, extend health benefits to more
children and expand the rights of subscribers to health maintenance
organizations. He lingered after the event, shaking hands and
embracing nearly all of the 250 people who sat through the
discussion at the Dover town hall. It was a friendly crowd, a
handpicked group of loyalists who remembered Clinton's words seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Peter B. Schmidt, 60, a retired professor of German at the
University of New Hampshire, said he was eager to see the president
return to matters of substance after a year in which he, as Schmidt
delicately phrased it, ``suffered some distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has paid a price, damn right he has,'' Schmidt continued.
``The idea that he `got away with it' is rubbish. Clearly he has
been harmed and his legacy has been tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt echoed the findings of many polls that the public
can separate Clinton's private behavior from his performance in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people decided wisely that they were not electing
a pope, a minister or a moral icon. They have elected a man who has
a good handle on the problems of the country,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not as forgiving. The Union Leader newspaper of
Manchester carried a banner headline reading, `` Mr. President,
you're a disgrace!'' and published a front-page editorial telling
Clinton he was not welcome in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial, signed by the paper's publisher, Nackey Loeb, was
titled, ``Don't come back, kid'' and said that once upon a time a
presidential visit to New Hampshire was a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it was purely political, it was something special
just to have the president of our country in our midst,'' the
editorial said. ``Not anymore. Not today. Not with this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the First Amendment is great,'' Lockhart said, ``and
should be protected at all costs.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich on Thursday officially was named
head coach of the USA Basketball men's senior national team that
will participate in the 1999 Americas Olympic Qualifying
Tournament.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should the team qualify, Tomjanovich, who coached Team USA to a
bronze medal in the World Championships of Basketball, also will
coach the next edition of the Dream Team that will play in the 2000
Summer Olympics at Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very honored to have been selected to coach the USA
team,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I feel that it's an opportunity that
doesn't come often, and I'm blessed to have a second opportunity.
My experience with USA Basketball has been nothing but wonderful. I
love the people I've worked with; we've developed a very good
relationship. Last year's experience was one that I will always
remember. It wasn't what I expected, but we took what we had and
did the best that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, 50, was selected because of the job he did in
leading the U.S. team to a bronze-medal finish in the 13th FIBA
Men's World Championship at Athens, Greece, last summer.
Tomjanovich accepted the job with the idea that he was supposed to
coach a team of NBA players, but the lockout resulted in NBA
players honoring a union request to not participate in the World
Championships until a new collective-bargaining agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich took a team composed of free agents, college and
Continental Basketball Association players, one many thought would
be quickly eliminated but instead worked its way through the field,
finishing 7-2 and defeating Greece 84-61 to capture the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were obviously a number of qualified candidates,'' said
Russ Granik, president of USA Basketball, ``but based on Rudy's
contributions to last summer's World Championship team, the
committee felt he was most deserving to coach this team in its
pursuit of an Olympic gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying tournament will be held July 14-25 at San Juan,
Puerto Rico. The USA men, gold medalists at the last two Olympic
Games, will play against 10 teams from North, South and Central
America. The top two finishers will earn a qualification spot for
the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The committee that selected Tomjanovich consisted of Rod Thorn,
a non-voting chairman, and 10 voting members _ seven NBA
appointees, one NCAA appointee and two former athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The seven NBA appointees are Wally Walker of the Seattle
SuperSonics, Wes Unseld of the Washington Wizards, Kevin McHale of
the Minnesota Timberwolves, Ernie Grunfeld of the New York Knicks,
John Gabriel of the Orlando Magic, Wayne Embry of the Cleveland
Cavaliers and C.M. Newton, athletic director at the University of
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Newton replaced Mike Dunleavy of the Portland Trail Blazers. The
NCAA appointee is Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. The two former athletes
are Billy King, now the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers,
and former Rockets player Clyde Drexler, now the men's basketball
coach at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also has arrived at a list of players it would
like on the Team USA roster and will formally contact those players
in the upcoming days. The team is expected to be composed primarily
of NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Some players aren't waiting to be asked. New Jersey's Jayson
Williams suggested that NBA players will go out of their way to
play even harder against the Rockets, hoping to impress
Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like an audition,'' Williams said before Thursday
night's game against the Rockets. ``Man, I'd love to play in the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich stressed that he does not pick the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, I never thought of that,'' said Tomjanovich, laughing.
``Please tell Jayson that I don't pick the team. Tell everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very experienced and talented committee makes those
selections. And I'm confident that they're not only going to have a
talented team but a team that will have chemistry. With strong
inside players, guys who can make outside shots and some
penetrating slashers.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to coach in the Olympics would help make up for
when Tomjanovich, then playing college ball at Michigan, was
overlooked for the 1968 Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in '68, I wasn't asked to try out for the Olympic Trials,
and it was something that hurt me,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I felt
that I was of the caliber to at least try out at that time, and
this has given me a second chance to get into that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ranks right up there with anything that I've done. The
opportunity to represent our country in international play is
something very special. I don't think Americans really get the feel
for how important these tournaments are internationally. They
really get a lot of interest and a lot of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's World Championship, in many countries, that was
bigger than the Olympics. But here's a situation where I feel a
great deal of responsibility in preparing this team and getting us
to qualify. So it's not only an honor but a tremendous
responsibility.''

FARNHAM GETS JUST DESSERTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sean Farnham was calm and collected as he strolled
to the pregame meal Wednesday afternoon. Three hours later, as his
second starting assignment of the season approached, Farnham was
more excited than a makeup salesperson at the Rodman household.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `It's USC and UCLA, and I'm about to start,'
'' Farnham said. ``Man, I was excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnham, a walk-on junior, channeled that energy into the most
effective game of his career: six points, two rebounds, two
assists, a blocked shot and a steal in a career-high 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him, it was difficult to envision the gangly freshman
who joined the Bruins in 1996. He played with smarts and controlled
energy _ the energy that UCLA lacked in its 18-point loss at Cal
last weekend, the energy Farnham displays in practice each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays like that all the time, and he was finally
rewarded,'' freshman forward Matt Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Farnham played for five minutes, rested, then returned with
10:15 left in the half to battle USC center Brian Scalabrine. It
wasn't a tolken start _ Farnham played throughout the game _ and
that meant as much as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how much I'd play,'' he said. ``My dad was
asking me if I was going to play for four minutes and come out, or
stay in. I played well enough that I ended up getting back in. It
was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeding stuff: If the NCAA Tournament began today, the Bruins
probably would be a No.5 seed based on their power rating (19) and
three losses in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   There's little difference between a No. 4 and 5 seed, since both
would have to play the top seed in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guess we're a 4 or 5 seed,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
``We could sink as low as 7 or 8, or climb back to 3 or 4. That's
another reason there has to be a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: UCLA outrebounded USC 40-35, the first time in
seven games the Bruins outrebounded their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Pine time to fine time: Barnes played his best game in months
Wednesday, with three rebounds in 11 minutes and smothering
second-half defense on Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Matt's best game in terms of energy and toughness,''
Lavin said. ``He brought the effort we've been asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and reserve forward Travis Reed have the smallest margin
for error among UCLA's regulars. If they do not produce quickly _
sometimes within 60 or 90 seconds _ they are abruptly replaced.
Fleeting appearances have a way of squashing confidence, especially
when freshmen and sophomores are involved.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavin let Barnes play through a mistake or two Wednesday,
and the result was Barnes' first impact performance since the Dec.
19 Cal State Northridge game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few games, I've been hesitating,'' Barnes said.
``Coach told me to look for my offense, and that helped. I tried to
be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go in the games, I have to produce. I don't have a
chance to get warm.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ When Roger Clemens said he wanted to move closer
to home, he meant it.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Toronto might be about the same distance from
Clemens' Memorial-area house, as the former Blue Jay flies. But at
least Clemens won't have to worry about packing his passport and
fussing with Customs on the commute.
</P>
<P>
   He is closer to home, indeed. He is in Yankees pinstripes. Home,
at last.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, we thought Clemens meant Houston when he talked
about coming home. We thought he meant plans for 20-minute drives
to the new Ballpark at Union Station, not four-hour flights from
LaGuardia. We thought he was talking about the city so nice it
names highways after favorite sons _ like the Nolan Ryan Expressway
_ not the city so nice they named it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Clemens is a devoted father who cherishes the time he
spends with his four K-kids. To see Clemens shooting baskets with
his kids, or roughhousing with them, it's clear Clemens wanted to
be close to his family year-round.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, home for this fierce pitcher had to be in
Yankees pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   His ferocious baseball personality, his huge talent and hunger
for a championship ring ultimately had to lead him to the Bronx, to
the jungle that is the most celebrated team in baseball. He had to
stand in the center of the Yankees' swirl, under the critical gaze
of owner George Steinbrenner, the demanding microscope of Yankees
fans and the focus of the media capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ruth and Reggie, Wade and Darryl, the Rocket's game and
demeanor were too big to ride out with middle-market teams and all
their nice media, comfortable suburbs and strict payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   But what you also should know about the trade that sent Clemens
to the Yankees on Thursday: The Astros demanded it, too. As
recently as two days ago, it was all but a done deal in the Blue
Jays' eyes. Clemens was going to be an Astro.
</P>
<P>
   He was going to play with his kids by day, toy with National
League batters by night. He was going to be the Final Ingredient to
an Astros pennant.
</P>
<P>
   After the long, bizarre trade negotiations _ the wild contract
demands, the miscommunication, the bad words _ emotions finally
settled. Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker dealt long and hard with the
Jays, and two offers that the Blue Jays liked were on the table.
</P>
<P>
   One of the offers involved outfielder Derek Bell, pitcher Scott
Elarton and a minor-leaguer. The other centered on Elarton and
three top minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But inevitably, Hunsicker and manager Larry Dierker hesitated.
They questioned the deal and talked about what they would lose by
trading Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker loves the command and control the 6-7, 240-pound kid
possesses. Only Thursday, as Elarton was breezing through the first
day of spring workouts, Dierker stood behind the 22-year-old and
heard Astros catchers kiddingly call Elarton ``Michelangelo,'' for
the way he paints corners of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker indicated throughout the trade talks that the two
players he did not want to lose were outfielder Richard Hidalgo and
Elarton _ the cornerstone of the club's future. Hunsicker meant it,
and Dierker could not agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle wanted him in the Randy Johnson deal, and we didn't do
it,'' Dierker said. ``We didn't do it for Clemens. It tells him
something about what we think of him and the expectations we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton's name was pulled out of the deal, all but sealing it
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's trade certainly clinched another World Series run for
the Yanks and finally gave Steinbrenner the player he has coveted
for years. For the Astros, a team without a bona fide ace, their
1999 fate is much less secure as they try to defend their NL
Central Division title and move deeper into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But there were several reasons the Astros were not emotionally
broken about not getting Clemens. The biggest was keeping Elarton,
but if this is going to be a hitting team like few others in
baseball, the Astros also wondered why they should get rid of a
proven slugger like Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Why tinker with the depth and explosiveness of Astros bats and
further slash the minor-league pool when that is what has carried
the team this far?
</P>
<P>
   Passing on the deal also gives the Astros a few months to see
how their staff works out with Elarton in the rotation, time to see
if Shane Reynolds will fit in as the ace, if Jose Lima will
continue his rise, if Chris Holt will come back strong from his
injury and if Sean Bergman will continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
   If the staff does not respond by midseason, there still will be
time before the trade deadline to acquire someone such as
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Elarton was called to the clubhouse. When he
walked into the meeting, he saw Hunsicker, Dierker and pitching
coach Vern Ruhle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious,'' Elarton said. ``They looked kind of happy.
But I didn't know if they were happy because I was leaving or
because I was staying.''
</P>
<P>
   They were happy because as Clemens finally found his home,
Elarton did, too.

unborn,'' Sen. Robert Smith returned Thursday to the high school
where he taught history three decades ago and stepped forward as
the first candidate to make a formal announcement of his campaign
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidacy of Smith, New Hampshire's senior senator, was
not widely welcomed by Republican leaders in the state. Although
his campaign gets under way with just the barest of public support,
they fear that if he begins running unexpectedly well here, other
contenders will be inclined to concede him a home-state advantage
in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary, do little stumping
here and so make the primary all but irrelevant to a nomination
that, they believe, he is unlikely to win.
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that his national ambitions had been
ridiculed by Republicans in his own state. But he predicted that he
would emerge from the pack, because, he said, he is the most
genuine, unabashed conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a leap-year conservative jumping out of the grass
every four years to say, `Here I am, I want to be president,'''
Smith declared to a cheering audience at Kingswood Regional High
School in this summer resort town in central New Hampshire. ``I've
been fighting day after day for the past 15 years in the United
States House and the Senate for the conservative values I believe
best represent New Hampshire. I might be a new face in this
presidential campaign, but I'm an old warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith invoked God and the Bible, and spoke most passionately of
three unswerving stands that have marked his tenure in Congress:
his support for a national anti-missile defense, his demand for a
full accounting of Americans missing in Vietnam (the senator, who
served with the Navy in Vietnam, heaped praise in his speech on
Eugene McDaniel, a former prisoner of war there who introduced him)
and his opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's goal is to protect all unborn children,'' Smith
asserted, drawing applause from an audience in which students far
outnumbered his adult supporters. ``As president, I will nominate
only pro-life justices to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Likening his intentions to Lincoln's freeing of the slaves, he
said, ``Abortion is the moral outrage of the 20th century, and I
will end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator dismissed Republicans who say the party should drop
President Clinton's impeachment as an issue, He condemned the
president for ``criminal behavior,'' offered himself as an official
of upstanding character and later said he viewed Clinton's ``in
your face'' visit to this state Thursday, less than a week after
his acquittal by the Senate, as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans perplexed by Smith's designs on the White House, and
their implications for the state's primary, recall that when, for
example, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa sought the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1992, most other democratic contenders stayed away
from the Iowa caucuses, which as a result carried little weight
that year.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Smith's quest has done little to discourage
prospective Republican opponents, perhaps because he barely
registers single digits in New Hampshire polls, in which he is
overwhelmed by George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. Smith referred to
both, and to Steve Forbes, only obliquely Thursday, saying, ``I
don't have a big name or a huge family trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith performed so weakly in winning re-election to the Senate
two years ago that network exit polls at one point declared him the
loser to his democratic opponent, former Rep. Dick Swett. Smith
ultimately won, with only 49 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now his presidential candidacy carries substantial risks to his
support at home. A humiliating showing in his own state would leave
him particularly vulnerable should he seek re-election to the
Senate in 2002: He could suffer a humiliating showing. Already, he
has irked some constituents who thinks he should be tending to the
state's business rather than seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Carney, a veteran Republican strategist in New Hampshire,
``noted that since 1960, every statewide elected official around
the country who had run for president, lost and then ran for
re-election to the lower post has done worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a presidential nomination, Carney noted, candidates
have to move further to the left or right and thus lose some of the
broader appeal that helped them get elected back home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview Thursday before his announcement why early
polls showed him badly lagging, Smith said: ``It's because I've
never run for president in my own state. What it says is I have not
run for president. These candidates are in here all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Bush and Mrs. Dole ahver barely set foot in the state's
snow-covered hamlets. And Smith could not explain why he was
scoring so low in plls here, when native sons customarily score
high.
</P>
<P>
   Although he plans a low-budget campaign, Smith has traveled the
country extensively in the last year (he tallies 42 days in Iowa).
He disputes speculation that he is running simply to advance his
views or to position himself for a cabinet job in a Republican
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be in this race if I wasn't intending to win New
Hampshire and Iowa and North Dakota,'' he said. ``There's no other
reason to get into this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A few presidential prospects have already formed exploratory
committees or, as in the case of Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, taken the further step of creating official
campaign committees. But with his appearance here Thursday, Smith
became the first to make the formal declaration.
</P>
<P>
   He thus set off what will be a succession of official candidate
announcement tours in the next few months, and will take his
fledgling tour to Iowa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While his speech dwelled on social issues, Smith also called for
an across-the-board 10 percent tax cut for all Americans, curbing
the federal government's involvement in education and supporting
the rights of gun owners. Presenting himself as a populist with
grassroots appeal, Smith said, ``You've heard of the country club
Republicans. Well, I'm a country music Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment that Smith may be trying to do the impossible came
across even in his rally. The trappings were there: the admiring
wife and children. The school band (playing ``Rocky'' at the
beginning and ``God Bless America'' at the end.) The American
Legion color guard.
</P>
<P>
   But in introducing Smith, Phil Decelle, who hired him to teach
and coach baseball here a quarter-century ago, mentioned the
naysayers. ``Maybe familiarity breeds a little bit of contempt,''
he said. ``Maybe, because he is so close to us, we can't see Smith
as president. I'd like to say I can see Smith as president.''

TRENT INSISTS MAVS MUST BE AGGRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mavericks forward Gary Trent, frustrated with
the club's losing streak that reached six games with a 101-88 loss
to the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, challenged his teammates to
become more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Mavericks display some aggression, they will be
battered on the boards, the referees won't give them a break and
victories will be difficult to come by, Trent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are known to be soft, and that's why \Rthe referees\S let
us get done like we do,'' Trent said. ``If we control the interior
of our defense and get physical and bump everybody that comes
through the lane ... and make everybody know that when you come
through the lane somebody is going to lay a forearm or bump you,
good things will happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent cited the New York Knicks as a team with a long-standing
reputation of being physical. That's the image he wants the
Mavericks to portray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks, even though they don't have that same physical
team that they used to have, they still get away with a lot of
bruising,'' Trent said. ``That's because that's what they're known
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent said he hopes his teammates heed his words, starting with
tonight's 9:30 game against Golden State (3-5) in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, who signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the
Mavericks on Jan. 23, has worked into shape and given the Mavericks
(1-7) a physical inside presence in the past two games. He scored
14 points, on 6-of-10 shooting, and grabbed five rebounds in 23
minutes during Monday's 99-84 loss at Portland. He scored a
team-high 15 points, on 7-of-14 shooting, and grabbed seven
rebounds in 23 minutes against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually he's better than I thought he was,'' Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``He is definitely a
pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to find ways to use him, because he's everything
that this team needs. He's a pretty darn intelligent player also,
and we need intelligent players out there, because we're making too
many bonehead errors.'' Mavericks reduce roster
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks placed guard Erick Strickland on the
injured-reserve list and waived guard Khalid Reeves, trimming their
active roster to 12 players.
</P>
<P>
   All NBA teams have until today to reduce their active rosters
from 14 to 12 players.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland strained his right groin when the Mavericks practiced
yesterday morning in Los Angeles. He is expected to be sidelined
two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland played in six of the Mavericks' eight games this
season, and averaged 4.2 points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.8 assists in
8.7 minutes. He made nine of 24 field-goal attempts (37.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he tried to trade Reeves but could find no takers.
Back in Oakland Just because the Mavericks' victory was against
Golden State doesn't mean win No. 2 will also be against the
Warriors. At least that's what the Mavericks are saying.
</P>
<P>
   The two clubs play tonight, and the fortunes of both teams have
changed since they last met. The Mavericks have lost six
consecutive games since the 102-99 double overtime victory over
Golden State, and the Warriors have won their past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play a whole lot better than we've played the
last couple of games if we expect to beat anybody on the road,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks guard Michael Finley added that the Warriors might be
seeking a little payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little revenge factor on their part, and
they're going to come up with some top-notch intensity,'' Finley
said. ``We just have to match their intensity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 19:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the trustees of Dartmouth College to improve
campus life by making fraternities and sororities substantially
coed and reining in alcohol abuse is perhaps surprising from an
institution where fraternities have been a tradition since the
1840s and whose frat parties inspired the movie ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   Piggish behavior has been tamped down in recent decades, but the
Dartmouth trustees are steering in the right direction when they
question the role of fraternities as a means of social
organization. Their move ought to inspire leaders at other colleges
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The very selectiveness of the Greek houses is what makes them
desirable to students who naturally crave a sense of belonging. But
that exclusivity often works against efforts by college
administrators to create an inclusive atmosphere for all students.
</P>
<P>
   At their worst, fraternities and sororities perpetuate social
cliques. Their unsupervised parties can encourage excessive
drinking. They may intensify fragmentation of the student body into
ethnic and income groups. On smaller campuses, they can dominate
social life so completely that there are limited options for
socializing outside of the frat-sponsored mixer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dartmouth faculty recommended in 1978 that fraternities and
sororities be abolished, believing that they fostered
anti-intellectualism and sexism. A more recent report from the
college's committee on diversity and community leveled similar
criticisms. There has been continuing concern that the system
creates a climate at odds with the college's academic mission. But
the trustees are also aware that they cannot simply abandon the
Greek system without replacing it with new types of housing and
student gathering spots. They say they are prepared to make the
necessary investments.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges, including Dartmouth, have long relied on
fraternities and sororities, despite their flaws, to provide
students with social activities and opportunities for friendship
and emotional support. Many Dartmouth students support the Greek
system because there is little else available. Reducing the role of
Greek houses means college administrators will have to shoulder
more responsibility for meeting the social needs of their students.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Designers find inspiration in the darnedest places.
Movies watched on an airplane. Ski slopes. Art books. Children
playing. Any place or anything that sparks an image that lends
itself to translation into clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The fall collection Anna Sui showed on Wednesday evening had its
genesis in flea markets, where she saw Danish modern furniture and
Marimekko dresses. That led her, she said, to think about the early
1960s, the period between Beatnik and Hippie when young people were
flocking to folk festivals to hear singers like Bob Dylan and Judy
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started listening to early Dylan for an element of cool,''
she said before the show, ``and I invented this girl going to folk
festivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sprouse, on the other hand, found his muse on Mars,
specifically the pictures sent back from the Pathfinder landing in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Italy that summer,'' he recalled Thursday, ``when
they were sending back the images from Mars and I stayed up all
night to see them on television. I've been into the rover and Mars
thing ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last August, National Geographic printed stereoscopic
pictures from the landing and supplied 3-D glasses for viewing
them. Sprouse said he was looking for an idea to follow up his Andy
Warhol theme of last year's show, and decided that that was it.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained images from NASA and permission to reproduce them.
Working on a computer, he developed prints for fabric and had them
produced in nylon, wool and silk.
</P>
<P>
   He then tried looking at the patterns through 3-D glasses and
got the same effect as looking at the magazine pages. So he
supplied the glasses to the audience on Wednesday night, and they
were able to see three-dimensional versions of the dusty,
rock-strewn landscape of Mars, complete with multiples of the
six-wheel rover, on dresses, coats and pants.
</P>
<P>
   To heighten the space age effect, he outfitted models with body
computers, complete with headphones holding miniature monitors
hooked up by wires to keypads worn on the wrist. ``So you can walk
down the street surfing the Internet,'' Sprouse said.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the world is equipped with 3-D glasses by fall, the
clothes will have to stand on their own when worn off the runway.
The patterns are certainly bold enough in the reds, greens, russets
and black tones of the NASA photographs. And Sprouse has always
been adept at cut, so his fans will be able to add new tailored
coats with Velcro closings, short shift dresses, hip-slung pants
and sexy evening dresses that shimmer with the blues and pinks of a
Martian sky.
</P>
<P>
   Sprouse has been on and off the runways sporadically in recent
years, so it was good to have his strong vision back to inject some
vitality into what has been a rather calm season so far.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing futuristic about Ms. Sui's folkies, who took
to the runway in black and white grid and chain prints, giant
Marimekko circles, ombre mohairs in blues and reds, afghan knits,
ribbon-trimmed suedes, and intarsias of turquoise and blue or
orange and pink suggested by Scandinavian fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   They wore long skirts and dangling earrings, had triangular
peasant scarves tied in back under long straight hair, and carried
guitars or guitar-shaped bags. On the backdrop, Murray Lerner's
documentary ``Festival,'' about the Newport Folk Festival, was
screened, recreating for a modern audience the seemingly innocent,
pre-Woodstock days, yet setting the scene for the next phase in
music by capturing the moment when Bob Dylan went electric.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of Ms. Sui's most wearable collections, but it
lacked the spark of sex and even danger that her best shows have
had.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Sui's sensibility reflects pop culture, designers like
Linda Allard of Ellen Tracy, Jill Stuart and Susan Lazar look to
the women who wear their clothes. Reality, not fantasy or
role-playing, defines their approach.
</P>
<P>
   With Ellen Tracy celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, Ms.
Allard said she looked to the company's past and then stripped away
the details to come up with pure, pared-down designs. But she upped
the luxury by using double-faced flannel, shearling, leather,
Shetland wool, alpaca, hand-knit cashmeres and satin.
</P>
<P>
   Unstructured jackets and coats had collarless necklines that
closed with snaps or not at all. Many tops were cropped to bare a
sliver of skin over hip-slung pants or long evening skirts. For
day, skirts hovered safely in the area of the knee. Colors were
soft and pretty in shades of pumpkin, sage, lemon, sky blue, mauve,
rose and green.
</P>
<P>
   The sportswear attitude continued into evening, with pants or
long skirts of satin or feather-light alpaca topped by camisoles,
tanks and cardigans enlivened with discreet beading.
</P>
<P>
   With seeming effortlessness, Ms. Allard captured the way the
average woman with a healthy interest in fashion would like to
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Stuart concentrated on a youthful style epitomized by
smocking on nearly sheer mohair or silk, bib-front dresses that
bared the back, skinny pants in glittery materials, and coats with
thonglike ties placed high under the bosom.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lazar also focused on a high waistline, sometimes
accenting it with obi wrapping. She also showed long skirts wrapped
to the back or the side, hand-knit sweater coats, and unexpected
touches of beading, on one shoulder, say, or under one arm. Like
Ms. Stuart, she showed perfectly nice clothes but nothing to shake
up the status quo.

MODANO'S OFF-NIGHT NOTHING MORE, COACH SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock cringes when he hears even the
slightest hint of an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Stars coach said yesterday that Mike Modano's excuse of
being tired in a poor performance against the Florida Panthers on
Wednesday night was acceptable, as far as he was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one guy that you have to cut a little slack,''
Hitchcock said. ``He comes in and works hard every game. For him to
be off one night is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 19 minutes, 20 seconds of ice time, Modano had no shots and
four giveaways and was on the ice for the only goal-against in a
2-1 victory against the Panthers. Afterward, he said he felt
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad overall game for our whole line,'' Modano
said. ``That's as worse as I've felt in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Modano said he doesn't expect any lingering effects when the
Stars play host to the Chicago Blackhawks tonight, beginning
another stretch of four games in six nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually bounce back from a night like that,'' Modano said.
``Sometimes, it takes a night like that to really refocus you on
what made you successful before.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hitchcock said Modano has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' leading scorer with 55 points in 52 games, Modano is
second on the team in plus-minus at plus 19, and ranks third in the
NHL in game-winning points at 13. For the past three seasons, he
has been the team's go-to guy on offense and its top checking
center, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask a lot of him, but that's because he can do it,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Craig Ludwig said the expectations can be suffocating
at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys think he can play 82 games the way he does. There
ain't nobody who can play 82 games like that,'' Ludwig said.
``There's pressure, but he handles it as well as anybody, that's
why they're paying him $45 million. Look, he's going to get tired
just like everyone else, and I'd rather have him tired now than in
May. He's one guy we're not worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he expects the pressure, but he adds the pressure
for his line increases in home games. For one, Hitchcock can wait
until the visiting coach puts his players on the ice, so he can
better match Modano and linemates Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen
against the opposing team's top scorers. On the road, opposing
coaches look to keep their top scorers away from Modano. As a
result, Modano has scored 32 points on the road and 23 at home.
He's also a plus 11 on the road and a plus 8 at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some pressure there to perform. Our line is depended
upon to check and defend and score,'' Modano said. ``First and
foremost, we've got to go out against their best lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, there's a lot of pressure to check them and then turn
around and score at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the top line has done just that. Before
Wednesday's meltdown, Modano, Hull and Lehtinen had scored goals in
10 of the previous 11 games. Over that stretch, Hull had nine goals
and five assists, Modano had three goals and 11 assists and
Lehtinen had three goals and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   But with five of the next six games at Reunion Arena over a span
of 10 days, is there any worry Modano could burn out?
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually responds as well as anyone after he has a bad game.
I don't think it will be a problem.'' Hitchcock said. ``The thing
about the last game is that for whatever problems he had
offensively, he still was out there at the end of the game making
big plays on defense. His offense might go at times, but he has
become the type of player that his defense is there every night.''

TEXAS CONSIDERS DRUMMING UP MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old-timers, though I don't necessarily like that term, still
refer it as the Super Drum. Or just the Drum.
</P>
<P>
   And after 22 years as the home to men's and women's basketball
teams at the University of Texas, the Frank Erwin Center has yet to
show its age like some of us have who were around for the first
game in 1977. Once the crown jewel of Southwest Conference arenas,
it yet ranks among the upper echelon in the Big 12 and, for its
size (16,175), holds up well nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But from an athletic-department point of view, things might be
better. And that's why Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds has
initiated discussions within the university system that could lead
to the multipurpose arena becoming an athletic-department entity.
</P>
<P>
   The Erwin Center operates as an ``auxiliary enterprise'' under
the university umbrella, with its own staff, and reports to the UT
office of business affairs. The UT athletic department pay
approximately $100,000 yearly in rent for games, practices and
other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast and consider, for instance, that Texas Tech's income
from 22 luxury suites in its new United Spirit Arena figures to be
in excess of $500,000 annually. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   What Dodds pictures is at least a closer association between the
athletic department and the Erwin Center _ which could in turn lead
to things like marketing consolidation, income-generating luxury
suites and other niceties in keeping with the recent and ongoing
$90 million worth of athletic facility improvements.
</P>
<P>
   As I understand it, there are a number of things to be resolved
before such a thing could take place. Dodds indicates a decision
regarding even the feasibility of the idea could be a month _ or
more _ away.
</P>
<P>
   But athletic-department officials have already visited Ohio
State's new Schottenstein Center _ a 19,500-seat facility that has
52 luxury suites that go for between $45,000 and $65,000 with
commitments for five, seven and nine years. They also will look at
Nevada-Las Vegas' plans to renovate the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center and
explore how other facilities around the country are operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call them fact-finding expeditions,'' said Chris Plonsky,
associate athletic director for external services and one of three
department staffers who are involved. ``We did the same thing when
we were talking about redoing \RRoyal Memorial\S stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all on an information-exchange level right now,
nothing more. And there is no chance that this would happen unless
it were mutually beneficial for the Erwin Center, the university
and the athletic department.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting idea. And one whose time may have come.
QUICK HITS WATCHING WAGNER
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of winning the Big 12 title and a postseason push for
Texas men might ride on the tenuous condition of point guard Ivan
Wagner's left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The knee, from which about 50 pieces of floating cartilage were
removed during the off-season, locked up during Saturday's practice
at Oklahoma State. Yet, Wagner continues to play on and well _ as
evidenced by his defensive performance Wednesday in holding Texas
Tech's Rayford Young to 10 points four days after he scored 41
against Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bothering me, but I want to try and play through it,''
Wagner said. ``We've got some goals we're so close to
accomplishing; I want to be a part of it. I just try to ignore the
pain that shoots through it sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Barnes says, ``There's no one on our team any
tougher.''
SHOOTING STARS
</P>
<P>
   Figure this. Oklahoma is the league's most prolific 3-point
shooting team _ even thoughthis is Kelvin Sampson's worst-shooting
(.430) and lowest-scoring squad (71.5) at OU and the player who
figured to be the best long-range shooter (guard Kelley Newton) is
a medical redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   OU has made 209 3-pointers in conference games. Colorado is next
at 175.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we recruited these guys, they couldn't shoot a lick,''
Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks, the Sooners do a great job getting shots
off screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the system, but give the kids
credit,'' Sampson said. ``They work at it. ... and some of them
have some been good shooters for long time.''
ARE THEY BACK?
</P>
<P>
   With a strong second half of the Big 12 season, the Texas women
just might have played themselves into contention for an NCAA
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has won six of eight, including three in a row, over Texas
Tech, Oklahoma State and Missouri. At 8-5, the Longhorns have
remaining home games against Texas A&AMP;M and Baylor before finishing
at Tech. Winning two of three puts them at 10-6 and 16-10. A win in
the Big 12 tournament and Texas could be back in the NCAA
Tournament after missing last season for only the second time in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' UT coach Jody Conradt hedged. ``I hate to look
ahead with this team, but we have played pretty well lately. We've
still got a long way to go in this conference race, which is not
showing any signs of loosening up any.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest RPI from ``College Basketball News'' ranks Texas
53rd.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA Tournament selectors use the Rating Percentage Index _
derived from a team's Division I winning percentage, its schedule
strength and its opponent's schedule strength _ to supplement the
selection of at-large teams.
</P>
<P>
   Other Big 12 teams in the top 64 include Texas Tech (No. 6),
Iowa State (No. 11), Nebraska (No. 40) and surprising Oklahoma (No.
57). At this stage, OU coach Sherri Coale gets my vote for women's
coach of the year.
NEBRASKA CENTER IN ELITE COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Nebraska coach Danny Nee if he has just about run out of
razzle-dazzle adjectives to describe senior center Venson Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just really, really good,'' Nee said most recently.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take Nee's word for it, even though Hamilton had led the
Cornhuskers from an 0-2 Big 12 start into the thick of the
conference race. Look at numbers, if that's your game.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Hamilton became the first Cornhusker and only
the fourth player among players from Big 12 schools to score 1,000
points, pull down 1,000 rebounds and block 200 shots in a career.
Hamilton has 1,296 points, 1,017 rebounds and 224 blocked shots..
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches started talking to me about it last year,''
Hamilton said. ``But I wasn't really thinking about it until I
started getting close. Then, I really started striving for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has also thrust himself into contention for player of
the year. His 14 double-doubles lead all Big 12 players this season
and he has 11 of those in his past 14 games. Interestingly, he also
ranks fourth in Nebraska career steals and had a career-high six
assists in Nebraska's victory at Missouri two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In conference games, Hamilton averages 17.5 points, 11.0
rebounds and a league-high 2.7 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me is his consistency,'' Nee said.
``He's a natural rebounder and the most consistent player we have.
He's played himself into a special group of players. If those
figures aren't MVP stats, I don't know what is.''

ROGAN BACK HOME TO FIGHT IMPEACHMENT BACKLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Transformed overnight from a freshman
congressman into a national political star, Rep. James E. Rogan
came home Thursday for the political fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing his Los Angeles-area district, Rogan _ targeted
for political extinction by Democrats and hailed as a hero by
Republicans _ was in a feisty mood, ready to confront questions
about his role as House prosecutor in the impeachment trial of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full day back home after the trial, Rogan preached
against drugs to schoolchildren, reassured South Pasadena residents
about a proposed freeway, kibbitzed with high-tech business and
academic leaders, and glad-handed with the Republican Party
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   He received a standing ovation Thursday night from a gathering
of about 150 Republicans celebrating Lincoln's birthday at the
Oakmont Country Club in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never walk away from a fight,'' Rogan said earlier in the
day, noting that he's the only one of the 13 House managers from a
swing district and that Democrats have made him a prime target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear that bull's eye proudly. If standing up for what I
think is right, standing up to protect sexual harassment laws,
makes me a bull's eye to the Democrats, then I think they've got a
lot of explaining to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, 41, who barely won a second term in November with 50.7
percent of the vote, started the day at Mark Keppel Elementary
School in Glendale by warning fifth-graders about the dangers of
drugs. Police security was heavy because of an anonymous threat.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke later to the Technolink Association of business,
academic and high-tech industry leaders at the California Institute
of Technology and then went to South Pasadena where he visited a
historic area slated to be demolished for the Long Beach Freeway
extension.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted residents warmly, recalling names, kissing and
hugging the elderly ladies who led the battle and inviting
neighborhood kids to come visit him in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home. These folks know me,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Moore, a 40-year-old Democrat from Pasadena who attended
the chat, admitted she and many others in her city disagreed with
Rogan on impeachment. But she'll support him anyhow because he's
helping locals fight against the freeway extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to do what he believes in,'' Moore said. ``We support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan will need voters like Moore come Election Day in November
2000. While other house managers come from safe Republican
districts, Democrats seeking revenge for impeachment have made
Rogan a top target for the 2000 elections in part because his
district is moderate, has more Democrats than Republicans and
supported Clinton in both 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political action committees have been formed to start
raising money now and Hollywood heavyweights like television
producer Norman Lear and entertainment mogul David Geffen have
pledged their support to bounce Rogan from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually look forward finding the Democrat who wants to run
for my seat who says the values of those (Hollywood) people are the
values of our constituents because they are not,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan knows impeachment wasn't popular but those who are writing
his political obituary aren't aware of the strong bond with his
constituents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel like Mark Twain when he said, Reports of my death
have been greatly exaggerated. A lot of people who are licking
their chops now about me don't understand the political dynamics of
this district,'' said Rogan, a former Glendale Municipal Court
judge and assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In polls voters always say they want politicians who follow
their conscience. That will be the big test in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said Hollywood has targeted him before and that in
November he beat ``one of their own,'' former Screen Actors Guild
President Barry Gordon. While many high-profile actors and
producers may be at the ``left end of the political spectrum,''
Rogan insisted that most of the studios are actually run by
Republicans and said Hollywood has no better friend in Congress
than him.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Wingard, a regional director of the California
Democratic Party, said Rogan's conduct on impeachment brought him
``out of the closet as an ultraconservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden he's going to focus on the district, which is
something he hasn't done. Now that he's got some national
recognition he's back to mend fences in the district,'' Wingard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wingard said local Democrats already are gearing up for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally we wouldn't have started this soon. We feel it's
within our grasp to take the seat,'' Wingard said. ``There are
people all over the county who want to get Jim Rogan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said his new visibility takes getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of it as much as my wife is,'' he said. ``We'll
be at a restaurant and she'll say, Did you see how many people were
looking at you?''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was a grueling experience for him with frequent late
nights, many lasting until 5 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over. I'm not far away from it enough yet where
I can sort out my philosophical and historical perspective on it,''
Rogan said. ``Everyone is still trying to take a step or two back
from it.''

RICH AND THE RUTHLESS: YANKEES PULL A FAST ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours ago, the Rangers were privately celebrating in
the executive wing of Arlington ballyard offices.
</P>
<P>
   They had him. They had Roger Clemens. The trade with Toronto
appeared signed, sealed, and . . .
</P>
<P>
   The delivery, of course, never happened.
</P>
<P>
   The long New York arm of Boss George suddenly reached out and
snatched away Clemens at the last second.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, after the bombshell deal of Clemens to the Yankees
was announced, disappointment flowed freely from the lips of
general manager Doug Melvin and owner Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been led to believe Roger really wanted to play for the
Rangers,'' Hicks said. ``We bent over backward to make a deal, and
frankly, as of Wednesday afternoon, thought we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Melvin was told by Toronto GM Gord Ash that the deal
with the Rangers was 90 percent certain. Ash advised Melvin he had
one more phone call to make _ to the Yankees on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, I phoned \RYankees GM\S Brian Cashman and asked
if he was involved in the Clemens thing,'' Melvin said. ``Brian
told me there was no involvement, and wouldn't be. But he did add
all this could change if his owner \RGeorge Steinbrenner\S began to
worry about us or the Indians getting Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   One very small consolation is involved for the local baseball
club.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Yankees, or at least George Steinbrenner, feared the
Rangers if they had Clemens. Ain't that a hoot? Wednesday night,
Steinbrenner ordered his postseason pitching hero, David Wells,
included in the Toronto package. He did so to keep Clemens away
from Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin: ``I do know this much _ when Toronto started talking
with the Yankees \RWednesday night\S there was no way David Wells
was included in anything the Yankees offered. Gord Ash made that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the debate rage locally _ why didn't the Rangers not include
enough to counter the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   The trade Toronto was set to make with the Rangers centered on a
package headed by super prospect Ruben Mateo, the outfielder slated
for Triple-A duty in Oklahoma City this season.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Melvin nor Hicks discussed the players the Rangers
were offering, other voices confirmed Mateo as the main attraction
for the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not giving up any of our starters to make the trade,''
Hicks said. ``But what we had offered, Toronto really liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Steinbrenner roared into the picture. In young Homer Bush,
the Blue Jays think they have solved their second-base vacancy.
Left-hander Graeme Lloyd also filled a glaring bullpen need. But
the deal with New York totally centered on what starting pitcher
the Yankees would part with. Wells, frankly, was a shocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My disappointment at the moment would be a lot worse if they
had gotten Clemens for something like El Duque \ROrlando
Hernandez\S,'' Melvin said. ``Put in Wells, however, and that's
hard for any team to counter.''
</P>
<P>
   From Hicks: ``The Yankees were the only team in baseball that
could give up that much and still have Roger approve the deal.
Roger was only going where he thinks he can win a ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Wells, the Rangers would have had to include pitcher
Rick Helling, along with Mateo and something else, to approach the
New York offer.
</P>
<P>
   This closes the debate on how far should the Rangers have gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the newspapers, Rusty's \RGreer\S name had come up for
Clemens, so even did Pudge \RRodriguez\S and Helling,'' Hicks said.
``But like we were told early on by Clemens' people, if we had to
trade Pudge, Rusty or Helling, then Clemens wouldn't want to be
here. Lose any of them, and even with Roger, could we win? I doubt
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly without Helling, winning would have been very
doubtful. He had to be the No. 2 starter behind Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   After Steinbrenner ordered Wells inserted in the deal, Clemens
had the right to veto his trade to New York. Another disappointment
for the Rangers was he immediately OK'd it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple. Clemens thought he had a better chance to win
with the Yankees,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   But it's also interesting that Steinbrenner traded a very good
pitcher for a great pitcher in a defensive move to shut off the
Rangers. The Yankees' rotation is now better, but by how much?
</P>
<P>
   And Hicks, a businessman who doesn't exactly warm to finishing
second, did so again, as with Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let's just keep working hard,'' Hicks noted, ``to build the
kind of team depth the Yankees have. Then we can answer these kind
of moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, a longtime friend of Ash's, added: ``Two years from now
I think Gord will wish he had taken our deal. But for now, he got
what he wanted in Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   All because Boss George provided what the Rangers couldn't. The
rich and ruthless win again.

ELS WINS MATCH-PLAY PREVIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ernie Els defeated Paul Azinger 3 and 1 Thursday
to advance to the second round of the World Golf Championship. Wait
a minute, that was Riviera Country Club the twosome was playing,
not La Costa, and Brandel Chamblee was their playing partner, not a
member of the ESPN on-course reporting crew.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Coincidental?
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, it was an honest mistake. Els, No.7 in the official
world golf rankings, will go against No.58 Azinger on Wednesday on
the first day of the inaugural match-play event that will award $1
million to the sole survivor in the field of 64.
</P>
<P>
   Els is among 35 players who qualified for the La Costa event who
are using the Nissan Open to spit-and-polish their games. Even
though, truth to tell, using stroke play to get ready for match
play is like reading comic books to prepare for the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger had to be glad this was but a practice test. Els trumped
Azinger's birdie on the par-5 opening hole with an eagle and
finished par-birdie-birdie to Azinger's bogey-par-bogey to card a
3-under-par 68 to Azinger's 72.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making an early exit, Azinger is afforded an early
(7:27) rematch, if you will, today with Els (and let us not forget
Chamblee, who carded a 74).
</P>
<P>
   Before teeing off, Els and Azinger poked fun at their pairing.
``We kind of made a joke about it,'' Els said. ``He said he's going
to check my game out and I said I'm going to check his game out.''
</P>
<P>
   The pleasantries ended as soon as their first round began. On
the back nine especially, smiles and small talk between Els and
Azinger were as rare as birdies. While Els could be heard
acknowledging a good putt by Azinger here and a nice drive by
Azinger there, his praise was not roundly reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
   As Els retrieved his ball from the 17th hole to warm applause
after draining a 10-foot putt, Azinger seemed inordinately
interested in a speck of dirt or a wrinkle or something on the
crease of his black pants.
</P>
<P>
   He did shake Els' hand before bolting past the outstretched arms
of autograph seekers and disappearing up the hill. If gamesmanship
got the best of Azinger's graciousness, Els professed not to notice
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's a great guy,'' Els said after signing some two dozen
caps, programs and pieces of paper that were thrust in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   So is Els, though Angelenos can be forgiven for not knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Penn shows his face in L.A. more often than the affable
South African, who has graced the PGA Tour stop here only once
before in his six years as a PGA Tour semi-regular.
</P>
<P>
   He typically has joined the U.S. circuit during its Florida
swing in March. The California gold rush of 1999, though, turned
him into yet another prospector, heading west.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I haven't ever started (on the PGA Tour) early,''
Els said. ``The tournament next week changed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A million-dollar pot of gold might have altered Els' schedule,
but it hasn't changed his priorities. He continues to gear his game
toward the four majors, starting with the Masters the first week of
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're playing a major,'' Els said, when asked if
he is aiming to peak next week. ``It's a big-money event, but the
majors matter more (to him), absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   If Thursday's scores were any indication, the games of many of
the match-play participants are in as good shape as Riviera's
greens. David Duval and Bob Estes shared the first-round lead at
66, and two other players headed to La Costa, Loren Roberts and
Nick Price, were among the top seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd prefer to have a good week going into it,'' Duval said
in his typically understated way.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Swede Robert Karlsson, who's simply trying to
salvage something from an exhausting journey that took him from
Dubai to L.A. via Singapore. Karlsson, a European Tour regular, is
making his first appearance here and his sixth on the PGA Tour. He
gained entree to the field because his No.66 world ranking at the
start of last week boded well for his securing the final qualifying
spot for the Match Play World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   That was before he missed the cut at the Dubai Classic and David
Toms didn't finish high enough at the concurrent PGA event in San
Diego and all the other dominoes fell wrong for him.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson isn't exactly an unknown quantity - he finished 11th on
the European Tour money list last year. But he has a ways to go to
build a name for himself here. The back of his caddy's bib read
``Karisson.''
</P>
<P>
   That was par for the course, as was his first-round score of 71.
Who knows? By the end of next week, more than a few strange names
might become familiar.

YANKED AWAY: RANGERS OUTBID FOR CLEMENS BY NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Rangers had their hands on pitcher Roger
Clemens, only to be blindsided by the New York Yankees and owner
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stepped in yesterday and acquired Clemens from the
Toronto Blue Jays for pitchers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and
second baseman Homer Bush. The Rangers had all but closed a deal
with the Blue Jays on Wednesday that would have brought Clemens to
Arlington for a package of minor-league prospects headed by
outfielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   But Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash made one more phone call
and got a better offer from the Yankees. The deal came two weeks
after Yankees general manager Brian Cashman told the Rangers he
wouldn't pursue Clemens unless pushed by Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for New York as it is for the Yankees,''
Steinbrenner said at the team's spring training complex. ``Two
years ago we tried to get Clemens \Ras a free agent\S, and we
didn't get it done. I don't like to lose out, especially on a guy
like Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner admitted the Yankees were motivated by the fear
Clemens would end up pitching for the Rangers or the Cleveland
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned where Roger is going to show up,''
Steinbrenner said. ``I was. I gave thought to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who demanded Toronto trade him after last season, could
have vetoed the deal according to his agreement with the Blue Jays
and instead gone to the Rangers. He lives outside Houston and has
long expressed a desire to pitch in Texas, either with the Rangers
or the Houston Astros. But he accepted this trade immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elated to get a second chance to go to the Yankees,''
Clemens said. ``I'm still catching my breath. I'm happy to be in
the American League. I know all the players and the umpires and I
hope this is where \Rmy career\S winds up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said he was disappointed the
deal wasn't done, especially because he was led to believe Clemens'
first choice was to pitch in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most disappointed in that,'' Melvin said. ``You hear from
players and agents that a guy wants to go to a certain place, like
Roger wanting to stay here in Texas. Then you work hard to make it
happen, and it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he was told Wednesday the deal was 90 percent done.
Ash told the Yankees he had another deal for Clemens and asked them
if they wanted one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard what the Blue Jays wanted, my knees buckled,''
Cashman said. ``It was a tough call but when you have a
Clemens-caliber pitcher staring you in the face, you have to make
the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, was 20-6 with a 2.65 earned-run average for the
Blue Jays last year, earning his second consecutive Cy Young Award
and the fifth of his career. He joins a team that won an American
League-record 114 games last season and its second World Series
title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clemens brings to the table is pretty impressive,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Not that \RWells\S doesn't, but
what Clemens has accomplished in his career is long and
considerable. He gives you the kind of guy who can dominate a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we better? I don't know. But I still like the idea of
putting him down there and having him pitch for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Yankees took the news with mixed emotions. Wells was a big
factor in the Yankees' success last year, going 18-4 with a 3.49
ERA. He pitched a perfect game during the regular season, started
the All-Star Game and won three games in the playoffs. He was also
one of the Yankees' emotional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It floored me,'' Yankees pitcher David Cone said. ``It stunned
me. Boomer was a cult figure in New York. This is the only trade
you could have made to send Wells away. I'm sure there will be some
mixed emotions. He was amazingly popular. But once Rocket throws
his first 15-strikeout game at Yankee Stadium, people will be
oohing and aahing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, whose career began with the Blue Jays, left the Yankees'
clubhouse without speaking to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be extremely despondent,'' said Cone, who was planning
to join Wells for a few beers last night. ``He loved being a
Yankee. He was proud of what we did last year. This was probably
the toughest day of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has two years left on the four-year contract he signed
with the Blue Jays before the 1997 season. He will be paid $8
million this year and $8.1 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clemens was traded while under a multiyear contract, he
could demand to be traded at the end of the season. But Clemens
said he doesn't foresee that. Steinbrenner said the Yankees will
likely talk to agents Alan and Randy Hendricks about a contract
extension, but it wasn't a prerequisite for him agreeing to the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll be talking over the next year,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``I think Roger will pitch four or five more years of top
baseball. He's a great competitor.''

RENO CONSIDERING HANDING OVER INQUIRY ON STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 5th graf to clarify.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department is considering whether to
appoint a special investigative prosecutor to conduct its inquiry
into charges of possible misconduct by Kenneth Starr, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One specific proposal discussed in recent days is the
appointment of a U.S. attorney, possibly one with solid Republican
credentials, who would supervise a team of Justice Department
prosecutors and FBI agents, said the officials who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who is traveling in South
Africa, has not reached any decision on the matter, the officials
said. But in recent days her aides have weighed a variety of
options should the attorney general choose to take the
investigation of the independent counsel away from the Office of
Professional Responsibility, the Justice Department's in-house
ethics unit.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will focus on whether Starr's prosecutors
improperly coerced witnesses like Monica Lewinsky, disclosed grand
jury secrets to the news media and withheld possible conflicts of
interest from Justice Department lawyers at the outset of the
Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions at the Justice Department come in response to a
recent exchange of rancorous correspondence between department
officials and lawyers in Starr's office. In a letter to Ms. Reno
late last week, Starr criticized what he regarded as unauthorized
disclosures to news organizations about the Justice Department's
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also suggested that the Justice Department could not be
trusted to conduct an unbiased inquiry, the officials said. On
Thursday, Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, would not discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the officials said, favors an alternate approach that
would shift the inquiry beyond Ms. Reno's direct control. Starr
prefers the appointment of a lawyer from outside the Justice
Department with broad legal experience, someone agreed upon by Ms.
Reno and Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One person mentioned by Starr as the kind of candidate with the
stature to carry out such an inquiry was former Attorney General
Griffin Bell, who served under President Jimmy Carter and is 80
years old. A representative of Bel said Thursday that he was
traveling and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have also expressed reservations about whether
the Office of Professional Responsibility should supervise the
inquiry. Last Friday, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, questioned the impartiality of the office, one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general,
Hatch expressed dismay at news articles about the inquiry into
Starr's conduct in the Lewinsky matter, the officials said, adding
that Hatch suggested that the Justice Department consider
alternatives to allowing their office to carry out the
investigation. Justice Department officials would not comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should Ms. Reno ultimately refer the matter to an outside
counsel, it would symbolically bring the Whitewater investigation
full circle. Depending on the precise powers granted to such a
counsel, Starr and his prosecutors could be forced to submit to the
kind of intense scrutiny that Starr has trained on President
Clinton and White House aides since August 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unclear how much authority would be granted to an
outside counsel. There is no provision in the law that permits Ms.
Reno to seek an independent counsel to investigate Starr's
operation. But Justice Department officials have concluded that
under Ms. Reno's statutory authority, she could appoint a
prosecutor with the same power that an independent counsel has to
convene grand juries and compel testimony under oath.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that the inquiry, as currently
envisioned, would more likely be administrative rather than
criminal. As such, the maximum penalties if wrongdoing is found
would probably amount to no more than reprimands, suspensions or
dismissals, rather than felony or misdemeanor charges.
Nevertheless, the lawyer who leads the inquiry would almost
certainly ask Starr's prosecutors to turn over highly sensitive
information about how they investigated the president.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether an attorney general has the authority to
investigate an independent counsel remains unresolved. There is no
language in the statute that even addresses how an independent
counsel would be investigated. Under the law, the attorney general
is given the sole authority to determine whether to remove an
independent counsel. But Ms. Reno's aides and Starr's prosecutors
have argued for months over whether that responsibility also gives
her the inherent power to investigate him. This unsettled debate
has stalled the Justice Department inquiry of Starr's office, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 provides for
the appointment of an independent counsel if there are specific
criminal accusations against any individual among about two dozen
officials who qualify as ``covered officials'' in the Executive
Branch, like the president and vice president. Independent counsels
are not among the officials designated as ``covered'' by the law.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the officials said, the deliberations at the Justice
Department to move the inquiry beyond the direct control of the
attorney general are an attempt to address Starr's concerns that
the Justice Department cannot conduct an impartial inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In his complaint letter to the Justice Department last week,
Starr objected to news reports that disclosed the scope of the
internal inquiry and the long-running conflict between the
independent counsel's office and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Ms. Reno has named senior prosecutors to handle
difficult cases. She selected Michael R. Stiles, the top federal
prosecutor in Philadelphia, to head an inquiry into the 1992 Ruby
Ridge standoff in Idaho. And in 1997, she selected Charles G. La
Bella, a senior federal prosecutor in San Diego, to investigate
campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a prosecutor with Republican credentials late in the
second term of a Democratic president's second term could be
difficult. One person mentioned as a possible candidate is Robert
Mueller, the acting U.S. attorney in San Francisco. Mueller, who
headed the Justice Department's criminal division during the Bush
administration, said Thursday that he had heard nothing about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   At Starr's office, prosecutors remain highly suspicious of Ms.
Reno, associates of Starr said. They challenged the timing of the
Justice Department inquiry, saying that it surfaced shortly before
the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, at a time when Starr appeared
to be politically vulnerable. And they argue that some of the
allegations have been known publicly for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   One associate of Starr recently called the Justice Department
investigation ``politically motivated'' and wondered aloud whether
an aggressive investigation that targeted Starr had been quietly
encouraged by a vengeful White House. Several weeks ago, another
associate of Starr predicted that ``the heat would be turned up''
on the office after the Senate acquitted the president.

AN INVITATION LIST IS NOT A GUEST LIST 
NO. 1 RUN OR NONE 
OFF THE MARKET

   NEW YORK _ What if they gave an awards benefit and none of the
A-list award-winners came?
</P>
<P>
   If not for the singer known as Jewel, it would have happened at
the Time for Peace Award dinner Thursday night. Steven Spielberg,
Robin Williams, Tracy Chapman, Joan Baez and Mary J. Blige were all
no-shows, even though their names had been listed prominently on
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the winners plan their lives so far in advance that they
already had other engagements for Thursday night on the calendar
when they were notified months ago that the Time for Peace
committee had chosen them. Even Jewel was a question mark: She
rushed to the $1,000-a-person dinner, at the Manhattan Center on
West 34th St. near Eighth Ave., after taping ``Late Show With David
Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for Peace was following a time-honored strategy of trying
to draw a large paying crowd by inviting a handful of well-known
people. And Time for Peace was hardly the first benefit to have to
cope with celebrities' jam-packed schedules.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening-night party for the Winter Antiques Show last
month, &UR;  &LR; Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was nowhere to be seen, though her
name had been at the top of the invitation, in larger letters than
anyone else's. (Her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., dropped by for a
little while.)
</P>
<P>
   Anne Fuchs, a senior vice president and publishing director at
Hearst magazines, may have solved the celebrity no-show problem.
She is one of the heads of Bright Nights at the Whitney Museum next
month. It will honor no one at all.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Run or None &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If nothing else, Steve Forbes is focused. He spent _
appropriately enough _ Presidents Day weekend closeted with his
family, discussing the pros and cons of running for president
again.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg will not run for a fifth term
in 2000 did not prompt Forbes _ the millionaire publisher and
flat-tax fan of the 1996 presidential campaign _ to schedule
another get-together to discuss the pros and cons of running for
Lautenberg's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he chooses to run, he will run for the presidency,'' Bill
Dal Col, Forbes' top strategist, said. ``That's a decision he has
yet to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the Market &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is a postscript to all the talk that Hillary
Rodham Clinton was buying an apartment on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan: A contract for the $1.295 million apartment that the
real estate grapevine had her purchasing is in the hands of a
would-be buyer. Would that be Mrs. Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not,'' said the broker who listed the apartment, Jeff
Rothstein. ``I wish it was. That would be great. I'm sure the
building would love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Creme de la Creme &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eric Clapton plans to auction several guitars at
Christie's in June to raise money for his drug and alcohol
rehabilitation clinic in Antigua. But his most famous guitar will
apparently not be on the block.
</P>
<P>
   That instrument is in the hands of musician Todd Rundgren, who
performed with Ringo Starr at the Beacon Theater this week.
</P>
<P>
   This raises two questions: How did Rundgren come to have
Clapton's guitar, and why is it so special?
</P>
<P>
   To answer the second question first, it was originally George
Harrison's guitar when the Beatles were still appearing together.
Eventually, Harrison gave it to Clapton, who played it when he was
with Cream, the blues-jazz-rock fusion group that was inducted into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When Cream disbanded, Clapton lent the guitar to the singer and
songwriter Jackie Lomax. Rundgren bought the guitar from him in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Rundgren said that Clapton had contacted him about including the
instrument in the auction. Rundgren said he had told him that it
was spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   But if that deal falls through, Rundgren said he might give it
to Clapton ``out of a sense of karma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' he added, ``I've owned it longer than Eric Clapton
did and I've played it longer than he did.'' &QL;

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Right-hander Roger Clemens drew the ire
of Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, whose attempts to acquire
the five-time Cy Young Award winner nearly reached fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who requested Dec. 2 that the Toronto Blue Jays trade
him to a contender or an organization closer to his Houston-area
home, witnessed the realization of his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash, who despite a proposal from
the Rangers involving minor-league center fielder Ruben Mateo as
the centerpiece, traded Clemens to the New York Yankees yesterday
for left-handers David Wells and Graeme Lloyd and second baseman
Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays required Clemens' consent to consummate any trade,
and the 36-year-old right-hander would have been traded to the
Rangers had he vetoed yesterday's trade to the Yankees, Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most disappointed in the fact that I hear from the player
and his agents that he wants to stay at home and in the American
League to pitch,'' Melvin said. ``So, you work ... thinking it's
going to happen _ and then it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call his agents and ask, `Hey, what the heck is
happening here? I thought he wanted to play in Texas?' This was a
case here where he thought he had a better chance to win with the
Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clemens nor his representatives, Alan and Randy
Hendricks, could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, the Rangers' No. 1 prospect, served as the centerpiece of
Melvin's proposal, which also included left-hander Eric Gunderson,
major-league officials said. Melvin only confirmed that the
Rangers' proposal included three players and an undisclosed amount
of cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' proposal, though, did not include left fielder
Rusty Greer or catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our package, we keep all of our starters and add Roger,''
Rangers owner Tom Hicks said. ``I was looking forward to what was
going to happen in September and October.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of parting with Mateo did not sit well with some
members of the organization, and the Rangers' proposal put a ``knot
in my stomach,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough deal for us to do,'' Melvin said. ``We were not
all in agreement on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Melvin and Ash reached a tentative agreement
Wednesday, but the latter promised to listen to the Yankees' final
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas really wanted this,'' Ash said. ``They tried, and they
tried very hard. They came up with a lot of creative proposals, and
they came up with what I thought was a very good offer this week.
It was more for the future, and given the state of our team now, we
needed to bridge the gap from the present to the future right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's trade signaled the Rangers' second failure in as
many attempts this winter to acquire a dominant No. 1 starter.
Left-hander Randy Johnson spurned the Rangers' four-year contract
offer worth $50 million and signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks on
Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like 90 percent of our off-season was spent on trying
to acquire a No. 1 starting pitcher,'' Melvin said. ``We're very
fortunate that we were able to improve our club and get done what
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash placed a 10 p.m. phone call to Melvin's Southlake residence
Wednesday to inform him that the Yankees' offer appeared more
attractive. Melvin, though, was en route to Port Charlotte and did
not arrive here until 2 a.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ash spoke to Melvin's wife, who relayed the message to her
husband early yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellen put one other player in the deal,'' Melvin said, ``but
she couldn't get it done, either.''
RANGERS NOTES
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not expect catcher Ivan Rodriguez in camp for
today's first scheduled workout for pitchers and catchers. The
recent American Airlines pilots' sickout likely will delay
Rodriguez's arrival from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin spoke yesterday with minor-league outfielder Ricky
Williams, who might not report to camp. The former University of
Texas running back and Heisman Trophy winner remains interested in
reporting, but the two parties did not reach a resolution. Melvin
expects to discuss the matter with Williams again within the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed left-hander Matt Perisho and Rob Sasser to
one-year contracts worth the major-league minimum $200,000. Perisho
and Sasser will earn $1,098.90 per day while on the 25-man roster.
Right-handers Danny Patterson, Al Levine and Dan Kolb, catcher
Cesar King and Mateo remain the Rangers' only unsigned players.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who injured his right hamstring in November while playing
winter ball for Escogido of the Dominican Republic, participated in
yesterday's first minor-league workout along with 41 others. Mateo
will continue to do so until the Rangers' first full-squad
major-league workout Feb. 25.

DUVAL, ESTES TIE FOR NISSAN LEAD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Duval, ranked No. 2 in the world, rallied
late. Top-ranked Tiger Woods stayed within range, as usual. And
Texas tour veteran Bob Estes showed he, too, might challenge in the
Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who shot a tour-record-equaling 13-under-par 59 in his
last tournament round in California, said he was ``absolutely''
satisfied with the 5-under 66 he shot Thursday, when he tied Estes
for the first-round lead with a birdie on the par-5 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially,'' said afternoon starter Duval, ``when I started
out and saw such good scores in the morning. I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's five-birdie, bogeyless round caught near-day-long leader
Estes, who finished with seven birdies and two bogeys after an 8:21
a.m. start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot a good score today, but I had a few too many loose,
sloppy shots,'' said Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Both enter cut day a stroke ahead of Loren Roberts, Nick Price
and Kirk Triplett, all tied at 67. Fifteen others, including
two-time Nissan champion Fred Couples, were tied at 68. Another 17
players, including Woods, were at 69 at the conclusion of a cool
and overcast opening round.
</P>
<P>
   The long-hitting Woods, who shot a Torrey Pines course-record 62
in winning the Buick Invitational last week, finished with three
birdies, just one on Riviera's three par-5 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, in the pack at 68, said success at Riviera was a
matter of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overpower the course, so you have to be patient,''
he said. ``The course tempts you, on holes like No. 10 (a 315-yard
par-4), but you have to stay patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kelly, a former high school hockey star, took the first
lead of the tournament at 3-under-par 68. He was elated at his
chance finally to earn a paycheck at Riviera, should he remain in
the top half of the field today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold this course in high esteem,'' Kelly said. ``It hasn't
been good to me _ I've never made the cut here, (but) it's my
favorite course on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly even liked the chilly temperature, which didn't rise much
above 60 degrees all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this weather,'' he said. ``I'm from Wisconsin. I didn't
even think about a jacket today.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts reached the top of the leaderboard next, including
five birdies in a gloomy morning round of 67 and promptly
proclaiming Riviera ripe for scoring. The damp weather, he said,
helped keep drives in the fairways and approach shots on the
greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got some room to drive the ball today,'' said Roberts,
who took advantage with ``one of my better ball-striking rounds of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Price and Triplett (a sizzling front nine of 31) joined Roberts
atop the field at 67 before Estes roared home at 66, his
5-under-par performance the residue of a recent switch to a
stronger grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had one of the best short games out here,'' Estes
said. ``but until my ball-striking gets tighter and stronger and
straighter, I'm not gonna do as well as I want to do and I'm not
gonna to be winning the tournaments I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the grip change was prompted by watching players like
Woods, Duval and Justin Leonard, a former British Open champion who
shot 70 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all got something in common,'' Estes said, reasoning
``maybe it's something you ought to be working into your own
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But even striking for seven birdies with the stronger grip the
didn't totally please the former University of Texas star, who
followed previous Longhorns Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw onto the tour
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing good,'' Estes said. ``I've been shooting
plenty of good scores. But I've got a long way to go to get up
there with the guys I don't have to name.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those unnamed appeared primed to yank the lead away from
Estes early. Duval, who earned $1 million in winning his first two
starts this year, struck for back-to-back birdies Thursday
afternoon on holes Nos.6 and 7 to get to 3 under par at 4-under
with seven holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't catch Estes until the 17th hole, but neither did the
world's No.2-ranked player put himself in much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only chance I had to make bogey was on the 14th hole when
I rolled my first putt seven feet past,'' Duval said. ``Other than
that, I didn't come close.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's enjoying the run which has produced nine victories
in his last 30 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning on this going on for a long time, myself,'' he
said. ``I don't think I'm doing anything beyond my capabilities.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a Madison Avenue version of a fairy tale:
Snogilvy White and the Seven Dwarfs. But will there be the
requisite happy ending or a Grimm one?
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual experiment, a giant agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather North
America, will affiliate with seven independent shops that are small
in size _ their combined billings are not even 5 percent of Ogilvy
North America's _ but loom large in creative abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy North America in New York, part of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC, is forming a consortium with the
seven so-called hot shops to collaborate on campaigns for present
clients as well as seek new business.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, called the Syndicate, is to function as a
secondary network for Ogilvy North America, meant to complement its
work with Ogilvy &AMP; Mather sibling agencies. The collaborators, to
be compensated with retainers and other nonequity investments, are:
Core in St. Louis; Grant, Scott &AMP; Hurley in San Francisco; Hunt
Adkins in Minneapolis; Pyro in Dallas; Vitro Robertson in San
Diego; Wong Doody in Seattle and Los Angeles, and Work in Richmond,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative aspects of the fledgling venture were underscored
by Rick Boyko, president and chief creative officer at Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather, who, when asked questions about procedural matters, replied
with a smile, ``We're making it up sort of as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   And the consortium is fraught with risk. Will small shops
accustomed to avid competition against big ones _ and each other _
be able to cooperate effectively? Will clients of the small
agencies be miffed as they pronounce themselves ready for prime
time? Will the copywriters and art directors on the Ogilvy North
America payroll perceive the Syndicate as a sinister slight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's talk among the junior and midlevel
employees,'' said Tro Piliguian, president at Ogilvy North America.
``There will be angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the North American Creative Council has known about,
discussed and embraced this,'' he added, referring to a group of
senior executives, ``which should make it a lot more palatable and
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the Syndicate is emblematic of efforts by
industry stalwarts like Ogilvy &AMP; Mather to confront the challenges
posed by the growing propensity of blue-chip corporations to shun
the formidable infrastructures and bureaucracies of traditional
agencies when they seek solutions to marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from smaller, nimbler, more entrepreneurial shops,
as well as from alternative sources of advice like management
consultants, has taken its toll on conventional big agencies as
free-spending advertisers like Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola and
Unilever search outside that realm for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ogilvy has a heritage and legacy of innovation and a belief in
the creative product,'' said Rick Boyko, president and chief
creative officer at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. ``We're always looking for
ways to find and work with the best talent we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us access to talent we've never had the opportunity
to tap into before, and gives them access to a large, multinational
agency with services like media and interactive they would not
normally be able to get to.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Wong, the outspoken chairman at Wong Doody who once worked
for Ogilvy North America, echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This affords us the opportunity to use Ogilvy as much as they
use us,'' he said, ``to squeeze every red drop of blood out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That jocular remark was indicative of the tone of a boisterous
breakfast Thursday at the midtown Manhattan headquarters of Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather, where reporters learned details of the consortium.
Attendees included Piliguian, Boyko, Wong and principals of the
other six small shops.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been, to paraphrase a remark made by President John
F. Kennedy to a group of Nobel laureates visiting the White House,
the most extraordinary collection of creative talent that has ever
been gathered together at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather with the possible
exception of when David Ogilvy dined alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great respect for all the agencies involved,'' said
Scott Aal, principal and co-creative director at Grant, Scott.
</P>
<P>
   And Wong said: ``If we don't know each other, we do know of each
other. You're always watching agencies of similar size if what
they're doing is interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven small shops have agreed to approach Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
first if they ever decide to sell. But the principals emphasized
their belief that the partnership would not mean surrendering their
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ogilvy's made it very clear they're buying into this because
of what we are: independent, fiercely independent,'' said Patrick
Hunt, president at Hunt Adkins.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wong said, if ``Sorrell writes us a check for $100
million, we're acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to Martin Sorrell, chief executive at WPP,
which has been much less active than its primary competitors like
the Interpublic Group of Companies and Omnicom Group in acquiring
shops like the Syndicate seven.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the biggest Omnicom agencies _ BBDO Worldwide, DDB
Needham Worldwide and TBWA Worldwide _ can cooperate with creative
shops that are also owned by Omnicom like GSD&AMP;M in Austin, Tex.;
Martin/Williams in Minneapolis, and Merkley Newman Harty in New
York. WPP once owned some creative hot shops, including the Martin
Agency in Richmond, Va., but sold those interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been in the works for 15 months,'' Piliguian said,
``since Rick Boyko seeded the idea in my head. I thought he was
crazy, but after reflecting a day I realized it was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not unlike what Katharine Hepburn once said about
the benefits of pairing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers: he gave her
class and she gave him sex. Here, Ogilvy North America is Astaire
and the small agencies are Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   As they dance together, the question is whether they are dancing
in the dark (though Astaire danced to that tune with Cyd Charisse).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the small agencies since it's a regular source
of income,'' said Paul Cappelli, president and creative director at
the Ad Store in New York, a small creative shop that is a peer of
the seven Syndicate members. ``And it's good for Ogilvy because
it's the way big agencies should structure themselves in the
future, with satellites supplying creative work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's better if you own the satellites,'' he added,
``because what's to keep an Ogilvy client from going directly to
one of the creative shops? And this doesn't address the problem of
the bureaucracy inside the big agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a behemoth agency, Ogilvy North America deserves
points for a willingness to try something unconventional. There are
several cooperative associations of small and midsized independent
agencies like the Advertising Marketing International Network, but
a dedicated teaming of small shops with a single mammoth one
appears innovative.
</P>
<P>
   And the Syndicate could develop into a promising attempt at
formalizing and solidifying relationships that have become
increasingly common between agencies large and small, as the big
shops hire the small ones on a freelance or project basis for
short-term assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how it's going to work,'' Wong said. ``That's
part of the fun.''

HILLARY CLINTON AND HER ADVISER TEST THE WATERS ON SENATE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped up her efforts Thursday toward a
run for the U.S. Senate from New York as her political adviser
contacted a wide range of union leaders and campaign consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is to discuss her possible race at the White House
Friday with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who is retiring
from the seat in 2000. Next week, Mrs. Clinton is expected to meet
with John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, and other labor
leaders. She is planning several trips to New York over the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ickes, Mrs. Clinton's political adviser and a veteran of
New York politics, said he has discussed Mrs. Clinton's potential
race with the campaign consultant David Doak, of Doak, Carrier &AMP;
O'Donnell, who is an old friend of Mrs. Clinton's and was the media
adviser in David Dinkins' two New York City mayoral campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes said he also talked this week to the campaign consultant
Bill Carrick of Morris, Carrick &AMP; Guma. Carrick has worked for Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and is a partner of Hank Morris, who
was the media consultant last year in Charles Schumer's successful
U.S. Senate campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes also spoke this week about Mrs. Clinton's potential
campaign to Sandra Feldman, the president of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly be delighted to see her run for the Senate in
New York,'' Ms. Feldman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the teachers would be very happy,'' she said. ``She
knows education. She has been a good friend for many years. I think
there would be a lot of enthusiasm for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ickes is to return to Washington late Friday and expects to
begin calling county leaders in the state on Mrs. Clinton's behalf
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said on Tuesday that she was giving ``careful
thought'' to a Senate race and would make up her mind ``later this
year'' _ a timetable that irked many New York Democrats because it
makes it difficult for other candidates to raise the $10 million to
$20 million needed for the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton's advisers said she needed the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to drag this out, and she wants to come to a
decision as quickly as possible,'' said one adviser. ``But she
doesn't want to be stampeded.''

NEW YORK LOTTERY TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With revenues stagnating, New York state
officials are adopting the biggest changes in the lottery in years,
increasing the number of prizes but making it even more difficult
to win the Lotto jackpot and effectively raising the price of a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes, a customer with a dollar will soon be able to
buy only one Lotto number instead of two, as is now the case. The
changes also mean that a person's chance of hitting the Lotto
jackpot will decrease from 1 in 13 million, to 1 in 18 million,
odds that lottery experts say are among the most difficult in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials said, the number and size of the
smaller cash prizes in the Lotto game will increase.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as the New York State Lottery faces increased
competition from a growing number of casinos and the multistate
Powerball lottery that provides bigger payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, New York lottery sales were $3.8 billion last year,
down 4 percent from the year before. The state's profit, after
administrative costs and prize payoffs, was $1.3 billion, down $63
million, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Perlee, the director of the New York State Lottery, said
the changes had been largely prompted by concerns from Lotto
customers, who complained that the game's nonjackpot prizes were
too small and too few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been made loud and clear to us that people are willing
to have a longer shot at the jackpot if we can deliver them a
better chance at winning second, third and fourth prizes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's lottery was started in the early 1970s. The state
keeps 45 percent of the sales from the lottery as revenue, which
state officials say is earmarked for education. Forty percent is
paid out in prizes, and the remainder is used to pay for
administration.
</P>
<P>
   New York's lottery has a number of different games, including
instant-win scratch-off games and daily numbers with relatively
small payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the high-stakes Lotto games that have become the
biggest revenue producers because the payoffs can grow into the
millions with increased numbers of players. For Lotto, sales were
$745 million last year, down 14.4 percent. The profit on that was
$335 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the changes to Lotto, which will take effect next month,
the total weekly payoff will not change _ starting at $3 million
for the Wednesday drawing and $4 million for the Saturday drawing,
and increasing if no one wins the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes mean that winning the jackpot will be harder
than ever. The odds were already longer than in neighboring states
like New Jersey, where the odds of hitting the state's Pick 6
jackpot are one in 9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But to sweeten the Lotto pot, New York officials are increasing
the number of secondary prizes that are handed out, as well as
decreasing the odds of winning those prizes. They are also planning
to hand out bigger payments for those prizes. In effect, they say
they are revamping the weekly payoffs so that more money goes to
the lesser prizes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, second prize could total as much as $25,000 under
the new rules, compared with the $3,000 that Lotto now pays out.

COLUMN: IF SENATE RACE SIZZLE FIZZLES: LEWINSKY FOR CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The political buzz of the week, of course, was all
about Hillary Rodham Clinton and whether she will move to New York
to take on big, bad Rudolph W. Giuliani in next year's race for
U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   You can already see the drool on the collective media lip. Don't
be surprised if you read tabloid headlines blaring ``Beauty and the
Beast'' in World War III type, with The Daily News and The New York
Post arguing editorially over which is which.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the most exciting local battle since the 1971
Ali-Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden never takes place? New
York politics in 2000 would have all the fizz of a college lecture
on urban planning in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   So here's an alternative to keep the political fires crackling:
</P>
<P>
   Monica S. Lewinsky for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and laugh, but some political scientists and
strategists are saying, Why not? They think she could put up a good
fight running in, say, the district of Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney,
which lies mostly on the East Side of Manhattan, or in the
Westchester-Queens district of Nita M. Lowey. Both congresswomen
have been mentioned as possible Senate candidates if Mrs. Clinton
sits out the race.
</P>
<P>
   Should either give up her seat, Ms. Lewinsky, 25 and thus
constitutionally eligible for the House, could slide right in. What
has she looked for since leaving the White House if not a good New
York job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a job where I feel challenged, engaged and
interested,'' she wrote to President Clinton in 1997. Congresswoman
would surely fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Ms. Lewinsky already spends a lot of time in the
city, and she would start out way ahead of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually have to spend half your money to build name
recognition,'' said Norman Adler, a New York political consultant.
``She wouldn't have to spend a penny. She's photogenic. And what
can you say to attack her that everybody doesn't already know?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped testimony at the
Senate impeachment trial this month could see that she had been
unfairly typecast throughout 1998. She was no Valley Girl ditz. She
came across instead as mature, well-spoken, savvy about the law and
more than a match for the House prosecutor who was questioning her.
(Not that that was necessarily an Olympian feat, some would say.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows how to handle herself, and she's connected to the
three kinds of people you have to know: politicians, the media and
the legal community,'' said Mitchell Moss, a political scientist at
New York University. ``If you can master those three, you can be
elected in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age when people are famous simply for being famous, who
can top Monica Lewinsky? That can be a strong political asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all celebrity,'' said George Arzt, a public relations
consultant to New York politicians. ``Geraldine Ferraro ran as a
celebrity. She didn't run with any record on anything. She was a TV
star.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Ms. Ferraro went down in flames in the Senate race last
year, but there is no reason to assume Ms. Lewinsky would, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll get a break,'' Adler said. Moss, citing the violent
offenders and recovering drug addicts who dot the lineups of local
sports teams, added, ``New York is a city of second chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, he said, might find her a sympathetic figure, a young
woman treated badly by both the president and his Republican
pursuers. For fellow Generation X-ers, who thus far have shown
meager interest in politics, she could be a role model for getting
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Lewinsky may have more to offer than celebrity
status. Remember the Starr report's revelation that she had sent
the president her thoughts on education reform? Wouldn't you want
to hear what she has to say about charter schools in New York? None
of the consultants suggested that a congressional race would be a
cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious pitfalls. Ms. Lewinsky would be well-advised,
given the associations that could be made, to avoid campaign stops
near pizza parlors or Gap stores. She shouldn't even think about
Lucianne Goldberg as her communications director.
</P>
<P>
   But victory is within reach, and it could be a great thing for a
woman who must have had it up to here with the limelight. In New
York, if you want to stay out of the newspapers and off television,
you can't do much better than to be in Congress. &QL;

GOOD DEEDS HONOR FATHER'S MEMORY

(EDS, Dennis McCarthy is a columnist with the Daily News)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lesson Jim Bachelis wanted his young children
to learn someday was simple: Be a good person, help others, make
your daddy proud.
</P>
<P>
   It was late on a Saturday afternoon early last year when Wendy
Bachelis called her children, Lauren and Brett, into her bedroom to
share his teaching.
</P>
<P>
   All the literature she had read and all the experts she had
talked to said this was the best time. Late afternoon, not at night
when it might be too close to their bedtimes.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want them having bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her children weren't supposed to be seeing this videotape that
their father had made for them six months before he died, the young
widow knew.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband wanted her to wait until the kids were older and
could handle it better. But Jim had been wrong about that, Wendy
now knew.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who had died of cancer at 41 only a month earlier,
hadn't taken into account how quickly even young kids grow up when
they're forced to.
</P>
<P>
   How they'd be struggling with his death and desperately needed
something tangible to reach out and touch _ something to hold on
to, even if it was only a videotape.
</P>
<P>
   No, it couldn't wait, Wendy knew. Her kids needed their father's
words right now.
</P>
<P>
   She drove over to the bank, got the tape out of the safe deposit
box, and drove home _ waiting until late afternoon to show it
because that was the right time.
</P>
<P>
   She called her children into her bedroom and asked them to join
her up on her king-size bed. She had something she wanted them to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy hit the remote control play button and closed her eyes.
The voice and face of Jim Bachelis came through the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in a park, smiling and looking healthy, telling
his kids, one last time, how much he loved them.
</P>
<P>
   Telling them that life was a precious thing not to be wasted, so
don't _ especially on tears.
</P>
<P>
   Be happy and like yourself, their father said. Be a good person
and contribute to society. Get involved in charity work. Do all
that and they would make their daddy very proud of them, Jim
Bachelis told his kids.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, the tape went blank, and the emotion drained
out of them. Wendy hugged her kids, and they all shared one last
good cry together.
</P>
<P>
   Then they talked about how lucky they were to have had a
wonderful man like this in their lives, even if it was for too
short a time.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a month, Lauren said, there were no bad
dreams after falling asleep that night. Her dad wouldn't allow
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted me to be a good, strong person, and that's
what I was going to be,'' the 9-year-old girl said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Bachelis stood holding her 5-year-old son's hand at the
finish line of the pre-Los Angeles Marathon ``Torch Run'' in
downtown Los Angeles last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Valentine's Day. Perfect day for a kid to pay back some
love and promises.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance they could both make out the little figure of a
girl carrying a torch for the charity she was representing _ Our
House.
</P>
<P>
   It's a West Los Angeles nonprofit agency where children who have
lost a parent or sibling come to lean on each other and work
through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   It is where Lauren came, and where she was chosen recently as
the child to represent Our House in the Valentine's Day ``Torch
Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's arms were dead tired from holding up this torch on the
mile stretch of her run, but she wasn't about to let her dad down.
</P>
<P>
   This one was for him. The torch remained high.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came across the finish line, and you could just see her
adrenalin was pumping,'' Wendy said. ``She was so happy and felt so
good about herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran up to me and said, `Daddy would be proud of me,
wouldn't he, Mom?' I told her he would be very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   She got home Thursday from Bay Laurel Elementary School in the
L.A. suburb of Calabasas, where her family now lives, and began
walking through her new neighborhood knocking on doors.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Marathon is coming up next month, and she is one of 26
kids from Our House who will run a mile each to raise funds for the
charity, which is one of 46 charities taking part in the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Would they like to sponsor her with a donation, Lauren asked the
people who answered their doors?
</P>
<P>
   Be a good person and contribute to society, her father said. Get
involved in charity work.
</P>
<P>
   Do all that, and you will make your daddy very proud.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bachelis has to be busting with pride right now.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in sponsoring Lauren in the marathon can make
a pledge in her name by calling Our House at (310) 475-0299.

SPANIARDS HOLDING FIRM ON SIZABLE INVESTMENTS IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spanish companies that invested heavily last
year in Brazil insist they are not having second thoughts because
of its financial crisis, and several have turned it to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run telecommunications giant Telefonica, for example,
gained $1 billion on Brazil's currency devaluation in January. And
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's second-largest bank as measured by
assets, acquired the troubled Banco Excel-Economico in August for
one Brazilian real while agreeing to invest $820 million to bring
it back to health with the aid of government concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bet we made on Brazil is a long-term bet,'' said Francisco
Blanco, Telefonica's director of investor relations, echoing a
policy heard in other Spanish board rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica agreed to pay $6 billion last July for the largest
piece of Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA, known as Telebras,
Brazil's telephone system, when the government auctioned it off.
But after the real was devalued in January, Telefonica saved $1
billion on the deal through the early redemption of bonds
denominated in dollars that it had encouraged the Brazilian
government to issue last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, potential investors think twice about investing in
Brazil,'' Blanco said. ``So we are gaining position.''
</P>
<P>
   But not without some pain. Telefonica's share price has declined
8 percent since last July, and Standard &AMP; Poor's slightly lowered
the company's long-term rating in November because of increased
exposure in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   After the devaluation of the real last month, share prices also
dipped for Banco Bilbao and Banco Santander, Spain's largest bank,
which bought Brazil's Banco Noroeste for $756 million last year.
Standard &AMP; Poor's placed Banco Bilbao on credit watch last month
because of its exposure in emerging markets, including Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But the buying spree by Telefonica and the two big Spanish banks
in Brazil came after they spent several years investing heavily in
banks and telecommunications in Argentina, Chile and Peru. The
companies say Brazil's growth potential is too important to ignore
despite the current financial instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil accounts for about half of Latin America's gross
domestic product,'' said Jose Sevilla, Banco Bilbao's financial
director for Latin America. ``We have a project to build franchises
in Latin America to combine the advantages of global and local
banking. Brazil is part of our overall strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Spanish companies are following. Endesa, Spain's largest
electric utility, paid about $400 million last year for key stakes
in Coelce, an electricity distributor serving the area around the
northeast port of Fortaleza, and in the Cien consortium, which will
supply Brazil with electricity from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Endesa's director of affiliated companies, Alberto Lopez, said
the company made the relatively small investments to better
position itself for the privatization of Brazil's electricity
generation network, which is expected within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Iberdrola, Spain's second-largest utility, invested about $1
billion in electricity and gas distributors in Brazil in 1997,
mainly in Bahia state, but last year it focused on
telecommunications there, part of the company's diversification
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Iberdrola bid $769 million in the privatization of Telebras,
following Telefonica's lead but buying smaller stakes in several of
the same Brazilian phone companies, like the fixed-line provider
Telesp, which serves the Sao Paulo region.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco of Telefonica said the backlog of 5.5 million clients who
want phone lines in Sao Paulo was so large that ``even in a
recession scenario, it's not enough to rethink the capital
expenditure program.''
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica plans to install two million lines in Sao Paulo this
year, though Blanco said that the poor economy in Brazil could
prompt some people on the waiting list to delay their requests.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica and other Spanish companies in Brazil ``are seeing
that the capacity of the market outweighs the risks. Even in the
most pessimistic scenario, they would keep earning money,'' said
Jose Luis Perez, a managing partner of KPMG Peat Marwick in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is where Spain considers it has a competitive
advantage,'' said Fernando Fernandez, head of research for Banco
Central Hispano, Spain's third-largest bank, which agreed last
month to a stock swap sale to Banco Santander.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic position in Brazil will be maintained,''
Fernandez said. ``There's no way they'll pull out.'' &QL;

 MERGER ADVISER BUYS A BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, the merger adviser Eric J. Gleacher is striking out
on his own. This time, he is severing ties with National
Westminster Bank, Britain's third largest, which bought his merger
boutique in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gleacher, who used to head the mergers and acquisitions practice
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. before striking out on his own
in 1990, said he and his colleagues were taking the business he
sold to National Westminster for $135 million private in April. The
Bank of Scotland will own 9.9 percent of the new firm, to be named
Gleacher &AMP; Co. He will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, it didn't make sense for NatWest and ourselves
to stay together,'' Gleacher said. ``So instead of being a small
part of a large organization, we decided to take it over.''
</P>
<P>
   National Westminster ran into problems in 1997 when it racked up
huge losses in its derivatives and equities businesses. As a
result, it sold off most of those concerns. That left Gleacher's
operation a stand-alone without the high-yield finance business he
needed to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Gleacher said he and his employees would continue to focus on
mergers and acquisitions advice and the high-yield finance
business, among other things. &QL;

DERBY OFFERING NEW BETTING TWIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The terms ``future book'' and ``winter book'' have long been
part of horse racing's lexicon. But now the concept has a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs kicked off its Kentucky Derby Future Wager
yesterday at simulcast sites nationwide, including Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie. Similar to early betting that has been offered by
Nevada casino racebooks for years, the Future Wager gives fans an
opportunity to lock in a win bet at higher odds on Derby
contenders, while assuming the risk that the 3-year-old might
suffer an injury or attack of slowfootedness that keeps him out of
the Derby starting gate altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The new twist is that Churchill Downs is offering the Future
Wager as a pari-mutuel pool, in which odds are set based on the
money wagered on each horse.
</P>
<P>
   Future Wager betting on 23 designated Triple Crown nominees will
continue through 3:30 p.m. (CST) on Sunday, at which time official
odds will be calculated for each horse. For the uninitiated, it
works like this: if a Future Wager is made on filly Excellent
Meeting and her final odds for this weekend's pool are announced
Sunday at 12-to-1, the ticket holder will get those odds even if
Excellent Meeting beats the boys in the May 1 Kentucky Derby at
3-to-1 odds. If she doesn't run in the Derby at all, or loses, the
ticket holder is out the amount of his bet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't like the 23 entrees on the Future Wager menu can
order ala carte by selecting a popular option: No. 24 for ``all
other 3-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Future Wager will return March 11-14 (Pool Two) and April
8-11 (Pool Three) with an updated list of contenders and odds. In
other words, it is possible that bettors favoring Excellent Meeting
could buy separate tickets on her at 12-to-1 odds in Pool One,
8-to-1 in Pool Two and 5-to-1 in Pool Three.
</P>
<P>
   The Future Wager is providing greater access to early Derby
bets, but for those planning a trip to Las Vegas or who have
contacts there, futures odds at racebooks can be more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a late-developing 3-year-old at Oaklawn Park might
be listed at 100-to-1 or more at some racebooks. But if he isn't on
the 23-horse Future Wager list, he will grouped in the ``all
others` category at single-digit odds, hardly a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The ``all others'' was established as the early-program
favorite, and for good reason. If this wager had been offered in
previous years, Derby winners such as Grindstone (1996), Lil E. Tee
(1992), Strike The Gold (1991) _ and possibly Winning Colors (1988)
and last year's Real Quiet _ likely wouldn't have made future-book
radar screens in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   KRONE REGAINS WINNING FORM
</P>
<P>
   According to press clippings, jockey Julie Krone entered the
Fair Grounds season suffering from a confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
   You would never know it now.
</P>
<P>
   The country's all-time leading female jockey won five races
Tuesday, including the 3,500th winner of her career. In her first
season at the New Orleans track, she is riding in such
extraordinary form the past two weeks that she even appears to be
improving the performance levels of her mounts. She has regularly
been bringing home long shots as well as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Krone endured a career's worth of injuries the past
five years, including a knee fracture before this Fair Grounds
season. The repeated misfortunes affected her performance in the
saddle, and at one point, she says she even saw a psychiatrist in
an attempt to regain her bearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anybody that's been watching her ride would agree that her
confidence is 100 percent,'' said her agent, Joey DiAngelo.
</P>
<P>
   Krone said, ``I've lost it before, and now it's back.''
</P>
<P>
   DiAngelo said some Fair Grounds trainers were skeptical of Krone
when she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never rode this circuit before, and a lot of people had
never seen Julie first-hand,'' he said. ``Now, people that said
they would never ride girls are giving us \Rmounts\S. They have a
different outlook about her now.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone is third-leading jockey at Fair Grounds with 46 wins,
trailing Robby Albarado (76) and Eddie Martin (68). She probably
can't catch the top two New Orleans veterans, but if she were on
the Billboard chart, she would be No. 3 with a bullet. In the past
10 days, she has been riding winners at a 31 percent clip.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Last year's champion juveniles are scheduled to race this
weekend at Fair Grounds. Answer Lively attempts to make amends in
Sunday's Risen Star Stakes for a recent poor showing, and filly
Silverbulletday makes her first 1999 start tomorrow in the Davona
Dale Stakes. Ten 3-year-olds were entered for tomorrow's Fountain
of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park, the first major Triple Crown
prep of the year. Leading contenders in a wide-open field are Cat
Thief, Aly's Ally, Doneraile Court, Certain, Vicar, Grits'n Hard
Toast and The Groom is Red. The 1 1/16-mile race will be televised
on WFAA/Channel 8 with a 2:14 p.m. CST post. Deadline for stall
applications for Lone Star's upcoming thoroughbred meet is March 3.
The 72-day meet runs April 15 through July 25. Santa Anita has been
selected as host for the 2000 Breeders' Cup. The Arcadia, Calif.,
track previously had the races in 1986 and 1993. This year's
Breeders' Cup will be at Gulfstream Park in November. Arch, last
year's Super Derby winner, has been retired due to chronic ankle
problems. Plans are for him to stand at stud this year at Claiborne
Farm, which owns the 4-year-old in partnership with Adele
Dilschneider. Because of compatibility problems, Churchill Downs'
Kentucky Derby Future Wager won't attract as much betting action as
it might have. Santa Anita, Gulfstream Park and Aqueduct are not
accepting bets on the wager this weekend because their computer
systems cannot process races with 24 separate betting interests.

LET'S HAVE MORE THAN MURMURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What the world needs is another golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   I hear you shrieking at the very thought of one more Touchstone
Energy Tucson Open, Par-Three Challenge, Bruno's Memorial Classic,
Shark Shootout or Sprint International. Well, save your voice, you
might need it.
</P>
<P>
   You will need it if my tournament concept gets off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere on the year-long schedule of pro events ... for men,
women and old men ... and every possible combination of the three
... competing in stroke-play, match-play and pairs formats ... is a
tournament that caters to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   By which I don't mean the fans who limo up to the local PGA stop
in tweeds, jewelry and ``member'' badges, the ones who are too
refined to utter a sound or step on a twig within earshot of the
oh-so-sensitive golfers.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the fans in Hooters sweatshirts, painters' hats and dingy
sneakers, the ones who picked up their etiquette from Al Bundy and
just happen to be the sport's growing public.
</P>
<P>
   Why not reward those guys with a tournament where the customary
rules of gallery behavior are suspended and it's all right to
cheer, jeer, heckle and _ if this isn't going too far _ trip a
camera shutter?
</P>
<P>
   Not every tournament. One.
</P>
<P>
   Try it, they might like it. Even Tiger Woods, whose gripes about
midswing camera clicks at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am two
weeks ago resurrected the issue of photographers', cell phones' and
pagers' intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   One PGA Tour pro endorses the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like one tournament where everybody can scream and yell
anything they want _ `Miss it! Miss it!' '' said Jerry Kelly, tied
for eighth at 3-under-par after Thursday's first round of the
Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee we'd play just as well. If it's one guy (making
noise), it bothers us. If everybody's doing it, it doesn't bother
us.''
</P>
<P>
   By accident, the PGA Tour has something approaching our
high-decibel proposal already, a January tournament called the
Phoenix Open. It's the best-attended stop on the tour and a few of
the week's 500,000 fans might not have attended finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, a lot of them might show up chip-faced.
</P>
<P>
   The par-3 16th hole in Phoenix has grown so notorious for its
bleacher bums that nearby beer sales were halted this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only place I've got booed for hitting it in a
bunker,'' Kelly said. ``I'm lucky I hit the green a little bit
first, or they would've been yelling, `Air ball!'''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval mis-hit a chip into a far-side bunker and heard a
woman behind him grouse loudly, ``Well, I could have done that!''
</P>
<P>
   Duval admitted coming unglued because of the comment as much as
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   There was a taste of Phoenix in Pacific Palisades Thursday when
a fan near the 14th green, three empty beer cans on the bench
beside him at 10 in the morning, rattled Kelly's group with his
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some players hear it more than others,'' Phil
Mickelson said after his 68. ``I don't really mind it that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The heck he doesn't, said a writer who watched Mickelson go
face-to-face with a camera-wielding fan at Spyglass Hill during the
Pebble Beach tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you can have a camera and no one else can?''
Mickelson said. The fan tucked the camera under his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Other athletes tolerate such abuse, if that's what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when baseball's Ken Griffey Jr. played in the
Pebble Beach pro-am, he was unnerved by the silence as he bent over
a putt. He's used to the occasional crowd murmur during his
backswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody, please make some noise,'' he told the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that baseball players expect a din. Golfers
expect a morgue.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Quiet Please'' signs are such an institution, they bear a
sponsor's logo this week.
</P>
<P>
   But golfers don't complain about constant noise like the drone
of a blimp or the whine of a buzz saw at the house overlooking
Riviera's seventh tee Thursday. So why would it be a problem if
they showed up at our tournament _ don't you know we'll hold it in
the Bronx _ expecting sound and fury from behind the ropes?
</P>
<P>
   Where'd you learn that swing, Furyk _ in a granite quarry?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Michelson, I thought left-handers could hit the low pitch!
</P>
<P>
   Time for a grip change, Hoch: Take your hands off your throat!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there'd be a ``Rah, Tiger!'' mixed in.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the catharsis would unburden the 20th century American
male of the obligation to whisper a comment on every golf stroke he
sees.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: No ``You da man!'' No ``It's in the hole!''
</P>
<P>
   None of the little cliches fans have picked up from TV: ``He
pulled that little 5-iron a little bit. He's left with a tricky
little flop shot over a little bit of a hump....''
</P>
<P>
   We might even discover that given a tournament where they could
say anything, fans would have nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's the idea. Once a year, a loud break from
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA can reach me at Riviera. (My pager will be set on
``vibrate.'')

GILLETTE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE, 68, SAYS HE WILL RETIRE IN APRIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman and chief executive of Gillette Co., Alfred M.
Zeien, said Thursday that he would retire on April 15, after a year
of mixed financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien led Gillette, the world's largest maker of men's shaving
systems, for eight years and was the force behind the Mach 3,
Gillette's new three-blade shaver. He will be replaced by Michael
C. Hawley, the company's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that Zeien's decision to step down was his
alone. And while analysts said they thought that Zeien, who is 68,
initiated the management change, his departure comes at a time when
Gillette, hurt by financial instability in some international
markets, has been struggling to consistently deliver its goal of
double-digit earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has long prided itself not only on the strength of its
Sensor line of razors and blades but also on its global reach and
consistent delivery of double-digit quarterly earnings growth. Both
were factors that hurt the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was promoting the Mach 3 and rolling it out as fast
as its factories would produce them, Gillette, which gets about 35
percent of its revenues from outside the United States, was
suffering from weakness in many international markets, slow battery
sales of its Duracell brand, and reduced revenues from blades.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the troubles abroad, particularly in emerging
markets, Gillette's profits fell nearly 20 percent in the third
quarter of last year _ the company's first quarterly decline in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, did rebound somewhat in the fourth
quarter, when it posted a 5 percent gain in operating income, to
$720 million. Since then, management has said, and reiterated in a
conference call Thursday, that it expects to return to a 15 percent
to 20 percent rate of earnings growth in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll lose no sleep over investments in Gillette over the
next few years,'' said Zeien, who is a 31-year veteran of the
Boston-based company. He said that although there was never an
ideal time to step aside, ``this is almost the best time.'' In
support of that view, he ticked off a number of achievements,
including the introduction of the Mach 3 seven months ago, the
company's acquisition of Duracell and its having overcome what he
called a ``blip'' in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley, who will take over after the company's annual meeting on
April 15, said that going forward, ``we will capitalize on the
sales and profits growth opportunities to be realized, and the cost
reduction benefits to be derived, from two key activities we've
recently begun.'' They are an integration of the company's global
operations in 1997 and a reorganization announced last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hawley, 61, has worked for Gillette in various capacities for 31
years, including in finance, marketing and technical operations. He
is considered one of Gillette's most experienced international
managers, having worked in five countries.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, Hawley said, investors can be assured that
Gillette will remain focused on being the leader ``in existing or
new core product categories in which we choose to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Zeien, said Wendy Nicholson, an analyst who follows
Gillette for Salomon Smith Barney, ``given Gillette's weakness in
1998, I think Al probably felt very personally compelled to stay
with the company to ride them through this difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they have reported better earnings in the fourth
quarter and the momentum seems to have been restored at the
company, Al can leave Gillette feeling like he left a healthy
business,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ``Clearly, given the historical
success, he would not have left the company on a down tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette announced the management change after the market
closed. Its shares closed at $55.6875, down 81.25 cents  &QL;

 INVESTOR MAKES UNDERPRICED BID FOR 2% OF RJR NABISCO SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest example of a practice known as a ``mini-tender,''
a tiny investment company offered Thursday to buy 2 percent of the
outstanding stock of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. for $24 a share, or
8 percent lower than its recent closing price.
</P>
<P>
   While those seeking to buy more than 5 percent of a company's
outstanding stock must make regulatory filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, a company making a mini-tender can skirt
that requirement by offering to buy less. In recent months, such
offers have been made to holders of Greyhound Lines Inc. and United
States Office Products Co. at prices up to 20 percent lower than
the market value of those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although mini-tenders are not governed by any regulations, such
offers are transmitted to a company's investors once they are
received by the Depository Trust Company, the national central
securities depository.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some regulators are growing concerned that some
investors, particularly the elderly, might perceive that such
tender offers have to be acted on promptly in order for them not to
lose money. But in doing so, they relinquish their stock for a
price often far lower than they could get if they sold it in the
open market.
</P>
<P>
   The offer Thursday for stock of RJR Nabisco, the tobacco and
food giant, came from Schultze Asset Management, a tiny company in
New Jersey. It could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Nabisco urged holders to reject the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``RJR Nabisco strongly recommends that its shareholders reject
this tender offer,'' the company said, adding that the price
``based on current market prices is below the amount shareholders
could receive from a sale of their RJR Nabisco shares in the public
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of RJR rose 31.25 cents Thursday, to $26.125.

NEEDED TO WIN SENATE SEAT IN NEW JERSEY: LOTS OF CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ There is already a long list of potential
candidates for the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated next year
by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, but there is one qualification that
will quickly separate who is viable and who is not: the campaign
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Because running for statewide office in New Jersey requires
candidates to reach voters through two expensive media markets, New
York and Philadelphia, political analysts say most Senate
candidates will need to raise and spend $10 million to $12 million
in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money has become the first primary in elections these days,''
said Paul Hendrie, communications director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research organization that tracks
the role of money in federal politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first test for whether a candidate is credible or
not. It is not the candidate's resume or a candidate's track record
or positions on issues or even base of support. The first thing
that people look at is how much money can they raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, 75, a multimillionaire, cited the pressures of
raising such a gigantic sum as a primary reason behind his decision
to retire after three terms. He said that he realized, as he sat
through the impeachment proceedings that ended last week, that the
five-week trial was costing him $750,000 that he could have been
raising for his campaign. With only $500,000 in the bank, he
estimated that he would need to raise $25,000 to $30,000 a day for
the next 18 months to help make up the difference. ``I decided
that's not what I wanted to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While money in the bank can turn a candidate into an early
front-runner and scare off potential opponents, the ability to
raise money can be even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. She said that she would
consider making a bid for the Senate in 2000. She does not have a
dime in the bank for a Senate race, but neither her top aides nor
Republican Party leaders are concerned because they say there is
little doubt about her fund-raising abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Mrs. Whitman raised millions of dollars in the past
for her campaigns and the state party organization, but she has
also raised millions for fellow Republican candidates around the
country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans who are considering entering the race
already have hundreds of thousands in the bank, but they lack Mrs.
Whitman's star power and statewide appeal. According to federal
campaign finance records, Rep. Frank A. LoBiondo of Vineland, who
said he was talking to supporters about seeking the Republican
nomination, raised $846,000 for his re-election to Congress last
year. But he spent only $146,000, leaving him more than $700,000 to
start a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County
executive, who said he was also thinking about the Senate seat,
expressed confidence in his ability to find donors. At his
inaugural, he raised $550,000. ``The fund-raising does not seem to
be a problem,'' he said, acknowledging that not all of the $550,000
could be used for a Senate bid because it was raised under state
campaign finance rules, not federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, a review of recent campaign finance filings shows
that Rep. Robert Menendez of Union City is ahead of the pack with
$1.2 million. Menendez, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House
and already a favorite of party regulars, is expected to announce
early next week whether he will seek the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate hopeful, Susan Bass Levin, a Democrat who is the
mayor of Cherry Hill, created an exploratory committee last year to
test the waters and held a fund-raiser that she said had raised
several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Jim Florio, who has also expressed interest in the
seat, has shown in the past that he can raise money with a network
of wealthy donors. But party leaders point out that he has not run
for office since he lost to Mrs. Whitman in 1993, and they are
hoping that party leaders and donors will rally behind a new face
in the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent federal campaign finance records,
some of the others who said they were considering running for
Lautenberg's seat would be starting with next to nothing. Rep.
Marge Roukema, a Republican from Ridgewood, has about $33,500; Rep.
Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from Fair Lawn, $31,470, and Rep.
Frank Pallone Jr., 23,678.

SOUND SOURCE SOARS, RETREATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of Sound Source Interactive soared 30
percent in early trading Thursday after the CD-ROM publisher
announced a distribution deal with Macmillan Computer Publishing,
but then Wall Street took back most of the gain by the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Sound Source shares closed the session up 9.375 cents to 93.75
cents, or 11 percent, in a performance reflecting the volatility
among tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas-based company, recently ranked as the seventh
largest publisher of educational software, said the Macmillan deal
would expand its existing sales channels and develop new sales
possibilities for its library.
</P>
<P>
   Macmillan, which will handle the entire line of Sound Source
CD-ROMs in North America, is the world's largest computer book
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Thursday's gain, Sound Source remains down 40
percent from its 1999 high, reached just two weeks ago during a
session when its value more than doubled even though there was no
news to drive that increase. By contrast, the Feb. 9 announcement
that Sound Source had hired investment bankers to explore strategic
alternatives -- a sign that the company could be sold and usually
an upward spur to a stock -- led to a 30 percent decline during the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Sound Source's wide swings may be related to the intense
interest in the high-tech sector among day traders and investors
who participate in Internet chat rooms, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's gain came on the heels of a 33 percent loss during
the previous session following three negative disclosures:
</P>
<P>
   __The company reported a loss of $760,503, or 13 cents a share,
for its second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with profits of
$1.27 million in the year-earlier period. Sales plunged to $1.67
million from $3 million due to slow sales of ``The Abbys: Incident
at Europa'' and three ``Babe: Pig in the City'' titles.
</P>
<P>
   __Nasdaq recently notified the company that the stock may be
delisted since it had failed to keep the closing price of the stock
above $1 for 30 consecutive sessions. To avoid delisting, the stock
must close above $1 for 10 consecutive sessions prior to April 29.
</P>
<P>
   __The company has decided to abandon the nonfamily oriented
software business to focus on its ``core competence'' of family
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Sound Source, which has 42 employees, went public with a $10
million offering in 1996. The stock traded at over $6 on its first
day but fell under $3 in early 1997 and has never regained that
level.

PROFILE: `BEST LITTLE BOY' IS NOW A CHIEF FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are three essential things to know at this
moment about the financial writer Andrew Tobias.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that he went to Camp Wigwam in Maine with Steve
Grossman, who recently resigned as national chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. The second is that Hillary Rodham
Clinton squeezed his hand at the stroke of midnight on New Year's
Eve 1992. ``I will never forget it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The third is that he has become a crucial fund-raiser among gay
men and lesbians for the president and other Democrats, and has
himself given the party $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   So next month, Tobias is to become the new treasurer of the
Democratic National Committee _ the first openly gay person to have
such a leadership position in the national party. His job is to
help raise $250 million for the Democrats in 2000, and get money
from an increasingly important interest group that the party still
considers untapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing very sexy or cool about the DNC,'' Tobias said
this week in his Manhattan apartment, adding that his new job is,
partly, to make the party relevant to people who focus most of
their philanthropy on AIDS and gay civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how much gay men and lesbians give to the party,
although the Democratic National Committee estimates that it was $3
million in 1996. ``I'm going to try to give the gay and lesbian
community a way to give money so that it's identifiable,'' Tobias
said. ``When tobacco gives money to the Republican National
Committee, they don't do it anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1997, the Clintons have attended three Democratic
National Committee gay and lesbian fund-raising events _ two at the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington, one last summer in the Hamptons at
the home of Dr. Christopher Barley, an internist, and Jonathan
Sheffer, the artistic director of the Eos Orchestra. They raised
$1.2 million, and Tobias was at all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is still wondering, `Should we take money
from these awful people?''' Tobias said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias became a Clinton partisan some 15 years ago, when he met
the couple at a Renaissance Weekend. ``I don't know them very well,
but they have totally changed my life,'' he said. ``I think what
the government does is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say it was President Clinton and
Grossman's idea to offer Tobias, 51, the job. ``He was sort of a
natural for this,'' said Richard Socarides, a presidential adviser
who oversees issues of gay rights. ``Andy checks a lot of boxes for
the White House and the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias is the kind of generous and self-deprecating person who
is fun to sit next to at dinner but hides a lot of life behind an
amusing persona.
</P>
<P>
   The amusing part first: ``This Teletubby thing is so
wonderful,'' said Tobias, referring to the Rev. Jerry Falwell's
criticism of the television Teletubby character, Tinky Winky, as
gay. ``And incidentally, Tinky Winky is gay. And part two, so what?
And part three, he's not molesting any of the others. Mainly,
though, he carries what the Reverend Falwell calls a purse, and
what the producer calls his `magic bag.''' Tobias smiled. ``Come
on,'' he said, ``it's a purse.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-amusing part, from Tobias' memoir, ``The Best Little
Boy in the World Grows Up'': ``I think my own loneliest moment may
have been on a winter evening senior year in college with my two
roommates up at Killington, in Vermont. . . . What got me was
trying to negotiate the `apres-ski' that night, scoping out chicks
at the dance bar, and having to pretend I was loving it, man _
loving it! In fact, I was hating it. I was inadequate, I didn't fit
in, my life was a complete deception . . . As I crunched back
through the cold crisp air, under the stars, feeling so left out, I
realized that my life was absolutely, completely hopeless. I sat
down in the snow, alone, and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias remembers himself as a profoundly ``out of it'' child who
grew up on Fifth Avenue and spent weekends at the family's country
house in Bedford in Westchester County. His father was an
advertising executive; his mother adored him. Tobias went to Horace
Mann in Riverdale and then Harvard, where he was better at making
money than going to class. By the time he graduated in 1968, he had
put ``Let's Go,'' then a slender Harvard Student Agencies guide to
Europe, into the black.
</P>
<P>
   He became a writer for New York magazine, then a financial
columnist for Esquire and in 1973 published ``The Best Little Boy
in the World,'' his first memoir about growing up gay, under a pen
name. The book became a classic among gay men, and 25 years later
was re-issued by the Modern Library, this time with Tobias' name
and picture on the front cover. ``The Best Little Boy in the World
Grows Up'' was published simultaneously by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias told his parents and friends about his homosexuality in
the 1970s, but did not come out publicly until the early 1990s. His
partner is Charles Nolan, who designs the Ellen Tracy clothing line
with Linda Allard.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias became rich _ a ``tongue in cheek'' vast fortune he hints
is around $10 million _ with a line of personal-finance software,
now obsolete. His salary at the Democratic National Committee will
be $1 a year.

GM TAYLOR GIVE KINGS AN EARFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Looking at the faces of the Los Angeles
Kings as they left their dressing room after Thursday's morning
skate, one might have thought they'd just seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Forum isn't haunted, but the Kings had just listened to
a stern 15-minute lecture by Los Angeles general manager Dave
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Normally slow to anger, Taylor had seen enough after watching a
tired Mighty Ducks team beat his Kings 3-1 in a crucial game on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have games like the other day and get outworked in our
own building, it's unacceptable,'' Taylor said after addressing the
team. ``I wanted to tell the players they have to take on the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dug ourselves a big hole, we've had our share of
excuses, and our share of injuries (Rob Blake, Jozef Stumpel, Glenn
Murray, Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr), but we can't be protecting
the players anymore. All of the excuses are gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Kings quickly left the building after the meeting,
but Yanic Perreault said there was no doubt Taylor had the team's
full attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got so much respect from the players that everyone
listened,'' Perreault said. ``Dave believes in this team. We know
we have a good team, but we know there's no tomorrow, we have to
win now.''

NET COMPANY CLAIMS DISNEY IS STEALING LOGO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leggo my logo.
</P>
<P>
   That's what an Internet search engine firm told the Walt Disney
Co. in papers filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The company, GoTo.Com, is seeking an injunction against Disney
to prevent it from using the current logo for its Go Network site.
GoTo.com claims the color scheme and typeface are so similar to its
own that consumers are bound to be confused.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at GoTo.com, whose site was launched in June, said
they met with Disney representatives several times to no effect
before the Mouse launched its Web site in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to dissuade them from using this practically
identical logo, and they refused,'' said John Fisher, who sits on
GoTo.com's board of directors. ``They proved to be completely
intractable and intransigent.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney representatives said the GoTo.com lawsuit is baseless.
``Disney has secured the rights to the Go Network logo and we'll
defend those rights vigorously,'' said spokeswoman Rebecca
Anderson. Asked whether the two designs appear similar, Anderson
said, ``People can make their own judgment when they look at them.
That's as much as I'm prepared to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Brewer, president and chief executive of GoTo.com, said
there is more at stake than two companies with similar images.
Brewer said Disney's portal approach _ in which it seeks be a
gateway to the Internet, directing users to other sites, including
several owned by or associated with Disney _ is the opposite of
what his company hopes to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   GoTo.com is a fee-based search engine. Businesses pay GoTo.com
for a high ranking when users type in key search terms. An online
bookseller, for example, might pay 3 cents to appear on a results
list each time a user searches using the term ``books.'' But that
retailer's information would appear lower on the list than that of
a company paying 5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a business model, GoTo.com owes allegiance to no
single advertiser and has no vested interest in which Web sites
users choose to visit, Brewer said. ``Everything (Disney and its Go
Network) stand for is against what we set out to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By using a logo similar to GoTo.com's, Disney's site could hurt
his company, Brewer said. ``I don't think they have a very good
product, and I don't want to be tainted with their product,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Brewer portrayed the case as one of David vs. Goliath, his
$30 million firm is itself backed by some of the biggest names in
Internet financing.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Fisher, whose venture capital firm Draper Fisher &AMP;
Jurevetson invested in the company, GoTo.Com received much of its
early money from idealab! Capital, the financing wing of
Pasadena-based idealab! Created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen,
idealab! serves as an incubator for new, technology-based companies
in the Southern California region.

LIFELESS BRUINS LEFT SPINNING WHEELS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ They're consistent, but that's the pain and
not the pleasure. In a season fast unraveling, a playoff spot
growing more elusive by the shot, the pass, the shift, the Bruins
suffered their third straight loss Thursday night, a 2-0 blanking
at the hands of the playoff-charged-and-ready Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Behind by two goals in less than seven minutes of the first
period, the Bruins watched the Senators rev up their skating game,
sharpen their penalty-killing knives, and proficiently put away
what amounted to a ho-hum victory (No. 31 vs. Boston's 22).
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the battle of the special teams,'' said Senators coach
Jacques Martin, who watched netminder Ron Tugnutt chalk up the
sixth shutout against the Bruins this season, the third in the last
month. ``And we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss also dropped the Bruins another rung in their quest for
a playoff berth in the Eastern Conference. The Canadiens, with a
3-1 win in Philadelphia, slipped past Boston into the No. 9 spot in
the conference, still a spot short of the playoff picture. The
Bruins slipped to 10th and now have the Panthers (No. 8) and
dreaded Habs to upend if they're going anywhere come mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how disturbingly consistent the Bruins have become: they
have won only three times in their last 17 games (3-11-3). Thursday
night, they had key contributor Kyle McLaren back on their blue
line, and that made for a tighter picture in their back end. But in
the attacking zone, where they are unable to generate any sustained
pressure or mount good shots, they skate without authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now our confidence is just not where it should be,''
said netminder Byron Dafoe, who absorbed the loss despite stopping
26 of 28 shots. ``We have to hurry up and get on a roll, but
unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns started to alter the offensive approach
early in the second period when he finally moved Dmitri Khristich
off the No. 1 line, where his effectiveness has been next to
nothing for most of the season's second half. Burns bumped
Khristich off the right wing of the No. 1 line and moved Anson
Carter in there, with Sergei Samsonov and Jason Allison, Carter's
old linemate in Washington. What followed wasn't exactly magic _
the trio managed a total of six shots in the second and third
periods _ but at least it was a move that showed some
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try something,'' said Burns, a noticeable shrug in
his voice. ``We still had no goals to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns added that his Bruins could have been ``a little meaner
with their shots.'' Translation: no one showed much of a fight or
snarl to follow up on rebounds or fight through traffic for initial
shots. It was a cordial, spiritless loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators cracked Dafoe only 77 seconds into the game on a
Daniel Alfredsson goal that was meant as nothing more than a
centering pass off the right wing board. His back to the net,
wanting only to keep the puck deep, the talented Swede swept in a
backhander that first eluded Carter on the way in and then
ricocheted in off one of McLaren's gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost it on the way in,'' said Dafoe. ``In fact, I lost it
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Yashin scored the second _ and last _ for the Senators on
a power play at 6:21 (Dave Ellett off for roughing). The big,
mobile slot man slid into the middle and nailed a one-time slapper
off a pretty feed from Andreas Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators are young, fast, and deep. They play an aggressive
trap, always ready to spring two forecheckers, preying off mid-ice
transitions. The Bruins try to play the same way, but lack the legs
and talent to be as forceful with the forecheck. When they do
trigger good scoring opportunities, they lack the polish to
convert.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, they've clearly been exposed as understaffed
and undertalented, and the lack of passion in their game says they
know it. They might not admit it, but they know it. They work, but
it's more going through the motions than it is going with the
gusto. The follow-through that so many expected from last season _
the particular hope of the front office _ instead has fallen flat.

EX-UNIVERSAL STUDIOS BOSS SIGNS DEAL WITH KING WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Frank Biondi, who left the top slot at Universal
Studios three months ago, has agreed to a consulting deal with
syndicated TV producer King World Productions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi, who resigned after ``Meet Joe Black'' opened to
disappointing grosses, will work in strategic planning and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Biondi, who also has headed Home Box Office and
Viacom, likely signals that cash-rich King World is looking for
deals. ``With a billion dollars in cash reserves, long-term
contract renewals for `Wheel of Fortune,' `Jeopardy!' and `The
Oprah Winfrey Show' and the recent success of `Hollywood Squares,'
King World has never been stronger,'' Biondi said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi's departure from Universal, where he had been chairman
and chief executive officer, came after a long string of dismal
performances at the box office and a decision by Edgar Bronfman
Jr., chief executive of Seagram Co., to take more direct control of
Universal. Biondi left Viacom in 1996 when Chairman Sumner Redstone
took a similar course.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi will receive more than $25 million from Seagram to settle
his contract, which was to expire in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi has been criticized by some analysts for not exerting
enough hands-on control over costly projects, but others regard him
as an astute player in the complex world of entertainment
financing. Before joining HBO in 1978, he was an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Recent speculation about Biondi was that he might form a
partnership with Wall Street investor Richard Reiss to back media
companies. Biondi and Reiss reportedly were seeking to raise $150
million to $500 million.

PUCK BOUNCES KINGS' WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings' 3-2 victory over the
Edmonton Oilers before 11,287 at the Forum on Thursday night might,
or might not, merely prolong the agony that has accompanied Los
Angeles' disappointing 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the agony of losing to the Oilers just hours after being
lectured by an angry Dave Taylor wasn't a very appealing option.
</P>
<P>
   A defeat would have left the Kings 10 points out of a playoff
spot and certainly out of the good graces of their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But the bounces were going the Kings' way on Thursday and they
pulled within six points of the eighth-place Oilers as they prepare
for a six-game road trip that begins Saturday in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hockey gods were showing their kindness early when
defenseman Philippe Boucher used his hockey stick like a pool cue
and bounced a shot off the boards for his first goal of the season
two minutes into the game. Strangely enough, Boucher, who has spent
much of the season in the press box, was the offensive catalyst,
recording a career-high three points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game of follow the bouncing puck in the first period
and Mikhail Shtalenkov wasn't good at it. The Edmonton goalie was
pulled after allowing three goals on 12 shots in the first 18
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 26th-ranked power play opened the scoring when
Boucher's dump-in bounced off the left-wing boards and went into an
empty Edmonton net after Shtalenkov had left the crease to play the
anticipated bounce.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took a 2-0 lead at 5:15 when Luc Robitaille, while
falling down, got his stick on Boucher's shot from the right point.
The goal was Robitaille's 30th of the season and 900th point as a
King. Robitaille has scored 30-plus goals nine times in a season,
all with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Selivanov, who scored three third-period goals at
Anaheim on Wednesday, scored on a deflection at 12:38 of the first
period to pull the Oilers within a goal. He then tied game on a
breakaway goal at 14:50. But good fortune continued to go the Kings
way when Steve Duchesne's 60-footer hit the stick of an Oilers
defenseman and fooled Shtalenkov at 17:52.
</P>
<P>
   The puck and the game settled down in the second period. Neither
team scored and they combined for just nine shots on goal. The
Kings, however, missed two great chances to take a two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the period Olli Jokinen took a nice pass from
Vladimir Tsyplakov in the right circle and hit the right post with
half of the net open.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period Marty McSorley fanned on his shot
attempt from the point and Robitaille started off on a clear
breakaway. The Kings winger went for lower left corner of the net,
but Essensa knocked it wide.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's best chance came on a power play when one of the Los
Angeles penalty killers flipped an ill-advised pass into the slot
and Stephane Fiset was forced to make a scrambling save.

RODMAN INSISTS IT'S A GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dennis Rodman is ready to sign with the Los
Angeles Lakers. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with knowing for certain is that the source of the
information this time is Rodman himself, and that means nothing can
be taken at face value.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's editions of the Chicago Sun-Times, Rodman said he
planned to sign a one-year contract either Thursday or today. But
Thursday passed without a signing, and the Lakers have indicated
they do not expect anything to happen today either.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman insists he's coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it,'' he told the Sun-Times, in his first public
comments on the matter. ``The media has been saying, `Dennis Rodman
is broke, over the hill, not happy and can't play anymore.' But
what else is new? People have always been counting Dennis Rodman
out and telling lies. So that's not going to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good (and) I feel like playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The team confirmed that Rodman and Lakers owner Jerry Buss met
after Wednesday night's game between the Lakers and Dallas
Mavericks, but the result of that meeting is unclear. It was the
first face-to-face meeting Rodman has had with any team official in
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rodman is scheduled to appear today on ESPN's
``UpClose'' at 3 p.m. perhaps to explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Buss himself extended the invitation to the eccentric former
Chicago Bull _ over the strong objections of Lakers management _
about three weeks ago. But Rodman has been slow to accept the deal
for the veterans minimum salary, $12,195 per game, because it's far
below his market value.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one else wants the seven-time rebounding champion or can
pay him the millions he once commanded, so it's a mystery why he
has dragged out the process, unless one simply assumes he's pumping
it for the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   His explanation: ``I had to take my time and do what's best for
Dennis Rodman. (There is) no rush. I'm a free agent. They can't pay
me what I'm worth anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister and business adviser, Debra Rodman, said she had
spoken with the Lakers and also indicated he would sign the deal
Thursday or today.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if he'll suit up to play Friday night or
Sunday, because he's probably got to go through at least a couple
of practices with them,'' Debra Rodman said. ``Personally, I'm
happy to see him getting back out on the court, because this is
something he really loves doing and is something he's really good
at.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had to take some extra time to rest, because he has
been so busy going nonstop for three years playing ball, shooting
movies, doing TV shows and making personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he recently got married (to actress Carmen Electra). And
he never felt the need to hurry because, let's face it, the league
will be making a hell of a lot more money off of Dennis than he
will be making off of them.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Rockets were running on fumes and
adrenalin. Scottie Pippen, who had made just about every play he
could have, was barely moving as he backpedaled.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final seconds of a game that could have been sacrificed to
the realities of the lockout-season schedule were slipping away,
and Pippen, who understandably could have collapsed, fell down.
</P>
<P>
   Had Scott Burrell squeezed into a size 13, the Rockets and New
Jersey Nets might still be playing. Instead, Burrell was called for
tripping Pippen, who got up to sink a free throw with 3.3 seconds
left in overtime and give the Rockets a 93-92 victory Thursday
night at Continental Airlines Arena, completing their third game in
as many nights with a stunning comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big, big, big, big, big,'' said Rockets forward
Othella Harrington, who finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds.
``Things weren't right for us in the first half, but we hung tough
and kept closing, closing, closing, until we got a great win for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive victory because of the schedule problems
and just how poorly the Rockets had started the game, trailing by
as many as 13 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It also was remarkable because, after getting whipped on the
boards in Minnesota the night before and playing their third game
without Charles Barkley, the Rockets outrebounded the Nets and
rebound machine Jayson Williams 57-39.
</P>
<P>
   And it was most inexplicable because as worn as the Rockets
clearly were by the road, they grew stronger defensively as the
game went on, limiting the Nets to two field goals in the final two
minutes of regulation and overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said of his
team's last-legs defense. ``I love that stuff. That's how we used
to win in the old days. It wasn't always pretty. But when we got in
the huddle, we're talking about defensive assignments, instead of,
`You missed me.' We're heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets turned back that way when, after a late-first-half
rally, they found themselves back in a game they could win and,
with back-to-back games at Miami and Orlando over the weekend, one
they might have needed.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, after a horrid first-half performance, took over in the
third quarter, scoring six points and getting four assists. He
finished with a season-high 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into the fourth quarter, Michael Dickerson (14
points, five rebounds) drove the baseline for a 75-74 lead, the
Rockets' first of the night. But with 2:35 left in regulation, the
Nets led 84-83 and the Rockets needed a stop.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Rockets got every defensive stop they could
want. Pippen switched defensive assignments to battle Keith Van
Horn in the low post, and the Nets forward missed his three
remaining shots in regulation. With an 84-81 lead, the Nets then
missed five consecutive shots, including a Pippen block of a Van
Horn jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets pushed their lead to 85-83 with 12.8 seconds left in
regulation on an Eric Murdock free throw. But with 4.4 seconds
remaining, Hakeem Olajuwon took a quick dribble to his left and hit
a 17-footer to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets led for most of the overtime, but with 1:14 left,
Pippen knocked the ball loose from Van Horn only to have it bounce
off Brent Price's shoulder and back to Van Horn, forcing Price to
foul. Van Horn hit both free throws to tie it at 90.
</P>
<P>
   Williams appeared to poke the ball loose from Olajuwon on the
next possession, but Murdock was called for a foul and Olajuwon hit
both free throws for a 92-90 lead with 53.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn then scored immediately for another tie, and the Nets
had their chance to grab the victory when Harrington came up short
inside, finding himself open too late to get off a good shot over
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles then drove for what could have been the
game-winner, but as the ball ricocheted off the rim and appeared to
be headed back in, Williams went up to give the ball a tap and was
called for offensive basket interference, giving the Rockets their
chance.
</P>
<P>
   With Olajuwon (21 points, 15 rebounds) looking to get rid of the
ball, he turned to Pippen, only to have Pippen fall and the ball
sail out of bounds. Burrell, however, was called for tripping
Pippen, the Nets screamed and Pippen took the line to give the
Rockets the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a foul,'' Pippen said. ``I was tripped. It was obvious.
He tried to overplay me, and he tripped me, the same as he did in
practice all last year (with the Bulls).''

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ In the back corner of the Los Angeles Dodgers
clubhouse, amid the names of prospects and stars, is a locker for
Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Strange thing is, Martinez isn't a Dodger. And it's looking more
and more like he won't be unless something changes.
</P>
<P>
   A source said a deal with another organization could come
quickly, but that Martinez's camp is weighing the option of waiting
for a more lucrative deal. A source also said, as of events of the
past few weeks, he didn't anticipate Martinez returning to the
Dodgers organization.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who's been in the Dodgers system since 1985,
remains in the Dominican Republic rehabilitating his surgically
repaired right shoulder. And he's there without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez last pitched June 14. Two weeks later he had surgery to
repair a tear in his rotator cuff. The prognosis was he wouldn't be
ready to pitch at the major-league level until late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an invitation to come in and work out here as a free
agent,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``We'll
continue to rehabilitate him and continue to do everything we can
to get him ready to pitch. It's my understanding that when he gets
closer to being game ready, he'll make a decision on where he wants
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez isn't scheduled to arrive in the United States until
the second week of March.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers physical therapist Pat Screnar saw Martinez three weeks
ago at a workout at Dodger Stadium and said the veteran was on
schedule. Martinez, who went 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA before injuring
his arm last season, is 123-77 with a 3.45 ERA since joining the
Dodgers in 1988 but has missed parts of the past two seasons with
shoulder injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``His progress to this point has gone well,'' Screnar said.
``He's been on a throwing program for the last couple of months and
he continues to improve his strength. His throwing to this point is
just on flat ground. He hasn't been off the mound yet. Everything
we've seen, to this date, has been positive to his return.''
</P>
<P>
   Granting Clemency: Malone was curious to see where Roger Clemens
wound up, and had a grin when he learned that the five-time Cy
Young Award winner had gone to the American League instead of to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And before the Dodgers signed Kevin Brown to the $105 million
free-agent contract in December, Malone said he was intrigued about
the opportunity of acquiring Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to someone about it, but after we got Kevin Brown
(the talk ended),'' Malone said.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When the third game in three nights goes
into overtime and you tiptoe off to the bus with a one-point win,
there is usually talk of the little things.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Munchkin Brent Price shows that he's part kangaroo and leaps to
grab hold of two critical offensive rebounds coming down the
stretch. The perpetual-motion machine Othella Harrington sprints
out of the paint to get a fingertip on Keith Van Horn's last,
desperate 25-foot shot. There is a tripping call by a rookie
referee, a reach-in call by a veteran whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Scottie Pippen. Nothing little there.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Rockets were contortionists and nearly bent
themselves out of shape trying to get him.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what they have been expecting all along.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to fit in is fine for a start. Easing into a comfort
zone is all right for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But taking control is what the Rockets need.
</P>
<P>
   And taking over is what Pippen did in the second half of the
wacky, wild, scrappy, hustling 93-92 win over the Nets on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries to Charles Barkley, Antoine Carr, Rodrick Rhodes
and Stanley Roberts already crippling them, this most grueling
stretch of the compressed schedule was threatening to bury the
Rockets beneath a blizzard of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pippen rose up and howled like the storm of the century.
Give me what I want, and I'll go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a lot more control of what was happening in
this game after what happened in Minnesota,'' Pippen said. ``I
thought that we let the fatigue get to us in that one. I thought
that a game that we had some control over got away from us. I
thought that we had a breakdown in our composure and our
concentration, and I didn't want it to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at halftime (of the Nets game), I kind of told myself that
it was time to step up and take on a lot more of a leadership role.
I haven't tried to take over since I've been here with this team. I
haven't tried to force myself into any situations. But I did
believe that this situation called for me to do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Something bigger. Something better. Something special. Something
quite reminiscent of his days with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 18 of his game-high 26 points in the second half
and grabbed five of his six rebounds then. It was after the
intermission when he picked up five of his six assists and all four
of his steals.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Scottie Pippen of all those years and all those
playoff games, using those long arms to get into the passing lanes
and knock balls loose to start fast breaks in the other direction.
This was a charging, slashing Pippen lowering his head and going to
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sure, confident Pippen running the offense from the
point-forward position, the blender who mixed all of the
ingredients in the Rockets' grittiest effort of the young season
and turned it into victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Astros might have had with Roger Clemens on the
mound, a proven winner who knows what has to be done and just does
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't necessarily want me or need me to score all the
points or take all of the shots,'' Pippen said. ``But they do want
me to make plays and get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pippen running the show in the second half, taking the
quarterback burden off Price and allowing the point guard to roam
free and get those big offensive rebounds. It was Pippen directing
traffic, allowing Harrington _ Charles Lite _ to bang away on the
inside for his 12 points and 12 boards. It was Pippen who, from the
midway point in the fourth quarter, teamed with Hakeem Olajuwon's
21 points and 15 rebounds to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt comfortable,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, that may have been in part due to Barkley's
absence. Pippen has more room to operate. He has less concern with
trying to stay out of the path of another charging bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're darn right it's easier,'' Pippen said, smiling. ``We're
not calling `4-hold' for Charles all the time, which means I stand
around spotting up for a shot. That's not my game. I like motion. I
like the movement to create my opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen found enough of those opportunities to score nine points
in the fourth quarter, and he and Olajuwon combined for 17 of the
Rockets' final 23 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a lot of fun for me,'' he said. ``This is the kind of
role I envisioned, and when Charles and the other guys get back, I
think we're going to be able to raise our game. This was a good
step in the right direction for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is straight ahead, not looking back. Pippen is now the
only member of the defending champions not to have received his
1998 championship ring. A couple of weeks ago, that bothered him.
Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to keep it up there in Chicago,'' he said. ``Why
do I need to wear a Bulls ring in Houston? Maybe I'll get myself
another here.''
</P>
<P>
   A night like this could be a start.

ALMOST EVERYONE WANTS A PEACE OF DUVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It gets a little noisy out at Riviera Country Club
sometimes, but nothing seems to be disturbing David Duval's peace.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when a spectator shouts, ``Hey, shoot a 58!''
</P>
<P>
   Duval didn't even break stride at that challenge/compliment
Thursday. He just kept strolling down the 10th fairway and recorded
his birdie en route to a five-under-par 66, which tied Bob Estes
for the first-round lead at the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   After winning two tournaments last month and shooting an
eye-catching 59 in the final round of the Bob Hope Classic, Duval
was expected to be atop the leaderboard. And you can include Duval
in that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can tell you I'm out there at peace and playing well,''
Duval said. ``I don't know if I feel in a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure seems like something special, if not quite a ``zone.''
Duval could have easily shot a 64, but had putts lip the cup on the
13th and 16th holes.
</P>
<P>
   And his recovery on the 12th hole typifies how good things are
going. After a poor drive landed in the trees, Duval had to twist
his body just to address the ball, which laid next to a large
eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
   Duval hit his approach shot long, but it bounced off a spectator
and landed safely on the fringe, enabling him to record par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what I'm doing is beyond my capabilities,''
Duval said. ``I do expect to go out there and play well.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time Duval hasn't felt like he would have a memorable
round was the day he shot his unforgettable 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel like I had energy (before the round), then
it disappeared,'' Duval said. ``Usually I have a feeling of how
I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   With two tour victories in four appearances, Duval is currently
No.2 in the World Golf Rankings behind Tiger Woods, who shot a 69
on Thursday. Woods vaulted to No.1 after he won the Buick
Invitational last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of observers are eager to kindle a Woods-Duval rivalry
and add a little spark to the often bland assortment of winners on
the PGA Tour. But Duval quickly dismisses any questions about his
rivalry with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the desire to have a rivalry, but at the same
time I think it's a bit disrespectful to other people,'' Duval
said. ``To not mention them is disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   So Duval did, singling out Mark O'Meara, Ernie Els and Davis
Love III among others.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, just how good a rivalry is this? Woods may have won the
Buick Invitational, but Duval was up in Idaho on his snowboard,
taking some time off. In fact, snowboarding and skiing have become
almost as much a passion for Duval as golf, if not as lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I like doing it so much that I don't think about
playing golf,'' Duval said. ``But when I come back, I appreciate
that I'm playing even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's winter hobbies have convinced him that taking a break is
as essential as any other aspect of his preparation. And no one
will dispute him, considering his recent track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stop playing,'' Duval said. ``I've learned it's as
important to stop as to hit a bucket of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the next few weeks, Duval plans at least one more ski
trip, even if he shoots another 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been drawn to the mountains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice, but let's get back to this rivalry thing. In golf's
version of the top 25, who's No.1? Duval or Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Duval won't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played as well as anybody the last 15-20 months, you
can't take that away from me,'' Duval said.
</P>

BRATTON MAKES MOST OF STROKES OF GOOD FORTUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alan Bratton, who needed to win a playoff in
gathering darknesss to earn the final qualifying berth for this
week's Nissan Open, sits one stroke off the tournament lead today.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton's first-round 67, a 4-under-par effort including six
birdies, left him tied with Loren Roberts, Nick Price, Kirk
Triplett and Kevin Sutherland, a stroke back of tournament
co-leaders David Duval and Bob Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton earned his Nissan berth by shooting 6-under-par 66 in a
qualifying event Monday at Los Serranos North, then defeating
reigning U.S. Junior Amateur champion James Oh in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   So close: Valencia's Jason Gore, who finished 26th in last
week's Buick Invitational as a qualifier, just missed Monday's
playoff at Los Serranos, shooting a 67.
</P>
<P>
   Price check: Nick Price, playing the Nissan in an attempt to get
ready for next week's World Match Play Championships, shot 67 to
trail the leaders by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Price's 4-under par, four-birdie, no-bogey showing was his first
since playing two weeks ago in South Africa. Price said he finished
eighth in that tournament and ``didn't play well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to take time off,'' said Price. ``I was able to
sleep in the same bed for 30 straight nights and I haven't done
that for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky shot: Kazuhiko Hosokawa, a pro from the Japanese Tour
playing on a sponsor's exemption, recorded the day's luckiest shot.
</P>
<P>
   On the famed bunker-on-the-green No.6, Hosokawa hit his tee shot
over the hole. The ball bounced off a sprinkler cover, appeared to
hit a sitting fan, then rolled to within two feet of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Hosokawa, who shot 73, made the birdie putt and tossed the ball
to the fan in the gallery. Baseball angle: Former Dodgers general
manager Fred Claire is not at spring training in Vero Beach, Fla.,
for the first time since 1968. Instead, he attended the Nissan
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Claire was telling baseball stories in the press tent Thursday
morning when his wife, Cheryl, tugged on his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard these stories before, Fred,'' she said. ``I want to
see some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to school: Corey Pavin spent the night before the
tournament attending the USC-UCLA basketball game. Pavin played
golf at UCLA. He didn't fare quite as well as the Bruins did,
however, shooting a 1-over par 72, which placed him six strokes off
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chip of the day: Phil Mickelson might have had the prettiest
chip of the day Thursday. On the par-3 16th hole, Mickelson hit his
tee shot near the edge of a bunker adjacent to the green. With his
feet planted just on the edge of the bunker, Mickelson calmly
pitched the ball about 20 feet and straight into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overpower the course here, you have to be patient,''
Mickelson said. ``The course tempts you, but you have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd control: Thursday's opening round was ideal for
spectators. There was plenty of room in the galleries for fans to
find a place to watch, even on the 18th green when co-leader David
Duval concluded his round. The announced attendance Thursday was
13,652. Last year's opening round at Valencia drew 11,480 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Golf weather: The cloudy skies didn't bother the golfers, and
they should be able to get used to them. Today's forecast is for
mostly cloudy skies with some peaks of sunshine in the afternoon
and a high of 59. Saturday's forecast is cloudiness in the morning,
with partly cloudy skies in the afternoon and a high of 68.
</P>
<P>
   No one is complaining about the cool weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be sunny today, but it never
happened,'' Duval said. ``It worked out.''

   KURD-EUROPE (Berlin) _ Political divisions have long undermined
the scattered Kurds in their battle for a homeland. But for the
overwhelming majority of the estimated 850,000 Kurds now living in
Europe, it is clear that Abdullah Ocalan's arrest has constituted a
moment when differences are swept away, however fleetingly, by a
shared sense of outrage. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KURD-TURKEY (Istanbul, Turkey) _ All eyes turned Thursday toward
a small island in the Sea of Marmara where the Turks' most hated
enemy is being held prisoner. The principal Kurdish guerrilla
leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is now the sole prisoner on the island of
Imrali. Naval boats have been deployed around Imrali, which lies 35
miles southwest of Istanbul, and military helicopters patrol
overhead. By Stephen Kinzer. With map.

   INDIA-CHRISTIANS (Gandhinagar, India) _ Despite the hostility to
Christians in Gujarat, where Hindu militants have attacked dozens
of Christian prayer halls and schools over the last year, several
Hindu nationalist leaders have chosen to have their offspring
educated by those same reviled Roman Catholic missionaries, who
happen to have a reputation for running some of the finest schools
in the state. By Celia W. Dugger. With photo and map.

   MEXICO-DRUGS-MUSIC (San Luis Potosi, Mexico) _ The Tucanes are
one of the most successful of hundreds of Mexican country bands
whose lyrics chronicle drug traffickers' daily lives and violent
routines. The extraordinary popularity of their music here and in
the United States underscores the profound roots the drug industry
has sunk into North American popular culture, suggesting that
millions of fans quietly admire the smugglers' fabled wealth,
anti-establishment bravura and bold entrepreneurial skills. By Sam

   NY-IMMIGRANT-VOICES (New York) _ Blacks' fear of the police, and
whites' struggle to understand it, is not a new story. But with
crime lower than it has been in a generation in New York City, the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, a West African immigrant, has become a
new lens through which people view their relationships with the
police, and the stark contrasts that mark life in the city's
disparate but connected communities. By Ginger Thompson and Jodi
Wilgoren. With photos.

<P>
   CRUISE-LOOPHOLES (Miami) _ Doing business under a decades-old
loophole in the tax code, the growing cruise ship industry pays no
income taxes in the United States even though its companies are
based here and 90 percent of its passengers are Americans. The
industry also does not observe the nation's labor laws, minimum
wage law and many environmental and safety regulations. By Douglas
Frantz. With photo.

<P>
   ELEPHANTS-VIRUS (Undated) _ The death of a much-loved baby
elephant at the National Zoo in 1995 of a previously unknown virus
that researchers think is a major cause of death worldwide among
young elephants in captivity, and a serious threat to their
conservation in zoos. Discovery of the virus has also led to the
identification of a drug that can cure the illness, but it is not
an ideal solution. Part of the problem apparently stems from mixing
African and Asian elephants, which are separate species, in
captivity. By Denise Grady.

   CALIF-BIAS (Novato, Calif.) _ People have painted Novato, a
Marin County town, as a county aberration, a place where hate
crimes happen. But Cynthia Murray, a Marin County supervisor from
Novato, said that perception was not reality. ``One of the things
that is happening is that we take hate crimes very seriously,'' Ms.
Murray said. ``It has given us a reputation for having bias
incidents. We sort of get punished for reporting every incident
that other towns wouldn't.'' By Evelyn Nieves. With photo and map.

<P>
   EMBASSY-SECURITY (Washington) _ The retired chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff who led a State Department investigation of
bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa last summer said on
Thursday that the department is so frightened of seeking money from
Congress that other embassies could be left vulnerable to terrorist
attacks. Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. said the embassy security budget
that the State Department requested this month was clearly
inadequate and would leave American diplomats abroad vulnerable. By

<P>
   ACCOUNTANT-SHORTAGE (New York) _ From Georgetown University to
the University of Colorado, the number of students graduating with
accounting degrees this spring will be only half of what it was a
few years ago. The profession's largest and most powerful group has
proposed a plan aimed at making the job more attractive by, in
part, reducing the requirements. But some accountants, regulators
and investors adamantly oppose that plan, saying it makes about as
much sense as lowering the standards for emergency-room nurses or
police officers. By Melody Petersen. With graphic.

<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Using internal company
documents and sworn depositions in the Microsoft trial, a
government lawyer was able Thursday to depict Compaq Computer Corp.

abandoned the software products it preferred in favor of
Microsoft's offerings. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   BANKBOSTON-BRAZIL (Boston) _ BankBoston, the oldest bank in the
nation, is being buffeted by fears that Brazil's economic crisis
may overwhelm it. The bank has also been embarrassed by financial
scandal, trading losses and an untimely and expensive acquisition.
Its stock has plunged from its 52-week high at a time when mergers
are sweeping the banking industry, and as a result, the bank is now
seen by many analysts as takeover bait. By Timothy L. O'Brien. With

TV GOLF: IT'S NO EASY PAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By rough estimate, there will be slightly more
than a bajillion hours of professional golf on network, cable and
security-camera television in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, will attempt to include every practice swing,
tee shot, fairway chip and curling putt of Tiger Woods and David
Duval.
</P>
<P>
   And if they're leading that particular tournament, so much the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the story, week in and week out, and you've got to
show them because people want to know how they shoot, poor or
great,'' said CBS' coordinating producer for golf Lance Barrow. He
spoke in his trailer just up from the 18th hole at the Riviera
Country Club on Wednesday during a rare break in preparation for
this weekend's coverage of the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has been on the Woods-Duval story the past four weeks. Woods
didn't cooperate much at last week's Buick Invitational at Torrey
Pines. He shot a course-record 62 Saturday but finished his round
five minutes before the network went on the air at noon with its
three-hour live coverage.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the two will match each other shot-for-shot on
USA Network's CBS-produced coverage of today's second round
(ridiculously tape-delayed for the second day in a row at 4 p.m.),
then finish high enough on the leaderboard to make the
live-coverage window Saturday (noon to 3 p.m.) and Sunday (1 to 3
p.m.) for the network presentation with Jim Nantz and Ken Venturi
in the 18th-hole tower.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to advancements in microwave technology, a network like
CBS can cover them anywhere on the course.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Riviera course designer George Thomas had TV in
mind when he created this 18-hole playground down in a dry river
bed in the Palisades in the early '20s. Not until the 1953 Los
Angeles Open did TV cameras even venture in, and that was only for
local coverage by ABC over L.A. affiliate KECA.
</P>
<P>
   (Historical sidenote: Arnold Palmer's victory in the 1966 Los
Angeles Open, played that year at Rancho Park, was the first
network-wide coverage of a golf tournament, albeit in
black-and-white. Color TV cameras were used the next year, again at
Rancho, again won by Palmer.)
</P>
<P>
   Up until about four years ago, a course like Riviera could only
be televised on the back nine. An eight- or nine-camera team was
tied to cables, except for the occasional good blimp angle to cover
a particular hole (such as the blind-shot 18th tee, where CBS still
uses a camera on top of a firetruck crane to follow the ball into
the fairway).
</P>
<P>
   Now, with up to 16 cameras at Barrow's beck and call for
director Steve Milton and associate director Jim Rikhoff, all
within clear range to feed pictures and sounds to one of several
100-foot microwave towers around the course, it'd be difficult for
anyone on the field to slip by unnoticed from camera view or from
course reporters Gary McCord, Bobby Clampett, Peter Oosterhuis,
David Feherty or Peter Kostis.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the updated technology, particularly with the
conversion to digital, CBS is using larger production trucks this
year, which made finding a place just to park the half-dozen units
at Riviera's cozy little facility that much more of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes golf, believe it or not, probably the
toughest live sport to cover, according to Barrow, who does his
share of college basketball and auto racing for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the two hours you might be on the air, there are no
breaks,'' Barrow said. ``There are no confined areas and play is
going all the time. And it sounds like nothing to the average
viewer, but the toughest thing is when we decide to go to a
commercial. You could miss five great shots during a break, so when
you come back, you have them all cued up on tape, and while you're
showing those, you're missing five more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the case of trying to cover Woods last Saturday, his
entire round is on tape and Barrow has to decide when to duck in a
highlight reel of Woods' best shots to show during the live window.
</P>
<P>
   And you gotta show Tiger, right?
</P>
<P>
   Time after time: This year, CBS bumped up its golf schedule to
24 events. But after this weekend, the crew won't convene again
until the second week in April for coverage of the Masters because
of the network's commitment to the NCAA college basketball
tournament through March.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the live action, CBS has added two 15-minute
highlight shows for several tournaments (including the Nissan) to
air Thursday and Friday nights after ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' that Rikhoff and Chris Svendsen help pull together with
golf bards McCord and Feherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about this while I was on a plane the other
day,'' said Barrow, who was killing time on a flight last month to
produce the AFC Championship Game for CBS in Denver. ``From the
first of February until the end of August, we'll do 82 golf shows.
Add in the late-night, and it's 98 shows. In years past, we'd
arrive at the course on Thursday, rehearse on Friday, then cover
Saturday and Sunday. Most of the time now (with the cable partner
doing the first two rounds), it's arrive Tuesday, plan Wednesday
and shoot for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge golf fan, so I enjoy all this, but....''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of hours, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

WHAT SMOKES

   _Although it seems preposterous to consider ``The Miracle on

They're talking about now going back to 5:35 p.m. with a half-hour
pregame show. Although ESPN's ``Sunday Night Football'' ratings
were up, kickoff might also be moved to 5:35 p.m. Sure, it'll help
some with folks who are getting off work, but the real reason the
ratings fell flat last year was the blowouts. Don't confuse viewers
any more than they already are with more kickoff changes.

SALUTE TO WHITTINGHAM IS NO RETIREMENT PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Men like Charlie Whittingham never get
retirement dinners, and it's not because they don't deserve the
toasts and testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't retire,'' said Jack Mandato, a thoroughbred owner
who's been a friend of Whittingham for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   So Mandato, co-owner of Charlie G's Prime Steak House, is giving
the Hall of Fame trainer something just as good, a dinner Monday
night to mark the dedication of a room in his name at the recently
opened restaurant in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   The room is decorated with plaques and winner's circle photos
from some of the 600 stakes victories recorded by Whittingham, who
has ruled the sport for decades like a racetrack Bear Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Given his accomplishments _ three Eclipse Awards for training,
11 national champions, two Kentucky Derby winners, eight Santa
Anita Handicap winners, etc. _ you could fill a shopping-mall food
court with Whittingham memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is Charlie one of a kind and probably one of the best
there ever was or will be in his profession, but he's also one hell
of a man,'' said Mandato, of Westlake Village. ``He's the most
unassuming legend I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, he's not retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham, who will be 86 on April 13, has been battered in
recent months by the loss of sight in one eye, by a bout with
pneumonia, and by a fall last week that left him with a fractured
right elbow and two black eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You oughta see the other guy,'' he jokes when he pulls off his
dark glasses to reveal the bruises to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the pneumonia, which forced his longest absence from
the track since his days as a World War II Marine, the maladies
haven't kept him away from his Santa Anita barn.
</P>
<P>
   He's still out of bed at 3:30 a.m. The difference is that he
doesn't get to the track until after dawn now _ wife Peggy drives _
to avoid the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything else (but racing),'' Whittingham said
wryly. ``Staying in bed's not very enjoyable after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittingham doesn't do the hands-on horsemanship anymore. But he
doesn't have to. Son Michael moved his own horses into Charlie's
barn last spring and acts as assistant trainer. Pony rider Jeanie
Lockett doubles as a steadying hand for the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Between Charlie's and Michael's horses, the barn is alive with
19 runners, plus a well-fed Australian Shepherd named Ferdinand
after Whittingham's 1986 Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's horses won only 10 races in 1998. But just when you
thought he was fading away, he sent an 8-1 shot to the Gulfstream
Park Breeders' Cup Sprint Championship in Florida last Saturday and
the horse came within an unlucky neck of winning the $200,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, a son of Ferdinand, is co-owned by Mandato, who named
him Young at Heart in a nod to Whittingham and an octogenarian
uncle. Young at Heart's mother is Bannockburn, a freakishly fast
sprinter who happened to be the first horse Whittingham trained for
Mandato.
</P>
<P>
   They met in 1980 when Mandato was running his fleet-management
consulting firm in Maryland and Whittingham was visiting Laurel
Race Course to run Perrault in the Washington D.C. International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who, I think, has trained for the Queen and
people like that, but he always made sure I was taken care of at
the track, always made sure I was invited to dinner because he knew
I didn't know anybody (in California),'' Mandato said, explaining
his affection.
</P>
<P>
   Others relate tales of Whittingham's harder edge with equal
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Like when Charlie was due to get out of the hospital after 12
days in December, and Michael was late arriving to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, is that you?'' said Charlie, who'd been dozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the (bleep), did you take the bus?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who made his own mark on the sport by training 1986
Breeders' Cup Classic winner Skywalker, had resisted the idea of
working with his father, preferring to establish his own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have done it years ago,'' said Michael, 52. ``I never
realized how great it is to be around him all the time. I'm
savoring every moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael isn't sure if his dad has come to grips with the
possibility he has trained his last champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knows he's winding down,'' the son said. ``Of
course, he might get some (good) horses and that could change. He's
been up and down many times in his life. He's always been an
optimist. That's what's kept him strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandato hopes 150 people _ including jockeys, trainers and other
racetrack stars _ will attend Monday's dinner. Tickets are $125, to
be donated to the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund for injured and
ill riders. Information: (818) 654-0387.
</P>
<P>
   71 days to the Derby: The week's fork in the road for Kentucky
Derby candidates is the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream. At
midweek, the probables included Aly's Alley, Casanova Star, Cat
Thief, Certain, Doneraile Court, Grits'n Hard Toast, Legal Street,
The Groom is Red and Vicar.
</P>
<P>
   News of other 3-year-olds:
</P>
<P>
   _Unbeaten colt Cape Canaveral, trained by D. Wayne Lukas,
suffered a stress fracture to his right front shin and will miss
the Kentucky Derby, Bloomberg News reported. He could return to
racing by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   _Epic Honor became this year's Northern California hope by
adding the Golden State Mile at Bay Meadows on Monday to his Golden
Gate Derby win last month. The colt and jockey Lonnie Meche had a
rough trip to a three-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   _Bob and Beverly Lewis' Straight Man debuted with a four-length
victory in 1:08.82 for 6 furlongs Sunday at Santa Anita. That eased
the sting for trainer Bob Baffert of Finder's Gold's last-place
finish in his first try against winners earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   _Baffert's champion filly Silverbulletday makes her '99 debut at
the New Orleans Fair Grounds in Saturday's Davona Dale. Gary
Stevens rides.
</P>
<P>
   _Bobby Frankel-trained Honest Lady will face colts _ including
Baffert's Prime Timber _ in the Feb. 28 San Rafael at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (going into Thursday): Alex Solis,
39 winners; David Flores, 32; Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay, 29;
Gary Stevens, 26. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 21; Bobby Frankel, 12; Ron
McAnally, 11; Vladimir Cerin and Richard Mandella,
10.!tvspt2!Handicapper helper:!off! Front-running horses held on to
win a perfectly normal 7 of 28 races at Santa Anita over the
three-day weekend. But look closer: Pacesetters in 6-furlong races
won 5 of 6; pacesetters at other distances on dirt and turf won 2
of 22.
</P>
<P>
   On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $100,000 Boo
La Boo Stakes, 3-year-old fillies bred in California, 6 furlongs,
and $75,000 San Marino Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1\ miles on
turf; Sunday, $125,000 Las Flores Handicap, fillies and mares 4 and
up, 6 furlongs. At Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $200,000 Fountain of
Youth, 3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles. At the Fair Grounds: Saturday,
$125,000 Davona Dale, 3-year-old fillies, 1 mile 70 yards; Sunday,
$125,000 Risen Star, 3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Mileposts: Official word is expected in March that the 2000
Breeders' Cup will be held at Santa Anita.... The 1998 Eclipse
Awards for horses and humans were evenly spread geographically _
seven winners were based in Southern California, seven in the 49
other states and Canada. The bad local news: Skip Away was the
fifth straight Horse of the Year from outside SoCal, which had
dominated.... The U.S. team was named for the March 21
international jockey competition at Santa Anita: Kent Desormeaux,
Julie Krone, Chris McCarron and Mike Smith.... Whitney Tower, the
former Sports Illustrated racing writer who became president and
chairman of the racing Hall of Fame, died last week at 75.... Santa
Anita said it will offer its only ``guaranteed'' pick-six of the
season March 6, the day of the Santa Anita Handicap. If the pool
doesn't reach $1 million, the track will make up the difference. In
a new wrinkle, there would be a carryover instead of a mandatory
payout if nobody has six winners.... John Shirreffs won with seven
straight starters before Weather's eighth-place finish on Saturday
stopped the trainer one short of matching Laz Barrera's Santa
Anita-record streak.... Jockey Isaias Enriquez was happy to end his
streak _ he was 0 for 72 at Santa Anita before Luckyisforever's
victory Friday.... Two wins Monday put Laffit Pincay within 131 of
Bill Shoemaker's career record.... Chris Antley, making a comeback,
rode Winning Crusader on Sunday to the jockey's first Santa Anita
victory since 1997.... Former Hollywood Park exec Rick Baedeker has
another new position. He has gone from VP of marketing for the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association to a similar job with the
Television Games Network. TVG is the yet-to-be-seen 24-hour racing
channel.... Gulfstream Park near Miami plans to review videotape to
correct the clockings of 20 to 30 races whose official times have
been found to be slow by as much as four-fifths of a second (or
about four lengths) because of a system operator's error....
Gulfstream leader Jorge Chavez rode six winners Saturday, one short
of Jerry Bailey's track record.... Blue-collar Hawthorne Race
Course near Chicago opens today for 203 days of racing, the first
95 run by neighboring Sportsman's Park, which is being redone as a
horse and auto racetrack.

NORTHRIDGE TAKES OFF TOWARD TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the fact, LaShaunda Fowler laughed
sheepishly. But in the heat of the moment, she couldn't contain her
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   With the sound system blaring ``Celebration,'' Fowler pulled off
her Cal State Northridge basketball jersey and twirled it in the
air as if it were a cheer towel as she walked off the court,
completely satisfied with the Matadors' 80-58 Big Sky Conference
victory Thursday over Eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, a 5-foot-6 sophomore guard, scored a career-best 19
points and seven rebounds, tying career marks with seven field
goals and two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to win,'' she said in explaining her postgame
actions, ``because we have a good chance to be Big Sky champs.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Northridge (16-7, 10-3) into a three-way tie
for first place with idle Montana State and Portland State, which
lost Thursday to Northern Arizona. Portland State plays at
Northridge on Saturday at 7 p.m., but the players knew all they had
to do was win their final four games to clinch the school's first
Big Sky crown and host the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they only have to beat Portland State and Weber State on
Thursday to clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Amari led the Matadors with 25 points _ 20 in the first
half _ and backup post player Leah Rice added a career-best 17
points, all in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Fowler who stepped forward and took over for guard
Edniesha Curry, who scored a season-low five points and played just
nine minutes after dislocating a finger in her left (non-shooting)
hand. Curry entered the game leading the conference with a
19.1-point average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edniesha's out, so someone had to step up and fill her big
role,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge coach Frozena Jerro was excited it was Fowler. In
practice, Fowler often passes on the open shot, and Jerro has been
yelling at her to look at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that the Matadors worked on a baseline jumper
play for much of the week. Fowler scored most of her points from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a breakthrough game,'' Jerro said. ``This was the one
we've been waiting for. She's been trying to get her game under
control. What you saw was some maturity. Instead of trying to force
things, she took what the defense gave her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro also was pleased with Rice, a freshman who surpassed her
previous point total by five points. She scored 13 of her team's 15
points in one 6:22 span and also grabbed five rebounds, one shy of
her career best.
</P>

   Northridge came out strong and forced 19 first-half turnovers,
many in the open court, and turned a 7-6 game into a 33-13 rout

   The Turks are cock-a-hoop. The man who for nearly 15 years has
orchestrated a bloody revolt in the country's Kurdish southeast has
been snatched abroad _ in Kenya _ and whisked back to Turkey to
face charges of fomenting murder and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Turkey's politicians and to read its press, you
would think that, with Abdullah Ocalan behind bars, the civil war,
which has cost more than 30,000 lives, is all but over; that the
Kurds have been definitively squashed; and that successive Turkish
governments' misguided policy of denying the Kurds the right to
express, however peacefully, a desire for some kind of
self-government has been wondrously vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, any of it. A lasting peace can be forged only if the
Kurds, especially but not only in Turkey, are given the fair deal
that has so far been denied them.
</P>
<P>
   In its moment of seeming triumph, the Turkish government would
be wise to offer just such a deal. Then Turks and Kurds alike could
look forward to a better future.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's capture certainly provides an opportunity for the
reassessment on both sides that is needed before any settlement
becomes imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, it is true, the events of the past few days give
little evidence that a spirit of reason or compromise can be
applied to what is certainly a complex issue _ one, indeed, that
has plunged the Greek government into crisis, after allegations
that some of its ministers had colluded in Ocalan's entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   But, emotional and confusing as the kidnapping has been, it
might just possibly prove to be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 million or so Kurds are perhaps the world's biggest
stateless nation. They find themselves scattered across four
countries _ Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria _ none of which is noted
for polished human rights or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds are unlikely to feel contented in any of these
countries, even if their governments became models of moderation,
without a generous measure of autonomy in the regions in which they
predominate. That needs to be understood by those who now resist
the Kurdish call for self-government.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, however, the Kurds need to recognize that there
is no political room in the Middle East, at present or in the
foreseeable future, for an independent state of Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   For Kurdish nationalists, the Ocalan episode may have brought
home that uncomfortable reality. It has shown the Kurdistan
Workers' Party, better known by its Kurdish initials, PKK, how
short it is of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Greece, Turkey's eternal antagonist, wanted to
give Ocalan a haven. Turkey's army has been containing the Kurdish
rebellion in southeastern Turkey, where most of the country's 15
million or so Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or two, the rate of killing has subsided.
Emergency rule in several provinces has been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider context the balance of power has shifted in Turkey's
favor, too. The United States still sees Turkey as a vital ally in
its campaign to strangle Saddam Hussein's Iraq. And, by cozying up
to Israel, Turkey has been able to squeeze Syria _ which is partly
why, last autumn, Ocalan, who had long been based in Syria, was
forced to seek exile elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All this meant that, even before the snatching of their leader,
Turkey's Kurds were having to rethink their aims and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sign of that came in the more conciliatory tune that Ocalan
had begun to sing. It had not, however, beguiled everyone: Ocalan
has a brutal, capricious and autocratic record, even within his own
movement.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest robs the PKK of a charismatic strategist, but at
least it may allow the group to refashion itself in a more
civilized, democratic and peaceful guise _ and to renounce violent
secession as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Why, though, should Turkey, boosted recently in the battlefield,
bolstered by allies old and new, and flush with joy at Ocalan's
arrest, now change its policy and consider giving the Kurds the
right of self-expression?
</P>
<P>
   First, because this latest change of fortune may not be
decisive. Many of the remaining guerrillas will hunker down in
their mountain fastnesses; they will not give up, not yet anyway.
They may even turn to terror in Turkish cities farther west, where
millions of Kurds have settled.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though Turkey's Kurds are by no means always friendly
with their cousins in northern Iraq, the Iraqi minority now has the
core of an autonomous entity there, under the protection of the
same Americans who often seem willing to wink at the repression of
Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Turkey should realize that it will never achieve its
oft-stated goal of becoming a full member of the European Union
until it shows a greater respect for the rights of its own citizens
and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Turkey will have to change its opposition to
peaceful Kurdish desires for self-expression (such as the ability
to run schools and make broadcasts in Kurdish) if it is ever to
persuade the West that it is a full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the shortest run, the least Turkey can do is to ensure
that Ocalan is given a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help. The Kurdish problem has now, de facto, been
internationalized. Taking matters further, the European Union, with
American backing, could offer a forum for Turks and Kurds to seek a
compromise involving Kurdish self-rule in southeastern Turkey, if
that is what the Kurds want.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the Turks will reject such an idea. But the
Kurds will not go away. If they are not to have a state, they
deserve at least a modicum of self-government and justice. &QL;

LATE BIRDIES SALVAGE PAR FOR SANDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Sanday's previous appearance in a PGA Tour event was last
year's Buick Invitational, in which he shot a 9-under-par 63 and
was tied for second after the first round. But a lot has changed
since then.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is Sanday isn't playing the North Course
at Torrey Pines, where he shot his memorable 63. He is at storied
Riviera Country Club, site of this week's Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sanday, a resident of South Pasadena and a graduate of Cal State
Northridge, got a first-hand look at Riviera's challenges Thursday
and shot an even-par 71. It could have been worse, but he birdied
two of his last three holes to salvage a good score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel content with even par, because it was starting to get
away from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started his round with a birdie from three feet on the par-4,
315-yard 10th hole, but he bogeyed the 11th after driving into the
rough and finished his first nine holes in 1-over 37. He then
birdied the par-5, 503-yard first hole but followed that with
back-to-back bogeys and felt frustration creeping into his game.
</P>
<P>
   Sanday recovered but not before another test of his patience. He
hit what he called ``a perfect 2-iron'' through the green on the
par-3, 236-yard fourth hole, but he got up and down for par after a
difficult chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit the 2-iron, I thought, `How do you make a par out
here?''' Sanday said. ``It was getting frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to play some of his best golf. He birdied the par-4
seventh hole from three feet and the par-4 eighth hole from eight
feet, and lipped out a 15-footer for birdie on the par-4, 420-yard
ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I started to feel good after I made the par on
(number) four and hit the fairway on five,'' he said. ``I changed
something in my alignment and I hit the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there, I pretty much didn't miss any shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanday and his caddy, Alhambra's Joe Citro, said hitting the
fairways made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he did that, he got it close to the hole,'' Citro said.
``That was the key. Late in the round, he hit the fairways ... on
those two (late) birdies, he had wedges into the green. It made it
a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course, I don't think, is that hard,'' said Sanday,
who pointed out he has played only two rounds at Riviera _ one in
practice and one Thursday. ``If you hit the fairway, it's not that
hard. If you miss the fairway, you're dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough is clumpy and the ball will sit down. You can't even
get to the green from 150 yards. You just don't have enough power
to get it there. You hit the fairway, it's not like you'll hit a
4-iron into every hole. You'll hit a lot of wedges and 9-irons,
even 7-irons. You can shoot low.''

FORGET `FRANKENSTEIN FOOD' SCARES; GMOS ARE NO MONSTERS

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sight of the British press in a fit of moral panic is rarely
edifying. But over the past few days, with headlines about
``Frankenstein foods'' gracing the front pages of even supposedly
highbrow newspapers, the country has witnessed a particularly
dispiriting example.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are often
unthinking in their arguments. Solutions devised for one failing
are attacked for making another worse.
</P>
<P>
   Put a gene into a plant to make it infertile, so the change is
incapable of ``escaping,'' for instance, and you are accused of
stopping seed-planting for next year. Or make a plant insect-proof,
and you are damned for encouraging a more resistant strain of
insect.
</P>
<P>
   These issues are too important, many appear to believe, for
logic and science to play a part. That said, the intelligible
objections to GMOs need to be addressed, not merely dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   They are mainly of two kinds: the claim that GMOs are bad for
the environment and the claim that they are bad for human health.
</P>
<P>
   If GMOs are bad for the environment, it is likely to be in the
same ways as normal agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   They may tip the balance of nature further in farmers' direction
by allowing them to capture the maximum amount of sunlight falling
on fields, and then to keep most of the resulting plant material
for their own use. That means less for wildlife _ and so less
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although preserving wildlife is a laudable aim, it is
better done explicitly, and not by expecting farmers to act against
their interests. Besides, many GMOs require less in the way of
pesticides and herbicides, which should bring significant
environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As for human health, the hoohah in Britain obscures the fact
that there is simply no good evidence that the technology used to
create GMOs is damaging in any way.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that individual products will never be
unhealthy. But it does mean that GMOs should be approached on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   There may be scope for giving people more information through
labelling; and it would help if genetically modified food offered
more obvious advantages to consumers than a redder tomato.
</P>
<P>
   But blanket bans or moratoriums would be harmful, for even the
limited range of genetically modified crops that is now available
is starting to offer real and concrete advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in Britain has also obscured something else _ that the
really important story about GMOs is being played out in Colombia.
Delegates from 170 countries met in Cartagena this week to work out
an international ``Biosafety Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Their aim is to create guidelines that make trade in GMOs
(mainly crops) possible, but also sensitive to justified concerns
about safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying conflict in these talks is economic: between
those who wish to promote agricultural industries by fostering
trade, and those who wish to protect farmers by inhibiting it.
</P>
<P>
   World trade rules stipulate that safety measures affecting trade
must be based on science, not on popular fears. That is a good
principle, but it is being flouted. Europe's ban on hormone-treated
beef from America is an early, worrying, example.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization has ruled against the ban on the
ground that there is no scientific evidence that the hormones are
dangerous; yet the EU is showing little sign of lifting it.
</P>
<P>
   A way needs to be found to stop scientific or pseudoscientific
differences from poisoning the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign from Cartagena is that delegations are not
falling into traditional rich- and poor-country camps. Argentina
and Mexico are lining up with America in favor of free trade.
Though they are poor by western standards, they see advantages in
embracing GMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Other poor countries should remember the ``green revolution'' of
the 1950s and 1960s, itself based on new botanical technologies.
Claims that GMOs may mean a second green revolution are
exaggerated. But history suggests that new agricultural techniques
do more good than harm; hindering their adoption would be foolish. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The sight of the British press in a fit of moral panic is rarely
edifying. But over the past few days, with headlines about
``Frankenstein foods'' gracing the front pages of even supposedly
highbrow newspapers, the country has witnessed a particularly
dispiriting example.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are often
unthinking in their arguments. Solutions devised for one failing
are attacked for making another worse.
</P>
<P>
   Put a gene into a plant to make it infertile, so the change is
incapable of ``escaping,'' for instance, and you are accused of
stopping seed-planting for next year. Or make a plant insect-proof,
and you are damned for encouraging a more resistant strain of
insect.
</P>
<P>
   These issues are too important, many appear to believe, for
logic and science to play a part. That said, the intelligible
objections to GMOs need to be addressed, not merely dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   They are mainly of two kinds: the claim that GMOs are bad for
the environment and the claim that they are bad for human health.
</P>
<P>
   If GMOs are bad for the environment, it is likely to be in the
same ways as normal agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   They may tip the balance of nature further in farmers' direction
by allowing them to capture the maximum amount of sunlight falling
on fields, and then to keep most of the resulting plant material
for their own use. That means less for wildlife _ and so less
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although preserving wildlife is a laudable aim, it is
better done explicitly, and not by expecting farmers to act against
their interests. Besides, many GMOs require less in the way of
pesticides and herbicides, which should bring significant
environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As for human health, the hoohah in Britain obscures the fact
that there is simply no good evidence that the technology used to
create GMOs is damaging in any way.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that individual products will never be
unhealthy. But it does mean that GMOs should be approached on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   There may be scope for giving people more information through
labelling; and it would help if genetically modified food offered
more obvious advantages to consumers than a redder tomato.
</P>
<P>
   But blanket bans or moratoriums would be harmful, for even the
limited range of genetically modified crops that is now available
is starting to offer real and concrete advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The panic in Britain has also obscured something else _ that the
really important story about GMOs is being played out in Colombia.
Delegates from 170 countries met in Cartagena this week to work out
an international ``Biosafety Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Their aim is to create guidelines that make trade in GMOs
(mainly crops) possible, but also sensitive to justified concerns
about safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying conflict in these talks is economic: between
those who wish to promote agricultural industries by fostering
trade, and those who wish to protect farmers by inhibiting it.
</P>
<P>
   World trade rules stipulate that safety measures affecting trade
must be based on science, not on popular fears. That is a good
principle, but it is being flouted. Europe's ban on hormone-treated
beef from America is an early, worrying, example.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization has ruled against the ban on the
ground that there is no scientific evidence that the hormones are
dangerous; yet the EU is showing little sign of lifting it.
</P>
<P>
   A way needs to be found to stop scientific or pseudoscientific
differences from poisoning the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
   One encouraging sign from Cartagena is that delegations are not
falling into traditional rich- and poor-country camps. Argentina
and Mexico are lining up with America in favor of free trade.
Though they are poor by western standards, they see advantages in
embracing GMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Other poor countries should remember the ``green revolution'' of
the 1950s and 1960s, itself based on new botanical technologies.
Claims that GMOs may mean a second green revolution are
exaggerated. But history suggests that new agricultural techniques
do more good than harm; hindering their adoption would be foolish. &QL;

STANFORD STOMPS WASHINGTON, 89-57 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There were airballs and errant passes, too many
mistakes and not enough field goals. For the first time this
season, Washington lost a game at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's defeat was not that surprising, coming as it
did to Stanford, the seventh-ranked team in the country. But the
disparity was: Stanford 89, Washington 57. If the game is any
indication, there are many miles between first place and fourth
place in the Pac-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, posting its biggest win ever over the Huskies in
Seattle, improved to 11-2 and maintained a one-game lead over
Arizona. The Huskies dropped to 8-6 and are now in precarious
territory. They fell one game behind the third-place Bruins and are
still in the NCAA Tournament picture.
</P>
<P>
   But Cal arrives tomorrow afternoon for what is suddenly a
crucial game. It is one of four remaining, and the Huskies (15-9)
probably will need to go 3-1, perhaps 2-2 to secure a tournament
bid. They play at USC and UCLA next week followed by a home finale
against Washington State on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   If the selection committee members were watching Thursday night,
they would have seen an overmatched team that lacked the firepower
to contend with Stanford. Supposedly vulnerable in light of their
recent play, the Cardinal looked ready for the tournament to begin.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in some time, the Huskies looked sloppy. They
weren't crisp, they didn't rebound, they fumbled the ball and
basically were humbled by a superior team.
</P>
<P>
   In one sequence that captured the evening, Todd MacCulloch lost
control of the ball, flopped to the floor in an attempt to retrieve
it, and watched as Kris Weems picked it up and went the distance
for a layin. A few minutes later, MacCulloch threw a bounce pass to
Grant Leep, hitting him right in the chest. The problem was that
Leep was seated on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get the ball and I'd just throw it to the other team,''
said MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 13 points in the first 20 minutes, MacCulloch did
not even take a shot in the second half. All he took was abuse. The
foursome of Mark Seaton, Jarron Collins, Tim Young and Mark Madsen
unsettled the Husky center.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen was productive at the other end as well, converting
putbacks and leading Stanford with 15 points. He shot an air ball
from the line but otherwise offered positive contributions. When
there were nudges on the floor, Madsen was usually the deliverer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just pushed me off the block and got me farther away
where it's harder for me to make moves,'' MacCulloch said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Huskies made moves Thursday night, they were
ill-advised or off-balance. Stanford caused the disjointed effort
with its conference-leading defense, but Washington was expected to
counter with its own weapons. Aside from Donald Watts, who had 18
points, the Huskies did not have a perimeter game. Deon Luton and
Senque Carey both went 2-for-8.
</P>
<P>
   Neither took good shots because none was to be found, not with
the Huskies hastily running their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got impatient and tried to create a lot of 1-on-1 stuff,''
coach Bob Bender said. ``We've never been effective doing that.
Everybody was trying to get us out of the hole and then it
escalated from there.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared ominous at halftime when Stanford led 45-31. The
Cardinal had trailed at halftime in their previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Then when Washington opened the second half in a zone, Weems
busted a 3-pointer that continued the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   The key development was evident early when Stanford began to
overwhelm Washington on the glass. The Cardinal finished with a
48-25 advantage. No one assisted MacCulloch, who collected 10.
Collins came off the bench to provide nine of his 10 rebounds in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was ordinary for the first time since he took over the
starting job 12 games ago. Stanford senior Arthur Lee outdueled the
Husky freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like he had control of his team a little more than I
had control of mine,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   With its relentless rebounding and defense, Stanford dominated.
In the first half, the Huskies went through two scoreless stretches
lasting almost five minutes each. Most of their field-goal attempts
were wild ones. A couple drew gasps instead of iron, like Luton's
misguided 3-point attempt and Carey's shot from the lane.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal contested every cutter and pass. Perhaps the
Huskies weren't out of their league, but they were certainly out of
sync, bobbing and weaving and rarely connecting. Washington hit 4
of its first 18 shots, falling behind 24-13 as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal weren't exactly finding the cylinder either for
awhile, missing nine straight at one point. But they often found
Madsen inside, finally discovering the team that went all the way
to the Final Four last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road this is as good as you can ask for,'' said
Stanford forward Peter Sauer. ``Not many people beat Washington
here by 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end when Watts went to the bench and watched the
reserves play it out, he wondered: ``How did we let this happen.
Why didn't we perform better.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the Huskies' lack of intensity, particularly on
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding is not really a skill thing,'' he said. ``It's
something that involves heart. We didn't play with heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Or much direction. Washington will be back at practice today,
preparing for Cal, hoping to rebound in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to figure out the answers, and we've got to figure
them out fast,'' Watts said.

STANFORD PROVES WASHINGTON IS OUT OF ITS LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fans of local hoops are having a bad week.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Sonics wobble through two games of hideous
offense, the University of Washington men's team Thursday night
under-did their pro counterparts so dramatically that the thought
of a Vin Baker free throw actually lightened the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too early to entertain water-cooler discussion about the
Mariners' No. 5 spot in the rotation?
</P>
<P>
   OK, one bad week doesn't end a season (even if the NBA season is
only three weeks long). But Thursday night at Hec Ed, the Huskies
had a game that stunk so badly it might have bent light rays, never
mind postseason prospects.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of things happen with college kids. But with the
expectations created by eight wins in the past 10 games, including
triumphs over ranked Pac-10 Conference foes UCLA and Arizona, the
Huskies figured to at least cause Stanford a fair degree of
annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cardinal barely had to dampen its garments with
sweat in order to dispatch Washington, 89-57. Fortunately for the
Huskies, a single horrific loss won't cause irreparable damage to
their NCAA tourney hopes. But the outcome left no doubt as to who
was championship material on the West Coast and who was tourney
filler.
</P>
<P>
   And if Washington doesn't snap back abruptly for Saturday's game
here against Cal, it will be NIT filler.
</P>
<P>
   With a packed house anticipating upset and a regional TV
audience figuring entertainment, the Huskies instead emitted a
night-long dial tone. The 32-point loss where they had been
undefeated this season probably was the worst emotional whipping
the Huskies have endured during Bob Bender's six-year tenure as
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very disappointing and frustrating evening,'' said
Bender, his description failing as badly to grasp the enormity of
the evening as the team failed to grasp anything in red.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Cardinal had its way on offense, the defense was
a jaw-dropper. Or perhaps a jaw-breaker. Against a team that had
found an offensive rhythm in recent weeks, Stanford so completely
denied the interior to Washington that Todd MacCulloch, the nearest
thing to money in baggy pants hereabouts, went scoreless the final
22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was by far the best defense I've seen in six years,''
said Bender, whose club shot 36 percent for the game and never
mustered so much as a whisper of a run in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable collection of bones and brains, these Stanford
guys. They came into the game allowing opponents an average of 37.8
percent from the field, so it wasn't exactly a surprise that the
defense was formidable. But the ferocity with which they ripped the
game from the players and the crowd by challenging every UW
thought, much less dribbles or passes, was startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so big, and they played so much harder than we did,''
marveled Senque Carey, who had his freshman comeuppance against
senior star guards Arthur Lee and Kris Weems. In 32 minutes, Carey
had seven meaningless points and two assists. Without Carey
organizing the drill, MacCulloch might as well have been the
Washington Monument for all his scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was trouble when I looked up (at the clock) with
11:36 remaining in the first half, and Todd hadn't touched the
ball,'' said Bender. But it wasn't just the big guy. Every Husky
starter shot at least one airball. It's one thing to chip paint off
the rim with bad shotmaking; it's another to leave the rims shiny
and buffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to move our feet,'' said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, himself mastering the understatement. ``We knew
Washington likes to use a motion offense so we wanted to stay in
front of them and keep hands off so they had to shoot over us.''
</P>
<P>
   The resultant airball festival was breathtaking in its
ineptitude. The Huskies quickly broke down into one-on-one contests
for which they have little aptitude or skill. During the 12-minute
stretch in the first half when the element of contest was
eliminated, the Huskies scored two field goals.
</P>
<P>
   And they were the hottest team in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Who ordered the ice?
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's dominance was so pronounced that it warped time back
to last year when the Huskies were perceived as too soft to prevail
against college basketball's big boys. But the UW success in last
year's NCAAs, coupled with the 3-3 mark against ranked teams this
season, offered evidence that passivity was passe.
</P>
<P>
   The way Mark Madsen, Tim Young and a seemingly endless supply of
reserve big men knocked around the Huskies, the suspicion returned
in locomotive fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it could also be argued that since the Huskies were
similarly roughhoused by second-ranked Connecticut earlier this
season, the seventh-ranked Cardinal demonstrated that the gap
between the top of the NCAA field and the bottom of the bracket is
far broader than anyone knew starting the week.

<P>
   Can justice be counted in money? Yes, comes the answer every
day, from parliaments and congresses, and from the courts that
enforce their laws: a small fine for a parking offense, a bigger
one for theft; damages for negligence; compensation for injury.
</P>
<P>
   So how much for the Holocaust?
</P>
<P>
   Germany has never answered that question directly, but from its
early post-war days it has accepted that only by offering material
restitution as well as expressions of remorse could it prove that
it had broken completely with its Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has paid out fully $60 billion in reparations.
But the demands for more have not stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, indeed, they have grown more insistent, especially in
America, where the collective actions of lawyers, Jewish groups,
politicians and regulators now beset German companies as never
before, and threaten to hold up the takeover of Bankers Trust by
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to put an end to the lawsuits, a dozen prominent
German banks and businesses, backed by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder,
announced this week that they would set up a fund _ it could be
worth more than $2 billion _ to compensate former slave laborers
and others who suffered under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   This will not put an end to the pursuit, however, if only
because it is not only Germans who are being pursued. Several
American companies, for instance, now face claims because their
former German subsidiaries are accused of helping the Nazi war
machine; Ford, General Motors, Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan are
among the well-known names.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's largest insurer, Generali, is beset by claims. Eight
French banks are said still to owe money to Jewish depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Barclays, whose French subsidiary has likewise been
accused, is setting up a $3.6 million fund in response.
</P>
<P>
   Two Austrian banks are likely to pay out much more in
compensation, though nothing like as much as the $1.25 billion that
Switzerland's banks last year agreed to put into a fund for the
heirs of Jewish depositors who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on. Britain has created a small fund to
compensate Jewish refugees interned during the war. France is
producing an inventory of Jewish assets seized during the German
occupation, with a view to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 countries met in Washington in December to try to settle
disputes about assets, notably works of art, stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawsuits are still outstanding: the French state rail
company is being sued by a man whose parents were sent to
Auschwitz, he says, in one of its trains.
</P>
<P>
   Better late _ even 54 years late _ than never? Certainly, that
is the right response where banks or insurance companies have
simply refused to come clean about deposits or policies, and
thereby robbed Holocaust victims or their heirs of what they were
owed.
</P>
<P>
   And, equally certainly, many of the belated payments of
compensation would not have been forthcoming but for legal action.
Nor indeed would much of the information that is needed for the
historical record, without which no accounting, financial or
otherwise, can ever be done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something distasteful about the quest for
``compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessness of some Jewish groups, the ambitions of
American politicians seeking ethnic votes, the class-action suits,
the lawyers' contingency fees: do these really bring justice to
those who survived the Nazi terror, or honor the memory of the 6
million who did not?
</P>
<P>
   Or do they, by seeming to put a price on the Holocaust, reduce
this most terrible of episodes to something more like an everyday
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Several American lawyers say that, despite the new German fund,
they will fight on. They should think again. &QL;

   Two Austrian banks are likely to pay out much more in
compensation, though nothing like as much as the $1.25 billion that
Switzerland's banks last year agreed to put into a fund for the
heirs of Jewish depositors who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on. Britain has created a small fund to
compensate Jewish refugees interned during the war. France is
producing an inventory of Jewish assets seized during the German
occupation, with a view to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 countries met in Washington in December to try to settle
disputes about assets, notably works of art, stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawsuits are still outstanding: the French state rail
company is being sued by a man whose parents were sent to
Auschwitz, he says, in one of its trains.
</P>
<P>
   Better late _ even 54 years late _ than never? Certainly, that
is the right response where banks or insurance companies have
simply refused to come clean about deposits or policies, and
thereby robbed Holocaust victims or their heirs of what they were
owed.
</P>
<P>
   And, equally certainly, many of the belated payments of
compensation would not have been forthcoming but for legal action.
Nor indeed would much of the information that is needed for the
historical record, without which no accounting, financial or
otherwise, can ever be done.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something distasteful about the quest for
``compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessness of some Jewish groups, the ambitions of
American politicians seeking ethnic votes, the class-action suits,
the lawyers' contingency fees: do these really bring justice to
those who survived the Nazi terror, or honor the memory of the 6
million who did not?
</P>
<P>
   Or do they, by seeming to put a price on the Holocaust, reduce
this most terrible of episodes to something more like an everyday
crime?
</P>
<P>
   Several American lawyers say that, despite the new German fund,
they will fight on. They should think again. &QL;

 GROUP SEEKS WARNINGS FOR `GAY' PROGRAMS  &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Christian lobbying group is calling on the federal government
to add a new warning label to television programs _ HC for
``homosexual content.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar to warnings on programs containing violence, sex and
adult language, the HC rating would alert parents to shows that
have ``homosexual situations,'' said Phillip Vaught of the
Christian Action Network in Forest, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Tuesday, Martin Mawyer, the organization's
president, requested a meeting with Federal Communications
Commission Chairman William Kennard to discuss the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Vaught said Thursday that any show with a lesbian or gay
character would need to be slapped with an HC warning.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that would include the Teletubbies _ whose Tinky Winky
was fingered as gay last week by the Rev. Jerry Falwell because
he's purple, has a triangle antenna and carries a purse _ Vaught
replied: ``I don't think that would be necessary because (Tinky's)
not a gay character. At least not the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mawyer released a statement this week complaining of 25
``homosexual characters'' on prime-time television, 12 on NBC
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parents across the country that are sick and tired
of having their living rooms invaded by homosexual characters and
activities on their television,'' Mawyer said. He said he was
shocked to learn that Fox's ``That '70s Show'' recently portrayed
two teenage boys kissing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't end with just the networks,'' he said. ``HBO is
planning to air in June a program called `The Sissy Duckling,'
which they describe as a `fuzzy little yellow bird who learns he's
gay.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mawyer said he is taking his 250,000-member organization's issue
to Congress, every network and to situation comedy producers across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless these producers are trying to promote a secret
agenda,'' he said, ``they should have no problems alerting parents
that their programs contain homosexual content.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC spokesman David Fiske said Thursday that the commission had
not seen Mawyer's letter. He noted that the current television
rating system is based on voluntary industry standards under the
federal Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
   To San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano, who is gay, the
Christian Action Network's proposal is ``again a case of twisted
values. The message is: What's coming up is evil, what's coming up
is less than human.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has feelings about something, but you can't subject
the public to feelings every time you have one,'' Ammiano said.
``Maybe we should have a warning about people like this,'' Ammiano
said, referring to Mawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal policy group People for the American Way said
Thursday that it strongly opposes gay warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're proposing goes far beyond current warning labels
that alert viewers to explicit adult content,'' the group's
president, Carole Shields, said in a statement. ``This is an
obvious attempt to stigmatize an entire group of Americans,''
Shields said. ``The Christian Action Network seeks to put a
slanderous smear on gay and lesbian Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Action Network describes itself as a grassroots,
pro-family organization. The group has lobbied hard for the demise
of the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Mawyer said homosexual content is creeping not only into
programming but into commercials as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``These commercials are called `gay vague' because homosexuals
understand the advertisements are directed toward them,'' he said.
``But the so-called straight community just can't figure it out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the day after his acquittal in the Senate, it was
glibness-as-usual for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week,'' he said in his weekly radio address, ``the
warring parties in Kosovo have been meeting at a 14th-century
castle in France in search of 21st-century peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Savoring the rich sweep of the past, the president proceeded to
enunciate two lessons from history. First, ``World War II taught us
that America could never be secure if Europe's future was in
doubt.'' Second, ``Bosnia taught us...(that) violence we fail to
oppose leads to even greater violence we will have to oppose later
at greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of these two lessons, the president explained, America
should intervene in Kosovo, though there should of course be ``a
clear and realistic strategy to allow us to bring our forces home
when their work is done.''
</P>
<P>
   These standard phrases constitute pretty much all Clinton has to
say about his decision to commit troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, to be sure, that no such force will be
assembled: at midweek the Serbs and the ethnic-Albanian Kosovars
remained some distance from a cease-fire, without which
peacekeepers will stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the two sides opt to keep on fighting, it is worth
pausing to consider the manner in which Clinton declared himself
willing to risk American lives for Balkan peace. It was not all
that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Take, first, the ``lesson'' that America must intervene in
European conflicts early on. If this is really so obvious, why did
Clinton not intervene when the Kosovo bust-up began a year ago?
After all, America had long ago promised to jump into Kosovo at the
first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush warned Serbia's dictator, Slobodan Milosevic,
that America would punish Serbia if it used force against Kosovo's
Albanian majority, and Clinton officials have echoed this threat
loudly and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, for example, Madeleine Albright, the secretary of
state, promised that ``we are not going to stand by and watch the
Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away
with doing in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright also said, that same month, ``The time to stop the
killing is now, before it spreads.'' Yet Clinton, like America's
allies in Europe, dithered.
</P>
<P>
   Second, consider that cozy phrase in the president's Saturday
address about a clear exit strategy. He has ample political reason
to promise one of these: whenever an American president sends
troops abroad, critics accuse him of marching into a Vietnam-style
quagmire, so those critics have to be anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, at the same time, the president's talk of an exit
strategy is dishonest, and consciously so. He knows perfectly well
that no date can be set in advance for the withdrawal of
peacekeepers: in Bosnia, after all, a deadline of one year was set,
but American troops remain in place three years after the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Mrs. Albright appeared on television to explain that
no deadline would be set in the case of Kosovo. So much for an exit
strategy, if Clinton meant a pre-timed one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Kosovo address also failed to explain the general
principles that determine when intervention is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, the president has intervened in
Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. But he has also declined to intervene in
places beset by equally serious wars, such as Chechnya, Liberia,
Sudan, Angola, Burundi, and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of these instances, America had plausible cause to
intervene: it might have felt some moral responsibility to quell
the humanitarian disaster in Liberia, a country invented by America
as a home for its ex-slaves; or in Angola, where America's
ex-Cold-War friend, Jonas Savimbi, is responsible for much of the
current carnage. But no intervention was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plainly feels that European wars threaten American
interests more than far-off African ones; not least because they
worry his European allies, whose cooperation he wants.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, he made the point that violence in Kosovo
might spread into the neighboring countries of Albania and
Macedonia, pouring fresh poison on the relationship between Greece
and Turkey (now rendered even murkier by the Ocalan business),
which are both NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's critics, such as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of
Texas, retort that European wars should be fixed by European
powers. Even if the Hutchison idea is not entirely practical, it
has some political force.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than tackling it explicitly and head-on, Clinton
brushed past, talking soothingly about how America can ``make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's glibness on Kosovo is not an isolated case. It is the
hallmark of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the president has spotted a tough issue, taken
an admirable position on what should be done, and then failed to
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes in freer trade, but lacks the perseverance to
build a constituency for it. He wants to pay America's debts to the
United Nations, but has not persuaded Congress to go along with
this.
</P>
<P>
   Just at the moment, Clinton is preparing to deploy an
anti-missile defense system. But he has not publicly explained why
he has dropped his old opposition to this scheme, or what he means
to do about the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which is relevant to
the nuclear balance with Russia and which may now have to be
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a brilliant student who thinks he can succeed by
pulling an all-nighter at the last minute. This is not the best way
to conduct American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though the Kosovo example is typical, it stands out
for its seriousness. If a NATO force is sent to Kosovo, it may well
have a difficult time: hard-liners on either side will resent the
cease-fire deal, and may take out their frustrations on the hapless
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton official now at the Brookings
Institution, worries that Kosovo might turn into a Somalia-style
mess: American troops will get killed, triggering a hasty
withdrawal and undermining American internationalism for a good
while thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always risks in peacekeeping. America is
strong enough to take these risks on _ provided it has a president
who explains them honestly. &QL;

PUCK GOES KINGS' WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings' 3-2 victory over the
Edmonton Oilers before 11,287 at the Forum on Thursday night might,
or might not, merely be a case of prolonging the agony that has
become Los Angeles' 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the agony of losing to the Oilers just hours after being
lectured by an angry Dave Taylor wasn't a very appealing option.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the type of guy to get angry, so we got the
message,'' said Philippe Boucher, the Kings' unlikely offensive
hero with a career high three points (a goal and two assists).
``Dave told us he believes in us, but it's time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we all knew, but it had to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   A defeat would have left the Kings 10 points out of a playoff
spot and certainly out of the good graces of their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But the bounces were going the Kings' way and they pulled within
six points of the eighth-place Oilers before starting a six-game
road trip in Calgary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher used his hockey stick like a pool cue two minutes into
the game and bounced a shot off the boards for his first goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is a God,'' joked Kings coach Larry Robinson of
the good bounces. ``It was nice to see.''
</P>
<P>
   It truly was a game of follow the bouncing puck in the first
period and Mikhail Shtalenkov wasn't good at it. The Edmonton
goalie was pulled after allowing three goals on 12 shots in the
first 18 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' 26th-ranked power play opened the scoring when
Boucher's dump-in bounced off the left wing boards and went into
the empty Edmonton net after Shtalenkov had left the crease to play
the anticipated bounce.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took a 2-0 lead at 5:15 when Luc Robitaille, while
falling down, got his stick on Boucher's shot from the right point.
The goal was Robitaille's 30th of the season and 900th point as a
King.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Selivanov, who scored three third-period goals at
Anaheim on Wednesday, scored on a deflection at 12:38 of the first
period. He then tied the game, 2-2, on a breakaway at 14:50.
</P>
<P>
   But good fortune continued to go the Kings' way when Steve
Duchesne's 60-footer hit the stick of an Oilers defenseman and got
past Shtalenkov at 17:52.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, who has spent much of the season in the press box, was
the first to admit both he and the Kings got the majority of the
good bounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some lucky breaks, but you've got to take advantage of
them,'' said Boucher, referring to the Kings' ability to maintain
their lead after Duchesne scored his fourth goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The puck and the game settled down in the second period. Neither
team scored and they combined for just nine shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were laid out pretty plainly for us,'' said center Ray
Ferraro. ``Tonight everybody came focused and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   One win, however, doesn't even come close to pulling the Kings
out of the hole they've dug for themselves, especially when they
have games coming up in St. Louis, Detroit and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Necessary, crucial, do-or-die, all of the cliches,'' said
Robinson of the trip. ``You have to be realistic and not think you
are going to win all five (before the Kings return to Southern
California for a game No.6 against the Ducks), but we can't do
worse than .500.''

he has dropped his old opposition to this scheme, or what he means
to do about the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which is relevant to
the nuclear balance with Russia and which may now have to be
renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a brilliant student who thinks he can succeed by
pulling an all-nighter at the last minute. This is not the best way
to conduct American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, even though the Kosovo example is typical, it stands out
for its seriousness. If a NATO force is sent to Kosovo, it may well
have a difficult time: hard-liners on either side will resent the
cease-fire deal, and may take out their frustrations on the hapless
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a former Clinton official now at the Brookings
Institution, worries that Kosovo might turn into a Somalia-style
mess: American troops will get killed, triggering a hasty
withdrawal and undermining American internationalism for a good
while thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always risks in peacekeeping. America is
strong enough to take these risks on _ provided it has a president
who explains them honestly. &QL;

   TEGUCIGALPA AND MANAGUA _ Edgardo Serrato points to the river, a
docile trickle of water in the distance. ``That...'' he says, then
swings around and points to the top of his field, ``got up to
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns back and indicates the barren, stony landscape on
either side of the river. ``And that,'' he says, ``used to look
like those,'' pointing to a thick patch of trees downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he sweeps his hand across his field, the soil newly
sown with beans, now covered with sand up to half a meter (nearly
two feet) deep. ``And this is what it left us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' of course, was Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly four months since Mitch swept through Honduras,
while its wide skirts of rain soaked Nicaragua (and, to a lesser
extent, parts of Guatemala, El Salvador and southeastern Mexico).
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent disaster relief has been done, and the clouds of
rain and rescue workers have cleared. Now for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Among their many tasks, governments, aid agencies and farmers
like Serrato are assessing the damage to agriculture _ a vital
industry and big export earner _ and the time and money it will
need to recover.
</P>
<P>
   At least the destruction was not as great as was at first
feared. Early estimates put Honduras's crop losses at 70 percent
and the number of its homeless at 2 million (out of 6.3 million).
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of the country being set back 50 years. For the
first few days, with bridges down, cities cut off and water
everywhere, that sounded possible.
</P>
<P>
   Better estimates are now emerging. Central American farming
divides roughly into (a) staples, such as beans, maize and rice,
grown mostly by small farmers, many with only a hectare (2 acres)
or two, who live off their crops and sell any surplus; and (b)
export goods, such as bananas, coffee, cane sugar, sesame (in
Nicaragua) and shrimps.
</P>
<P>
   Beans, ready to be picked, were badly hit: both countries, it is
thought, indeed lost some 70 percent of this crop. But there is
more than one bean harvest a year.
</P>
<P>
   Maize too took a battering, but governments bought seeds for
emergency post-Mitch planting.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution was not brilliant: the mayor of Puerto Cortes, on
Honduras's Caribbean coast, says that promised seeds never arrived
and he had to drum up help from local businesses. But overall both
countries lost only 20 percent or so of the maize they could expect
in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   In commercial crops, Honduras lost nearly half of its bananas
and 20-25 percent of its coffee _ which means, between them, about
one-eighth of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua lost only 6 percent or so of either, but two-thirds of
its sesame.
</P>
<P>
   As for shrimps, for all the flooding of their salty lagoons,
there are even reports that Honduras's shrimp farmers will do
better in the year after Mitch than before.
</P>
<P>
   Crop losses, however, are only the simplest part of the story. A
harder question is what Mitch did to the land.
</P>
<P>
   When rivers that had burst their banks receded, they left sand
up to two meters (six-and-a-half feet) deep. Some small farmers
with fields next to rivers have lost them for good.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is less sand they, like Serrato, can mix it into the
soil, but the mixture does not hold water so well. In the hills,
torrents of water washed soil away, or left it but rinsed the
nutrients out of it.
</P>
<P>
   No one can yet quantify the effects, but at least for a time the
land will be less fertile.
</P>
<P>
   That is bad news for countries whose food output was already
rising less quickly than their populations: according to the World
Food Program, Honduras grew 27 percent less food per person in 1996
than in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it is much worse news for some individual farmers, since so
many were only just scratching a living anyway. The same goes for
workers on the big banana plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, Standard Fruit (a subsidiary of Dole, an American
fruit giant) says it will in time produce as much as before; but
not necessarily in the same spots, and it will take two years just
to replant everything that was washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Overall in the plantations, the result will be temporary or
permanent unemployment for thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   At least Standard can afford the $70 million-75 million it
reckons it will need to put its Honduran plantations back in order.
For many subsistence farmers there, the problem is how to replant
at all, and what. Normally, they save enough seed from one harvest
to plant the next. Not this time. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government bought rice and maize seed abroad, but Hondurans
are choosy about beans: they like a local red variety. ``Seeds of
Hope,'' a scheme sponsored by the United States Agency for
International Development, is supporting farmers _ Serrato is one _
to grow seeds for distribution to others. So are a couple of local
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But this year such efforts will supply only a fraction of what
is needed for the main planting. Most farmers will have to sow
alien beans for a season at least, and they may get lower prices
for the result. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, recovery involves much more than just replanting and
waiting for the harvest. ``People see a hurricane as a one-off
blow,'' says one American development worker, ``but this is an
ongoing crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Freak rains during January dumped more water on some parts of
Honduras than the hurricane had, and farmers who had tried a late,
post-Mitch planting lost their crops again.
</P>
<P>
   Pests and fungi have flourished in the swampy conditions;
special chemicals and equipment are needed to get rid of them.
Dykes, bridges and roads have to be rebuilt; a lot of the lost
bananas and coffee were not washed away but went bad because they
could not be got to market in time.
</P>
<P>
   Most heavy-duty machinery is still out repairing the main roads,
so local roads are often being restored by hand. Silted-up rivers
must be expensively dredged before the dry season ends in May, or
they will flood again with the first rains.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials in both Honduras and Nicaragua reckon
their farms could recover in about five years. Nicaragua's
government plans to spend $1 billion during that time to achieve
it. But neither country has that kind of money, and local banks are
reluctant to lend except short-term.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of the Mitch-hit countries will present their
plans for reconstruction to prospective foreign aid donors, in
Stockholm, in May. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ It is ``space pussies' night'' in Radost FX, a trendy
Prague dance club. Slender Czech girls gyrate to techno music
pumped out by a British DJ. Male hipsters stand off to one side
awaiting the promised ``Lesbian Love Show.'' A poster on the wall
advises dancers to bring their own ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   It could be anywhere really _ London, New York. But that is
precisely the point. Prague is no longer fenced off. East and west
mean less to Czech hipsters than cool and uncool.
</P>
<P>
   Techno music and ecstasy belong to a world more nuanced and
ambivalent than the bleak, harrowing world in which Jan Palach
chose to douse himself in gasoline, set himself afire, and stagger
dying into Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Palach was a 21-year-old student, whose passionate ideals
inspired Czechs and Slovaks at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Most of the youth propping up the bar in Radost FX have
a vague idea who Palach was (``That guy who did the Buddhist thing
_ right?''), but none is curious to contemplate what drove him to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 20,'' one Czech mother later explains. ``For him and
his friends the past simply does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with older Czechs too. In 1990 thousands gathered to
remember Palach's passing. Last month only a handful stood with
President Vaclav Havel to mark the 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In small Czech towns most young people subsist on a lamentable
cultural diet of second-rate American television shows and pop
music. Few speak a foreign language; those who do opt for German.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is different. Here the more affluent and educated young
people have made their own underground. They choose English over
German, listen to edgier American and British alternative music,
prefer ``indie'' movies to television, surf the Internet, and favor
snowboards more than skis.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these hipsters' formative years have been spent in a
post-communist world. ``For me,'' says Tomas Hacek, a student of 20
at Charles University, ``liberty means raves and swapping e-mail
with guys in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views are echoed by the crowd camped out at a snowboard
shop off Wenceslas Square. Snowboarders here debate the merits of
Burton versus Sims boards, often using idiomatic English to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   A snowboard is a major investment. A decent Burton goes for
12,000 korunas ($400) _ more than most Czechs earn in a month. Then
there is the look: imported skiing jackets starting at 4,000
korunas and daily lift-passes at 300.
</P>
<P>
   Less affluent skateboarders sprawl on a couch watching surf
videos imported from California.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they get their kicks from music, skating or film, one
thing Prague's hipsters share is an apathy for politics. The few
who do protest tend to stick to well-worn civil-rights and green
issues. A few campaign for gypsy rights or for Free Tibet or
blockade local branches of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the apathy is a return to form. ``The Czechs have
been passive-aggressive for 400 years,'' says Keith Kirchner,
publisher of ``Think,'' an alternative magazine published in
English and Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of hip Prague is English. A sizeable number of
American expatriates, often artsy graduates attracted by Cool
Prague's beauty and cheap living, have made it the city's second
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is spreading it too, though owning a computer is
still beyond the pockets of most youthful Czechs. But many frequent
Internet cafes, where for 80 korunas or so you can surf the net for
an hour, download snazzy sites, send e-mail and sip espresso.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Czech underground has produced little it can call its
own. But Czechs have begun to put out local movies and trade
homemade CDs of local bands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so few foreigners speaking their language, Czech
hipsters, like their Danish or Greek counterparts, will stay net
importers of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Havel finds it sad. He laments not so much the influx of
English-language counterculture (one of his heroes was Frank Zappa,
the American music icon) as the lack of youthful purpose and what
he calls ``selfishness, opportunism and everything that at the time
of Palach's act was called stealthy collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   For Havel's generation of dissent, underground culture was a
protest medium. Today it is just a way of having a good time. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ It is ``space pussies' night'' in Radost FX, a trendy
Prague dance club. Slender Czech girls gyrate to techno music
pumped out by a British DJ. Male hipsters stand off to one side
awaiting the promised ``Lesbian Love Show.'' A poster on the wall
advises dancers to bring their own ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   It could be anywhere really _ London, New York. But that is
precisely the point. Prague is no longer fenced off. East and west
mean less to Czech hipsters than cool and uncool.
</P>
<P>
   Techno music and ecstasy belong to a world more nuanced and
ambivalent than the bleak, harrowing world in which Jan Palach
chose to douse himself in gasoline, set himself afire, and stagger
dying into Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the Russian
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Palach was a 21-year-old student, whose passionate ideals
inspired Czechs and Slovaks at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Most of the youth propping up the bar in Radost FX have
a vague idea who Palach was (``That guy who did the Buddhist thing
_ right?''), but none is curious to contemplate what drove him to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 20,'' one Czech mother later explains. ``For him and
his friends the past simply does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes with older Czechs too. In 1990 thousands gathered to
remember Palach's passing. Last month only a handful stood with
President Vaclav Havel to mark the 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In small Czech towns most young people subsist on a lamentable
cultural diet of second-rate American television shows and pop
music. Few speak a foreign language; those who do opt for German.
</P>
<P>
   Prague is different. Here the more affluent and educated young
people have made their own underground. They choose English over
German, listen to edgier American and British alternative music,
prefer ``indie'' movies to television, surf the Internet, and favor
snowboards more than skis.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these hipsters' formative years have been spent in a
post-communist world. ``For me,'' says Tomas Hacek, a student of 20
at Charles University, ``liberty means raves and swapping e-mail
with guys in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views are echoed by the crowd camped out at a snowboard
shop off Wenceslas Square. Snowboarders here debate the merits of
Burton versus Sims boards, often using idiomatic English to make
their point.
</P>
<P>
   A snowboard is a major investment. A decent Burton goes for
12,000 korunas ($400) _ more than most Czechs earn in a month. Then
there is the look: imported skiing jackets starting at 4,000
korunas and daily lift-passes at 300.
</P>
<P>
   Less affluent skateboarders sprawl on a couch watching surf
videos imported from California.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they get their kicks from music, skating or film, one
thing Prague's hipsters share is an apathy for politics. The few
who do protest tend to stick to well-worn civil-rights and green
issues. A few campaign for gypsy rights or for Free Tibet or
blockade local branches of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the apathy is a return to form. ``The Czechs have
been passive-aggressive for 400 years,'' says Keith Kirchner,
publisher of ``Think,'' an alternative magazine published in
English and Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of hip Prague is English. A sizeable number of
American expatriates, often artsy graduates attracted by Cool
Prague's beauty and cheap living, have made it the city's second
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is spreading it too, though owning a computer is
still beyond the pockets of most youthful Czechs. But many frequent
Internet cafes, where for 80 korunas or so you can surf the net for
an hour, download snazzy sites, send e-mail and sip espresso.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Czech underground has produced little it can call its
own. But Czechs have begun to put out local movies and trade
homemade CDs of local bands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so few foreigners speaking their language, Czech
hipsters, like their Danish or Greek counterparts, will stay net
importers of culture.
</P>
<P>
   Havel finds it sad. He laments not so much the influx of
English-language counterculture (one of his heroes was Frank Zappa,
the American music icon) as the lack of youthful purpose and what
he calls ``selfishness, opportunism and everything that at the time
of Palach's act was called stealthy collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   For Havel's generation of dissent, underground culture was a
protest medium. Today it is just a way of having a good time. &QL;

FEDERAL EXPERTS RECOMMEND EXTENSIVE HEPATITIS A VACCINE
PROGRAM  FOR 11 STATES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal health officials called Thursday for routine vaccination
programs for children in California and 10 other states to stop the
spread of hepatitis A.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of medical experts advising the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention urged that public-health programs use
statewide vaccination programs in escalating efforts to control the
virus, but left details up to each state. In most states,
vaccination programs are targeted now only at certain high-risk
communities.
</P>
<P>
   California and the other 10 states singled out by the CDC panel
accounted for about half of all the hepatitis A infections from
1987 to 1997, although they contained only about 22 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The new recommendations are part of a long-term strategy that
ultimately aims at nationwide vaccination efforts, even in states
that do not have particularly high incidence of hepatitis A
infections.
</P>
<P>
   California state health officials said they planned to study the
recommendations but would wait for financing issues to clear up and
for two independent organizations of pediatricians and family
practitioners to weigh in on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC panel report was formally approved Thursday and now goes
to the CDC director for final adoption, considered a formality.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey-based Hepatitis Foundation International
applauded the recommendations, noting that the Hepatitis A virus is
one of the most common infectious agents in the country and results
in annual costs of $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Well-designed vaccination programs, the organization said, have
proved to be safe and cost-effective. One shot, followed after at
least a few months by a booster, is sufficient for lifetime
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A, which affects the liver, is generally spread by
oral-fecal contact or by consuming contaminated food or water.
About 125,000 to 200,000 people are infected annually in the United
States. It is a different virus than blood-borne hepatitis B and C.
</P>
<P>
   Infections with hepatitis A often cause no serious symptoms in
young children, but they can easily spread the infection to older
children and adults who may suffer severe flu-like symptoms, weeks
of fatigue, jaundice and liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   Children entering school or group child-care programs may be
particularly prone to spreading the virus, the experts noted,
suggesting that may also be the most practical setting in which to
administer vaccines. Children between the ages of 5 and 14 are most
likely to catch the virus; 30 percent of reported cases occur in
people under age 15.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC panel's recommendations cover anyone between the ages of
2 and 19 but focus mainly on preventing infections in the younger
kids, said Dr. William Schaffner, a panel member who serves as
chair of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt School of Medicine in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the vehicle for bringing the virus home to Mom, Dad,
Suzie and Grandpa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies are under way as to the safety and benefits of
vaccinating infants. For now, though, the experts recommend parents
and caregivers rely mainly on good hygiene, not vaccination, to
protect children below age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A has not reached epidemic levels even in the states
with the most cases. Nor is it often linked to chronic infections
and life-threatening liver disease as is hepatitis C, for which
there is no vaccine. Hepatitis B also can cause chronic infections,
but there is a vaccine against that pathogen. Being vaccinated
against hepatitis B does not protect you from acquiring hepatitis
A.
</P>
<P>
   Control initiatives already have been begun in four of the
states _ Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona and Alaska _ with particularly
high disease rates. The highest incidence was in Arizona, with 48
cases per 100,000 population during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   California had 21 cases per 100,000, about double the national
average.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ If life in this faded regal city were a
Russian novel, the heroine's tragic death would not have been in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   But the chronicle of Galina(CQ) Starovoitova's life is not
fiction. In the ugly world of Russian politics, there is no
storybook consequence to her murder last fall at the age of 52.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a political assassination last November,
the federal legislator from St. Petersburg was shot three times in
the head as she climbed the stairs of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was viewed by her allies as a martyr whose
shocking death would surely inspire some essential changes to
Russia's faulty experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But three months later, her death is merely another in the long
list of grisly murders that have distinguished the state of
post-Soviet affairs in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has not been solved; her political movement has not
been galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   With its crude democracy and volatile economy, Russia often is
compared to the American Wild West. If so, Starovoitova was viewed
by many as one of the white hats. She was an articulate and popular
campaigner for human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prime ministers and 10,000 mourners attended her
funeral. Some 1.8 million households in Russia dimmed their lights
on a night last November in her memory, according to the national
power company.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin and the nation's top leaders promised
that her killers would be caught and justice would be swift. A bank
offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and
conviction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals expressed outrage at Starovoitova's murder and promised
to work together to carry on her dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democrats are fighting among themselves,'' Ruslan Linkov,
a Starovoitova aide who was seriously wounded in the Nov. 20 gun
attack, said in a recent interview with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after these tragic events. A lot of people cannot
overcome their political and personal ambitions,'' he said from the
sanatorium outside St. Petersburg where he is convalescing.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made and the investigation into her death
has been clouded by charges that prosecutors are on a political
witch-hunt -- against Starovoitova's allies and journalists
covering the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound about the motive for her killing: published
reports in Russian newspapers that she had possessed incriminating
evidence linking St. Petersburg's incumbent governor Vladimir
Yakolev with organized crime; another report suggesting it was an
inside job by her own allies looking to manufacture a political
crisis; a third alleging that she had extensive business interests
and the murder may have been over money, not ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Many here, in St. Petersburg believe the truth will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interested parties surrounding this crime are just clouding
the investigation,'' said Mikhail Ivanov, St. Petersburg editor of
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova emerged as a public figure in the energetic days of
perestroika, when the Soviet Union was compelled to relax its grip
on the people. She was pointedly anti-communist and worked to
protect dissidents and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of Yeltsin, she became a prominent legislator
in the years after the fall of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best intentions of Russians who had hoped to find
meaning in Starovoitova's murder, the political void was too big
for one dead gentlewoman to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic movement, dynamic at the start of the decade when
the Soviet Union was crumbling, is now tainted by failure. It is
marked by years of Yeltsin's inability to produce a working
democracy, and by rabid profiteering and corruption that has
produced an elite class of wealthy Russians and masses of poorer
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains in the throes of an economic crisis that began
last summer, and still delivers more pain. Little wonder that
Russians believe, not in the promises of their politicians, but in
trying to feed and clothe themselves. In opinion polls, the
Communist Party continues to cling to its lead in Russia, though
with no more than 20 or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russians wholly embrace neither communism nor democracy. There
are no dead martyrs in today's Russia, just as there are no living
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to raise this symbol, and there is no one like
that,'' said Leonid Kesselman, a democratic activist and political
analyst in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate in a country with a broken economy and the
elections of a new parliament and president scheduled to take place
in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the so-called ``young reformers'' fired last year from
government amid the country's economic turmoil -- including Boris
Nemtsov and former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko -- have formed a
loose political coalition that thus far has failed to gather
momentum. They seem to be vying for the relatively sparse
constituency of an existing minority party, the Yabloko headed by
Western-style liberal Grigory Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, had she lived, Starovoitova did not appear to
have a niche to fill in today's ambiguous political landscape,
though there was talk she may have been intending to run for the
regional governorship in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   While popular and prestigious, she had little real power. In
part, Starovoitova was hampered because she was a woman. Men still
hold most positions of power in Russian politics and in this
male-dominated society there is no popular sentiment for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is more of a public, than a real political figure. She
didn't affect anything . . . Galya(CQ) had authority over the
population, but she didn't have the authority to unite them,'' said
Kesselman.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Maybe because she was a women, maybe because she was
(seen as) naive -- today's condition requires a bit of cynicism.''

   WASHINGTON _It's been a while since President Clinton was known
to play the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, though, while dining with his Mexican counterpart,
Ernesto Zedillo, near the Yucatan city of Merida, Clinton sat in on
a small combo and laid down an impromptu rendition of the torch
standard, ''My Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   A paean to the two leaders' wives, no doubt, Clinton might just
as well have been playing to his host.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of Clinton's presidency, after all, has been the
courtship of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His whirlwind Merida summit with President Zedillo last week was
nothing less than a diplomatic lovefest, meticulously scripted to
send the message that relations are fundamentally sound between two
very different countries that just happen to share a
2,000-mile-long border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than neighbors,'' Clinton proclaimed in a speech.
''More and more, we belong to the same American family . . . What
binds us together is far, far more important than what divides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has become a cornerstone of Clinton's foreign policy,
whether the goal is to press for democratic change in China, force
a Balkans truce or craft a lasting Mideast peace -- objectives
that, to be sure, require mountains of faith to even pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, are arguing for a bit less window
dressing and a lot more candor from the White House when it comes
to U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in such thorny areas as
trade, immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Clinton to change his tune this week(CQ), when he
decides whether to certify to Congress that Mexico is cooperating
fully with U.S. efforts to combat the scourge of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has patently failed to thwart a massive narco-crime
industry that U.S. authorities say will smuggle perhaps $30 billion
worth of drugs into the United States this year -- about 60 percent
of all the illicit drugs that will make their way onto the nation's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't expected to stop Clinton from giving Mexico's counter
drug efforts a passing grade; he signaled as much during last
week's summit by praising Zedillo's commitment to a U.S.-Mexico
alliance against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his instincts to put the best possible face on a messy
problem, Clinton is downplaying the failings in Mexico's anti-drug
efforts because to decertify would trigger painful sanctions
against Mexico, a key U.S. economic partner, and risk shattering
the relationship Clinton and Zedillo have met worked hard to forge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is clearly doing backflips to be able to send up
certification language to the Hill,'' said Mexico expert George
Grayson, professor of government at the college of William &AMP; Mary,
in Williamsburg, Va. To do otherwise, said Grayson, would ''poison
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, that relationship is tested by what has
become a diplomatic rite of spring, when the White House grades the
counter-narcotics efforts of Mexico and some 30 other countries
that are major sources or distribution channels for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 law, the president must certify to Congress by
March 1 of each year whether these countries are cooperating fully
with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts. Countries whose programs are
decertified face immediate suspension of most U.S. aid --
humanitarian and counter-narcotics assistance are excepted --
unless the president decides to sustain assistance for national
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress has 30 days in which to overturn the president's
certification recommendations, through a joint resolution, or allow
the White House ruling to stand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Congressional members -- and constituents
angered by the flood of drugs from Mexico -- has crested for the
past two years with vocal, if unsuccessful, legislative efforts to
decertify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More sound and fury is expected this time around, particularly
if the Clinton administration paints too rosy a picture of Mexico's
failed anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't ratify, nor sanction, a concept that tells the
people of both republics that this is coming along,'' said Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a major player in the issue as chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere. ''They need to make sure that it's absolutely clear
that the progress has been limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico detests the certification process and the annual
criticism it foments from its overbearing neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   It is American drug consumption, Mexicans are quick to point
out, that provides the rich incentives for narco-criminals, whose
work undermines law and order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that it's a unilateral, subjective and unfair
process,'' Mexico's former ambassador to the United States, Jesus
Silva-Herzog, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
''It's difficult for us to understand how is it possible that the
largest consumer of drugs in the world becomes the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington recognize the Mexican government's
frustration, and Coverdell said Zedillo -- who just two weeks ago
earmarked for counter-narcotics efforts another $500 million --
deserves support for devoting high-level attention to the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Coverdell said, Mexico has done far too little to
combat narco-traffickers, or to rid the country of the official
corruption that enables them to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data remains terribly disturbing,'' he said. ''We've got a
lot of work to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   The annual certification imbroglio gnaws at a relationship also
strained by immigration and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans and Americans will make some 250 million legal border
crossings this year, one indicator of the growing economic and
cultural integration of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''With each crossing,'' said Clinton, ''we move beyond mere
diplomacy, closer to genuine friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, Clinton sees a glass that's half full.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 150,000 Mexicans immigrate legally to the United States
each year, adding richly to the country's pool of some 15 million
Americans of Mexican descent, but also competing with native
Americans for jobs while taxing the services of state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   At least as many slip into the country illegally. But while
numbers of illegal entries are fuzzy, Mexicans make up the largest
block of the estimated 400,000 people of various nationalities who
enter the country illegally each year, according to the Center for
Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank.
</P>
<P>
   What drives the mass movements is the vast disparity between
living standards in Mexico, a nation of 95 million people with an
average per capita income of $4,400 per year, and the United
States, where, with 250 million people, per capita income averages
seven times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   That wage gap has also driven a major restructuring of American
industry, as thousands of U.S. manufacturers and suppliers have set
up shop in Mexico, aided by the low tariffs and investment
guarantees embodied in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who ramrodded the NAFTA through a reluctant Congress in
his first major, and still most dramatic, legislative victory,
hails the integration of the two economies as a step forward for
both countries. NAFTA, said Clinton, has strengthenedboth
economies, providing a buffer from the ravages of the global
economic crisis and a model for broader trade agreements he hopes
might one day link the entire Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as U.S. exports to hard-pressed Pacific Rim nations
plummeted by 19 percent, two-way trade between the United States
and Mexico grew 11 percent to nearly $175 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That placed Mexico in third place, behind Canada and virtually
neck-and-neck with Japan, among U.S. trading partners. Mexico is on
track to eclipse Japan this year as this country's number-two
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must expand this oasis of confidence and growth in our
hemisphere,'' Clinton said, reiterating his call for a Free Trade
Area of the Americas stretching from the Yukon to the southern tip
of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, true to form, there's a flip side to the cheery
portrait Clinton paints of the cross-border economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA opponents complain bitterly that the agreement, which was
negotiated by the Bush administration, has put to flight hundreds
of American factories, large and small, which have invested some
$30 billion building new plants in Mexico, sending good-paying jobs
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The trade picture, moreover, is grossly distorted, these critics
assert, because it counts as U.S. exports tens of billions of
dollars each year of relatively low-value parts and raw materials
that are shipped south and used to manufacture or assemble finished
goods that Mexico then exports to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're processed in Mexico and sent right back here and the
only effect it has on U.S. employment is to reduce it and the only
effect it has on U.S. wages and incomes is to lower them,'' said
trade expert Alan Tonelson, research fellow with the U.S. Business
and Industry Council, a trade association representing more than
1,000 small and medium-sized
</P>
<P>
   manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is simply a trade policy that's designed to encourage
outsourcing,'' said Tonelson, ''to encourage U.S. corporations to
move to Mexico and take advantage of low wages, lax regulations,
etcetera.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Charles McMillion(CQ), chief economist for the Washington
consulting group, MBG Information Services, ''It has the effect of
squeezing profits and squeezing wages in these companies and
forcing them, if they possibly can, to move at least some of their
production to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McMillion, ''It's put incredible pricing pressure on them
over the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an unapologetic optimist on this,'' said Chandler Stolp,
director of the U.S.-Mexican Policy Studies Program at the
University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The shifts decried by NAFTA's critics, Stolp said, merely
represent the rational corporate response to a low-wage base on the
country's southern doorstep. That sort of integration, Stolp said,
helps U.S. companies compete favorably against their overseas
rivals, even as it offers Mexican workers a ladder up from poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''If trade were just a matter of selling finished products to
each other, then Mexico and the United States really have very
little to do with each other,'' said Stolp. ''We're not competing
with Mexico, we're partnering with Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, concedes that the U.S.-Mexico economic
relationship is imperfect, as are links on immigration and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, he maintains, is not to curse the darkness,
but rather to light those candles that might be lit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any complex relationship will have its ups and downs,''
Clinton said last Monday in Merida. ''But we know our differences
cannot divide us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _It's been a while since President Clinton was known
to play the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, though, while dining with his Mexican counterpart,
Ernesto Zedillo, near the Yucatan city of Merida, Clinton sat in on
a small combo and laid down an impromptu rendition of the torch
standard, ''My Funny Valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   A paean to the two leaders' wives, no doubt, Clinton might just
as well have been playing to his host.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of Clinton's presidency, after all, has been the
courtship of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His whirlwind Merida summit with President Zedillo last week was
nothing less than a diplomatic lovefest, meticulously scripted to
send the message that relations are fundamentally sound between two
very different countries that just happen to share a
2,000-mile-long border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than neighbors,'' Clinton proclaimed in a speech.
''More and more, we belong to the same American family . . . What
binds us together is far, far more important than what divides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism has become a cornerstone of Clinton's foreign policy,
whether the goal is to press for democratic change in China, force
a Balkans truce or craft a lasting Mideast peace -- objectives
that, to be sure, require mountains of faith to even pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, though, are arguing for a bit less window
dressing and a lot more candor from the White House when it comes
to U.S.-Mexico relations, particularly in such thorny areas as
trade, immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect Clinton to change his tune this week(CQ), when he
decides whether to certify to Congress that Mexico is cooperating
fully with U.S. efforts to combat the scourge of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has patently failed to thwart a massive narco-crime
industry that U.S. authorities say will smuggle perhaps $30 billion
worth of drugs into the United States this year -- about 60 percent
of all the illicit drugs that will make their way onto the nation's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't expected to stop Clinton from giving Mexico's counter
drug efforts a passing grade; he signaled as much during last
week's summit by praising Zedillo's commitment to a U.S.-Mexico
alliance against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his instincts to put the best possible face on a messy
problem, Clinton is downplaying the failings in Mexico's anti-drug
efforts because to decertify would trigger painful sanctions
against Mexico, a key U.S. economic partner, and risk shattering
the relationship Clinton and Zedillo have met worked hard to forge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is clearly doing backflips to be able to send up
certification language to the Hill,'' said Mexico expert George
Grayson, professor of government at the college of William &AMP; Mary,
in Williamsburg, Va. To do otherwise, said Grayson, would ''poison
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, that relationship is tested by what has
become a diplomatic rite of spring, when the White House grades the
counter-narcotics efforts of Mexico and some 30 other countries
that are major sources or distribution channels for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1986 law, the president must certify to Congress by
March 1 of each year whether these countries are cooperating fully
with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts. Countries whose programs are
decertified face immediate suspension of most U.S. aid --
humanitarian and counter-narcotics assistance are excepted --
unless the president decides to sustain assistance for national
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress has 30 days in which to overturn the president's
certification recommendations, through a joint resolution, or allow
the White House ruling to stand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Frustration among Congressional members -- and constituents
angered by the flood of drugs from Mexico -- has crested for the
past two years with vocal, if unsuccessful, legislative efforts to
decertify Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   More sound and fury is expected this time around, particularly
if the Clinton administration paints too rosy a picture of Mexico's
failed anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just can't ratify, nor sanction, a concept that tells the
people of both republics that this is coming along,'' said Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a major player in the issue as chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Western
Hemisphere. ''They need to make sure that it's absolutely clear
that the progress has been limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico detests the certification process and the annual
criticism it foments from its overbearing neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   It is American drug consumption, Mexicans are quick to point
out, that provides the rich incentives for narco-criminals, whose
work undermines law and order in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that it's a unilateral, subjective and unfair
process,'' Mexico's former ambassador to the United States, Jesus
Silva-Herzog, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
''It's difficult for us to understand how is it possible that the
largest consumer of drugs in the world becomes the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington recognize the Mexican government's
frustration, and Coverdell said Zedillo -- who just two weeks ago
earmarked for counter-narcotics efforts another $500 million --
deserves support for devoting high-level attention to the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Coverdell said, Mexico has done far too little to
combat narco-traffickers, or to rid the country of the official
corruption that enables them to operate.

 &HT;    Suspect competent to represent himself, but many paradoxes in
case border insanity
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You keep wishing somebody would pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do this,'' defendant James R. Taylor Sr.,
representing himself in a double-murder case, told Greene County
Common Pleas Court Judge Thomas Rose Wednesday during the testimony
of his estranged wife, Patricia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for everybody, I think,'' Rose said. ``Carry on.
We'll get through this somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who spent the day in court couldn't help but come away
feeling Rose's pain. In one of the most unusual trials in recent
memory _ and most likely the first time in modern Ohio history that
a defendant has served as his own counsel in a death-penalty case _
the judge and prosecutors find themselves between a judicial rock
and a hard place.
</P>
<P>
   Greene County Prosecutor Bill Schenck knows what everybody is
thinking: How could the courts allow this to go on? The answer lies
in that one pesky word that seems to be wreaking so much havoc in
the world lately: The Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he was ruled competent to stand trial, we had no choice,
under the Constitution, but to grant his request to represent
himself,'' Schenck said. Before and during the trial, Rose has
pleaded with Taylor to allow his two stand-by attorneys to step up
to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution says you're entitled to counsel,'' concurred
University of Dayton law Professor Dennis Turner, ``and that means
it's your constitutional right that you can pick yourself. Once it
is determined you are competent to stand trial, that also means you
are competent to make choices about your case, including who should
represent you.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of
insanity to two counts of aggravated murder in the Valentine's Day
1998 shootings of Ron and Carolyn Rihm, two of his wife's closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that has many ``Alice in Wonderland'' qualities, you
have the paradox of a defendant claiming he is competent to
represent himself, and on the other hand claiming insanity as part
of his defense. And there's the additional paradox that, despite
the extraordinary circumstances, the trial can best be described by
one word: Tedious.
</P>
<P>
   True, it made for a dramatic half hour when the 68-year-old
Taylor cross-examined his estranged wife, Patricia, Wednesday.
Taylor peppered his wife of 46 years with questions about alleged
infidelities, but she hung tough, answering ``No sir,'' and ``No,
Mr. Taylor,'' with vehemence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good times together, didn't we?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few, sir, very few,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Wednesday's proceedings were, at best, dull. Taylor
stopped questioning his wife because ``I hurt too much,'' he told
the judge. He grilled Fairborn police Officer Lee Cyr at least
three times that long, asking endless variations of the same, often
irrelevant question, until everyone in the courtroom wished he had
a dollar for every time the judge admonished, ``That question has
been asked and answered. Move on to the next question, Mr.
Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Rose is in a tough spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the circumstances, he has to give the defendant the
benefit of the doubt and certain advantages,'' he said. ``He can
get away with things a trial lawyer never could.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after Taylor asked Cyr the same question for what seemed
like the tenth time, Rose could barely contain his exasperation:
``I'm allowing some flexibility as to the rules of evidence. But
I'm not going to let you entirely dismantle it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Taylor is convicted, would an attorney be able to file an
appeal based on inadequate representation?
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say no. ``That would be like the kid who kills his
parents and argues he should be found not guilty because 'I'm an
orphan,''' UD's Turner said. ``He could find an attorney to appeal
on other grounds, but not because he insisted on exercising his
constitutional right to represent himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Are state competency standards the culprit? Is it too hard to
find a defendant incompetent? ``Here is your dilemma: If you
conclude he's not competent, that also means you can't try him,''
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Why does Taylor insist on representing himself, bruskly brushing
away his court-appointed attorneys, despite the obvious discomfort
it brings him and the court?
</P>
<P>
   Schenck said he has never seen a trial quite like it. ``It's all
about control,'' he speculated. ``At this moment in court we are
living out the marriage of Jim and Patricia Taylor. You see it in
the way he tries to control the court, the witnesses, in the way he
refuses to accept the court's rulings. You see it in the way he
tried to control his wife on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not, we are prisoners of this process,
just as Patricia Taylor was a prisoner during 46 years of
marriage.''

   Taylor may not be doing himself any favors by serving as his own
counsel _ ``The old saying goes that a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client,'' Turner noted _ but he has every legal
right to do so. And the court has a legal obligation to allow him
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As Taylor fumbles through his questions, as the trial drones on,
you can imagine Judge Rose steeling himself in the same words with
which he admonished Taylor: ``Carry on. We'll get through this
somehow.''

 &HT;    A stray act of kindness
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the items my wife brings home from
the grocery store along with a selection of fat-free foods is a
little magazine with all sorts of health news. I read it in
self-defense, and sometimes find useful information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I can lengthen my lifespan by 10 to 20 years
without paying ridiculous prices for chemically manufactured drugs.
Something as simple as eating a cup of nonfat yogurt and a cup of
cubed cantaloupe every day will keep me from having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I've discovered 23 home remedies hiding in our spice rack.
</P>
<P>
   Spices, being generally fat-free, have been approved by the Food
Police. You'd never guess all the simple ways to stay healthy
merely by swallowing potions of ground-up leaves and roots.
</P>
<P>
   I'd always known hot pepper sauce did a lot for collards and
turnip greens. What I didn't know was that a single pod of hot red
pepper can cure cluster headaches, arthritis pain, sore throats,
toothaches, cold feet and various digestive disorders.
</P>
<P>
   If you have cold feet, grind some dried red peppers, mix with
talcum powder or cornstarch, and sprinkle into your socks. This
will cause the small blood vessels under your skin to dilate,
providing extra blood flow and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper can be a solution to an age-old problem that has
plagued sleeping partners of the opposite sex since Adam and Eve,
one that has cause considerable discord in my own marriage. If she
has enough cover I'm drenched with sweat. If I'm not sweating she's
shivering. Now I can simply sprinkle her side of the bed with red
pepper and we can both sleep happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   These are only samplings of the various nuggets you can pick up
from the pages of magazines dedicated to better living without
chemistry. There are many others, including the first known
practical use for parsley. Tea made from parsley cures urinary
tract problems.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised to learn that a spoonful of horseradish will
blast sinuses open. What I didn't know was that cats lower blood
pressure and prevent heart attacks. Dogs maybe, but not cats.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that people who own cats have significantly lower
blood pressure than people who don't. I would have guessed, from
personal experience, that it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Texas at El Paso study claims cat ownership can
help even more if you have already had a heart attack. Cat owners
are far more likely to complete a course of cardiac rehabilitation
than those who don't have a cat, 96 percent to 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hopeful the UTEP findings will solve the long-standing cat
problem at our house. It began four years ago when my wife heard a
mewing at the back door. Upon investigating she found a small
kitten. She served the little visitor a saucer of milk and
instructed me to prepare sleeping quarters on the carport.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion that we carry the kitten to the county pound for
adoption fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what they do with pets that don't get adopted?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   As months and years went by, what began as ``my kitty'' turned
into ``our kitty'' and eventually into ``your cat.'' My cat began
to fall further out of favor when it began making paw tracks on her
car, scratching the paint with clawing leaps onto the hood.
</P>
<P>
   The cat also perfected a ruse of lurking in the shrubbery when
we drive into the carport, then dashing inside and hiding under the
car. I keep a broom to sweep it out, which necessitates getting
down on my knees on the concrete, which is hard on breeches.
</P>
<P>
   We managed to cope fairly well with one cat. Then last summer a
full-grown calico stray decided to accept our hospitality. The two
fought a lot. We had hopes one or the other would give up and move
on to one of our neighbors. That didn't happen. The calico stayed,
and began ``marking'' territory, which included the carport.
</P>
<P>
   Marking is next to having a polecat in residence. It will get a
human arrested for indecent exposure. In a less compassionate
household than ours, it would trigger a quick trip to the pound, or
down to the Flint River in a croaker sack. Being a humanitarian
soul, soft of heart, slow to anger, my solution so far has been to
scrub the carport with Lysol and Pine-Sol almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Even my wife has finally admitted we have a serious cat problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we find them a good home and give them away?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a happy solution. Except for one thing. I have
never known anyone who has successfully given away a full-grown
cat. Certainly not two. Research shows chances of giving away a
grown cat are roughly 1 in 1,000. Odds on giving away a marker are
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The UT El Paso findings offer a glint of hope. There must be
people reading this who are at high risk for a heart attack. Surely
there is somebody out there who has suffered a heart attack and
doesn't want to have another. I would be willing to give up both my
cats to prevent heart attacks. Furthermore, I'll do home delivery
anywhere in Georgia, or in contiguous states, plus furnishing free
cat food for six months.

 &HT;    The Ritz with a bang
 &HT;    By Roland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you haven't seen a uniformed doorman in white
gloves chase a speeding wine bottle, you haven't been traveling
with my mother and me.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted our stay at San Francisco's five-star Ritz-Carlton to
be memorable. Darn if I didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   After a post-breakfast goodbye to family members in Monterey, my
mother and I took a leisurely back-road drive north to San
Francisco where I had a club-level suite reserved for the last day
of our weeklong vacation and family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year my mother's eyesight has deteriorated rapidly
due to age-related macular degeneration. The loss of her vision
took away a lifetime of artistic pursuits, among other
taken-for-granted pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   That was partly why I wanted to splurge on a world-class luxury
hotel before we returned to our respective homes in Colorado and
Texas. I wanted to do something nice for my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Berlin's ``Puttin' On The Ritz'' kept running through my
head as we drove north past irrigated fields of artichokes,
attractive horse farms and pocket vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   I called ahead to confirm our reservations. All was in order.
The entire staff of the Ritz-Carlton was prepared to make my our
stay comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, boy. Can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the rural roads ran out. We were forced onto the
ever-clogged Highway 101. I tried to follow directions to the hotel
that I had printed out from the hotel's Internet page.
</P>
<P>
   It was tough navigating unfamiliar freeways, turnoffs and
streets while keeping up with the breakneck pace of the surrounding
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   After climbing a hill that caused everything in the car to roll
to the rear, I made two sharp right-hand turns and pulled under the
front portico of the Ritz-Carlton where a small army of uniformed
doormen, bellmen and who-knows-what surrounded our rental car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' was all I got to mumble before our doors were opened,
we were welcomed warmly and runners were dispatched to notify
who-knows-who of our arrival. Things were moving fast. White-gloved
hands removed luggage from the trunk, hanging clothes from the back
seat and various scattered sacks and bags.
</P>
<P>
   Small clumps of well-dressed guests watched our arrival while
they waited for their cars or limousines.
</P>
<P>
   The white gloves were quickly loading a brass luggage cart with
our belongings when the tune in my head changed from ``Puttin' On
The Ritz'' to ``The Ballad of Jed Clampett.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of a paper shopping bag broke and an amazing variety
of California food specialties splatted onto the elegant
entranceway of the Ritz-Carlton. A bottle of excellent California
merlot thunked down in the middle of spiced shrimp, scallops,
calamari, grapes and other eatables.
</P>
<P>
   Since we were in hilly San Francisco _ on Nob Hill, to be exact
_ the merlot took off like a chain-gang escapee in a downhill dash
toward California Street and, presumably, Chinatown. A uniformed,
white-gloved doorman was in close pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the paper bag had become wet with the juices from
doggie bags my mother brought back to our room refrigerator when
she couldn't eat all of a meal. She thought most servings too large
and refused to waste good food.
</P>
<P>
   I made matters worse by trying to help clean up the mess before
being coaxed away and told everything would be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   I signed the guest register smelling like Cajun shrimp, a fact
politely ignored by one and all.
</P>
<P>
   In the suite, Mother and I toasted our trip with the trophy
merlot. Then we got ready to put on the Ritz.

 &HT;    The pruning of Atlanta
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta is losing an average of 50 acres per day
of tree cover to make way for new housing, roads, shopping malls
and office parks, according to a new analysis of satellite images.
</P>
<P>
   And as its urban forest disappears, metro Atlanta's misery level
is going up - more heat, more flooding, more air pollution, higher
electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   The new analysis of Landsat Satellite data by NASA climate
scientists, University of Georgia researchers and others shows that
from 1988 to 1998, the13-county metro Atlanta lost about 190,000
acres of tree cover - about five times the size of Lake Lanier.
Between 1973 and 1988, the loss was about 151,000 acres, or about
27 acres per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metro Atlanta is certainly losing its tree cover at a rapid
rate,'' says Dale Quattrochi, a scientist with NASA's Global
</P>
<P>
   Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville, Ala., which has been
studying the metro area's changing landcover since 1996. ``The
biggest reason for the tree loss (in the past 10 years) is new
residential subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies by the Washington-based American Forests, NASA and
other groups show the metro area is paying a heavy toll for the
decline of its urban forest:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Since 1973, average summer temperatures in downtown Atlanta
and at Hartsfield International Airport have increased by 6 to 9
degrees more than those of the surrounding countryside, creating
urban ``heat islands.'' In 1973, temperatures in the hottest part
of downtown were more than 6 degrees hotter than surrounding areas,
and at Hartsfield 3 to 6 degrees hotter. Now, downtown and airport
temperatures can soar up to 12 degrees higher than the surrounding
treed areas. At the same time, average temperatures in the suburbs
also have increased by a few degrees, and, with fewer cooling
breezes blowing Atlanta's way, that may be a reason downtown has
gotten even hotter. In addition, the urban heat islands have
increased in size, changing weather patterns in the metro area. One
NASA study shows that the heat from downtown Atlanta helps trigger
summertime thunderstorms in Fayette and Clayton counties south of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hotter temperatures not only increase air-conditioning bills
and make life more unpleasant outdoors, they also cause more air
pollution. For instance, smog, Atlanta's biggest air pollution
problem, forms on hot sunny days. While no one has linked air
pollution levels to the metro area's tree loss, some studies show
that a 1 degree rise in summertime temperatures boosts the risk of
smog formation by as much as 3 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With fewer trees to help rainwater soak into the ground,
stormwater runoff - from roads, parking lots and other developed
sites - since 1986 in metro Atlanta has increased. For each major
storm that drops more than 3.5 inches of rain within a 24-hour
period, an additional 7.4 billion gallons of stormwater flow into
are creeks and the Chattahoochee River than was the case 13 years
ago. The excess water would fill more than 7,000 Olympic-size
swimming pools. Previous research has shown that trees and other
vegetation slow the movement of stormwater, lower the total runoff
volume and reduce flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Trees also help remove or trap lung-damaging dust, ash, pollen
and smoke - particulate matter - from the air. They absorb carbon
dioxide and other dangerous gases and, in turn, replenish the
atmosphere with oxygen. One acre of trees can produce as much oxgen
as 18 people breathe annually, and absorb enough carbon dioxide to
equal the amount produced by a car that is driven 26,000 miles in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental factors aside, trees beautify the landscape - they
provide us with pleasing-to-the-eye shapes and forms, add natural
character to cities and towns and soften the outline of concrete,
metal and glass.
</P>
<P>
   The American Forests environmental organization says a city
should have an overall tree cover of at least 40 percent to ensure
its environmental, economic and social health. However, the city of
Atlanta and a 3-mile buffer area around it have only 27 percent
tree cover, says a study by the group.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimates that the existing tree cover represents a
value of about $883 million for stormwater control in the city of
Atlanta and the 3-mile-wide buffer area. By increasing the tree
canopy to 40 percent in the area, stormwater benefits would
increase by an estimated $358 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see decision-makers incorporate this natural
capital into their decision-making process,'' says American Forests
researcher Gary Moll, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   There are several intense efforts underway in metro Atlanta to
mitigate heat island effects and tree loss. Most notable are the
efforts of Trees Atlanta and Cool Communities, a program of
American Forests. Marcia Bansley, the director of Trees Atlanta,
says one of the organization's goal is to encourage parking lot
owners to plant trees around their lots. Gas fumes escaping from
parked in unshaded parking lots in the summertime heat can be a
major contributor to air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Another major goal, says Lucie Griggs, who is coordinator of the
Cool Communities program in Georgia, is to encourage builders to
use material that reflect sunlight. ``We are talking with several
roofers in metro Atlanta about using such material,'' she says. The
roofs of large structures, such as shopping malls, large warehouses
and office buildings, can get as hot as 150 degree in the summer,
enough to affect whole neighborhoods. The reflective materials
would bounce heat back up into the atmosphere, and buildings and
surrounding areas would stay cooler.

   A message for GRUMP cardholders
</P>
<P>
   By John Kelso
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ I'm a little bit miffed with you people who have been
given free membership cards to Good Riddance to Unrelentingly
Morose People, or GRUMP.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember that I formed this political action group with
the intent of eliminating the humorless from the planet by the year
2000. At the rate we're going, we'll still have a bunch of
soreheads around these parts until about 3009.
</P>
<P>
   You GRUMP members aren't doing your jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 membership cards to GRUMP have been distributed to
readers. Some came to the newspaper and picked them up. I mailed
others. By the way, if you didn't get a GRUMP card, they're still
available in the main lobby of the newspaper. All you have to do is
show up during normal work hours and ask the security guard at the
desk.
</P>
<P>
   What are you doing with these membership cards, people? Putting
them in your wallet and sitting on them? Taking them out
occasionally and showing them off to your friends for a couple of
quick, cheap chuckles?
</P>
<P>
   You're certainly not using them for the purpose for which they
were intended _ to give me something to write about.
</P>
<P>
   On your GRUMP membership card, it clearly states that the holder
is a GRUMP Ranger, and that when you spot an incident of grumpy
behavior, you're supposed to report it to me by e-mail or phone.
</P>
<P>
   To date, I think I've received one e-mail from someone pointing
out that on Saturday afternoons, the produce shoppers at Central
Market on North Lamar run into each other with their shopping
carts, and another e-mail from a guy who turned himself in for
getting in a fight with a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   I know there's more grouchiness than that going on in that you
aren't reporting. I can tell so from reading my mail.
</P>
<P>
   Take this letter from Blake Batte, of Odessa, the Indian word
meaning drive-up window. Seriously, Batte was chapped when I
mentioned a fictitious perfume, Evening in Odessa, in my
Valentine's Day column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evening in Odessa?'' he wrote. ``I'm from Odessa and I take a
little offense to your using Odessa in a derogatory fashion. I know
that Odessa is not Utopia, but it is home for me and about 100,000
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It follows the thought of . . . I can cuss my sister, but
nobody else better cuss her! Might I suggest using a town or city
outside the state of Texas. Or, how about Bryan-College Station?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's Eau de Aggie from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an e-mail from someone who got fire ants in his drawers
over my Wednesday column about developer Gary Bradley and his
Circle C Ranch development in Southwest Austin. The writer was put
out when I suggested the Circle C Ranch children should gather up
the endangered salamanders at Barton Springs Pool, take them home,
and give them homes in aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your comments about the salamanders border on the illicit; it
is a violation ofFfederal law to remove any salamanders from Barton
Springs Pool, yet you encourage it,'' the writer tells us.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this writer is unaware that if you are a resident of
South Austin, you are entitled to a bag limit of 12 salamanders per
day, as long as each salamander is at least two inches long _ or a
hawg-o-mander.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy your salamander license at the same place you get
duck stamps.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ You keep wishing somebody would
pull the plug.``It's hard to do this,'' defendant James R. Taylor
Sr., representing himself in a double-murder case, told Greene
County Common Pleas Court Judge Thomas Rose on Wednesday during the
testimony of his estranged wife, Patricia. Anyone who spent the day
in court couldn't help but come away feeling Rose's pain. In one of
the most unusual trials in recent memory _ and most likely the
first time in modern Ohio history that a defendant has served as
his own counsel in a death-penalty case _ the judge and prosecutors
find themselves between a judicial rock and a hard place. (McCarty,
Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

are in daily combat with Iraqi defenses over no-fly zones that we
established for reasons that included protecting Kurds from Saddam
Hussein's attacks and now the Kurds are attacking the embassies of
our NATO allies and others because a Kurdish leader, who many
identify as a terrorist the like of Osama bin Laden, has been
jailed in Turkey, which Saddam Hussein now says may be targeted by
Iraqi missiles because our planes take off from Turkey and bomb
Iraqi defenses in the zones in which we are protecting Kurds.''

   GEORGE-WASHINGTON _ MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly two centuries
have passed since George Washington _ after being bled by would-be
healers and prophetically reviewing his will _ whispered `` 'tis
well'' and died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved mansion
beside the Potomac River. Now in the bicentennial year of
Washington's death on Dec. 14, 1799, the keepers of his historic
homestead and his legacy are fearful that the Father of His Country
is being forgotten. So, seeking to restore Washington to his
traditional place of ``first in war, first in peace, and first in
the hearts of his countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have
begun a $3 million campaign to spread his story far and wide during
the bicentennial year of his death. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   URBAN-HEATISLANDS _ ATLANTA _ In Atlanta, summertime in the city

exacerbate air pollution levels and make life miserable for city
inhabitants. In the countryside, trees provide cooling shade, and
water evaporating from leaves cool the air. A new NASA study is
helping Atlanta and four other cities pinpoint heat island problems
so that steps can be made - such as planting more trees _ to
mitigate the heat island effects. (Seabrook, Atlanta

Washington's death on Dec. 14, 1799, the keepers of his historic
homestead and his legacy are fearful that the Father of His Country
is being forgotten. So, seeking to restore Washington to his
traditional place of ``first in war, first in peace, and first in
the hearts of his countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have
begun a $3 million campaign to spread his story far and wide during
the bicentennial year of his death. (Dart, Cox News Service).

WHY DID SO MANY IGNORE THE CLINTON TRIAL? THEY HAD LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been thinking this heretical thought: King Hussein's recent
death was well timed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean I wished him dead. Or that the world is better off
without him. Or that I have no sympathy for his family or his
fellow Jordanians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What I mean is that his death came at just the right time to
remind our elected officials why so many of us put President
Clinton's impeachment trial fairly far down our list of things to
fret over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look at what happened when Hussein died. Bill Clinton
immediately led a large American delegation to Amman. He and others
simply dropped what they were doing and went to do something they
considered more important. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton went. Gerald Ford went and Jimmy Carter
and George Bush. So did Sen. Ted Stevens and Sen. Patrick Leahy,
who at that very moment were jurors in the impeachment trial. And
23 other people went with the president, too, from two members of
the House to the executive secretary of the National Security
Council to the parents of Jordan's Queen Noor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all those people put the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal in a
secondary position, why is anyone surprised that many of the rest
of us often found compelling reasons to do the same? Pollsters
regularly reflected Americans' discontent with the impeachment
process _ and disinterest, too. The reasons, no doubt, were many.
But at least one cause was that those of us who live outside the
Beltway actually have lives that require our daily attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting the Clinton affair wasn't worthy of notice
and analysis. Indeed, the president's behavior sickened nearly
everyone I know _ especially people who believe in the policies he
has represented. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But King Hussein's death was a painful reminder that some things
take precedence over others. That's something most of us out here
in the country instinctively knew as we took care of private
matters that were, quite simply, more crucial to us than what Ken
Starr or Henry Hyde or Charles Ruf or Tom Daschle or even Chief
Justice William Rehnquist were saying or doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate trial went on, for instance, both a current and
a former member of my church died. For me, this sad news quickly
became more important than whatever was happening in Washington.
Oh, like Bill Clinton I can ``compartmentalize'' pretty well. I
could, thus, devote time to both matters. But there was no doubt
which was more important, which explains why I was at a funeral
when the acquittal vote came. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar _ though joyful _ experience as I watched the
teen-ager who lives in my house prepare for a big role in a school
musical while the impeachment trial raged. His hard work _ and his
brief illness just before the play's opening _ were, in the end,
more important to me than whether senators would call Monica
Lewinsky to their chamber for live testimony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And no doubt all across the land parents of young actors and
actresses (and basketball players and debaters and oboe players and
on and on) were more engaged in the lives of their children than in
the personally pathetic life of the president or in the distended
rhetoric that demanded his ouster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Washington seethed, one of my sisters experienced a career
crisis 500 miles from where I live. At the same time _ and at more
than twice that distance from me _ an old friend was undergoing
surgery. Beyond worrying about all that, I was working with my wife
on important projects in our house. I was planning speeches I have
to give and classes I'm committed to teaching. And along with
working on a book of my own, I was writing a dedication to a
soon-to-be-published book containing a friend's sermons and hymns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, in fact, decent citizens lived their
decent lives and took care of business that they had every right to
feel was more important than what had entangled Washington. And
Washington would do a lot better by all of us if it would remember
that. &QL;

ABC'S `SONNY &AMP; CHER' PUTS `THE '60S' TO SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even after his death, we are still
underestimating Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
   His dad thought he was a failure when as a young man Sonny was
delivering meat for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Cher doubted him several times: That he could make them a hit
team (he did); that he could make her a movie star (he couldn't;
that came later); that he could resurrect their career in Las
Vegas, and write another hit song more in line with the late '60s
sound (he did, ``And the Beat Goes On''), and that the two could
make it with their own television show (they did).
</P>
<P>
   And the public, well, Sonny always made a great punch line to a
lot of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So the fact the Sonny and Cher story was being turned into a
television movie for ABC (and the February sweeps) was initially
greeted with a yawn and a smirk, especially since NBC had ``the
movie event of a generation'' coming up with its two-part ``The
'60s.''
</P>
<P>
   We underestimated Sonny yet again. ``The '60s'' was lame. ``And
the Beat Goes On: The Sonny &AMP; Cher Story'' (Monday at 9 p.m. EST,
check local listings) is not. For a made-for-television movie, it
is pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The '60s'' was in part victim to overhyped expectations,
``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story'' is a beneficiary
of less lofty ambitions. What makes the movie work is the
stunningly perfect casting of the title characters, an extended
nationwide search that unearthed two relative newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Underwood is Sonny, a mish-mash of superficial insecurities
and ticks masking a bedrock of determination.
</P>
<P>
   Simply said and without exaggeration, Renee Faia was born to
play Cher. Her eyes and nose, which along with the waist-length
hair were Cher's most prominent features, are dead-on. Faia also
captures the world-weary countenance of the singer/actor, the roll
of the eyes, the barbs she directed at Sonny as part of the act
that wasn't always acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story'' is not the
whole story _ it is based on Sonny's book, and overwhelmingly
concentrates on the 1960s and early 1970s _ but stops well short of
hagiography. It is not a movie event of a generation, but
accomplishes what it sets out to do: be a movie for a Monday night.

MEMORIAL TO RECALL WORLD WAR II INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SPELLING of Davis Buckley in 9th graf and Melvin Chiogioji in
next to last graf is correct.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fifty-seven years after President Franklin D.
Roosevelt authorized the mass incarceration of 120,000 people of
Japanese ancestry in World War II, a national campaign is under way
to build a memorial to the patriotism they displayed in those dark
days.
</P>
<P>
   A major fund-raising drive for the memorial _ to be built just a
few blocks from the U.S. Capitol _ began Friday, the National Day
of Remembrance, marking Roosevelt's signing of Executive Order
9066, which set the internment in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the memorial puts a proper focus on the Day of
Remembrance,'' said Cressey Nakagawa, a San Francisco attorney and
board member of the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation,
which is raising private money for the project.
</P>
<P>
   National Day of Remembrance activities were held across the
country. On Saturday in San Francisco the National Japanese
American Historical Society will honor a team of researchers and
lawyers who successfully challenged the constitutionality of the
internment camps in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For many Japanese Americans, a national memorial commemorating
their experience resonates deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Many camp survivors, whose families lost everything in the
forced evacuation of their homes and businesses, were so
traumatized that they only began talking about their experiences in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that we tell the story,'' said World War
II veteran Harry Fukuhara, 79, of San Jose. ``It's so hard to
explain it in words, though. So you have to have a monument you can
see.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city famous for its memorials, the tribute to Japanese
Americans might be regarded as unique because it focuses on a
particular ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   But the memorial's architect, Davis Buckley, who also designed
the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, said
it has a broader message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorials become focal points,'' said Buckley. ``They are part
of the texture of our memory. And it's that memory that's so
essential and extraordinarily important here. Because the memorial
speaks to a despicable event in our history, it goes beyond
Japanese Americans. It speaks to every American.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress and President George Bush approved the project in 1992,
setting aside a sloping triangle of federal land in the shadow of
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The design by Buckley, who consulted with Japanese-American
architects, envisions a park-like setting of cherry trees and a
plaza whose central feature is a Nina Akamu sculpture _ two
Japanese cranes entwined in barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   On a curved wall will be the names of Japanese Americans killed
in action during the war, along with the names of the 10 internment
camps where families were imprisoned and other inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the memorial was to be a tribute to Japanese
American fighting men of World War II. About 33,000 Japanese
Americans from Hawaii and the mainland volunteered for military
service. Most served in the legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team
and the 100th Battalion, which combined to become the most highly
decorated military unit of its size.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 Japanese Americans also served with the Military
Intelligence Service in the Pacific, shortening the war by serving
as translators and breaking enemy codes.
</P>
<P>
   But with ethnic-specific military memorials seeming to draw
disfavor, organizers of the memorial broadened its theme to capture
the entire experience of Japanese Americans during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the foundation has quietly raised $5 million of the
$8.6 million needed for construction. It has until Oct. 15 of this
year to raise the rest _ or the legislation authorizing the
memorial will lapse. ``We plan to run a full-blown campaign,'' said
Nakagawa.
</P>
<P>
   Once built, the memorial will be maintained by the National Park
Service. The foundation, on whose honorary board sit some of the
nation's most prominent Japanese Americans _ including former Rep.
Norman Mineta, D-Calif.; Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; and Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif. _ will dissolve after construction is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta sponsored the bill to authorize the memorial. He also
wrote House legislation in 1988 that provided $1.2 billion in
reparations and apologies to Japanese Americans who were interned.
</P>
<P>
   For Mineta, who was 10 when he and his family were interned, the
memorial is a ``monument to the faith and patriotism of the
Japanese Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It also speaks to something else, said retired Rear Adm. Melvin
Chiogioji of Washington, D.C., who chairs the foundation board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country was big enough to apologize _ I don't think any
other country in the world would do that,'' he said.

nothing but run, chow down, take a nap and then run some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at their happiest when they are out dashing through
the snow,'' said Bev Donovan, matriarch of this family that has
totally gone to the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Mike and twin daughters Andrea and Angela are all
actively involved in racing sled dogs. They buy, breed, train,
feed, shelter and love their assortment of canines to the point of
obsession. Yet the rewards are endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow extremely close,'' said Scott Gille, the husband of
Angela who became an enthusiast himself after marrying into the
clan. ``I have 10 dogs of my own now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the animals will be participating in the races this
weekend outside the town of Warrensburg in upstate New York.
Approximately 100 teams and mushers from throughout the Northeast
and Canada will be at the event Saturday and Sunday. The races,
staged at Pack Forest just north of Warrensburg, are sponsored by
the Pennsylvania Sled Dog Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a room left in town,'' said Barbara Fredericks
of the Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce. ``I've been fielding calls
for two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year that the event is being held at Pack
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see some of the finest dog sled races in the country,''
Bev Donovan said. ``They'll be races staged in many classes.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular is the four-dog sportsman division. The
unlimited class will see anywhere from 10 to 20 dogs pulling a sled
around a 13-mile circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a sight,'' Donovan said. ``The dogs are all barking
and pulling on their harnesses. Then, once the race starts, you
could hear a pin drop. All you can hear is the patter of their paws
on the snow. They're all business then.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are sent off at one and two-minute intervals. Some are
light and fast. Others are stronger and slower. Depending upon the
snow conditions of that day, one type will have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The devotion between human and dog exceeds the normal bond
usually found between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outright, unconditional love,'' Donovan said. ``A musher
would do anything for his dogs and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   One may not look any further than the Donovan family. They go
through 500 pounds of high energy dog food each month. The animals
get the best medical treatment that can be provided. Their
veterinarian, Dr. John O'Connor of the Glens Falls, makes a house
call to the Donovans since it usually takes several hours attending
to all the team members' shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Donovans work two jobs each and go without much sleep in
order to attend to their 17 athletes. They arise at 2:30 a.m. to
deliver newspapers. Then Mike Donovan goes to work at the post
office and Bev Donovan as a nurse at a rest home. They're home by
3:30 p.m. to begin running the dogs on their training routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the temperatures climb above 50 degrees, we can't run
them anymore,'' Bev Donovan said. ``They are exercised twice or
three times a day but would get too hot if they ran hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the dogs only have about two more months of their
season. Sassy seems to sense it. She addresses everyone personally
who comes within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pay too much attention to her,'' Gille said. ``She
just likes to hear herself talk.''

 &HT;    PROSPECT OF EAST TIMOR INDEPENDENCE CARRIES FEARS OF CHAOS,
BLOODSHED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIQUICA, Indonesia _ Ragged coffee farmers are battling with
bows and arrows, while teachers and doctors are packing their bags
to flee chaos they fear will descend if the disputed territory
called East Timor goes independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are in danger,'' said Timorese separatist Gregory
Dos Santos, who this week gave harbor in his home to five skinny,
glassy-eyed warriors who had run from fighting 10 miles away. Two
of them were 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   They share his sentiment that East Timor must seize the chance
for full freedom from Indonesia, and this is the issue that has
sparked a month-long escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The 800,000 people of this jungle-covered half-island, a
colonial remnant still afflicted with rampant poverty and feudal
polarization, suddenly in the past month were told they will have a
choice: accept broad self-rule as part of Indonesia, or become
independent.
</P>
<P>
   They are almost certain to opt for independence if they get the
chance. But a determined minority of islanders who see benefits in
Indonesian rule already are fiercely resisting the split.
</P>
<P>
   And charges are growing that Indonesia's military is acting to
thwart its own government's stated policy by arming
anti-independence paramilitary groups. Army officers admit they are
supplying guns, but say their aim is maintaining order.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side talks about the solution, the other side provides
weapons,'' said David Ximenes, a one-time guerrilla fighter and now
a leader of a pro-independence coalition here. ``It is Indonesia's
scheme to build a civil war. Their goal is to legitimatize their
army here.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether pro or con, many East Timorese acknowledge that
independence is a status for which they are not ready, one that
risks throwing them back to a fruitless and anarchic past.
</P>
<P>
   The international community, which did nothing to restrain the
often brutal colonial handling of East Timor by Indonesia, now is
scrambling to prevent the slide backward. A United Nations
peacekeeping force or transitional authority may be needed to head
off total societal collapse.
</P>
<P>
   This past week alone, thousands trod through sultry heat in
funeral processions mourning two young men killed in separate
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   One victim buried in the provincial capital Dili was an
independence supporter. The funeral here was for a pro-integration
youth, whom the five frightened young fugitives admit was killed by
their group -- they said in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   It was only late last month that Indonesia first suggested East
Timor might be set free if its people turn down a limited autonomy
plan still being constructed under UN auspices. Then on Feb. 11
President B.J. Habibie stunned his countrymen and the world by
saying this Connecticut-sized territory could be independent as
early as next Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie engineered a reversal of his country's 23-year policy
that began when Indonesia invaded East Timor in late 1975. Its
troops smothered a civil war that broke out as soon as the previous
colonial occupier, Portugal, abruptly withdrew earlier in the year.
In 1976 Indonesia formally annexed East Timor as its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   The annexation was not recognized internationally -- except by
Australia -- and guerrilla fighters of the East Timor independence
movement, Fretilin, have clashed with Indonesian armed forces
stationed here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 East Timorese died as a result of
Indonesia's presence, through fighting, executions or starvation
and disease attributed to draconian resettlement policies. Now,
those Timorese who cooperated with Indonesian authorities fear
retribution in an independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Swiss president of the International Red Cross,
Cornelio Sommaruga, appealed for permission to expand the Red Cross
presence in East Timor for an urgently needed ``humanitarian
mobilization.'' He cited the departure of frightened essential
service providers and a growing wave of thousands of internal
refugees from local hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have started packing up stuff. Our worry is that we will
have to leave very quickly,'' said August Sugiarto, 32, who has
taught chemistry for 10 years at General High School No. 2 in Dili,
the East Timor capital about 15 miles east of Liquica (pronounced
``Li-KEE-sa'').
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is conflict, we may be caught in the middle,'' said
Sugiarto, who is from Indonesia's main island of Java.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 90 percent of junior and senior high school
teachers on East Timor, like Sugiarto, are not Timorese. They are
employees of the central government from other parts of the
Indonesian archipelago who were assigned to work here, as are
thousands of others running everything from hospitals to power and
water plants.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesia cuts ties to East Timor, these civil servants
expect to be removed to other jobs. And many of them want to go,
fearing they are obvious targets if hostilities flare.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, employees at the central hospital in Dili
went on strike for a week, after an Indonesian doctor was attacked
by distraught relatives of a Timorese patient who died. In the
understaffed facility, the doctor had had to choose one of two
emergency patients he would treat, and the untreated patient did
not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Violence here, as elsewhere in Indonesia, has escalated since
economic and political crises led to the ouster of former President
Suharto last May. Confusion and conflict are exacerbated here by
the independence issue.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the young warriors hiding out at the Liquica
bungalow of Gregory Dos Santos, a local leader of the armed branch
of Fretilin, is an example of the murky disputes already raging.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos and the fugitives said the pro-independence group was
attacked by a band of anti-independence fighters in their village
Vatoboro. Both sides battled with spears, machetes, bows and arrows
-- the traditional weapons found in every East Timor home.
</P>
<P>
   One attacker was killed, and he turned out to be the son of an
East Timorese serving with the Indonesian army. The next day the
soldiers came.
</P>
<P>
   Troops beat up the pro-independence group with sticks and the
butts of their rifles, they said, and those who could flee, did.
About 60 families all escaped into the forest, though some emerged
to find shelter with sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   However, local military authorities put the blame 100 percent on
pro-independence forces, saying they grabbed a man who was
innocently working in the fields. The man's friends in the
anti-independence civilian militia decided to retrieve him, and a
battle ensued in which one of their fighters was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, the result is the same. One 18-year-old who
was pro-Indonesia died. Four young men who are pro-independence
were viciously battered, one ending up in the military hospital in
Dili and three others on the spare wooden pallets of what passes
for a hospital in Liquica.

`OFFICE SPACE' OFFERS A FEW LAUGHS BUT NO HURRAHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to sum up the philosophy (or the advertising) behind
``Office Space,'' a harmless proletarian revenge fantasy from the
creator of ``Beavis and Butthead,'' without resorting to a certain
well-worn vulgarism. But we can try.
</P>
<P>
   Work is a pain in the patoot. The printer is always down, the
nerd at the next desk is always muttering, and the boss is an oily
creep. Work bites the big tomato. Work is a drag. Work stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whether it actually does is an individual matter. But for
the disgruntled occupants of ``Office Space,'' gainful employ is a
cause for much comic whining. Some of it gets a laugh and some of
it doesn't, but all of it speaks to the deep, dark frustrations of
the average cubicle dweller.
</P>
<P>
   Peter (Ron Livingston, ``Swingers'') is about as average as they
get. Armed with crippling ennui and the waggish eyebrows to express
it, Peter trundles daily into his job as a software programmer at
Initech _ a sterile corporate workplace where eight bosses oversee
his every move, or lack thereof. The worst, a slithery jerk named
Lumbergh (Gary Cole, repulsive par excellence), makes Peter's life
purgatory with incessant demands on his time and patience. Peter is
one unhappy fella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single day of my life has been worse than the day before
it,'' he explains to a hypnotherapist in one of the movie's funnier
sequences. ``So, every day you see me _ that's the worst day of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypnotherapist mesmerizes Peter into a state of profound
relaxation, then croaks of a heart attack before he can wake him
up. Thus Peter becomes a blissed-out deadbeat. Thus he assumes a
who-the-hey-cares attitude about work, where he shows up on
occasion to trash his cubicle and gut fish at his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Thus he engages two beleaguered colleagues (Ajay Naidu and David
Herman, both convincing nebbishes) in an embezzlement scheme that
could crash the company. And thus the movie becomes a ``Nine to
Five'' for malcontent Gen X drones.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the plot might have whirled off into a bunch of
directions _ into a high-concept fantasy (the hypnosis thing), into
a comic romance (with Jennifer Aniston, playing Peter's waitress
girlfriend), into a farcical crime caper (the embezzlement). But
writer-director Mike Judge (who made his feature debut with
``Beavis and Butt-head Do America'') has more modest ambitions,
wanting only to spin some humor from the hum-drum angst of everyday
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's transformation from working stiff to enlightened
slacker is amiable enough, and if the movie is too flat to be
hilarious _ if Judge's direction never quite breaks out of his
animated background _ it has some memorable moments. Watch for the
gangsta-rap attack on an obnoxious laser printer _ it's a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston's presence here is a puzzler, since the part
amounts to a few measly scenes, most of them spent discussing the
details of her restaurant uniform. She has one great moment: When
Peter first invites her over to his place to watch ``Kung Fu,'' the
camera zooms into her face and tinkly music materializes on the
soundtrack. ``I ... LOVE ... KUNG ... FU,'' she says, staring at
Peter with dazed-kitten eyes. Piinn

KURDISH PROTESTS ATTRACT ATTENTION, LITTLE SYMPATHY IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The image of 15-year-old Nejla Kanteper running down a
London street, her head on fire, horrified Britons this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it also spoke a bitter truth about Kurdish exiles like
Kanteper. Here, as in the rest of Europe, the Kurds are only
noticed when they light themselves on fire, as she did, or engage
in violent protests like the ones launched by the arrest on Monday
of the fugitive Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, about 75 Kurdish protesters ended their three-day
takeover of the Greek embassy in London. A Greek caretaker who had
been held hostage was released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   British police refused the protesters' demands that they not be
arrested and be allowed to make a statement to the news media in
exchange for leaving the premises. Before the standoff ended,
frustrated officers said they were receiving muddled demands and
messages from inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what they want,'' one senior officer
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the standoff in London underscores the lack of
organization and political sophistication, not to mention bitter
infighting, that have all hurt the Kurds' pursuit of their own
country.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility has replaced indifference among many British people
toward the Kurds. The violent demonstrations that flared across
Europe this week, and are likely to erupt again when Ocalan stands
trial in Turkey, appear to have have eroded what little sympathy
there was here for the Kurdish cause.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged Englishwoman who paused on Wednesday afternoon to
observe the demonstrators outside the embassy expressed little
empathy for the teenage girl who set herself on fire to make a
political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's you and I paying for her in the National Health,'' the
woman complained, referring to the long hospitalization Nejla
Kanteper is expected to undergo while recovering from severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish outrage, and reaction to it, continued to reverberate
across Europe, even as the occupations of Greek diplomatic missions
and a brief takeover of a UN office in Vienna ended.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities fear that the estimated 500,000 Kurds in
Germany, the biggest Kurdish exile community in Europe, will cause
widespread havoc if protests continue.
</P>
<P>
   After riots flared throughout Germany, and Israeli security
guards shot dead three Kurdish protesters when they stormed the
Israeli embassy in Berlin, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder spoke for
most in his country when he warned that Kurds who break the law to
make political statements would be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on the number of Kurds living throughout Europe are
notoriously inaccurate, largely because most countries don't
recognize Kurds as a separate nationality. Instead, they are listed
as Turks, Iraqis, or Syrians _ after the nations in which the bulk
of the estimated 25 million Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish activists claim that upwards of 60,000 Kurds live in
Britain, most of them in London. But an official at Britain's
Foreign Office Thursday said the accurate figure is much lower.
``If there were 60,000 Kurds living here, you'd see more than a few
hundred people outside the (Greek) embassy,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   At Britain's Home Office, which is responsible for immigration
and criminal justice, officials admitted they knew little about the
Kurdish exile community. But they said it has not mounted an
organized political movement. Andy Cole, a Home Office spokesman,
said the storming of the Greek embassy was the first ``controlled
reaction'' by Kurds in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But as frustrated police officers trying to resolve the standoff
explained, the storming of the embassy appeared to be the only
coordinated aspect of the protest. They added that the protesters
entered the building with no obvious plan or leader and gave police
conflicting demands.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the embassy, Zinar Hogir, a spokesman for the Kurdistan
Information Center, said the protesters want British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook to intervene with Turkish authorities to
ensure a fair trial for Ocalan. By that, Hogir and other Kurdish
separatists explained, they want a trial in which Ocalan would not
be charged for any killings. Over 30,000 people have died in the
ugly, 14-year war between the Kurdish Workers' Party, known as the
PKK, and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ocalan is engaged in ``a national liberation struggle,''
he cannot legally be charged with murder, argued Hogir. Besides, he
added, Turkey has killed more people than have ``Kurdish freedom
fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Office spokesman said those demands underscore the
political naivete of the protesters. First, he said, the government
will not intervene in what it regards as the internal affairs of
Turkey. And Britain has no intention to allow the protesters to
leave the embassy without facing criminal charges, ``We don't
reward people who take over embassies,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds have long complained that history, national boundaries
and political alliances have worked against them. Hogir and other
Kurds here complain that Turkey's membership in NATO mutes western
criticism of it. They contrast the determination of the western
allies to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's operations
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo with the muted reaction toward
Turkey's ruthless crushing of Kurdish separatists. They also
acknowledge that rivalry among different Kurdish factions hurts
their causes.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy seizure, and especially the holding of a hostage,
have done little to endear Kurds to a British government that
already regards Kurdish claims of persecution in Turkey with
considerable skepticism. British tourists have been killed in
Turkey by Ocalan's group in a campaign to hurt the country's
thriving tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,085 heads of Kurdish households who applied for
political asylum in Britain last year claiming persecution in
Turkey, only 40 were granted refugee status. Another 30 were not
recognized as refugees but allowed to stay. In 1997, of the 1,585
applications for asylum, only 110 were allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and leftists here tend to be isolated in their sympathy
for the Kurds. Tony Benn, the dean of the Labor Party's old
socialist wing, mingled with demonstrators on Wednesday. Benn said
the Kurds' demand for a homeland is as legitimate as that of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the playwright Harold Pinter said that British people
should regard the acts they've seen this week not as evidence of
irrational malcontents but of a people so desperate that they were
willing to kill themselves to draw attention to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   But most Britons, like taxi driver Steven King, have tired of
them. King, who said he lost half a day's wages on Tuesday when the
demonstrators blocked a main road in the Holland Park section of
London, said: ``If they had their own country, they wouldn't act
like this there. And if they did, the police wouldn't tolerate it
like ours do.''

JULIAN LENNON: BACK WITH A `SMILE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you intend to come back with another album?
</P>
<P>
   An emphatic no is the quick answer by Julian Lennon, the
once-shy son of Beatles icon John. The new album, ``Photograph
Smile,'' will appear Tuesday, a triumph of grit and perseverance
for a Lennon who was considered finished in the eyes of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Julian popped up in 1984 as a teen favorite with the
album ``Valotte,'' he ended up ``beyond disillusionment'' with the
music business for most of the past decade. He felt shafted by his
managers and his record label, before walking away after 1991's
ironically entitled ``Help Yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, today, Julian (about whom Paul McCartney wrote the
classic ``Hey Jude'') is not afraid to lash out at the biz, nor
afraid to criticize his dad's widow, Yoko Ono, for what he
perceives as diminishing his role in the Lennon legacy. More on
that later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got so frustrated after the last album,'' says Julian.
``I'd had too many broken promises, lack of support, things not
going the way I had hoped, and people just not coming up with the
goods. After living 100 percent in this wonderful industry, it was
time to cut my losses and get the hell out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy anymore. I wasn't doing what I wanted to do and
I didn't have any control,'' adds Lennon, now a worldly-wise 35.
``It took me five years to be released from the contract I was tied
into, with the record company and management. In that time, if I
had worked, they would have owned it. So I chose not to work. But
it was a blessing in disguise, because I actually lived life for a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of John Lennon by his first wife, Cynthia, Julian
started painting and sculpting. He drove across Europe visiting
friends. He did a lot of sailing, bicycling, and cooking. He tried
photography. eventually, he started composing music again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started writing naturally again,'' he says. ``No time
clocks, nobody knocking at the door. Nobody telling me that it's
not commercial enough or it's not uptempo enough, or this or that.
And once I started writing naturally again, it flowed. I was just
writing for the sake of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Photograph Smile,'' which starts out slowly in a
style very derivative of his dad, but shows a maturing talent as
the 14 songs unfold. There's the chiming, 12-string pop of ``I
Don't Wanna Know,'' the Middle East touches of ``Crucified''
(``we're all freaks in this sideshow,'' he sings), the Paul
Simon-like bounce of ``Kiss Beyond the Catcher,'' the environmental
anthem ``How Many Times'' (about deforestation), the tautly
interesting ``Walls'' (``you feel you have to scream and shout to
let the demons out''), and the idealistic ``Believe,'' which
reaffirms Julian's innate optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The overall sound is Beatlesque (much more so than half-brother
Sean Lennon's album last year), but with better melodies and more
insightful lyrics than Julian has previously shown. It's not a
hard-rock album by any means (he hasn't inherited that side of his
dad's genes), but it's a very decent pop record that he hopes to
back with a tour later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, the album appears to be chiefly concerned with the
pros and cons of romance, but the hidden agenda is a discussion of
the music industry, Lennon admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is written with the theme of love in mind, but a lot
of songs are actually written about the business, about the
relationships I was in with record companies and with managers. But
at the end of the day, the last things I want to write about are
record companies and business managers. And I certainly think the
public would agree with that. So, rather than droning on about the
business side of life, it's turned around into the theme of love to
make it more relatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, he comes out the other side with a still positive
outlook. As the last song, ``Way to Your Heart'' (a ballad with a
pretty string arrangement) states: ``I want to love you but not to
mold you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an optimist in that respect,'' he says.
``I've felt that there's always an answer. That's why I've felt
that I would find a level of peace in life. . . . I think what
keeps you going is that love inside you and the hope and the faith
that things are going to bloody work out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lennon is thrilled to release another record, he's not as
thrilled with his relationship with Yoko Ono. He has always gotten
along with Sean, but feels Ono has never given him his due as
John's other son. In fact, he had to fight hard, he says, just to
negotiate a settlement to get some of the money from his dad's
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I've gotten a piece of something that I can pass down
to my kids and to the rest of the Lennon family which does exist in
Europe, which has been shut out from the rest of the world by
Yoko,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been buying some of his dad's stuff back from auctions
_ ``some of the Beatles stuff, because none of that was handed to
me at all. The most ironic thing is how do you think I'm paying for
these things of dad's from the auctions? I'm buying back his stuff
for myself and my kids and the Lennon family in Europe with his
money, which is slightly insane, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian, who has no children as yet, says that Yoko ``wants the
history books to show that she and Sean are the Lennon family, and
that we do not exist. If you look at the (recent boxed set) the
`John Lennon Anthology,' if you look at anything that she has part
and parcel to do with, that she's had any control over, if it had
anything to do with dad or the Beatles or before the Beatles or
after, it's a rarity that you'll see my mom and myself as part of
that. It's always Yoko and Sean.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon can go on about this subject, but he'd clearly rather
talk about the happier life he leads today. He has lived in England
and the United States (in New York and Los Angeles), but now lives
in the lake country of northern Italy, which he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live on a lake and it's very quiet, very peaceful,'' he
says. ``The people are sweet, the food is phenomenal, the scenery
is phenomenal. Within an hour, you're skiing. Within a couple of
hours, you're on the beach. It's absolutely beautiful.''

`OCTOBER SKY' MAKES THE MOST OF ITS TIME AND PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
OCTOBER SKY 
Directed by: Joe Johnston 
Screenplay by: Lewis Colick (based on Homer Hickam Jr.'s memoir) 
Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, William Lee Scott, Chris
Owen, Chad Lindberg, Natalie Canerday, Laura Dern 
Running time: 108 minutes 
Rated: PG (language, brief teen sensuality and alcohol use, and for
some thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a rocket scientist to love ``October Sky.''
Based on the memoir of retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, it
traces his struggle as a teenager in Coalwood, W. Va., inspired by
Sputnik when everyone else was afraid of it and the Soviets who
launched it. Their gaze is downward-directed, into the coal mine
whose owners call the shots in the town. The gaze of Jake
Gyllenhaal's young Homer, however, is resolutely upward. Inspired
by his hero, Wernher von Braun, he and three buddies experiment
with homemade rockets in a far from encouraging climate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we know Homer went on to a career with NASA never
undercuts the suspense. So solidly are he and his pals
characterized, so persuasively is the texture of the community laid
in, that the film not only is convincing, it's affecting in a
moment-to-moment way. We want to know how he did it, how he
overcame skepticism and initial failure. ``October Sky'' isn't
afraid to be unabashedly inspirational. But its message wisely
takes a back seat to its storytelling skills, which are as
compelling as they are considerable, starting with our amusement at
the seriousness with which the inhabitants of Coalwood take the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But quickly we realize that fearfulness is bred into communal
life there, including the fear of economic devastation. That's one
reason Homer's father, played by the underappreciated Chris Cooper
in one of his finest performances, automatically thinks in terms of
sending his sons down into the mine, unless an athletic scholarship
should enter the picture. Not that Homer and his family are poor.
They belong to Coalwood's version of an aristocracy, since the
senior Hickam is the mine supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   It's momentarily startling to hear Cooper, so unforgettable as
the union organizer in John Sayles's ``Matewan,'' intensely voice
the management's anti-union line. But it's a measure of the
strength of ``October Sky'' that Cooper's John Hickman is no mere
cardboard heavy. Never do we doubt that he loves his family, or
that he is, in his own skewed way, conscientious, a hard-working
and honest man whose intrinsic pride and self-reliance have been
used against him, turning him away from a communal ethos. It's out
of misplaced love that he wants to literally give his sons the
shaft. So urgently does Cooper project his conflicted character
that it would be criminal if he didn't nail down one of next year's
Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But while Cooper's John Hickam is the film's most complex
character, there's nothing lacking in Gyllenhaal and the other
young actors playing his buddies. He's rightly unpolished but
characterful and doesn't give up when his first experiments fail.
Prospects improve when he enlists the aid of his three friends
believably played by Chris Owen, William Lee Scott, and Chad
Lindberg. The biggest boost comes from Owen's geeky math whiz,
Quentin, who lives at the low end of the Coalwood scale, in a
rickety shack. One of the strands in the film's huge emotional pull
involves us wishing Quentin can escape Coalwood along with Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high school principal is discouraging, and
represents the Coalwood majority strongly enough to make you ask
why they're so invested in the boys' failure, Homer and the others
do get some backing, most notably from Laura Dern's teacher, who
points them toward a science fair. Dern's low-key naturalism sits
perfectly in the film's unerring evocation of time and place and
community texture. It may sound corny in the telling, but you'll be
caught up in the boys' attempts to end their long string of
misfires, launch one of their homemade rockets according to plan,
and, in doing so, launch their lives as well, blasting them beyond
the soul-crushing life that awaits them in the pits. As a movie,
the biggest obstacle ``October Sky'' faces is a pall of uplift. But
with the old-fashioned resoluteness of its era, it soars beyond
that, too.

OLYMPIC SPONSORS REEVALUATING THEIR ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What for 15 years has been indisputably a golden calf among
sports marketing opportunities for major corporations like
Coca-Cola, Xerox and Samsung, now is suddenly open to question.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of horrific publicity about corruption in the
International Olympic Committee and the Winter Games scheduled for
Salt Lake City in 2002, companies are begining to reevaluate
whether the Olympics continue to be the ultimate advertising
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   While there remains a stubborn reluctance on the part of
executives of the companies to publicly challenge the IOC _ leaving
David D'Alessandro, the president and chief operating officer of
Boston's John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. as the most
prominent public critic _ observers say that a meeting in New York
City last week among the major sponsors and the IOC was a
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the sponsors strongly challenged IOC officals at the
meeting to move more aggressively to clean up the scandal.
Moreover, the companies are starting to field queries from their
boards of directors and stockholders about how they are handling
the Olympic mess.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if this was a normal Olympic cycle, the only talk
about the games at Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta Thursday
would have been about strategies to maximize the company's $50
million sponsorship of the bi-annual events.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board of directors of Coke, a sponsor of the
Olympics for 70 years, was slated to discuss far more rudimentary
issues: the relative value of the sponsorship, and whether the
company's brand could be tarnished by associating with the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, as a sponsor we're concerned when events of this
seriousness _ and they are quite serious _ impact any activity of
the company, whether they be sponsorships or what have you,'' said
board member Susan B. King, a former senior vice-president of the
company, who is a trustee of Duke University. ``I think everybody
would like to see this weathered.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coke has not gone public with strong criticism of the IOC,
sports marketing sources say that the company and Visa
International have been outspoken in private dealings with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several sponsors who share D'Alessandro's concerns,
but for whatever reasons they don't want to be as public about
it,'' said Bob Heussner, the senior vice-president for strategic
planning at Advantage International, the worldwide sports and
marketing agency, based in McLean, Va. ``There was a lot of concern
expressed at that meeting, and a lot of questions asked for which
the IOC had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think how all of this sorts out depends on what happens in
the next 60 to 90 days,'' Heussner said. ``If, by then, all of the
skeletons are out of the closet and dealt with effectively, I would
predict that most of the sponsors stay involved, and at the current
level. If the IOC doesn't do that, it's a roll of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four members of IOC have been linked to ethical
misconduct involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter
Games. The IOC has said it will expel at least eight of those
members. Meanwhile, the IOC, the Attorney General of Utah, the
United States Justice Department, and the US Olympic Committee are
all conducting investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, according to industry observers and some
company officials, the sponsors are expected to use the negative
publicity as leverage to try and drive down sponsorship fees, and
to loosen the IOC's control of the use of the Olympic rings as a
marketing symbol. The IOC's rigid approach to how the symbol of the
Olympics may be used in marketing is a source of continued
frustration for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms are starting to be more proactive, albeit behind the
scenes. Sources, including industry observers, say that Visa is
telling the IOC that it wants the leader of the Olympic movement,
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, to step down, if Visa is to
continue to support the Olympics at its current level of about $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never make any of our private communications with the
IOC or anyone else public,'' said Michael Sherman, director of
international corporate communications for Visa. ``Visa has had
discussions on the role of the IOC leadership in the future, as
have other sponsors. But Visa has sent no letter discussing Mr.
Samaranch's position.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 major Olympic sponsors would appear to have considerable
leverage. With the exception of Coca-Cola and TIME/Sports
Illustrated, all must renew their sponsorships with the IOC later
this year. The scandal is forcing the companies to consider whether
their cherished international showcases are yielding diminishing
returns.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, industry sources say, is nearly $1 billion that the
IOC derives from sponsorships and, indirectly, from television
advertisers that the IOC uses to finance both the games and the
development of sports around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   What the companies are hoping for, and advocating strongly
behind closed doors, is swift and certain action by the IOC at its
March meetings in Switzerland to make clear that the way it has
conducted business since the Olympics became big money in 1984 is
no longer viable. At the meeting in New York last week, they
demanded, and received, assurances that there will be a conference
telephone call with IOC officials in early March, before the
crucial meetings, to make sure that certain reform is on track.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is specifically seeking: an admission from the IOC
that it is incapable of investigating itself; a new IOC membership
appointed by every member nation of the United Nations, as opposed
to the current membership appointed by Samaranch himself; a new
site-selection process that eliminates the IOC members' role of
visiting cities and then voting; full-disclosure of all gifts
received by members; and an immediate start of a search for a
successor to Samaranch, who is scheduled to retire in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the companies are about the difficult business of
weighing what impact the scandal is having on their brands. That is
difficult to assess, and the efforts so far have produced mixed
results.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner &AMP; Associates, a public research firm in Baltimore,
conducted a survey in early February that showed 70 percent of
American adults either had not heard about the scandal, or felt no
differently about the sponsors after having heard about it. Only 18
percent of those surveyed felt negatively about the companies. But
according to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll conducted on February 9,
51 percent of 711 adults examined said their respect for the games
has declined, with 23 percent saying they are less likely to watch
the 2002 games on television.
</P>
<P>
   Amid that confusing context, one of the sponsors making a
decision about involvement beyond 2000 is UPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are about the business of measuring constituent
impact,'' said Susan Rosenberg, an Olympic marketing official with
the company. ``We're using our customers and our employees and
surveying them to measure their reaction to what's been happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most of the sponsors, I would think, we're in a
wait-and-see mode, seeing what actions the IOC is going to take and
what the impact is,'' Rosenberg said. ``We feel we've had such
success with the Olympics, so far, why would we make a snap
decision now, when the process involving the allegations is still
ongoing?''
</P>
<P>
   The same wait-and-see approach, with caveats, prevails at Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed our concerns at the New York meeting,'' Sherman
said, ``and we expect decisive action across the board on a number
of issues both with the IOC and other areas. There is a lot of
communication involved with this at Visa International, and we are
very much on top of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many officials involved with the Olympics say that
the athletes and the long tradition of spectator interest in the
games themselves are likely to win out. But the sponsors will push
publicly or privately for reform and use their leverage to try and
rein in the escalation of fees _ which have jumped to the current
average of $40 million per sponsor from as little as $150,000 to
$250,000 for the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the continued popularity of the games themselves
is the bright portrait painted by Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC
Sports, which owns the US broadcast rights to the Olympics through
2008, at an estimated cost of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at the IOC can take any confidence that what they have
done to date is enough,'' Ebersol said. ``They must continue to
move to deal with new members under suspicion, to have new voting
procedures and to show, when it comes time to select the site of
the 2006 games, that this is a whole new way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, the fact of the matter is, we have not heard a single
word from any of our advertisers signed up for the (2000) Sydney
games in terms of them being concerned about what they have bought.
And we are half sold, already.''

   ``See,'' he said in English that was strong but still broken
after five years in the United States, ``I fight for what I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nguyen, along with hundreds of other Vietnamese refugees who
have settled in Orange County, has taken the fight against
communism to an unlikely setting: a nondescript shopping center
along one of Westminster's main boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day for more than a month, they have marched,
shouted anti-communist slogans and waved banners outside a store
whose owner insists on displaying a poster of communist leader Ho
Chi Minh and a communist Vietnamese flag in a part of town known as
Little Saigon. Fights have broken out. When 150 police officers in
helmets and body shields tried to disperse a crowd of 500 on
Monday, demonstrators laid down in their path.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters say they are exercising the freedom of speech
guaranteed in their adopted homeland. The store owner, Truong Van
Tran, says he is doing the same. With both sides unwilling to
budge, the standoff has highlighted the difficulties that can arise
when old wounds come up against new freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not the police, not the protesters, not even Tran's
lawyers _ can quite explain why Tran dared the Vietnamese community
to make him take down the flag and photo, which he had displayed
quietly for some time. Little is known about his personal story or
beliefs. All anyone knows for certain is that the 37-year-old Tran
returned to Vietnam last year for the first time in two decades and
that he came away convinced that the current government is a
legitimate one that deserves normalized relations with the United
States. He does not call himself a communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to provoke our community, the same as if he hang
Hitler's picture in Jewish community,'' said Nguyen, 48, who fought
against Ho Chi Minh's army and later spent 10 years in jail. ``The
law is not everything. There is a moral obligation to his
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County Superior Court judge, however, ruled that Tran
has a constitutional right to display the communist symbols at his
HiTek TV and VCR store. The American Civil Liberties Union, which
is representing Tran, said police must now enforce his right to do
so. Tran, who was hospitalized briefly after he was hit in the head
outside his store in mid-January and again last week when he fell
to the ground after a melee erupted, has vowed on Vietnamese radio
to rehang his display.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are your rights as guaranteed by the court and then your
rights as exist practically,'' said Peter Eliasberg, one of the
ACLU attorneys handling Tran's case. ``Right now he's being denied
his rights practically. . . . All I can say is if he's willing to
put his principles before the profit motive, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran's business has been closed for a month now, and Vietnamese
community leaders say they cannot imagine anyone shopping there
ever again. The landlord wants him out and has issued an eviction
notice, claiming that Tran owes thousands of dollars in back rent
and other fees. The landlord also says that Tran has hurt other
mall tenants by creating a public nuisance. Tran has said he
intends to fight the eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very appropriate time to evict a guy who's in arrears
on rent and then invites all these people down for a
confrontation,'' said attorney Jonathan Slipp, who represents
landlord Danh Quach. ``At that time, you start saying, `Maybe this
guy isn't the best tenant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks a one-note song is coming out of the Vietnamese
community in Orange County,'' Eliasberg explained. ``He thinks it's
important to have a dialogue and that issues should be discussed.
He's a stubborn guy and he thinks he has a right to speak and, as
an American, he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese-Americans in Orange County, where a third or more of
the 300,000 Vietnamese refugees in southern California live, say
they are horrified by how Tran has gone about making his point. In
one letter addressed to Vietnamese community leaders, and
translated into English by them, he boasted of the portrait of ``my
beloved Uncle Ho Chi Minh.'' In another, he added, ``If you all
think you are great, then go ahead, come over to clear me out.'' It
was signed, ``Good bye all of you in a state of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a core group of a dozen or more protesters has been
spending the night outside HiTek. Days, hundreds of Vietnamese
immigrants show up regularly, some to gawk, most to express the
anger and hurt that the symbols still evoke in them. Vietnam and
Korean war veterans have turned out to show their support for the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this in this community, it's just uncalled for,'' said
Alfred Garcia, 65, who wore his dog tags from the Korean War over
his shirt. ``Sure he has his First Amendment rights, but these
people were hurt really deeply by the war. What he's doing is like
shouting fire in a theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui Binh Ban, president of the Federation of Overseas Free
Vietnamese Communities in nearby Garden Grove, said, ``We lost
everything to survive. . . . We cannot accept to see the communist
flag fly here. He can do anything he wants, but he cannot provoke
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Orange County Human Relations Commission has been
unable to negotiate an armistice between the demonstrators and
Tran. Rusty Kennedy, the commission's executive director, doesn't
think there can or will be one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even on our list of expectations,'' Kennedy said.
``The spokespersons for the protesters will not negotiate with him.
Period. And he wants publicity for his cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The intransigence on both sides has put Westminster police in
the position of having to guarantee everyone's safety and their
right to air differing opinions. At one point, when Tran refused to
cooperate with their plans to safeguard him, police threatened to
arrest him if he returned to the video store. Police also declared
an unlawful assembly, and temporarily ordered the protesters to
leave. Both orders have since been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems intent on trying to inflame the community; at one
point he was talking about having a helicopter drop fliers with a
picture of the Hanoi flag,'' said Lieutenant Bill Lewis, spokesman
for the Westminster Police Department. ``What was that about? . . .
So we're ready for the long haul. Ending this would take I don't
know how many police officers and putting them in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thang Tran, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern
California and no relation to the store owner, said his group has
repeatedly urged peace among the protesters. Violence is what they
left behind in Vietnam, he said. It would do no good to bring it to
their streets now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right to free speech and we know that,'' said Ky
Ngo, one of the protest organizers. ``We have the right, too, to
raise our voice and show we're against him. You can do that in
America and we're in America now.''

MORE SENSIBLE CORE POSITON SHOULD BE IN INDEX FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a sizable five-figure amount of savings in an IRA. I
am 41 and am fairly risk-tolerant. Until March 1998 it did fairly
well in Columbia Growth. My financial adviser guaranteed me that we
could do better with other funds. Following this advice, we moved
it to the following investments: 50 percent in Oakmark, 30 percent
in Brandes Institutional International Equity, and 20 percent in
Acorn USA. Had I left the funds in their original location, I would
have garnered a 19 percent gain in the past 10 months. However,
presently the group as a whole has lost 3 percent. I realize this
is a small time period to judge the performance, but I really don't
want to head down this path if the past is any indication of the
future. Not to mention that I am paying a 1 percent annual fee for
this advice. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   P.S., Tigard, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. To a degree I wouldn't be too hard on this adviser _ the
suggestions went largely along the lines of advice that I
frequently give, which is to diversify beyond a large-cap growth
portfolio domination. With the benefit of hindsight, it seems to me
that the big error here was to move the core position from
large-cap growth (Columbia Growth) to the large-cap value
(Oakmark).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the past 52 weeks have not treated Oakmark kindly,
with its loss of 4.20 percent ranking it number 909 of 991 growth
funds tracked during that period by Lipper Analytical Services. The
average growth fund tracked by Lipper in that period returned 17.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your adviser relied on your assessment that you are
fairly risk-tolerant when choosing this fund. Oakmark's portfolio
manager Robert J. Sanborn is given to take big positions in what
Morningstar Mutual Funds calls deep value plays.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to a 9 percent-plus position in Phillip Morris and
a little more than 6 percent in downtrodden Nike. But Morningstar
also notes that over the long run Sanborn's plays have frequently
rewarded his gutsy shareholders well _ evidenced by its five-year
record of 17.29 percent returns, only slightly trailing the
large-cap value average of 17.88 percent in that period.
</P>
<P>
   The report on the two diversifications is better. Acorn USA, a
small-cap fund, lost 2.55 percent over the 52 weeks ended Feb. 11,
according to Lipper _ the average loss for its peers was 7.89
percent. It's a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Brandes Institutional International Equity is your only fund
that was in the black for the 52-week period, returning 8.20
percent. Another keeper.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? You're perhaps right that ten months isn't a
sufficiently long period to let the investment adviser show his or
her stuff. And as I said before, I agree with the idea of
diversifying beyond the large-caps. But I also think Oakmark is a
sufficiently contrarian fund that it's not a good choice for a core
position. Thus you might consider moving the lion's share of that
position back to Columbia Growth, or to a fund tracking the
Standard and Poor's 500. That last suggestion probably would make
your adviser scowl _ after all, who wants to pay somebody a 1
percent fee to suggest an index fund?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son is 32 and has his IRA with T. Rowe Price, entirely
invested in its Equity Income. The current balance is approximately
$9,000. Because of his age, both he and I felt the IRA should be
invested in equities. Do you agree? We also wondered whether it
would be better to have his IRA invested in Price's Equity Index,
which gained 27.9 percent in 1998, compared to 8.4 percent for
Equity Income.
</P>
<P>
   J.Z., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think you're both right that this IRA should be
invested entirely in stocks at this point. And I also agree that
Price's Equity Index would be better than Equity Income over the
long haul. That's not to say that Price's Equity Income isn't a
good offering, but its objective requires that its portfolio be
concentrated in issues with strong yields _ and this steers it to
the value-oriented old workhorses which indeed deliver solid
dividends, but also offer little in the way of growth prospects. If
you go with the index fund, you'll get these same stocks, but
they'll also be mixed with the growth stocks, thus providing a good
deal of spark to the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that you should make the switch. But you should also be
prepared for the inevitable second-guessing that you will do when
the markets turn sour.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My problems and questions concern holdings in Mutual
Financial Services Z, Mutual European Z, and Mutual Shares Z funds,
all of which have performed very poorly over the past year. I have
had money in the Mutual fund family for a long time, going back to
the time when Mr. Price directed them, and I was satisfied with the
results up to the time they were absorbed by the Templeton fund
family. What is the reason for the lackluster performance of these
funds? Would you advise an exit? I am 68, retired, and living on a
pension and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   E.B., Easton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I can't argue with your discontent. In 1998 all three
of these funds trailed their peer averages, and two of them _
Mutual Shares Z and Mutual European Z _ were way behind, with the
.45 percent total return of Mutual Shares comparing to a 12.34
percent average return for large-cap value funds, and the 4.74
percent return of Mutual European comparing to an 18.97 percent
peer average, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Price, who was viewed as the key manager behind the
splendid long-term record of the Mutual fund group, is now gone. I
can't see any particularly good reason not to follow.
</P>
<P>
   If I were you I'd transfer to another fund family. I'll suggest
a few Vanguard funds, although you could build a similar portfolio
with a number of other families. I would treat Vanguard Index Value
as the equivalent of Mutual Shares, Vanguard European Stock Index
as a swap for Mutual European, and I would quit the financial
services arena entirely. You might decide that at your age you
don't want any sector fund, given the higher risks that go with
investing in single market sectors. If that's the case, you might
want to consider Vanguard Wellesley Income fund, which would
provide you with a tidy income stream. But if you are comfortable
with sector risk, I'd go with Vanguard Specialized Heath Care.

GOING LUCK HUNTING

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ Mike Paolucci first put out of the harbor
here on a lobster boat at 12 years old. Twenty years later, he's
still going out, and as the fishing vessel Christina-Eleni bobs on
the waves, he talks about the dangers of heading to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger used to be out there,'' he says, his hand sweeping
the salty horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not on the Christina-Eleni. He's standing on the Vegas
Express, the state's first gambling cruise boat. ``These days,'' he
says, ``the danger's in here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got $140 in his pocket _ and a stash left ashore _ and
that's the way the 32-year-old disc jockey and Renaissance singer
limits the danger aboard what is virtually a floating casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Vegas Express, which leaves the harbor for afternoon and
evening cruises Wednesday through Saturday and on Sunday
afternoons, heads quickly out beyond the three-mile limit of
Massachusetts waters and beyond the reach of state gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   As it crosses the line into federal waters, 175 electronic slot
machines come to life with what sounds like a communal gulp. The
craps tables and poker and blackjack tables and the roulette wheel
are bathed in bright light. Gamblers, full of expectation, flock to
the tables and machines, ignoring the bob of the vessel in 5-foot
swells.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, with House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran apparently
in the forefront, is considering whether to continue to lose
gambling revenue to video gambling in Rhode Island and casinos in
Connecticut. New Hampshire may yet consider allowing video gambling
at its racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Vegas Express or inside the video casino at the
Lincoln Park dog track in Lincoln, R.I., there is a glimpse of the
future of gambling here. If gambling is indeed on the menu in
Massachusetts, these places are today's surf and turf offering.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $39 for a cruise of about five hours on the 204-foot
Vegas Express. For that, as many as 400 passengers get a hot meal
in the dining room and about four hours of gambling time _ or time
to walk exterior decks and take in the sea. Many customers view the
trip as a sightseeing cruise, as well as a gambling junket.
</P>
<P>
   The video games are set up in rows on all three levels. The
second level, which has no windows, most resembles a Las Vegas
casino. Video games line the outer walls, while craps, roulette,
and poker and blackjack tables fill the center of the deck. The
video games take bills as high as $100, and the gambling tables
have $200 limits.
</P>
<P>
   The cheaper, 25-cent video games are on the third deck, where
windows give a sweeping view of the sea. The machine's names are
full of promise: Diamond Roses, Red Hot 7, Blazing 7s, Fame and
Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes after the cruise begins, Mike Paolucci is up on
the third deck, looking for a comeback. He's already down $100 from
the craps table.
</P>
<P>
   Paolucci, a big man with hands to match, works two machines at
once, his fingers hitting the buttons, and he more than makes up
for his earlier losses. The speed with which the games are played _
and money lost and won _ is remarkable. Wheels whir in slot games;
in electronic card games, hands are dealt almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is almost all white. There are young couples, older
women, young singles. When somebody wins _ the loud tink, tink,
tink of coins being disgorged announces a win all through the
second deck _ others gather to watch and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Delphia, 31, of Charlton wins on a slot machine but does
not know why: She doesn't understand the mix of bars and fruit and
7s that adds up to money. ``No, no, I didn't know I'd won at all.
Everybody else told me I did, and then the money started pouring
out.''
</P>
<P>
   She came aboard with $200 she had saved for the trip. Her plan
is to put all she wins into her pocketbook to take home with her
and gamble only the $200 base. By the time her machine quits
spitting coins, she's got $400 to tuck away. She'll hit another
machine for $100 later.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barry is 21 and a business major from Salisbury. He's here
on an outing with his father, Neil, a Seabrook, N.H., businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both had the day off, and he took me here,'' Brian says.
``It's a nice way to spend the day together, gamble a little, enjoy
the cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, they sit on the exposed upper deck, protected from
Febrary weather by clear plastic sheets draped on poles. As the
song, ``Come Break My Heart,'' blares from loudspeakers and the sun
begins to set, Neil says, ``Hey, this is great. You pay $40 for a
whale watch, and you don't even get a meal.''
</P>
<P>
   When the cruises began last July, there was some concern about
easy access to gambling and about paychecks being lost. Lenny Ross,
a Gloucester native and a heavy-equipment mechanic, saw it happen
among friends.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing a beer at Old Timers' bar on the waterfront, Ross, who
does not gamble, said, ``When it first started, you had locals
going out on the boat, but they learned pretty fast you can lose a
paycheck out there, so they've backed off now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cheryl Delphia, the lucky novice gambler, says she has seen
much the same thing ashore and in a far more pervasive way, at
lottery outlets where people gamble as an afterthought while doing
something as simple as picking up a quart of milk at the corner
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the lottery, and you can just go down to the store
and scratch your pay away on those things,'' she says. Coming to a
gambling vessel or deciding to go to a track to wager at video
machines is a conscious, planned decision, she says.
</P>
<P>
   That's evident in the parking lot at Rowe Square, from which the
Vegas Express embarks. It is filled with the cars of travelers who
have made a conscious effort to get here to gamble, not only from
Massachusetts, but also Maine and New Hampshire. The scene is
repeated at the dog track in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   There on a Tuesday night, the oval itself was cold and unlit.
But the lot held a hefty supply of cars, and an orange neon glow
beckoned through glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   While the Vegas Express has a cruise ship feel, with songs,
trivia games and other nongambling entertainment, the two large
video gaming rooms at Lincoln have a distinct Vegas air. There are
about 1,200 machines here, the state's answer to 1992, when
Foxwoods opened in nearby Connecticut and hurt the dog track's
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Markarian, an East Providence jeweler, scoffs at the
notion that places like this take money from the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You segregate gambling; it helps to eliminate the casual
gambler,'' he says. ``Widespread gambling is too much temptation.
Here, you have to come with a goal and a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Mike Paolucci did. He boarded with his
$140, lost most of it fast, but then made it back up at the video
games.
</P>
<P>
   After the Vegas Express docks, the big man ambles up the gangway
and crosses the parking lot to ease himself into the seat of his
black Cadillac for the drive home to Beverly. He's been on a sunny
winter cruise, he's had a meal, and he's $40 richer than when he
left.

GARBAGE CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF THE GRAMMY HEAP 
</HEADLINE>

   Garbage at the Grammys. That's right. The pride of alt-rock
nation is not just going to the Grammys next Wednesday, but is
among the elite five acts whose recordings have been nominated for
album of the year, joining Lauryn Hill, Sheryl Crow, Madonna, and
Shania Twain in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be up there with all those women artists is unbelievable,''
says Garbage drummer Butch Vig. ``And it's really five women if you
include our singer, Shirley (Manson). I think it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also cool is that Vig doesn't even think Garbage should
win. ``I hope Lauryn Hill wins. I think her record is the most
challenging,'' says Vig, whose group performs at the FleetCenter
Monday (opening up for Alanis Morissette) before flying to Los
Angeles for the Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage is also up for best rock album for ``Version 2.0,'' its
provocative, rock-techno pastiche CD that uses drum loops and
samplers, but also raw, retro-rock guitars and a few
well-publicized lyrics and riffs from the likes of Chrissie Hynde,
Brian Wilson, and Romeo Void.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this band has a history (it consists of a 20-something
Scottish singer and three older males from the Midwest) and it
doesn't take its Grammy nominations for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're younger, you feel you can go on forever,'' says
Vig. ``But we're now well aware that pop bands can be very
fleeting.''
</P>
<P>
   So, win or lose, Vig intends to have fun in LA. ``I'm staying in
a room next to Snoop Dogg!'' he says with a laugh. ``The way I look
at it is that the ceremony should be fun, but the whole schmooze
thing will be fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's right back on the road for Vig, who is also
widely known as the producer of Nirvana's breakthrough album,
``Nevermind.'' (Of which he says: ``That was a difficult record to
make, because I had to push Kurt Cobain a lot to go beyond what he
thought he was capable of.'')
</P>
<P>
   Garbage, which has reeled off such hits as ``Stupid Girl,''
``Queer,'' ``Only Happy When It Rains,'' ``Push It,'' and the
latest, ``Special,'' is looking forward to touring with Morissette,
though it will be hard to be an opening act again after just
completing its own headline run in Europe. Over there, Garbage
played to 12,000 people at London's Wembley Arena and in Dublin,
there was the added thrill that ``we partied with U2 until the sun
came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to jokingly say that we wanted to be an international
pop band,'' adds Vig. ``It's very gratifying to see that coming
true.''
</P>

   SFX goes Vegas: Concert giant SFX never rests. The latest move
is signing a three-year deal with the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority to mark Las Vegas as ``the official resort
destination'' of SFX, according to a Pollstar report. The
partnership means that Las Vegas will have a ``highly visible
on-site promotional presence at SFX-produced shows in 10 major US
markets this year.'' No word on whether Great Woods, now an SFX
venue, will be one of them, but don't bet against it.

<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Calif. _ As painful proof that he values freedom in
all its forms, Lap Nguyen offered the bullet hole just inches from
his heart, the dent behind one ear, the jagged pink scars on both
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' he said in English that was strong but still broken
after five years in the United States, ``I fight for what I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nguyen, along with hundreds of other Vietnamese refugees who
have settled in Orange County, has taken the fight against
communism to an unlikely setting: a nondescript shopping center
along one of Westminster's main boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day for more than a month, they have marched,
shouted anti-communist slogans and waved banners outside a store
whose owner insists on displaying a poster of communist leader Ho
Chi Minh and a communist Vietnamese flag in a part of town known as
Little Saigon. Fights have broken out. When 150 police officers in
helmets and body shields tried to disperse a crowd of 500 on
Monday, demonstrators laid down in their path.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters say they are exercising the freedom of speech
guaranteed in their adopted homeland. The store owner, Truong Van
Tran, says he is doing the same. With both sides unwilling to
budge, the standoff has highlighted the difficulties that can arise
when old wounds come up against new freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not the police, not the protesters, not even Tran's
lawyers _ can quite explain why Tran dared the Vietnamese community
to make him take down the flag and photo, which he had displayed
quietly for some time. Little is known about his personal story or
beliefs. All anyone knows for certain is that the 37-year-old Tran
returned to Vietnam last year for the first time in two decades and
that he came away convinced that the current government is a
legitimate one that deserves normalized relations with the United
States. He does not call himself a communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to provoke our community, the same as if he hang
Hitler's picture in Jewish community,'' said Nguyen, 48, who fought
against Ho Chi Minh's army and later spent 10 years in jail. ``The
law is not everything. There is a moral obligation to his
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County Superior Court judge, however, ruled that Tran
has a constitutional right to display the communist symbols at his
HiTek TV and VCR store. The American Civil Liberties Union, which
is representing Tran, said police must now enforce his right to do
so. Tran, who was hospitalized briefly after he was hit in the head
outside his store in mid-January and again last week when he fell
to the ground after a melee erupted, has vowed on Vietnamese radio
to rehang his display.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are your rights as guaranteed by the court and then your
rights as exist practically,'' said Peter Eliasberg, one of the
ACLU attorneys handling Tran's case. ``Right now he's being denied
his rights practically. . . . All I can say is if he's willing to
put his principles before the profit motive, more power to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran's business has been closed for a month now, and Vietnamese
community leaders say they cannot imagine anyone shopping there
ever again. The landlord wants him out and has issued an eviction
notice, claiming that Tran owes thousands of dollars in back rent
and other fees. The landlord also says that Tran has hurt other
mall tenants by creating a public nuisance. Tran has said he
intends to fight the eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very appropriate time to evict a guy who's in arrears
on rent and then invites all these people down for a
confrontation,'' said attorney Jonathan Slipp, who represents
landlord Danh Quach. ``At that time, you start saying, `Maybe this
guy isn't the best tenant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks a one-note song is coming out of the Vietnamese
community in Orange County,'' Eliasberg explained. ``He thinks it's
important to have a dialogue and that issues should be discussed.
He's a stubborn guy and he thinks he has a right to speak and, as
an American, he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese-Americans in Orange County, where a third or more of
the 300,000 Vietnamese refugees in southern California live, say
they are horrified by how Tran has gone about making his point. In
one letter addressed to Vietnamese community leaders, and
translated into English by them, he boasted of the portrait of ``my
beloved Uncle Ho Chi Minh.'' In another, he added, ``If you all
think you are great, then go ahead, come over to clear me out.'' It
was signed, ``Good bye all of you in a state of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a core group of a dozen or more protesters has been
spending the night outside HiTek. Days, hundreds of Vietnamese
immigrants show up regularly, some to gawk, most to express the
anger and hurt that the symbols still evoke in them. Vietnam and
Korean war veterans have turned out to show their support for the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing this in this community, it's just uncalled for,'' said
Alfred Garcia, 65, who wore his dog tags from the Korean War over
his shirt. ``Sure he has his First Amendment rights, but these
people were hurt really deeply by the war. What he's doing is like
shouting fire in a theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Bui Binh Ban, president of the Federation of Overseas Free
Vietnamese Communities in nearby Garden Grove, said, ``We lost
everything to survive. . . . We cannot accept to see the communist
flag fly here. He can do anything he wants, but he cannot provoke
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Orange County Human Relations Commission has been
unable to negotiate an armistice between the demonstrators and
Tran. Rusty Kennedy, the commission's executive director, doesn't
think there can or will be one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even on our list of expectations,'' Kennedy said.
``The spokespersons for the protesters will not negotiate with him.
Period. And he wants publicity for his cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The intransigence on both sides has put Westminster police in
the position of having to guarantee everyone's safety and their
right to air differing opinions. At one point, when Tran refused to
cooperate with their plans to safeguard him, police threatened to
arrest him if he returned to the video store. Police also declared
an unlawful assembly, and temporarily ordered the protesters to
leave. Both orders have since been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems intent on trying to inflame the community; at one
point he was talking about having a helicopter drop fliers with a
picture of the Hanoi flag,'' said Lieutenant Bill Lewis, spokesman
for the Westminster Police Department. ``What was that about? . . .
So we're ready for the long haul. Ending this would take I don't
know how many police officers and putting them in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thang Tran, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern
California and no relation to the store owner, said his group has
repeatedly urged peace among the protesters. Violence is what they
left behind in Vietnam, he said. It would do no good to bring it to
their streets now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right to free speech and we know that,'' said Ky
Ngo, one of the protest organizers. ``We have the right, too, to
raise our voice and show we're against him. You can do that in
America and we're in America now.''

OLYMPIC SPONSORS REEVALUATING THEIR ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What for 15 years has been indisputably a golden calf among
sports marketing opportunities for major corporations like
Coca-Cola, Xerox and Samsung, now is suddenly open to question.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of horrific publicity about corruption in the
International Olympic Committee and the Winter Games scheduled for
Salt Lake City in 2002, companies are begining to reevaluate
whether the Olympics continue to be the ultimate advertising
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   While there remains a stubborn reluctance on the part of
executives of the companies to publicly challenge the IOC _ leaving
David D'Alessandro, the president and chief operating officer of
Boston's John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. as the most
prominent public critic _ observers say that a meeting in New York
City last week among the major sponsors and the IOC was a
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the sponsors strongly challenged IOC officals at the
meeting to move more aggressively to clean up the scandal.
Moreover, the companies are starting to field queries from their
boards of directors and stockholders about how they are handling
the Olympic mess.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if this was a normal Olympic cycle, the only talk
about the games at Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta Thursday
would have been about strategies to maximize the company's $50
million sponsorship of the bi-annual events.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board of directors of Coke, a sponsor of the
Olympics for 70 years, was slated to discuss far more rudimentary
issues: the relative value of the sponsorship, and whether the
company's brand could be tarnished by associating with the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, as a sponsor we're concerned when events of this
seriousness _ and they are quite serious _ impact any activity of
the company, whether they be sponsorships or what have you,'' said
board member Susan B. King, a former senior vice-president of the
company, who is a trustee of Duke University. ``I think everybody
would like to see this weathered.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coke has not gone public with strong criticism of the IOC,
sports marketing sources say that the company and Visa
International have been outspoken in private dealings with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several sponsors who share D'Alessandro's concerns,
but for whatever reasons they don't want to be as public about
it,'' said Bob Heussner, the senior vice-president for strategic
planning at Advantage International, the worldwide sports and
marketing agency, based in McLean, Va. ``There was a lot of concern
expressed at that meeting, and a lot of questions asked for which
the IOC had no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think how all of this sorts out depends on what happens in
the next 60 to 90 days,'' Heussner said. ``If, by then, all of the
skeletons are out of the closet and dealt with effectively, I would
predict that most of the sponsors stay involved, and at the current
level. If the IOC doesn't do that, it's a roll of the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four members of IOC have been linked to ethical
misconduct involving Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter
Games. The IOC has said it will expel at least eight of those
members. Meanwhile, the IOC, the Attorney General of Utah, the
United States Justice Department, and the US Olympic Committee are
all conducting investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, according to industry observers and some
company officials, the sponsors are expected to use the negative
publicity as leverage to try and drive down sponsorship fees, and
to loosen the IOC's control of the use of the Olympic rings as a
marketing symbol. The IOC's rigid approach to how the symbol of the
Olympics may be used in marketing is a source of continued
frustration for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms are starting to be more proactive, albeit behind the
scenes. Sources, including industry observers, say that Visa is
telling the IOC that it wants the leader of the Olympic movement,
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, to step down, if Visa is to
continue to support the Olympics at its current level of about $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never make any of our private communications with the
IOC or anyone else public,'' said Michael Sherman, director of
international corporate communications for Visa. ``Visa has had
discussions on the role of the IOC leadership in the future, as
have other sponsors. But Visa has sent no letter discussing Mr.
Samaranch's position.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 major Olympic sponsors would appear to have considerable
leverage. With the exception of Coca-Cola and TIME/Sports
Illustrated, all must renew their sponsorships with the IOC later
this year. The scandal is forcing the companies to consider whether
their cherished international showcases are yielding diminishing
returns.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, industry sources say, is nearly $1 billion that the
IOC derives from sponsorships and, indirectly, from television
advertisers that the IOC uses to finance both the games and the
development of sports around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   What the companies are hoping for, and advocating strongly
behind closed doors, is swift and certain action by the IOC at its
March meetings in Switzerland to make clear that the way it has
conducted business since the Olympics became big money in 1984 is
no longer viable. At the meeting in New York last week, they
demanded, and received, assurances that there will be a conference
telephone call with IOC officials in early March, before the
crucial meetings, to make sure that certain reform is on track.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is specifically seeking: an admission from the IOC
that it is incapable of investigating itself; a new IOC membership
appointed by every member nation of the United Nations, as opposed
to the current membership appointed by Samaranch himself; a new
site-selection process that eliminates the IOC members' role of
visiting cities and then voting; full-disclosure of all gifts
received by members; and an immediate start of a search for a
successor to Samaranch, who is scheduled to retire in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the companies are about the difficult business of
weighing what impact the scandal is having on their brands. That is
difficult to assess, and the efforts so far have produced mixed
results.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner &AMP; Associates, a public research firm in Baltimore,
conducted a survey in early February that showed 70 percent of
American adults either had not heard about the scandal, or felt no
differently about the sponsors after having heard about it. Only 18
percent of those surveyed felt negatively about the companies. But
according to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll conducted on February 9,
51 percent of 711 adults examined said their respect for the games
has declined, with 23 percent saying they are less likely to watch
the 2002 games on television.
</P>
<P>
   Amid that confusing context, one of the sponsors making a
decision about involvement beyond 2000 is UPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are about the business of measuring constituent
impact,'' said Susan Rosenberg, an Olympic marketing official with
the company. ``We're using our customers and our employees and
surveying them to measure their reaction to what's been happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most of the sponsors, I would think, we're in a
wait-and-see mode, seeing what actions the IOC is going to take and
what the impact is,'' Rosenberg said. ``We feel we've had such
success with the Olympics, so far, why would we make a snap
decision now, when the process involving the allegations is still
ongoing?''
</P>
<P>
   The same wait-and-see approach, with caveats, prevails at Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expressed our concerns at the New York meeting,'' Sherman
said, ``and we expect decisive action across the board on a number
of issues both with the IOC and other areas. There is a lot of
communication involved with this at Visa International, and we are
very much on top of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, many officials involved with the Olympics say that
the athletes and the long tradition of spectator interest in the
games themselves are likely to win out. But the sponsors will push
publicly or privately for reform and use their leverage to try and
rein in the escalation of fees _ which have jumped to the current
average of $40 million per sponsor from as little as $150,000 to
$250,000 for the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the continued popularity of the games themselves
is the bright portrait painted by Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC
Sports, which owns the US broadcast rights to the Olympics through
2008, at an estimated cost of $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at the IOC can take any confidence that what they have
done to date is enough,'' Ebersol said. ``They must continue to
move to deal with new members under suspicion, to have new voting
procedures and to show, when it comes time to select the site of
the 2006 games, that this is a whole new way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, the fact of the matter is, we have not heard a single
word from any of our advertisers signed up for the (2000) Sydney
games in terms of them being concerned about what they have bought.
And we are half sold, already.''

LEONARD`S `COOL' COLLABORATION WITH THE COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fact and fiction have rarely merged in quite such a strange and
supple way as when crime novelist Elmore Leonard and Greenfield,
Mass., rock band The Stone Coyotes discovered each other in a small
Los Angeles nightclub. It was 1997, and Leonard was searching for a
muse. He was plotting the sequel to his 1990 book (and subsequent
film) ``Get Shorty,'' about loan shark-turned-Hollywood-producer
Chili Palmer. Leonard had decided that in the new novel Palmer
would be the manager of a band, one with a female lead singer, but
beyond that, the 73-year-old writer hadn't a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to Sinatra, and jazz. I had a lot to learn
about rock 'n' roll. I listened to Alanis Morissette and Fiona
Apple. I liked Gwen Stefani from that band No Doubt. I heard a lot
of female singers. You know there's a big pile of them out there
now,'' Leonard says on the phone from his home in suburban Detroit.
Although he confesses he had no idea what he was looking for, none
of the well-known women in rock struck Leonard as the model he was
hoping to find. Then one late-summer night, on the advice of an
industry acquainance, Leonard went to the famed Troubadour on the
Sunset Strip to hear The Stone Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right away I thought, `yeah, that's the music I want.' There
was a story to the songs, and it had sort of a country thing to
it,'' says Leonard. ``I liked the fact that the drummer uses
marching sticks and a weird little set, and that his son plays bass
on a barstool. Someone said the band is like AC/DC meets Patsy
Cline. And I thought Chili could understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Author and rock band began their unusual collaboration that
night, and over the next several months Leonard concocted the
fictional Texas band Odessa based on The Stone Coyotes' look, their
struggles in the business, and the band's stripped-down, rock 'n'
twang sound. He commissioned songs from the band to use in the
book, songs that also appear on The Stone Coyotes' new CD ``Church
of the Falling Rain.'' In a truly novel configuration of frontman
and backup band, Leonard and The Stone Coyotes are now on tour
together; he reads, they play. So far they've hit hot spots like
LA's Viper Room and the Mercury Lounge in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration marks something of a career boost for The
Stone Coyotes, an all-in-the-family rock band composed of
singer/songwriter/guitarist Barbara Keith, her husband Doug Tibbles
on drums, and Doug's son from a previous marriage, bassist John
Tibbles. They've spent the past 10 years writing, practicing, and
making home recordings in the basement of their house in
Greenfield, near where Keith grew up. But the small-town garage
band image is deceptive. Before they escaped Los Angeles for the
quiet comforts of Western Massachussetts, Doug Tibbles was a
successful writer of TV scripts, and Keith, who came up in the
Greenwhich Village folk scene, wrote songs recorded by Barbra
Streisand, Olivia Newton-John, and Tanya Tucker. She had also
signed a three-record deal with Warner Bros., but walked away from
it _ returning the advance money _ after concluding that she was
moving in the wrong musical direction. She went underground, and
resurfaced a few years later with a screaming electric guitar.
Leonard was so taken by Keith's declaration of independence he
included it in ``Be Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was looking for a certain power. He definitely
liked the idea of staying true to your school, and musically
sticking to your guns,'' Keith says on the phone from Greenfield.
In a business where artists are more often compensated for selling
out rather than pursuing a vision, The Stone Coyotes are an
exception to the rule _ and at an unlikely time of life: Doug and
Barbara are both in their 50s. ``If we had really thought about it,
we never would have predicted this,'' says Keith. ``We didn't have
a master plan or a career strategy. We thought if we just kept
improving, getting the groove down . . . It's so much fun to play a
song, and play it well, that's almost satisfaction enough. But you
want security, too. We just weren't sure if it would come from the
music business.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly catapulted into the spotlight via the back door, other
doors are opening as fast as you can say major-label interest. ``I
don't know exactly what it means yet,'' Keith says. ``It's not like
some A&AMP;R guy was sitting in the audience and liked us. We don't
sound exactly like something else. And we're not easily swept into
any new trend. But there is a stir. I think this is a really unique
chance to get up and show what we can do,'' Barbara says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now ``The Church of the Falling Rain'' is only available
at the band's website, www.thestonecoytes.com, which Leonard_ a
loyal fan, to say the least_ included in ``Be Cool.'' Since the
book was released on the 9th, the site's gotten at least 50 hits a
day. They're still ``keeping the wolves from the door in a
patchwork way,'' says Barbara, referring to a small antiques
business and occasional royalty checks. But while the Tibbles-Keith
family anticipates spending more time on the left coast in the
coming months, a move back to LA is not in their game plan. ``This
will always be home,'' Keith states unequivocally. ``I remind Doug
and John when they're chipping ice off the windows that Emily
Dickinson found her creativity in this.''
</P>
<P>
   And as to feeling like the whole experience is a bit like a
scene from a novel? ``Well, there is a surreal quality to it, in
the sense of something so unique happening.'' says Keith. ``But
then again, we know perfectly well what we are.''

A WORLD OF GRIEVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what they say: It's OK to eat sausages, but you don't
ever want to see how they are made.
</P>
<P>
   The same might apply to Microsoft's ballyhooed CD-ROM
encyclopedia, Encarta Africana. Now being aggressively promoted by
Harvard professors Henry Louis (``Skip'') Gates Jr. and Kwame
Anthony Appiah as the culmination of W. E. B. Du Bois's lifetime
dream, the colorful encyclopedia boasts over 400 contributors,
including United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, Quincy
Jones, and Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of Encarta's 2.5 million words were
written by a group of about 15 writers hunkered down in the Vanserg
Building on the fringe of the Harvard campus _ and a fractious
group at that. During the year and a half of intense work that went
into creating Africana, the project suffered an embarrassing
plagiarism incident, and a near-revolt on the part of the
piece-work writers who complained about low salaries, the lack of
benefits, and the paucity of African-Americans working on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The plagiarism occurred when Gates and Appiah's newly formed
corporation, Afropaedia LLC, submitted a batch of text to Microsoft
in 1997. Student temporary employees turned out to have copied, or
flimsily rewritten, many articles from the Encyclopedia of
African-American Culture &AMP; History, co-edited by Gates's Harvard
colleague, Cornel West. Depending on who's telling the story,
either Microsoft editors or Gates and Appiah spotted the copying
and called a halt to it. When the full-time staff was hired, the
Afropaedia managers laid down strict guidelines about sourcing new
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Once work ramped up in the summer of 1997, the writers learned
that working on Africana would be no bowl of cherries. Deadline
pressure was intense, and some staffers sardonically observed that
they were working ``for the wrong Gates,'' meaning that their
working conditions more closely resembled those of benefit-deprived
``temps'' at Bill Gates's Microsoft than those of the Harvard
staffers surrounding Professor Gates at his W. E. B. Du Bois
Institute. Pay was writerly, i.e. low. Furthermore, each man or
woman had to meet a daily writing quota, and there were no formal
provisions for paid vacation, medical benefits, or sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions came to a head in October of 1997, when 12 of the
writers signed a letter to Gates and Appiah, asking to discuss
their grievances. Gates said the Encarta budget didn't allow for
benefits or higher salary, but he did make some concessions.
Thereafter, the writers received some paid vacation, productivity
bonuses, and an extra month's pay if they stayed until the
project's end.
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, Africana staffer Stephen Bicknell asked the
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers if the 14 Africana
writers could unionize. Bicknell recalls: ``(Organizer) Kris
Rondeau told me: `Let me get this straight. You want me to help you
unionize, you'll be leaving here in 10 months, and you want to go
up against Skip Gates?' '' Says Rondeau: ``I agreed that it was a
highly imperfect labor situation,'' but nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gates says he has been roundly attacked by Afrocentrist
historians for not employing enough African-American staffers on
Encarta Africana, and is chary about discussing the working
conditions of his mostly white labor force. ``I've never had a
project that generated as much friction,'' he says of Africana.
``It was a learning experience for me.''
</P>

<P>
   One of the more outre book proposals yet seen on our fair shores
landed at 11 US literary agencies this week. The would-be writer:
Monika Lewinsky, a Viennese pharmacology student with a tentative
grasp of the English language, but a rock-solid sense of American
book-publishing priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a synopsis of the proposed 50-page humor book:
</P>
<P>
   ``A. Monika's reaction to the breaking news in the media and how
her life changed due to the notoriety of her name.
</P>
<P>
   B. Family name's history. Coat of arms of the Lewinskys.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on. Reached at home, Lewinsky proved to be as press-shy
as her American namesake. During the height of the scandal, she
complained, ``Everyone wanted to interview me. It was getting on my
nerves.'' Then she hung up.

`STONES' AN EERIE, ENGROSSING NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE STONES CRY OUT 
By Hikaru Okuizumi; translated, from the Japanese, by James N.
Westerhoven 
Harcourt Brace, 138 pp, $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine the history of the universe encased in a single stone.
The clash of tectonic plates and the burble of red-hot magma, the
emergence of vertebrates from the ooze, all calcified, stratified,
and frozen forever as granite or schist. It's an image that appeals
to anyone with a yearning for order, because one needs only to pick
up a geologist's hammer and chisel to make sense of mystery, to
illumine the dark cave where candlelight and reason get snuffed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuyoshi Manase, the protagonist of this eerie and engrossing
novel, must emerge from just such a cave. It's literal and
figurative, that cave, and it dominates his dreams and his wakeful
malarial ravings. Ultimately, it undoes him. ``The Stones Cry
Out,'' by Japanese writer Hikaru Okuizumi, is the story of an
amateur geologist and bookseller slowly collapsing under the burden
of his own history. The book, which received the Akutagawa Prize
recognizing new Japanese writers, was published in 1993. This
English translation, by James N. Westerhoven, is as polished as any
pebble in Manase's sample case.
</P>
<P>
   Manase learns his first, and most enduring, geology lesson from
a dying soldier in a cave on the Philippine island of Leyte, where
a remnant of the Japanese army has taken refuge at the end of World
War II. The soldier, a corporal, is skeletal, his eyes swarming
with maggots, but his voice is low and steady. ``What I'm trying to
say is, the tiny pebble that you might happen to pick up during a
walk is a cross-section of a drama that began some five billion
years ago, in a place that would later come to be called the solar
system _ a cloud of gas drifting idly through space, growing denser
and denser until after countless eons it finally gave birth to this
planet. That little pebble is a condensed history of the universe
that keeps the eternal cycle of matter locked in its ephemeral
form.''
</P>
<P>
   As circumstances within the cave grow more desperate, the
captain, convinced that the Japanese army will make one final
stand, organizes the starving, wounded men who have crawled in from
the jungle. The search for food becomes primary, and soldiers who
are strong raid abandoned villages and hack through the tangle of
vines to bring back snakes, lizards, a gaunt chicken. The captain
eats first, and leftovers are divided among those who have a few
days of life left. In order to amass the strongest fighting force,
the captain issues an order: Men who can no longer get up must end
their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, not one of the sick soldiers had enough physical or
moral strength left to do it,'' Okuizumi writes. ``The captain
issued orders to kill them. You were going to die soon yourself _
so you grabbed your bayonet and prepared to end their suffering wih
one well-aimed thrust. At the last moment your courage melted away.
You began to tremble. Boiling with rage, the captain struggled to
his feet and limped toward the invalids, trailing his wounded leg,
naked sword in hand, and one by one slit their throats.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the captain's sword, flashing red with blood and
firelight, stays with Manase as he reconstructs his peacetime life.
So does the dying lance corporal's geology lecture. Manase marries,
opens a bookstore, and fathers two sons. But he retreats for hours,
then days, to his storehouse of stones _ polishing, cutting,
categorizing, viewing samples under the white light of a polarizing
microscope. Although the events of the cave have marked him, he
hopes to achieve mastery through careful study, as if he is taking
cross-sections of his life and mounting them on slides. It seems
inevitable that he will draw his sons into his passion _ and in
doing so, destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   His older son, Hiroaki, begins his own rock collection, and
father and son spend an idyllic summer gathering specimens. On an
outing in an old quarry, they discover a cave. The dank walls are
shot through with green chert, a rock that Hiroaki covets. Here,
the plot becomes riveting. The menace of the father's obsession and
the fever dreams of wartime atrocities make the book hard to put
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Manase's study of the hard, glinting edges of rock has not
completely blotted out his past, nor his collusion with the mass
slaughter in Leyte. His own failure to apprehend where the edges of
memory begin and end has tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Okuizumi seems intrigued by the theme of expiation, although it
comes at a cost. Manase must return to the cave for a final test.
This time, the geology lesson is different. At dawn, the jungle
comes alives with the trill of birdsong and chatter of monkeys and
Manase receives a gift: an ordinary gray stone, perhaps from a
riverbed. But bathed in the golden morning light, it looks radiant.

`OFFICE SPACE' IS WORKMANLIKE SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
OFFICE SPACE 
Written and directed by: Mike Judge 
Starring: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, David Herman, Ajay
Naidu, Diedrich Bader, Stephen Root, Gary Cole, Richard Riehle,
John C. McGinley, Paul Willson, Greg Pitts 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: R (language and brief sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' is a cheerful little screenful of payback from
cubicle hell. It's pretty clueless when it leaves the office and
clanks through some tired boy-girl and computer-theft plot
mechanics. But Mike Judge must have worked some godawful jobs
before he became the ``Beavis and Butt-head'' mastermind. His
feature filmmaking debut really digs in and takes some swings at
the soul-corroding corrida known as the corporate world. At its
best, ``Office Space'' is ``Dilbert'' with sharp teeth, at its
funniest in its matter-of-fact assumption of corporate viciousness
as a given.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with a trio of software programmers (Ron
Livingston, David Herman, and Ajay Naidu) sweating their way
through meaningless jobs in a bland building in a nondescript
office park, only occasionally daring to raise their heads above
their partitions like prairie dogs popping out of their holes. The
only thing that keeps them from numbing out entirely is fear of
losing the jobs they hate, an edge the company exploits ruthlessly.
When the guys learn that two consultants have been brought in to
start the downsizing process, they freak. But Livingston's hapless
drudge named Peter is dragged to a therapist, where he catches a
lucky break.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner does the therapist hypnotize him into laid-back
blissfulness than the doc drops dead of a heart attack. Blissed to
the gills, Livingston's nerd prospers. By coming to work whenever
he pleases, exuding easy confidence, and describing the company's
operations with brutal frankness, he's tabbed as upper management
material. But when he sees his buddies about to be canned, he
realizes this isn't enough, and figures out how to scam the company
with what looks like, but of course isn't, a foolproof computer
larceny scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is funny simply because his eyebrows don't line up.
They look like false brows slapped on in a hurry. His pals are more
sympathetic than funny. Most of the laughs come from the guys Judge
is satirizing. Gary Cole is best as their power-tripping piranha of
a boss who makes a point of coming on cool and casual, beginning
every sentence with a slowly drawled, ``Yeahhhhh,'' as if he's
going to agree with his subordinate, then ending it by barking an
order and saying, ``Great!'' Stephen Root is hugely funny, too, as
the company scapegoat, a maladroit loser who's either going to go
nuts or explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' is mostly populated by live cartoons. I'm
thinking of the maniacally gleeful hatchet men played by John
McGinley and Paul Willson. Richard Riehle has his moments, too, as
a character who has spent 30 years worrying about being kicked out
of job purgatory, and Diedrich Bader is a plus as Peter's
down-market neighbor. As a waitress who also despises her job, and
addresses the specter of corporate fascism more directly than any
of the others, Jennifer Aniston is nice to have around, although
Judge is only going through the motions in her romantic sequences.
``Office Space'' is scattershot, but 9-to-5ers will find stuff to
like in its satire of the so-called work environment.

MORISSETTE THE MERRIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alanis Morissette went on a spiritual search in India two
years ago, she planned to visit Mother Teresa in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually called her the night before she died,'' says
Morissette. ``I don't know why. I just had this desire to call her
and connect with her and her sisters for some reason. I called and
they offered to put her on the line, but she wasn't feeling well
and I said, `No, let her rest.' She died the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than regret the lack of contact, Morissette, who is far
better known as the rock singer who sold 28 million copies of her
album ``Jagged Little Pill,'' still went to Calcutta and spent a
day helping the sick and infirm at a healing center run by Mother
Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most intense days of my life. It was very
beautiful. There have been about 15 intense days in my life _ and
that was definitely one of them,'' says Morissette, who went with
her mother, two aunts, and two friends.
</P>
<P>
   Morissette came back from India and wrote and recorded her
follow-up disc, ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,'' which she's
backing with a tour headed to the FleetCenter Monday. The first
single from the record, ``Thank U,'' distilled some of her
spiritual learning: ``Thank you India . . . thank you frailty . . .
thank you consequence . . . how 'bout no longer being masochistic .
. . how 'bout remembering your divinity . . . how 'bout not
equating death with stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   As for not seeing Mother Teresa in the flesh, she says, ``I feel
like I have seen her anyway, so it's all good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a long way from the Morissette of the ``Jagged
Little Pill'' days, back when she primal-screamed parts of her
vocals, snapped at ex-boyfriends, and was labeled the latest Angry
Young Woman. She's still only 24, but seems much more grown up and,
by her own words, much calmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the space that I'm in right now,'' says Morissette, a
native of Ottawa. ``It's the ultimate, because I have the privilege
of being able to share what I express. Some of it is also due to
the fact that I have a lot more experience now, having toured for
`Jagged Little Pill' and gotten a little older with a little more
perspective on what it means to be in the physical crazy realm.
Those kinds of things have resulted in my feeling calmer in
general, and happier. I've been laughing so much more now than I
ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also feeling much more balanced. Before this recent phone
interview from Cleveland, she meditated and did some yoga. She also
has a massage therapist with her on the road. ``It's important to
be able to feel centered in the environments that I'm often in,''
she notes.
</P>
<P>
   And, though she's known as one of the most earnest, most serious
new acts of the '90s, she also unplugs by playing a lot of
basketball. She was practicing her three-point shot just the day
before, she says, adding that ``we have a basketball hoop that
we're getting to bring on the road with us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life is good for Morissette, who learned something else from her
trip to India _ that no matter where you go, you can't expect to
find nirvana outside of yourself, no matter how exotic or spiritual
the country you're visiting may be. That's why she penned another
song on the new record, ``Would Not Come,'' which says: ``I'd go
traveling and still it would not come/ I would starve myself and
still it would not come . . . I'd renunciate and still it would not
come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After chasing (bliss) for as long as I have, or as long as I
did, I realized that it's really inside of myself,'' she says.
``The highest, most blissful moments I have are when I am sitting
still.''
</P>
<P>
   With such thinking, no wonder she's not susceptible to gurus or
cults. In the new song ``Baba,'' she parodies the need for gurus:
``How soon will I be holy/ How much will this cost guru? . . . I've
watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about putting gurus up on a pedestal to the point where
people are no longer listening to their own inner voice,'' says
Morissette. The song is not about a specific guru or cult, but ``I
think it makes it quite clear that cults wouldn't get very far with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   By changing from the simpler, girl/boy subject matter of
``Jagged Little Pill'' to the more complex spiritual issues of the
new album, Morissette knows that she has lost some of her listeners
(especially younger ones). The new album, which has moodier, less
accessible music overall, is not the commercial blockbuster of her
previous CD. Indeed, it slipped to No. 38 last week, though it may
spike back up because several more singles will be released from
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a change,'' she admits. ``A lot of older people are
gravitating toward this record. But I'm really not interested in
who kind of loves it or hates it or is inspired by it or repulsed
by it. I just need to express exactly where I'm at during this
particular moment; and that's all I'm really concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's feeling so free and unconstricted these days that she even
posed nude in a fetal position for a picture on the CD itself, and
made a video for ``Thank U'' that showed her romping nude on the
streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea came from feeling a lack of self-consciousness and a
lack of restriction,'' she says. ``It's a symbol of my wanting to
communicate that _ of feeling really comfortable with my body and
accepting it and treating it really well and feeling beautiful
without hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Between her two albums, Morissette competed in three triathlons
as a way of paying more attention to her body. Such physical
activity also helped hone her balance. ``I always thought that if I
were to develop other parts of myself, I would have to compromise
the cerebral, intellectual part. But I've come to realize that it
never really goes away, and that you can have both.''
</P>
<P>
   With her new confidence, she's exploring other career goals as
well. While she has codirected videos in the past, she stepped up
to be the sole director of her new video for the song ``Unsent,''
which comes out Monday. (It's about love letters never sent to
boyfriends, a theme that appeared on Carly Simon's 1995 album
``Letters Never Sent,'' though Morissette says she hasn't heard
that CD). And she would like to direct a feature-length film.
``I've just been offered a script to potentially direct, and I'd
love to write one as well,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also love to try more acting. She has completed one role
as _ get ready _ God in the film ``Dogma,'' a comedy written and
directed by Kevin Smith, who did ``Chasing Amy'' and ``Clerks.'' It
was ``very funny'' to be cast as a female God, whom she describes
as ``everything _ happy, angry, young, true, wise, crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she's continuing to exhibit a strong social
consciousness. She'll join a Tibetan Freedom Festival date in
Europe this summer (no details yet) and she recently performed at
an Amnesty International benefit in Paris with Bruce Springsteen,
Peter Gabriel, Radiohead, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was also up among my 15 most amazing experiences,'' she
says. ``I felt totally supported. There was such an atmosphere of
love, not an atmosphere of competition or fear or a
lack-of-communication vibe that I've felt at some other festivals.
Any time I can delve into an environment like I felt at the Amnesty
benefit, I'll do it.''

THE MAYOR TAKES THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's add up the damage from Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's week
from hell:
</P>
<P>
   His city has to pay $900,000 to the undercover cop who was
savagely beaten by fellow officers too craven to own up; its
oft-lauded Fire Department is undressed as a poorly-managed bloated
feather bed; Boston loses the MacWorld convention this year and the
Democratic National Convention next; and HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo
lobs a grenade at the Boston Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Did I leave anything out? Only the upside. Menino's six-year
record as a hands-on urban mechanic should help him withstand the
blustery winds of his bad hair week. Taking the convention losses
first: Everything that could reasonably have been done to land
those lucrative conclaves, Menino did. In spades.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was always fated to finish never higher than No. 2 on the
Democratic National Committee's national convention scorecard. But
Menino pounded his city's bid down to the two-yard line. He just
couldn't nudge it across the goal line for the simple reason of
California's 54 electoral votes, 4 1/2 times as many as
Massachusetts's 12. But there's no shame in coming close to a prize
of that scale.
</P>
<P>
   And with the new Boston convention center and hotels sprouting
like fiddlehead ferns after a rainy spring, Boston will get its
share of the lucrative tourist-convention trade. MacWorld needed it
all under one roof, and we are still maybe three years away from
that here.
</P>
<P>
   The other three hits the mayor took are less amenable to
aggressive mayoral action because they involve strands of America's
greatest domestic dilemma: race. Twisted, gnarled threads of racial
conflict weave through three of Menino's challenges: the police
beating, the Fire Department's record on hiring and promoting
minorities, and the BHA's shoddy record of protecting tenants from
racial assault.
</P>
<P>
   The $900,000 settlement for the undercover cop brutalized by
fellow officers too timid to come forward is a blot on the Police
Department's reputation. Police work is inherently confrontational
and controversial. After New York officers fired 41 bullets at an
unarmed man, Mayor Rudy Giuliani's job approval rating cratered
from 60-33 favorable-unfavorable to 44-47 in a matter of a few

<P>
   Mayors of big cities, with big-time problems of
police-versus-suspects, are vulnerable to the shifting winds of
public opinion. It's how they handle the inevitable buffeting that
determines their ultimate level of political support.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Fire Department, whose soft managerial
underbelly was exposed by Globe reporter David Armstrong's recent
series, there is clearly need for the mayor to demand swift
insertion of civilian management skills in a department used to its
own cozy internal arrangements. You can be a brave and skillful
firefighter, but not the person to manage things. Taking all
managers from the firefighting ranks makes no sense in this
complicated world.
</P>
<P>
   They have the slimmest management training and no experience in
the world outside the insular ways of this admittedly successful
department. The featherbedding is ludicrous. Having round-the-clock
drivers to walk the commissioner's dog or drive him to coach his
high school hockey team is indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing all superior officers to remain members of the
politically robust union is just asking for trouble. Political
favors are stored up by creating expensive and inefficient cul de
sacs like the marine unit or the alarm box system. But the mayor's
greatest hurdle is to reestablish control over the out-of-control
abuse of injury pay. Taxpayer dollars are being funneled into this
bottomless pit at an astonishing rate.
</P>
<P>
   Now we come to the BHA. One-10th of Boston's population lives in
public housing projects. For most of the 15,000 families housed at
much-cheaper-than-market rents, this is a great deal; some families
are fourth-generation project people. Secretary Cuomo's 50-page
report documents a grisly record of harassment against minorities
in South Boston's Old Colony and Charlestown's Bunker Hill
projects.
</P>
<P>
   There were ``KKK'' graffiti, cross-burnings, beatings, verbal
threats, barricading of apartments, a whole litany of vicious,
racist conduct. The Boston police dragged feet on furnishing HUD
with responses to federal inquiries. And the BHA was remiss at
several junctures. But things are better now.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes Cuomo documented took place between three and six
years ago. Menino has a beef: The feds are beating on the BHA with
old news. Menino took the lead in fashioning a combined strike
force of Boston police, the municipal cops and the Housing
Authority cops back when he was a city councilor.
</P>
<P>
   Nine tenants have been ejected from Old Colony and Bunker Hill,
after hundreds of hours of police work and court time, using
regulations that allow trouble-makers to be tossed out. ``I think
we have stabilized the problem,'' said one city official.
``Anything can happen, there'll always be incidents, but as far as
systemic problems, particularly in South Boston, I believe that has
ended, though you can have an incident anytime.'' Some minority
tenants were viciously harassed, and the city was slow to get a
handle on the persistent racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Said Deputy Superintendent Phil Vitti, who is in charge of of
project policing, his 40-officer force, which melds three police
agencies with BHA input and five unions: ``I think it's an
effective partnership, and I think it's working. Public housing
today is a different place to live in.''

ADAPTATION, DIRECTION OF IBSEN'S `BUILDER' SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MASTER BUILDER 
Play in three acts by Henrik Ibsen. Adapted by Robert Brustein. 
Directed by Kate Whoriskey. Set, Christine Jones. Lighting, Michael
Chybowski. Costumes, Catherine Zuber. Sound, Christopher Walker.
Produced by American Repertory Theatre. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Much is made in Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master
Builder'' about the artist's fear of ``the younger generation.''
The builder of the title, Halvard Solness, is terrified that
younger architects will pass him by. Ibsen himself may have been
jealous of the younger August Strindberg's growing influence, as
Robert Brustein points out in his program notes. Brustein, the
American Repertory Theatre's artistic director, was obviously
pleased with the symbolism of choosing a recent graduate of the ART
Institute to direct his adaptation of ``Master Builder.''
</P>
<P>
   And directors of the world beware. Kate Whoriskey is a major new
talent, to judge from the stunning psychological-aesthetic
landscape she and set designer Christine Jones have fashioned on
the Loeb stage. It, along with Brustein's adaptation, may not sit
well with traditionalists looking for the more representational
home-and-office setting, but if one is at all open to the ART's way
of doing the classics, ``The Master Builder'' blends beautifully
into the company's overall concept.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly echoes of avant-garde director Robert Wilson
in the look of the piece. As it opens, everyone in Solness's
household and office, except for him, is enclosed in a rectangular
form that's physically and psychologically confining: the secretary
in a big green glassed-in cubicle, counting into a microphone; the
father-and-son associates behind a horizontal control panel; the
wife appearing from time to time at a cutout in the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The language and movements aren't as radically transformed as in
a Wilson piece. Brustein's adaptation is similar to his ``Wild
Duck'' of a couple of years ago, which is less deconstruction than
reconstruction with contemporary idiomatic English _ a ``goddamn''
here, a ``that's a hot one'' there. Solness isn't any more of a
happy camper than the people who work and live with him, only one
of whom, the secretary, he's able to stand. He wonders if the homes
he has become renowned for are anything more than glorified
anthills for the bourgeoisie bugs who inhabit them. Into this
desiccated world enters Hilde Wangel, a saucy and irreverent young
woman who aims to cash in on Solness's pledge to build her a castle
by urging him to go for the gold, personally and professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Brustein's adaptation is solid, particularly in the
characterization. This isn't a ``Fatal Attraction'' seductress and
her victim. It's never clear who's seducing whom or even whether
Solness should resist her imprecations. Of course he overreaches,
but the tragedy lies with the inevitability of that overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   One unfortunate Ibsenism that remains is Wangel's constant
references to him directly as ``Master Builder,'' which carries
echoes of the ``Master Thespian'' skit on ``Saturday Night Live,''
particularly because Christopher McCann delivers his lines with a
formality bordering on pretentiousness. The ART regulars, though,
are very much at home with Brustein's language. Kristen Flanders is
particularly adept in the difficult role of the perky Hilde.
</P>
<P>
   As good as it is, the production doesn't make a case that this
is one of Ibsen's better plays, which may have something to do with
the company's tinkering with time and space. By taking ``The Master
Builder'' out of strict historical time, Solness's wrestling with
God seems too fevered and less impressive than it might have been
in a production that underlined how far ahead of his time Ibsen was
in responding to the silence of God.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting trade-off, though. One walks away from ``The
Master Builder'' with an appreciation of an old master's power to
live beyond the confines of theatrical history. And of a young
artist's dazzling potential to make theatrical history.

FEW REDEEMING QUALITIES IN `JAWBREAKER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
JAWBREAKER 
Written and directed by: Darren Stein 
Starring: Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, Judy Evans
Greer, Carol Kane, Pam Grier 
At: Copley Place, suburbs
<TEXT>
<P>
   Running time: 90 minutes &QL; 
Rated: R (violence, salty language, sexual situations) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was announced this week that Rose McGowan, perhaps best known
for almost wearing a dress to an MTV awards show a few years back,
is engaged to become the future Mrs. Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's frightening, you should see McGowan in
``Jawbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Let us not mince words: ``Jawbreaker'' is a terrible movie, and
McGowan is terrible in it. This is supposed to be McGowan's
breakthrough film, but it's the kind of swill that has derailed far
more established careers. Obstensibly an offbeat comedy in the
style of ``Heathers,'' it's the dull-as-dishwater story of a high
school prank that goes fatally wrong. But really, the most lethal
mistake here is the pathetic, humor-starved script by Darren Stein,
who also directed, and some of the worst acting anyone is likely to
see this year.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for all this is Reagan High School. Three teen
queens _ Courtney (McGowan), Julie (Rebecca Gayheart), and Marcie
(Julie Benz) kidnap their galpal Liz (Charlotte Roldan) as a joke
on her birthday. They tie her up, and to stifle her screams, they
jam a cueball-size jawbreaker _ those nasty dreadful things we used
to eat as kids _ into her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move. The jawbreaker lodges in Liz's throat, and she
suffocates. Instead of reporting the accident to the cops,
Courtney, the relentlessly amoral ringleader, concocts a scheme to
make it look as through Liz was whoring it up with the local trade,
and was raped and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Are you, like poor Liz, gagging yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Heathers,'' the devastatingly dark 1989 comedy that launched
the careers of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, was wicked and
funny, while making some pithy observations about teen suicide. But
Stein isn't interested in doing anything except carting out the
same old dusty jokes about cliques, clueless teachers _ heavens,
what is Carol Kane doing in this movie?! _ and every other cliche
of high school movies.
</P>
<P>
   In her slathered makeup and too-tight clothes, McGowan plays
Courtney as a vixen without a single redeeming quality. It's a
tiring, one-note performance. (Marilyn Manson, sans makeup, has a
brief, don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-it appearance.) And not to be
overlooked is that McGowan simply looks too old to play a high
school senior _ not that Gayheart or Benz are any more convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Grier turns up as a detective named Vera Cruz investigating
Liz's death, and her participation here is proof that ``Jackie
Brown'' didn't provide the same career resurrection John Travolta
has enjoyed since ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best bit in the film is the brief appearance of
William Katt and P. J. Soles as Liz's parents. In 1976, Katt and
Soles costarred in the ultimate high school horror film,
``Carrie.'' Stein certainly knows his movies _ even the name of
Grier's character comes from the title of a 1954 Gary Cooper
western. But it would really be saying something if he learned how
to make one.

HILLARY'S HUMILIATION IS HER BIGGEST FOE IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is impossible to overstate the humiliation Hillary Rodham
Clinton has endured this past year. No one in her position has ever
experienced anything quite like it. There were days when simply
maintaining her composure seemed to require every ounce of her
will. And it never ends. Friday, her husband was credibly accused
of rape in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that when Mrs. Clinton looks
north toward New York, she sees greener pastures. What began as a
daydream has become a serious consideration, holding out the
promise of a new and perhaps better life. And on a number of
levels, it makes sense. New York is the place you go when there's
no place else called home.
</P>
<P>
   She would be a formidable candidate for the United States
Senate. She is intelligent, disciplined, hard-working, and tough.
She's also a bit of a crackpot, but New York is nondiscriminatory
in this regard. It frequently nominates crackpots for high office
and occasionally elects them. It is understood that you have to be
a little crazy to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has other assets. They include 100 percent name
recognition and the ability to raise all the money she could ever
need in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she would have the executive branch of the federal
government at her beck and call. In addition to that, the
Democratic nomination would be hers the day she announced, which
may be the most important asset of all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a thousand times easier to wage a coherent general
election campaign if one's march to the nomination is unimpeded.
Chat-show experts say that this moment is as high as her kite can
fly; that the process, the press and the pressure of the campaign
would gradually diminish her. Not necessarily. The fact is that any
Democrat with no primary opposition and $25 million in the bank
would be a 50-50 bet to win the Moynihan Senate seat. In a two-way
general election race, Hillary Clinton would always be in the hunt,
never out of it. In a three-way race, she would be even more
formidable. New York's demographics have shifted since the 1980s,
as any GOP pollster will attest. It is again a Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   She would, however, face competent and compelling opposition in
the general election. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has done
what many thought was impossible; by sheer doggedness and
determination he has reversed the city's civic fortunes. New York
is livable again. It is clean again. It is safe again. Walking down
the city's streets, one can actually feel Giuliani's
accomplishment, and it is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Democrats win statewide elections in New York by
racking up huge margins in the city, splitting the suburbs, and
holding on for dear life upstate. Giuliani changes that formula; he
would at least break even in the city. As a result, Mrs. Clinton
would have to spend most of her time outside of Manhattan _ on Long
Island, in Westchester, and in the counties bisected by the New
York State Thruway. The campaign would be what professional golfers
call a ``grind.'' And she would be competing with an opponent at
the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   But her real opponent would be her apparently ceaseless
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's story in The Wall Street Journal alleges that in 1978,
her husband raped a woman named Juanita Broaddrick in a Little Rock
hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources at NBC News, where I used to work, four
contemporaneous witnesses and reams of supporting detail support
Mrs. Broaddrick's story. Lawyers for President Clinton have, to
date, refused all comment on these new allegations.
</P>
<P>
   How much more of this can Mrs. Clinton endure? What does she say
when some hostile reporter from the New York Post asks her to
explain her position on tougher sentencing laws for rapists? How
does she explain her complicity in all the cover-ups of her
husband's extramarital activities? How can she champion women's
rights when her husband is widely believed (based on substantial
and credible evidence) to be a sexual predator? Hypocrisy is part
and parcel of politics. But hypocrisy on this scale is untenable.
And unlike normal hypocrisy (``so good to see you!''), this kind of
hypocrisy sears the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton will find solace in New York if she goes there.
After the initial flurry of interest, no one will bother her, just
as no one bothered Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But she won't find
solace there if she runs for the Senate. Her humiliation will
continue unabated. Which is why people who know her believe that,
in the end, she will forego the race. One hopes, for her sake, that
they're right.

WHEN LASSIE IS A LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you go out and buy a big, aggressive dog to protect your
property. But something funny happens. Those number-crunching
actuarial types at your insurance company think Bowser is more of a
liability than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Are they crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. We are experiencing an epidemic of dog bites in
this country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta estimates that as many as 4.7 million people are bitten
each year, 1 million of them require medical treatment, and 334,000
end up in the emergency room. About a dozen people a year die from
dog attacks. The Journal of the American Medical Association
estimates that almost half of all children will be bitten before
reaching age 12. It is the No. 1 health problem among children.
</P>
<P>
   According to Loretta Worters, spokeswoman for the Insurance
Information Institute, all that adds up to a whopping price tag of
$1 billion a year, $250 million of that shelled out in medical and
liability payments by insurance companies. Dog attacks now account
for one third of all homeowners' insurance liability claims. And
the insurers are not wagging their tails over it.
</P>
<P>
   What are they doing about it? ``Insurance companies are all over
the block on this issue,'' says Frank O'Brien, regional manager of
the Alliance of American Insurers. Some companies deny coverage in
certain cases. Some may add a higher premium. Some don't treat dog
owners any differently than others. And many try to sort it out by
sizing up risk according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Bottiano, of Liberty Mutual Group, says her company does
have a list of certain breeds they would call ``unbindable.'' Cases
presenting these dogs _ pit bulls and American Staffordshire
terriers; Doberman pinschers; Rottweilers; German shepherds; chows;
wolves and wolf hybrids _ would have to be reviewed by an
underwriter. (Though the American Kennel Club may differentiate
between pit bulls and American Staffordshire terriers, most
insurance companies do not.) Siberian huskies, Alaskan malamutes,
Great Danes, Saint Bernards, and Akitas appear on other companies'
lists, too.
</P>
<P>
   If someone owns a breed from the red-flag list, Liberty Mutual
would ask more extensive questions concerning the dog's history,
training, gender, sexual status (neutered or spayed?), intent of
ownership, presence of children, and precautions (is the yard
fenced, for example).
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting here is that many of these factors are
exactly the ones that animal welfare organizations have warned
owners about for years. Aggressive dogs tend to be young,
unneutered males who have been poorly socialized. Also, the most
likely victim of an aggressive dog is not a burglar, but the owner,
the owner's children or the neighbors. As Worters and many dog
trainers say, having a big, aggressive dog around without proper
training (of the owner as well as the dog) can be as risky as
``having a loaded shotgun'' in the house.
</P>
<P>
   What dog experts have cautioned is exactly what insurance data
confirms. And as more and more owners ignore warnings and purchase
fierce creatures instead of companions, the bite statistics soar.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: While dog attacks have grown by 37 percent in a
decade (1986-1996), the actual dog population has only grown by 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   We all know lovely German shepherds or sweet Doberman pinschers.
Breed banning is no solution, though most insurance companies
simply raise a flag with certain breeds and look into the matter.
Here, again, the insurance world is in agreement with dog experts:
Worters says, ``Insurance companies believe that the ownership,
rather than the breed, per se, is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This should serve as a wake-up call,'' says nationally known
dog trainer Brian Kilcommons, ``because the few are going to ruin
things for the many. The bigger the dog, the greater the
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilcommons says people too often rationalize aggression,
particularly in the early stages. ``What is deceiving about
aggression,'' he says, ``is that the frequency and intensity take
time to develop. People miss these signals: Your pet growls to
protect a bone? Psychologically, the dog is pulling a knife on you.
And you better listen up, because we know the insurance companies
are.''

MORE BAD NEWS FOR AMERICA'S MEAN STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cities sue gun makers for flooding the streets with handguns,
the gun makers are making their arms more deadly than ever. One
needs no skills of investigative journalism to see this. All one
has to do is wander by a newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   An ad for Beretta handguns neatly sums up the current mentality
of the industry: ``Easy to Conceal. Easy to Fire. Easy to Acquire.
Hard to Beat. Beretta Cougar pistols set a tough new standard,
making heavy firepower easy to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the 1980s and early '90s, symbolized by Schwarzenegger
and Stallone spraying the screen with massive assault rifles.
Beretta, Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt and a host of imitators are up to
something new. In the American Handgunner, an article said, ``A
peculiar reverse arms race is underway among the gunmakers to see
who can make the smallest, lightest handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Handguns magazine's ``Giant Buyer's Guide To Pocket Guns,''
said, ``At one time not so very long ago, you could cover the
subject of pocketable magnum or big-bore revolvers and 9mm
Parabellum and more powerful autos in a single sentence: `There
aren't any.' . . . None of these firms came near to creating
anything like the mini-powerhouses we have today. Today's guns show
a size/power ratio undreamed of 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazines, of course, say their market is confined to
law-abiding gun owners who are concerned only with competitions,
hunting, collecting, and self-defense. But the illegal market, in
which several gun makers were found guilty of feeding by a federal
jury last week in New York, is certainly not oblivious to ads like
the one for a palm-sized .32 caliber Beretta Tomcat that ``might
surprise you'' with ``the punch of a .380.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the illegal market long be ignorant of Smith &AMP; Wesson's
small guns. In referring to S&AMP;W's AirLite, The Complete Book of
Handguns said, ``A year ago, a .38 Special this light would have
been unbelievable. It can change the nature of concealed carry . .
. the first reaction on picking it up is `Unbelievable!' It's
almost as if there's nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reviewer said such a gun ``has the potential to
save lives that may not be saved otherwise,'' particularly for
people who found that guns that were ``reasonably capable of
stopping a fight to the death'' were previously too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the medical studies that show that owning a gun
significantly increases one's chance of dying by gunfire. Gun
makers prey on paranoia over street crime, which has declined. Not
only did the magazine say the gun was light enough for joggers and
women, it even said the gun would be great for ``the doctor in the
ER'' who could hide it ``under his scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not explained why doctors need guns in the ER. Perhaps
every surgeon should be prepared for the day that his heavily
sedated patient leaps off the table to go on a suture rampage.
</P>
<P>
   In the same magazine, an article on Colt says the gun maker
``has been through a lot of positive changes lately. New CEO. New
consultants. New guns. Most important, a new attitude . . . The new
administration understands that one of their strongest potential
assets is the burgeoning concealed carry market . . . Colt has
never had a fuller, better set of choices for the decent person who
carries a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colt lineup of small handguns is so powerful that the author
said, ``Maybe Colt agrees with me: `Friends don't let friends carry
mouse guns.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In The American Handgunner, a reviewer said Kimber's Ultra Carry
compact pistol was more powerful than a comparable Smith &AMP; Wesson
and ``just took the lead in the race for smaller and lighter.
Shooters want little guns with big bullets.'' A piece in Guns and
Ammo said that a Sigarms ultra-compact auto pistol ``offers the
ballistic potential of potent .357 Magnum loadings in a package
appreciably more compact than any police service revolver chambered
for that powerful handgun cartridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Para-Ordnance advertises a line of compact guns ``with the
increased magazine capacity and firepower potential that was once
the exclusive domain of the modern 9mm.''
</P>
<P>
   The buyer's guide in Handguns says, ``Thanks to the popularity
of `pocket pistols' in the marketplace nowadays, new models are
constantly forthcoming.'' That makes the lawsuits by the cities all
the more important. No matter what these companies say, these guns
will wind up in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Beretta ad says, ``Easy to Conceal. Easy to Fire. Easy to
Acquire.'' Just when Boston and other cities are exhaling in relief
from declining gun violence, here come the gun companies, with
instruments that could very easily come back to terrorize us. Their
heavy firepower may be easy to handle for gun owners. Such power
will be hard to handle on the streets of America.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my last column, I mistakenly credited Charles Bronson instead
of Clint Eastwood with the phrase ``Make My Day.'' Sorry, whether
it's Bronson, Eastwood, Schwarzenegger or Stallone, with a gun in
front of their faces, I cannot tell them apart.

THE BOTTOM LINE MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS IT SEEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is a New York Yankee. That means Mr. Roger's new
neighborhood is the Bronx. It means Clemens will not be the first
Roger to come to mind when people start talking about great,
history-making Rogers in team history. It also means it's time to
send out some memos . . .
</P>
<P>
   To Red Sox fans: Please do not be confused. Clemens being traded
from the Blue Jays to the Yankees Thursday is not a postscript to
the Curse of the Bambino. You don't have to worry about that. The
surreal Babe Ruth was a 25-year-old pitcher/slugger when he was
sold away from Fenway Park to New York. He forever haunted the Sox
with his titles and his lore. Clemens is 36. He will only haunt the
Sox because they will forever remember the World Series game he
didn't finish in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. to Sox fans: Don't get excited by that last message. You
know your team is still going to be terrible this season, right? If
they pay attention to their diets and eat all their Minnesotas,
Kansas Citys, and Tampa Bays like they are supposed to, the Sox
could reach 80 wins. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   To Dan Duquette: Come on, man. Real quick. Let's play the Truth
segment of Truth or Dare. When all the cameras are not focused on
your mug, do you admit to yourself that the Sox are not a good
team? I know you do. You have to. I know you're a Bruce ``The
Boss'' Springsteen fan. Do you put on your copy of ``Born To Run''
to calm you? Or do you make like David Wells, crank up the
Metallica, and bash your noggin against the wall until you're
red-faced, sweaty, and screaming, ``I hate my team''? And when
someone mentions The Boss these days, do you think of Springsteen
or Steinbrenner?
</P>
<P>
   P.S. to Duquette: Been meaning to talk to you about this. You
mentioned that fans predicting doom after the loss of Mo Vaughn
were a ``bunch of Chicken Littles.'' Very dated reference. The term
you're looking for these days is ``player-haters.'' Use it in
interviews this way: ``Jose Offerman is a player. A big-time
player. Those who can appreciate the fact that he doesn't have a
position on this team are player-lovers. The rest of y'all?
Player-haters.''
</P>
<P>
   To fans who think other fans and media are too negative: When
Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield heard that Clemens was an official
Yankee, he unleashed an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   To Steinbrenner: What's up, man? You crazy? If ``Seinfeld''
wasn't in rerun status, Frank Costanza, George's father, would not
only be screaming about Hideki Irabu, he'd be upset about Clemens,
too. Your team won 114 regular-season games in 1998, the most in
American League history. So I thought you knew history. You don't.
You believe Clemens, 36, has four or five great years left. You
don't know history. More on that in a second.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. to Steinbrenner (I brought my historical Cliff's Notes this
time): All right, Boss. Name any great pitcher from 1960 to the
present. Bob Gibson, you say? Great choice. Gibson was the original
Rocket. He had a 1.12 ERA when he was 33. He was 23-7 with a
ridiculous 23 complete games when he was 35. After 35, his wins
went 16, 19, 12, and 3. Catfish Hunter once had a two-season win
total of 48 and had his best years in his 20s. He was out of
baseball by 35. Tom Seaver had five seasons of 20 wins or more,
none after 35. The great Jim Palmer was 43-30 after 35.
</P>
<P>
   Overkill to Steinbrenner: Look, Clemens already has proven that
he can pitch well in his mid-30s. But what makes you think he can
be a historical exception and do what the Gibsons, Palmers, and
Seavers could not? By the way, they all won World Series titles,
which Clemens has not.
</P>
<P>
   Random Shout-Out to the Dodgers: You guys are nuts. A seven-year
contract for 34-year-old Kevin Brown? How many 20-win seasons in
that contract?
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. to Duquette: I feel like Statman after writing that stuff
to Steinbrenner. Now I know what you must have been thinking two
years ago when you said Clemens was in the twilight of his career.
That's accurate, historically. And, Dan, maybe Toronto general
manager Gord Ash felt the same way. But the difference is that he
got three major leaguers for Clemens while you . . . well, you
know. And while we're at it, everybody not named Duquette and
Harrington knew Mo was leaving after last season. Why didn't you
trade him before . . . never mind.
</P>
<P>
   To sports fans in cyberspace: One of the best Clemens lines of
the day was posted on an on-line message board. We all know that
Clemens has given his children ``K'' names, after the symbol for
the strikeout. Well, one cyber type wrote that the Rocket only
wanted to play in New York because he needed a city with a ``K'' in
it.
</P>
<P>
   To Yankees GM Brian Cashman: Ever hear of chemistry, man? Your
team was one of the rare ones in sports that contained players that
actually liked each other. So you traded a 35-year-old pitcher for
a 36-year-old one? You traded a lefty setup man who didn't give up
a run at Yankee Stadium, you traded a gifted young second baseman.
Yes, your team will win more than 100 games again. But it would
have done that with or without Clemens. Was it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   To those who believe in Babe Ruth conspiracies: You know
Steinbrenner and Clemens are going to taunt the Sox and give Roger
No. 3 to wear, just for one season. If that doesn't happen, look at
it another way. Clemens usually wears No. 21. Two plus one is
three. Babe wore No. 3. Clemens may wear No. 12. One plus two is
three. Babe wore No. 3. Clemens is playing for his third team. Babe
wore No. 3. If the Yankees win the Series this year, it will be
their third title in the last four years. Babe wore No. 3. And like
Mo and Roger, Babe was also a Fenway visitor who shouldn't have
been.

NO. 1 IN THE EAST A TOUGH CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ongoing debate in college basketball right now is not who's
No. 1, but who's going to be No. 1 in the NCAA East region next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates: Duke and Connecticut. Unless one goes into a
total tailspin and loses a bunch of games _ and that doesn't seem
likely _ both deserve to stay at home. Obviously both can't.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the arguments for and against each. Duke has not lost
since being beaten in Alaska by Cincinnati in November on a
last-second basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils are blowing people away and everyone concedes
they are the No. 1 team in college basketball right now.
</P>
<P>
   Since the natural region of the Atlantic Coast Conference is the
East, sending the Devils to Charlotte for its first- and
second-round games makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   That's clearly where Duke wants to go. And it also wants to go
to the East Regionals in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But what about UConn? The Huskies are hearing criticism
for the way they have played of late.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me. The last time I looked, they had lost one game _ with
two starters missing _ to a decent Syracuse team. Other than that,
they haven't lost _ period.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument goes that they aren't playing the way they did
a month ago. They are banged up and struggling against some bad
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Please. College basketball is a long season. Teams have slumps.
And the Huskies have still won. And if anyone doubts their ability
when they are focused, check out the way they took care of Stanford
in Palo Alto two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is a fine team. Maybe a great team. But having seen both
the Blue Devils and Huskies play in person on more than a couple of
occasions, I found no evidence that jumps out and says if both
teams play their absolute best game, Duke will win.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tossup, which is why the call of keeping UConn in the
East, where the Huskies can play in Boston for the first two
rounds, is so tough.
</P>
<P>
   What's the tie-breaker? Maybe history. Maybe it's time to give
UConn a break.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the Huskies played North Carolina for a
regional title in Greensboro last year. They have also played
Florida for a regional title in Miami and UCLA for a regional title
in California. Of those three, only the game against North Carolina
was a clear-cut case of home-court advantage, but that's not the
point. Maybe it's time to keep UConn home _ if the Huskies finish
the season with only one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody on the NCAA selection committee owes the Huskies if all
things are equal _ and in this case they seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a travesty if the Huskies wind up heading west and
facing a team like Arizona in the regional final in Phoenix, which
would provide another home-court edge.
</P>
<P>
   Or head south and face a team like Kentucky in the regional
final at Knoxville _ an easy car trip from Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are this will work itself out. Someone will lose and the
choices will be easier.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling here is that if UConn wins out, it should stay
in Boston. Duke can be switched to the South to play in Orlando and
Knoxville, and a team like Auburn, which has had a great season but
is still a relative new kid on the block in terms of NCAA
tournament play, can take the trip west.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Homecoming unlikely
</P>
<P>
   All of you former Boston College fans who are visualizing a
return by Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien to Boston for an NCAA
tournament appearance in the FleetCenter can probably forget about
it. Although it could happen, the most likely scenario is to keep
the Buckeyes, who have won 20 games and made a remarkable
turnaround from last year's cellar-dweller campaign, will stay in
the Midwest or South . . . By the way, O'Brien should be a lock for
Big Ten coach of the year, and were it not for what Cliff Ellis has
done at Auburn, would be the favorite for national coach of the
year. Under O'Brien, Ohio State has five conference road wins this
season. The last two seasons the Buckeyes had four road wins total.
They also have 10 conference wins this season. Over the previous
four seasons, they had a total of 10 conference wins. And they have
season sweeps over Indiana and Purdue. All of this because of one
coach _ and one special player in guard Scoonie Penn. The BC
transfer is the only change from last year's team, which went 1-15
in the Big Ten. ``Scoonie has just stepped it up big time,'' said
O'Brien. ``He just keeps making plays.'' . . . If UConn does get
shipped elsewhere, don't expect to see Kentucky in Boston either.
Here's why. The NCAA likes to avoid rematches. Having Duke and
Kentucky as the top two seeds in the East would set up a possible
rematch of a regular-season game and of last year's South Regional
final. It's more likely that the Wildcats will get shipped to the
Midwest as a No. 2 seed to Michigan State . . . Keep an eye on what
San Diego State does in its search to replace Fred Trenkle.
Athletic director Rick Bey wants to upgrade the profile of the
program and reportedly is focused on a big name. Supposedly he has
Utah's Rick Majerus on his short list. Lots of luck on that one.
The other name that keeps coming up is Rhode Island's Jim Harrick.
Harrick's return to the West Coast is a foregone conclusion; it's a
matter of when, not if.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Double crossed
</P>
<P>
   Bill Raynor deserved better than getting dumped at Holy Cross.
Granted the W's weren't there and college basketball is still a
bottom-line, win-loss business. But anyone who has watched the
self-destruction of the Holy Cross program with its decision first
to go nonscholarship, and then bring back scholarships on a limited
basis this season knows that Raynor was working with constraints
that were out of his control. Supposedly he had a decent recruiting
class coming in with a real chance to compete in the Patriot
League. Now someone else will benefit from that work. And that
person could be lame duck Pittsburgh coach Ralph Willard . . .
Xavier could be searching for a new coach if Pittsburgh lures Skip
Prosser. Speaking of Pitt, consider this: A loss to BC Saturday
could make the Panthers the No. 13 seed in the Big East tournament
next month. When has the Big East or any other league had a
last-place seed with a regular-season win over Kentucky on its
resume, as the Panthers do . . . The Atlantic 10 could wind up with
only two NCAA tournament bids, which isn't all that surprising. The
A-10 has had a bad year. Only four teams are above .500, and Rhode
Island and George Washington both must be considered bubble teams .
. . Want a couple of early tournament sleepers? Try Ohio State and
Texas. Rick Barnes has quietly turned the Longhorns into a Big 12
power (that's not saying much this season), but the Longhorns have
become a decent team under Barnes's guidance . . . Things just get
worse and worse for UMass and Boston University with the lack of
senior leadership being as big a problem as anything. Both Bruiser
Flint and Dennis Wolff had reasonable expectations of playing in
the postseason this year. Now it looks like both will be done by
the first week of March . . . North Carolina has won at least 20
games for an NCAA-record 29 seasons . . . Rutgers has received
permission to talk to former UMass forward Ajmal Basit.

IMPRACTICAL IDEAS BLANKET THE RUNWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some designer creations die early. One trip down a
runway and they're history.
</P>
<P>
   As fashion designers previewed their fall '99 collections to
media and retailers this week, there were several candidates for
death from lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Take hoop skirts from the Barbara Bui collection, for example.
Hoops are rarely used, even in ballgowns, because they don't move
about easily. But Bui's short hoop skirts are accidents waiting to
happen. Imagine walking around with a hula hoop in your hemline and
envision sitting in a car. Overexposure would be just one hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Body muffs are another puzzlement. A model walked down a runway
with her chest and upper arms encased in a wide velvet band.
Shoulders and belly were bare, but she wore a long evening skirt.
It was obvious she'd never get a coat over the costume. And could
she eat? And if she lifted her arms for a close dance, wouldn't she
expose her breasts?
</P>
<P>
   Not all these semi-shrouds are alike. Sometimes they're a knit
band worn over a sweater. They can also resemble a very short
pullover without sleeves _ a capelike garment that confines and
covers upper arms and chest before ending just below the bustline.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Westwood delivered plenty of runway throwaways:
oversized ``buttoms'' in strategic places on a black bustier, a
fringed shawl over a red bustier and fringed blanket wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Hers aren't the only blankets. They're everywhere, cleverly
described as serapes, stoles, ponchos and riding capes, but looking
like blankets. Designers clearly adore them.
</P>
<P>
   Blanketlike wraps are made of fleece, wool, felt or combinations
of fibers. They're plain, striped and patterned. Some are short
(twin size?). Others are more voluminous (double or queen?).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes models simply clutch them about their bodies.
Occasionally these wraps are stuck together with some invisible
closure. A few have an opening for the head. But fastened or
handheld, it's a sure bet they won't replace parkas for trips to
the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Aprons are another peculiarity on the runways. John Bartlett
showed wool ``utility aprons'' over trousers. They looked more like
chaps.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mistaking Betsey Johnson's aprons. Most
memorable was a hand-crocheted number tied around the waist of a
baby-doll dress.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's fashion shows are always theatrical and this one was
no exception. It was staged in the service bays of the Manhattan
Mercedes-Benz dealer, a site in a West Side neighborhood where
buildings have barred windows and doors and are triple locked,
covered with metal gates and further protected behind chain-link
fences with rolls of barbed wire on top.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership, however, was spotless. Guests slid out of cabs
and limos and walked up a ramp into a vast and very clean service
area. A long runway with bleacher seating had been installed
between service stalls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to aprons, Johnson showed boned bustiers, laced
corsets, jackets with peplums, nightgowns as daytime apparel and
feather-trimmed coats and sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was plain and simple _ that's not Johnson's style. Every
costume was an eclectic mix of fabrics, trims and textures: a
yellow floral print, a red plaid ribbon, a bit of muslin, all
joyously combined. The collection appeared to have been created
from dozens of scrap bags, odds and ends of ribbons and yarns.
</P>
<P>
   Guests were treated to little rag dolls labeled ``Betsey.''
Hundreds of them peeked out of tiny black shopping bags, one placed
on each assigned seat. The dolls had stuffed heads and bodies,
button eyes, cotton rope arms, silk cord fringe for bangs and black
ribbon legs.

CLINTON SHOWS WHY THE REPUBLICANS HATE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven years after his ringing ``I'll be with you till the last
dog dies'' speech that mesmerized the Democrats inside the Dover
Elks Club in New Hampshire, a still-promising politician nicknamed
The Comeback Kid came back.
</P>
<P>
   Still promising. In 1992, he promised a 69-cent per day tax cut
that was ridiculed by Paul Tsongas, who whomped Bill Clinton in the
New Hampshire primary, and shortly thereafter held the eventual
two-term president to a rock-bottom 16 percent of the vote in the
Massachusetts primary.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton had something; still does. His enemies were holding
nasty signs and shouting ribald insults along his route in the
Granite State Thursday. The Union Leader editorial was, to put it
charitably, venomous(surprise!). But the persuasiveness and
sincerity that the nation's First Razorback exercises on the clear
majority of American voters was evident in spades.
</P>
<P>
   This trip, Clinton was promising to save not his own skin, but
Social Security. He vowed to repair not his own personal
reputation, but the public schools. He didn't have to go into great
detail about his day job, as the world's most prominent _ and
powerful _ peacekeeper. The satchems and sages of Europe are doing
that for him, round-the-clock, as he calibrates the threat of US
firepower against the latest tinpot despot to bait Uncle Sam, the
repulsive Butcher of the Balkans, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's is the fast-forward presidency. Has it really been
seven years since he roamed New Hampshire, seizing every
un-mittened hand, staring intently into every unwary gaze,
collaring every doubtful voter with the grip of the drowning man?
He has won New Hampshire twice in national elections, yet all the
Granite State's federal officials _ two senators, two congress _
voted to toss him out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was, in a Dover health care roundtable, a
Manchester party dinner, pumping hands, rallying Democrats, busting
through the media chaff with his patented sales pitch. Thanks to
C-SPAN, you could catch Clinton's triumphant return _ ``This dog is
limping, but still going'' _ then an hour of one of his bitterest
critics, Sen. Bob Smith, who wants to replace him. I am not making
this up. Bob Smith, who was lucky to win re-election last time out
with 49 percent of the vote, is running for president. As they say,
folks, it's a free country. You just have to be older than 34 and
native-born.
</P>
<P>
   So Bob Smith, in the Wolfeboro high school gym where he used to
teach, aims for Clinton's job, vowing he's not one of those hated
``deal-makers,'' but a real sincere fella. His announcement was a
nice, homespun small-town-America playlet.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned growing up without a father in a rural community
(just like Clinton), dedicating himself to bettering the lot of
humanity (just like Clinton), focusing on doing the right thing
never mind the politics (just like you-know-who), and prevailing
time after time solely because he is in tune with just-plain-folks
(just like, etc.). Of course, it goes without saying, Smith
promises to be the anti-Clinton, and we'll see how he makes out.
Clinton proved small-town is not necessarily small-time; Smith has
yet to demonstrate those same skills.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob, drawing barely four percent of New Hampshire
Republicans in early polls, mentioned Jimmy Stewart, the actor, and
the movie ``Mr. Smith goes to Washington,'' and another actor named
Reagan. He also referenced Alice in Wonderland, and during his
peroration waved a large starfish at the loyal listeners. The
parable of the hopeful soul who throws starfish from the beach back
into the ocean is the metaphor for this Mr. Smith's
one-man-can-make-a-difference campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Mr. Smith idolizes Jesse Helms, opposes making Dr.
Martin Luther King's holiday into a state holiday, and would
require every pregnant woman to have a baby whether the mother
wishes it or not _ all these stands may affect his political
future. But that's for another day. His grand announcement featured
a stirring acapella rendition of the national anthem by Rose
Remitter, whose brave smile and sweet notes would have melted the
most skeptical heart. The Star Spangled Banner is a hard song to
sing, and running for president is a hard row to hoe, but
determined folk manage to do both, against great odds.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith and his fellow Republicans hold Clinton in the
lowest regard, and disparage the President in most-insulting terms,
I chose to look on the bright side. I listened intently to Smith
deride the dovish tilt of American foreign policy over Vietnam, and
heard him exalt a more muscular US policy, stoutly vowing new
weaponry and a take-no-prisoners attitude toward the rest of the
world. The thought naturally occurred: what if a guy like Bob Smith
replaces Clinton? Smith begged his audience to relish the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   I will not ask you to decide whether Clinton showed elemental
political courage, or base political calculation, when he ordered
US warplanes to bomb Iraqi installations just as the US House voted
to impeach him. Take instead my question from the roiling debate of
Clinton's trial in the Senate. Do you recall that Clinton clung to
about a 60-40 polling majority on the crucial keep-him-or-croak-him
question of impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still kept US aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones,
correct? And any day, or any night, Saddam Hussein's anti-aircraft
missiles could have knocked down a US aircraft? And killed or
captured an American aircrew? You remember the propaganda value of
the pilots Saddam captured in the Gulf War? When George Bush
enjoyed remarkable political and media support?
</P>
<P>
   Now ask yourself: if you were a president just a handful of
votes away from impeachment, and your survival depended upon a
handful of senators in each party, and you had a shooting gallery
going every day over Iraq's no-fly zones, would you have the nerve
to tell your commanders to keep firing at those Iraqi missile
batteries? When every ring of the red phone might mean a terse call
from the Situation Room that an Air Force captain had been shot
down, captured, and shoved before a CNN camera, to instantly become
the planet's most famous pilot-hostage?
</P>
<P>
   Do you think your poll rating might take a dip? Like, 10 points?
15? Maybe 20? Do you think having one of your pilots shot down, or
two of them, or ten, would make it easier for your political
enemies to impeach you? My hunch is that Clinton's enemies, already
at his throat, would have been vastly emboldened if his measured
efforts to restrain Saddam had gone astray. I'd argue that Sen.
Trent Lott and his Merry Men have largely forfeited our faith that
they would rise above partisan passions to do the right thing when
the country's basic policies are in peril. They haven't yet proven
me wrong.
</P>
<P>
   So I think I can legitimately argue that Clinton showed guts in
holding to a tough, we'll-shoot-if-we-have-to policy in the no-fly
zones. I understand why the Republicans hate him. He keeps winning,
and they can't stand it. Or him. But I've been around enough
presidents to understand the most important thing is that they hang
tough when basic national interests are at stake. And I don't think
Lott, or Bob Smith, for that matter, get it.

THE LONG AND SHORT OF THE CELTICS' WILD WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ The country music station Thursday morning asked its
listeners to name a song fitting for a funeral. Celine Dion's ``My
Heart Will Go On'' was the landslide winner _ something by Garth
Brooks was a distant second _ but in between calls, the two talking
heads at the station wanted to discuss something quite different:
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they rhapsodized about Wednesday night's
triple-overtime game between the Grizzlies and the Celtics, one
that undoubtedly could have spawned several C&AMP;W hits, not to
mention a few blues numbers. Boston and Vancouver dueled into the
late British Columbian night, matching improbable 3-pointers,
dealing with questionable calls, and enduring almost four hours
before the Celtics emerged with a 131-129 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My players are exhausted,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. A
scheduled practice for Thursday was limited to ``reserves only''
and cut to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't begin to imagine how they feel,'' Pitino continued.
``I'm numb. And I didn't do a damn thing. It was an unbelievable
game.''
</P>
<P>
   We still are witnessing far too many clunkers in this
lockout-impacted season, but those of the 13,041 who remained at GM
Place for the whole affair got their money's worth. Early on, it
looked like a game that neither team especially deserved to win.
There was a rat-a-tat sequence when each team turned the ball over
twice within 10 seconds with wayward passes, one of which bounced
off the side of the backboard. On their next possession, the
Celtics committed a 24-second violation.
</P>
<P>
   But after 191 shots, 93 free throws, 75 fouls, 49 turnovers, 260
points, and 17 lead changes in the final 21 minutes, it was clear
that the game really did not deserve a loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had four starters who scored 20 or more points, but
the two biggest baskets came from two reserves _ Dana Barros and
Andrew DeClercq _ who combined for 15. Rookie Paul Pierce again was
dazzling with 26 points and seven steals, including two in the
final four seconds of the third overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's estimable Shareef Abdur-Rahim played 56 minutes and
rookie Mike Bibby went 54, including wire-to-wire in the three OTs.
After the loss, Vancouver coach Brian Hill sat in his office,
across a small coffee table from his wife, Kay, a red felt pen in
his hand and a marked-up statistic sheet in front of him. He looked
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five overtimes in 24 hours,'' Hill said, referring to the
team's double-overtime victory the night before in Anaheim against
the Clippers. ``We never should have let it get away.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. This had been a gut-wrencher. His team could not
hold a 3-point lead in the final five seconds of regulation play.
His team committed 31 turnovers, including four 24-second
violations in the fourth quarter, three in the final 3:12. A
victory would have been the Grizzlies' third in a row and would
have put them over .500 at 4-3, no small achievement for a
franchise that has yet to win 20 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the first of three signature offensive plays,
two of which extended the game and the third which, mercifully,
ended it.
</P>
<P>
   1. Dana Barros's big 3: The Celtics trailed, 94-91, with 4.5
seconds left. In came Barros, who had been on the bench for the
last seven minutes and was in a 3-point rut. ``I had no rhythm at
all,'' he said. But he found an opening on the perimeter, just out
of reach of Bibby, who should have stayed with him. ``As soon as he
caught the pass,'' Hill said, ``I knew he was going to make the
shot. As soon as he caught it.'' Barros said, ``I knew it was on
line, but I couldn't tell if it was going to be short or long
because I had to shoot it so high.'' Of course, it hit nothing but
net. On to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sam Mack's big 3: Prior to the game, Pitino talked
incessantly about Mack's long-range shooting and that he had to be
watched like a hawk. In the second OT, Boston led, 114-110, with 25
seconds left and Mack was fouled attempting a 3. He made all three
shots. After the precocious Pierce made two more free throws,
Vancouver needed a trey to tie the game. Mack somehow got open in
the left corner and, of course, knocked it down. ``I don't know
what happened on that play,'' Barros said. ``There were a lot of
people there.'' Added Pierce, ``I got a hand in his face and I
probably could have blocked the shot. But I didn't want to risk a
foul. He hit a tough shot.'' On to the third OT.
</P>
<P>
   3. DeClercq's steal and winning hoop: The Celtics trailed by 4
in the final minute, but Pierce (there's that guy, again) weaved in
for a scoop. DeClercq then collapsed on Abdur-Rahim, creating a
turnover. (Abdur-Rahim had eight for the game.) Barros and DeClercq
then worked a pick and roll and the big center got the ball. Now,
DeClercq driving to the hoop does not conjure up images of, say,
James Worthy. He took a bull-in-the-china-shop first step and went
up awkwardly, but successfully, for a layup. He was fouled by Tony
Massenburg and made the big freebie with 15.8 seconds left. Someone
mentioned afterward to DeClercq that the play looked a little
disjointed, that he went to the hoop as if he had two left feet.
``Gee, you must be from Vancouver,'' DeClercq said. ``That's the
way I always look.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, much more. The Celtics won even though Ron
Mercer and Antoine Walker fouled out in the third OT. Pierce stole
the ball on the Grizzlies' last two possessions and pronounced
himself whipped after going 49 minutes. There was the return of the
Celtics' press, with first-unit guys doing the drudge work.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there was enough for just about everyone, even the folks
at Country 94 on your dial.

TRUST MOM: WEAR CLEAN UNDERWEAR IS GOOD BUSINESS ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your mother was right.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't eat your vegetables, you won't get dessert. You
can't judge a book by its cover. Sharing is caring.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a mother's intuition makes good sense in
business as well. (She could have told you that.)
</P>
<P>
   But it took Rhonda Abrams, a small-business consultant and
author of ``Wear Clean Underwear; Business Wisdom from Mom''
(Villard Books, 1999, $22.95) to point it out to us.
</P>
<P>
   When Abrams, who writes and consults out of the San Francisco
Bay area, first became a manager herself, she went looking for role
models on the business bookshelves. There she learned she had to
swim with sharks and be part Attila the Hun if she wanted to
succeed in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dog eat dog,'' she said. ``But I'm not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took her a few more years to figure out she needn't
look any further than her own mother for a management mentor.
</P>
<P>
   When Abrams opened her management consulting practice in the
mid-1980s, she began dispensing advice to entrepreneurs as they
formulated their business plans. They would come to her saying they
wanted to do something meaningful with their businesses, do
something good for the environment, or otherwise make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, save that for your private life,'' she
said. But she was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of watching some businesses succeed and others
fail, she figured out the difference: ``The best values make the
best companies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where moms come in. Mothers are the first teachers of
values, and what they teach works equally well in life and in
business. Abrams uses business case studies to illustrate the
various mom-isms in her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wear clean underwear,'' for example, was one of the the most
commonly cited sayings that people she interviewed remembered
hearing from their mothers. (In fact, this saying came up even in
different cultures, which just proves mothers are the same the
world over.)
</P>
<P>
   But wearing clean underwear is really a lesson about doing the
right thing, even if no one is going to see it, Abrams said. If you
have that integrity, and you suffer a business setback, it will
hold you in good stead.
</P>
<P>
   Doing the right thing, even when it isn't obvious to others, has
myriad other benefits. Nordstrom, for example, has only one rule in
its employee handbook _ ``Use good judgment in all situations.'' It
also has some of the highest returns per square foot of any
department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're sorry'' is another piece of advice from mom that
can pay off in business. McDonald's learned this the hard way after
a jury awarded an elderly woman $2.9 million for the burn she
suffered when she spilled her McDonald's coffee. McDonald's had
already settled more than 700 other claims for coffee burns
stemming from its extra-hot coffee, Abrams said. And yet they
hadn't warned consumers, or planned to change the temperature of
their coffee. In other words, it didn't seem like the company was
sorry, so the jury sent a message that it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla, on the other hand, did say it was sorry when its apple
juice was linked to the 1996 E. coli outbreak in Washington. Not
only did it do a public product recall, even before the link was
definitive, it also publicly apologized for any illness or
suffering and offered to pay medical bills for anyone who had
gotten sick.
</P>
<P>
   That move made a huge difference in restoring public trust in
the company, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moms are a never-ending supply of good business tips.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, it was the mother of a Nordstrom employee who
originally suggested that the stores have a piano player during the
holiday season. The suggestion was such a hit that pianos have
since become a regular store fixture, which just proves a mom's
favorite maxim _ mother knows best.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of others to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump off
one, too?'' Southwest Airlines bucked established airline industry
trends to become one of the most admired companies in the country
and one of the few airlines to consistently turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't judge a book by its cover.'' Paul Orfalea had such
severe dyslexia he didn't think anyone would ever hire him, so he
hired himself. Today his company, Kinko's, has more than 900
locations and has grown because he gives employees plenty of trust
and decision-making authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring good values and passion to your business, it
sustains you over time,'' Abrams said. ``Employees are more
motivated, and the customers are more loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask your mother.

ESPN NOT BOTHERED BY UP-AND-COMING FOX 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   As so called wars go, the competition between ESPN and Fox
Sports Net has received its share of media attention, most bringing
a little exposure to Fox and no serious damage to ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN holds an almost 8-1 advantage in viewers over Fox. Those
numbers allow ABC Sports and ESPN Chairman Steve Bornstein to talk
boldly about his competition. ``The less I acknowledge that, you
know, that I put them in the same breath with me, the better I feel
about it,'' Bornstein told HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.
``I look at Fox as a bit of a mosquito. But again, my real interest
is not what my competitors are doing. My real interest is what
we're doing. Are we still the leader in sports television?''
</P>
<P>
   That's true now, but Fox has made inroads by acquiring former
ESPN anchors Keith Olbermann and Chris Myers to headline a regional
approach to covering sports across the country. Fox has 22 regional
stations and owns the broadcast rights to 70 professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ESPN is doing, I think it's complementary,'' Fox's David
Hill said. ``They're a national service. We're a local service,
we're a regional service. Our mantra is `Sports is tribal.' ''
</P>

   CNN/SI has a interesting story about trying out for a high
school basketball team. CNN/SI reporter Tom Rinaldi spent five days

young men competing for spots. The 30-minute show airs Sunday at 10

   With no more impeachment to cover, CNBC dives head-first into

airing a documentary on the 1979 NCAA title game between Michigan
State and Indiana State on March 28 at 9 p.m. ``Magic vs. Bird: The
Game that Changed the Game'' will be presented on the eve of this
year's championship game. John Thompson has also jumped on the
bandwagon. The former Georgetown basketball coach will host a
one-hour show on WTEM, a suburban Washington all-sports-talk
station . . . Members of the 1969 Miracle Mets appear March 1 on
the CBS series ``Everybody loves Raymond.''

LOOSE LIPS SINK FISH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. has a new board member.
</P>
<P>
   He is Ed Linde, chief executive of Boston Properties Inc., the
big real estate development company. He replaces Larry Fish,
chairman of Citizens Financial Group Inc., who resigned from the
board of the state's largest insurer this month after nearly six
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is usually the stuff of briefs in the back of the Business
section. But bear with me, please.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fish and Hancock chairman Stephen Brown offer the same
explanation for the parting of the ways: The growing convergence of
banking and insurance made it dicey to have a banker sitting on the
insurer's board with Hancock preparing for an initial public
offering of stock. Both banks and insurance companies sell products
like mutual funds and annuities and are increasingly pitching to
the same customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to eliminate any appearance of a conflict of
interest,'' Fish said in a brief telephone interview Thursday. He
called the decision ``very much mutual.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he ``hated'' to lose Fish. ``He has been a great
director,'' Brown said, particularly as part of the board's finance
committee, where his lending experience was so useful.
</P>
<P>
   The finance committee is charged with reviewing all of Hancock's
investments. And here's where things get interesting.
</P>
<P>
   According to two sources familiar with the situation, Hancock
directors became concerned about loose lips, specifically Larry
Fish's. Several directors heard back that Fish had been talking to
friends and business associates about the investments Hancock was
considering. That didn't fly at the top of the Hancock Tower. It
didn't help, either, that Fish was known for being
less-than-courteous to the staff of the finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to ask Fish about the issue, but couldn't. From the
moment I raised the finance committee, he told me he ``didn't want
to hear about it.'' I tried again: ``I don't care what else you
have!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I resigned. . . . I am telling you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Fish's role on the finance committee had no bearing
on his resignation. ``I don't know anything about that,'' Brown
said. ``The only thing I know about is the issue of convergency''
of banking and insurance and the timing of the public offering,
which could come in 18 months to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Other local banks and insurers don't seem to be nearly as
concerned about such potential conflict of interest as Brown and
Fish say they are.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Corp. chairman Charles K. Gifford, for instance, sits
on the board of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., and Thomas
B. Wheeler, chairman of Mass. Mutual, is on the bank's board. Gary
L. Countryman, chairman of Liberty Mutual Group, is also on the
BankBoston board. Terrence Murray, chairman of Fleet Financial
Group Inc., sits on the board of Allmerica Financial Corp., the
Worcester insurer; Allmerica went public 3 1/2 years ago, just as
Hancock is now planning.

MERGERS PUT A DENT IN `WALL STREET WEST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for FOREIGN-TAKEOVERS.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One by one, some of San Francisco's most
renowned hometown companies have been swooped up in a recent frenzy
of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions, including BankAmerica and Pacific Telesis,
have raised the specter that San Francisco may be losing its
reputation as ``Wall Street West.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest deal, announced Thursday, the Dutch insurance
company Aegon NV plans to acquire Transamerica Corp. and its famed
pyramid tower for $9.7 billion. The headquarters, with only 120
employees, will remain in the city.
</P>
<P>
   While public officials put a positive spin on the mergers,
others fear that the city's reputation is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have a high-profile merger with a large
established company, the issue of prestige comes into play,'' said
Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a
public/private organization that studies the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a loss of image when you lose a corporate
headquarters,'' Randolph said. ``It's not a trend that any city
wants to see.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend has been well established here recently:
</P>
<P>
   _ Britain's Vodafone Group PLC has offered $56 billion for
AirTouch Communications.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two years ago, SBC Communications Inc. of San Antonio acquired
Pacific Telesis, the parent of Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   _ NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., acquired BankAmerica Corp.
last year. Most headquarters operations were moved to Charlotte,
but the merged bank was renamed BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also last year, Norwest of Minneapolis grabbed another local
financial institution, Wells Fargo. Norwest retained the Wells
Fargo name and relocated to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   _ BankBoston Corp. took over the financial services company
Robertson Stephens, while NationsBank bought Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   More deals may be coming down the pike. The Pacific Exchange and
the high-tech investment bank of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist are viewed as
likely takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   The merger activity is by no means unique to San Francisco.
Mergers nationwide hit an all-time high last year, with 7,700 deals
worth $1.2 trillion, according to Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an
investment bank in Los Angeles. Consumer-rich California led the
way, with 13 percent of all companies sold based in California.
</P>
<P>
   Given a robust economy, boosters pooh-pooh the idea that San
Francisco has lost its attraction as a big-time business center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be losing headquarters,'' said Rhea Serpan, president
of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, ``but on the upside,
people continue to invest in our companies. There are so many
growth opportunities and good markets here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance and banking are two of the city's strongest sectors,
Serpan said, and there has been strong job growth in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new economy,'' Serpan said. ``It's global, it's
high-tech-related and we're well-positioned to take advantage of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mayor Willie Brown echoed the chamber
president's views about the merger activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're concerned, San Francisco continues to be the
headquarters capital for Northern California,'' said Ron Vinson,
the mayor's deputy press secretary. ``We don't seem to be adversely
affected by them.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Business experts say that mergers are economic Darwinism at
play, with solid companies and industries surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy development, especially for those institutions
that are strong players,'' said Lenny Mendonca, a director at
management consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co. in San Francisco. ``The
net effect on San Francisco and the Bay area is actually positive,
not negative.''
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors of City Hall, policy makers continue to debate
the impact of the mergers. So far, the economy here appears
unharmed. Building permits continue to rise. The downtown real
estate market is hotter than ever. And small businesses and
startups are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco remains home to several conglomerates and Fortune
500 companies, including Chevron Corp., The Gap Inc., McKesson
Corp., Charles Schwab Corp. and Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric. And some of
the world's largest privately-held companies, among them Bechtel
Group Inc. and Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., are based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, San Francisco is on an incredible economic roll,''
said Hector Chinchilla, president of the city's planning
commission. ``We're spending money, people are getting jobs, we're
putting up buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, there is always the threat of
mergers, mass layoffs and recession. He said San Francisco's
diverse economy would cushion the blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some argue that the mergers are giving us a black eye, while
others say it's the natural evolution of the economy,'' Chinchilla
said. ``I'm somewhere in between. It's too early to tell how all of
this will shake out.''

DAD'S MUSIC LIVES THROUGH SHEMEKIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shemekia Copeland, 19, knows she can count on the ``true blues
lovers'' to come to her shows. It's a mature, knowledgeable and
supportive audience.
</P>
<P>
   If only she could convince people her own age to embrace the
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If young people just knew more about it, they would like it,''
Copeland said by phone from a San Francisco hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends a little older than me, in their early 20s. And
when they come out to my shows, they're like, `Wow, this is so
cool.' They've never seen anything like it. There's a drummer
making those funky beats ... and a singer actually up there
singing. They're amazed at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland thinks many young people have based their opinions of
the blues on a misperception.
</P>
<P>
   ``When young kids think of the blues, they think of songs about
pickin' cotton and things like that. And it's not like that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be singing about pickin' cotton, because what
the hell do I know about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the blues fret about its demographics. Those who love
the music are often middle-aged, while the most celebrated blues
performers _ B.B. King, Bobby Bland and John Lee Hooker _ are in
their 70s and 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Other greats, including Albert Collins, Junior Wells and Albert
King, have passed away. Copeland's own father, singer and guitarist
Johnny Clyde Copeland, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   So when a 19-year-old singer with a full-throated voice like Big
Mama Thornton comes along, blues aficionados have reason to
rejoice. Some have even dubbed her a savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't hang anything on you that you don't want, but the
fact that people say I could help the future of the blues, I think
that's great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland, who grew up in Harlem and now lives in Teaneck, N.J.,
made her singing debut at 8 at the Cotton Club. But she didn't get
serious about singing professionally until she was 15, just a few
years before her dad died. She grew very close to him during his
final days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my dad. I'm so glad I spent that time with him when I
did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up, Copeland absorbed the music of Otis Redding,
Aretha Franklin, Koko Taylor and Etta James. But her father was
always her biggest inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's music will live through me for as long as I
live,'' Copeland said. ``I wanna make my daddy proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland's ground-pounding debut album, ``Turn the Heat Up,''
was released late last year on Alligator Records. Jimmy Vivino and
Michael Merritt of Conan O'Brien's Late Night Band played on the
album and also backed her during a December performance on the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Since her album was released, Copeland's elders in the blues
community have offered plenty of advice for the young belter, who
turns 20 on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the blues community. They're so supportive and helpful.
They look after me and they warn me about stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland's current tour includes songs from the album, among
them ``Ghetto Child,'' ``Married to the Blues'' and ``Big Lovin'
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   During the tour, Copeland will get a boost from her role in the
upcoming Neve Campbell/Matthew Perry movie, ``Three to Tango.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big stretch for me, but I play a blues singer in a
nightclub,'' she said.

DDJ HOPING TO HIT PAYDIRT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in their swashbuckling Fidelity days, the ``vulture''
investors who now run DDJ Capital Management were famous for buying
risky distressed assets at dirt-cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now DDJ is about to buy gardening supply company Smith &AMP; Hawken
for $75 million, as the winner of a bankruptcy court auction
conducted in Worcester, Mass. last week.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering question: Did DDJ get the drop on other potential
bidders thanks to an unusually fast auction timetable, or did it
overpay to protect a lackluster investment? You could hear either
point of view among people familiar with the process.
</P>
<P>
   Court testimony indicated that Smith &AMP; Hawken, a healthy
division of bankrupt CML Group Inc. of Acton, Mass., had suffered
through a poor Christmas season and cut its cash-flow forecasts for
the current fiscal year to just under $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means the DDJ bid, which includes about $25 million of
assumed debt, would amount to 15 times cash flow, roughly double
the going price for a healthy company in the same business. But
others seemed to be interested at those prices, or at least talked
a good game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret we didn't have more time to look at the business
because we were interested,'' said George Majoros, chief operating
officer of Wasserstein Perella Merchant Banking in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unsecured creditors, mostly investors who owned $40 million of
convertible debt, also beefed about the fast-track auction. But
they dropped their objection after a settlement improved their odds
of getting at least a little money back.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein Perella did not make a bid deemed acceptable, but
Majoros wrote to CML lawyers that his firm was prepared to pay $85
million or perhaps more for Smith &AMP; Hawken, pending further review.
The Majoros letter was dated Feb. 4, the deadline for Smith &AMP;
Hawken bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you sell your company based on that letter?'' Judy
Mencher of DDJ fired back. She said the Wellesley firm, which
manages about $1 billion, paid up in a fair auction for a company
it liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith &AMP; Hawken is a good little growth company that just needs
to be properly nurtured,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   DDJ was created in 1996 when original principals David
Breazzano, Daniel Harmetz, and Mencher left Fidelity Investments,
which decided the high profile of hard-nosed vulture investing
didn't fit with the Boston mutual fund giant's corporate image.
Smith &AMP; Hawken will be DDJ's largest retail gamble since it bought
hundreds of millions of dollars of debt owed by the bankrupt R.H.
Macy &AMP; Co. for Fidelity (Harmetz is no longer at DDJ).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to like Smith &AMP; Hawken's business, which is based
in California. Unfortunately, it has been owned by CML, which
sucked up cash like a Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   DDJ already had $70 million of loans outstanding to CML when it
teamed up with the Wisconsin Investment Board, which had loaned the
company another $20 million, to make a joint bankruptcy bid for
Smith &AMP; Hawken.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, DDJ money didn't come cheap when it became a lender to
CML last summer. CML was losing millions and its Nordic Track unit
was starting to look like a money pit.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston Corp. and a partner, Rothschild Inc., had loaned $50
million to CML in the first step of what could be a two-stage
lending agreement, with more money expected. On the other hand, the
original loan actually matured in midsummer. Instead of advancing
more cash, BankBoston and Rothschild could demand their $50 million
back, and perhaps they would have.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: DDJ took over the entire loan and advanced another
$15 million to CML. The price: interest at 4 percent over the prime
rate, plus points like you might pay for a home mortgage and a 19
percent equity stake in CML, not to mention every piece of
collatoral the company could muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they turned Nordic Track around, we were going to make
money because the stock would be worth something,'' said Mencher.
``If it was unsuccessful, then our backup position was that we were
protected by the value of Smith &AMP; Hawken.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fall, investment bankers at BancBoston Robertson Stephens
had been hired to find ways of raising capital for Smith &AMP; Hawken.
At least 20 to 25 of the most likely big investors were contacted
but all were scared off by the debt levels of CML, according to
Joseph Pelligrini, the investment banker working on Smith &AMP; Hawken.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Track turnaround never happened and that subsidiary
filed for bankruptcy protection in November. CML followed suit a
month later.
</P>
<P>
   CML executives said they wanted to sell Smith &AMP; Hawken quickly
because it was already being hurt by the financial drag of its
parent company. Smith &AMP; Hawken also needed access to new credit by
the end of February to build inventory for its crucial May-July
selling season.
</P>
<P>
   The auction process opened by the end of December with a
deadline six weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if Smith &AMP; Hawken had been kept under wraps and
then suddenly and unexpectedly been put through a process in a
short period of time,'' said John Pound, the chief executive of
CML. ``It was set up from the get-go to facilitate quick due
diligence from serious parties.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 70 potential bidders reviewed initial due diligence
material and 10 of them went to California for an on-site look.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions: CML was only accepting ``no-out'' bids,
meaning a potential buyer couldn't back out because it discovered
problems later or failed to get financing at prices it expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear was that in the event things were not as advertised,
you wouldn't have any recourse,'' said Majoros of Wasserstein
Perella. ``It's at least conceivable we could have paid more. Had
they opened up the process for one more month, I think Smith &AMP;
Hawken would have been just as valuable and its customer
relationships preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein Perella had been one of the prospects that received
initial information but did not go to California to visit Smith &AMP;
Hawken, according to Pound.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sale to DDJ is expected to close within weeks, and
Mencher said her firm was reviewing whether Smith &AMP; Hawken required
more money to stock up for its prime gardening season. She said DDJ
might seek an additional Smith &AMP; Hawken investor to put up new
capital.

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-KOSOVO _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is meeting
Friday with French President Jacques Chirac and expected to discuss
the tense ongoing negotiations between Serbs and Albanians over the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. The United States, which already
has committed some 2,000 troops to the region, has issued a warning
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that unless a deal is done
by noon (Paris time), 6 a.m. EST, on Saturday, U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes on Serb targets could begin within 24 hours. Developing.

   INDONESIA-EASTTIMOR _ LIQUICA, Indonesia _ Ragged coffee farmers
in this disputed territory of East Timor are battling with bows and
arrows, while teachers and doctors are packing to flee out of fear
of chaos. ``All of us are in danger,'' said Gregory N.M. Dos
Santos, who this week gave harbor in his home to five skinny,
glassy-eyed warriors who had escaped nearby fighting. Two of them
were 12 years old. They share his sentiment that East Timor must
gain independence from Indonesia, and this is the issue that has
sparked the escalation of violence. The 800,000 people of this
jungle-covered half-island, a colonial remnant still suffering deep
poverty and feudal polarization, suddenly have been offered the
choice to remain a part of Indonesia or to become independent. They
are almost certain to opt for independence, a status for which East
Timor is unprepared and which risks throwing them back to a
fruitless and anarchic past. (Kunstel-Albright, Cox News Service).

through hours of graphic testimony, but jurors in the dragging
death trial have already divulged to the court their horror at the
crime. ``Horrible,'' said one. ``I was sickened by it,'' said
another. The 12 men and women chosen to hear the case reacted much
like the nation. And in many respects, they are like your next-door
neighbors. They watch Wheel of Fortune and Walker, Texas Ranger,
they believe honesty is the most important value to impart to
children and their personal heroes are their spouses and others
close to them. A portrait of a jury, based on testimony and their
responses to questionnaires. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have looked in all of our manuals that came with the
computer and cannot find info about how to clean the mouse. It
seems to be dragging a bit and is one year old. Could it possibly
need to be replaced?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably just need to clean it, which is a fairly simple
task.
</P>
<P>
   A mouse uses a small rubber ball that sticks out of the bottom
of the case; this ball is in contact with a series of rollers
inside the case. As a mouse rolls around, the rollers sense the
ball's motion and communicate that to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   As it moves, a mouse picks up dust, crumbs, cat hair, etc., even
if it's on a mouse pad. You need to clean this out from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   Turn your mouse over and look at the bottom of its case. You'll
see where the mouse ball sticks out, and it's surrounded on most
mice by a plastic ring. Turn the ring counterclockwise and it
should come off.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mouse ball. Take an ordinary household cleaner _ I
like to use Windex _ and spray the mouse ball. Dry it well with a
lint-free cloth and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a can of compressed air and blow out the inside of the
mouse case. (If you don't have a can of compressed air, get one at
any office supply or computer store. You'll also need it to blow
out the dust that gathers inside your computer's case, something
you should do every six months or so.)
</P>
<P>
   Put the mouse ball back in place and secure it with the plastic
ring. Your mouse should work fine now.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a chance it might not. If it's still sluggish,
try replacing the mouse pad. The surface of a mouse pad can wear
smooth, which provides less friction.
</P>
<P>
   If it's still sluggish, check the connection to the computer. If
you have a cordless mouse, check the battery. If it remains
unresponsive, it may be time for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had tried Disk Defragmenter on my computer a couple months
ago without any problem, but when I tried it yesterday, my computer
froze at 10 percent complete. I reset my computer, turned off the
screen saver and tried it again, but it did the same thing. There
were no virus scanners in the background and no other program
running. What can I do next to accomplish the task? My computer is
a Compaq, Pentium II, 333-megahertz and using Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer to this can be found at the Microsoft Knowledge
Base at support.microsoft.com, in article
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q186/9/78.asp. But here's
the summary:
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you weren't patient enough. Windows 98 has a
different way of defragmenting a hard drive than Windows 95, and
part of the process slows the computer down to the point that it
appears not to be responding.
</P>
<P>
   With a traditional disk-defragmentation process, the files on
the computer are placed sequentially, one after the other, so there
are no gaps in between. But with Windows 98, the operating system
arranges your files so that the most-used items are placed on the
fastest part of the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Windows keeps a series of logs showing which
programs you use most. It then reads these logs and rearranges the
files accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   This takes some time, causing the process to appear to ``hang''
at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Your best fix _ go get a cup of coffee, take a jog around the
block or call an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The more you use the computer, the more extensive these log
files become. That's why your first defrag effort went quickly, and
the next one seemed to hang up.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to use the Norton Utilities' Speed Disk, which
does the same thing but much faster.
</P>

HOW TO GET KINDER, SIMPLER OPERATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent column on the hazards and frustrations of using
programs that run in the background in Windows 95/98 struck a
nerve. I was flooded with e-mail from readers who either had
experienced problems firsthand, or who now had suspects to blame
for some of their woes.
</P>
<P>
   The column looked at the tradeoffs of using utility programs
that work in the background in Windows, including virus scanners,
crash protectors and installation monitors. I ran Symantec's System
Works _ which includes all these things _ for about a month, then
turned off the background components for another month. The result
was a faster, more stable system without all the bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma, of course, is that if you shut down these
components, you don't get their benefits. If you sacrifice the use
of a background virus scanner for the sake of improved performance
and fewer software conflicts, you must be willing to manually scan
all programs and some documents that are introduced on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to the Symantec products. Every
virus checker comes with an in-the-background component. And most
personal computers sold at retail are loaded down with background
components that do everything from controlling special keyboard
buttons to looking for patches and updates via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SACRIFICE BACKGROUND PROGRAMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many readers appreciated my comments, but had an additional
question: ``So, um ... how exactly do I identify and disable these
things?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's no easy answer here. Each program handles
it differently. But there are some general places you can look and
strategies you can employ.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a feel for how much is running in the background by
doing a ``three-fingered salute'' _ hold down the Control, Alt and
Delete keys at the same time. This will bring up a box that will
show you just what's running on your system. The identity of some
entries, such as Explorer, will be obvious. Others, such as systray
(or system tray, the area on the taskbar that contains the clock),
will not be so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the End Task button here will abruptly shut down the
program you've highlighted. However, the program will come right
back the next time you start your computer. What you need to do is
figure out which programs you don't want to run at start-up and
configure them so they do not.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's time for a very important caveat: If you don't know
what something is, don't mess with it. Every time you turn off a
background application, you are losing some functions, and shutting
down the wrong thing could be irritating at best and disastrous at
worst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAN'T GO WRONG WITH RESEARCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, read any manuals or help files you may have for the kind
of programs that might have background components. The manuals will
discuss the software's different components and how to configure
them. Usually this will be through some kind of configuration
utility or control panel you can access through a program's primary
component. Find these main components under Start/Programs.
</P>
<P>
   Next, look in the Windows 95/98 system tray. The tray is the
area to the far right of the taskbar _ it typically includes the
clock and some icons, such as a speaker. Many background programs
place an icon in the tray. First, try right-clicking on it. You're
likely to get a menu, or a control panel might launch.
Double-clicking it also may bring up a control panel.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Norton AntiVirus 5.0, right-clicking on its tray
icon brings up a menu that includes the items ``Disable
Auto-Protect'' and ``Configure Norton AntiVirus.'' Clicking on the
former will disable its background activities, but it will remain
loaded and in system memory. If you choose the latter, you will get
a control panel that lets you completely unload Auto-Protect, and
it won't launch the next time you start your computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you use McAfee VirusScan 4.0, right-clicking on its tray icon
also will bring up either a menu that lets you disable or enable
different components, or a full control panel that lets you unload
the module altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs are even easier to prevent from loading when a PC
boots up. They launch by putting an icon in the Startup folder, and
preventing this is as simple as moving the icon out of the folder.
</P>
<P>
   To see what's in Startup, right-click on the Start button and
choose Explore from the menu that appears. Open the Programs
folder, then go to the Startup folder and look inside. Some
examples: if you have Microsoft Office, you'll find some icons
there that speed up its launch time; if you've got Norton
Utilities, the System Doctor places an icon here.
</P>
<P>
   Create a new folder on your desktop (right-click on the desktop,
choose New, the Folder) and name it ``From Startup.'' Drag the
icons of the programs you don't want to launch from the Startup
folder and onto this new folder. Restart your computer, and the
programs won't be running. If you want to run them manually, launch
them from the new folder on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Some older programs may launch background components using a
line in the WIN.INI file, a legacy from the old MS-DOS/Windows 3.1
days. You can check here by using Sysedit, a configuration file
editing utility. Click Start, then enter sysedit and click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Find the WIN.INI file and look for a line that starts either
LOAD or RUN. If there is a program here you don't want to run at
start- &QL; 
up, place your cursor in front of the filename, hit the Enter key,
then place a semicolon in front of the filename on its own line.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs are harder to track down. They launch via the
Windows Registry, the big database of settings in Windows 95/98. If
you have Windows 98, you're in luck _ it has a nifty feature called
the System Configuration Utility that lets you turn on and off
anything that runs at start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, then System
Information. Go to the Tools menu item and click on System
Configuration Utility, then click the Startup tab.
</P>
<P>
   From here, turning components on and off is a matter of clicking
a check box. You also can use the System Configuration Utility to
edit WIN.INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT and other configuration files. To me,
this application alone is worth the price of upgrading to Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   Again, let me emphasize that if you are unsure about making any
of these changes, then don't make them. There's no sense killing or
maiming your computer in a neurotic hunt for any and all background
applications.

   Disintegration: Microsoft Corp. is spending a lot of money
defending itself against antitrust allegations in federal court.
The government contends that, among other things, Microsoft went
out of its way to do harm to Netscape Communications by giving its
Internet Explorer browser away and including it as part of Windows.
Microsoft has insisted that pulling its browser out of the Windows
98 operating system _ which uses the browser as a desktop interface
_ would cripple the system. But someone had better show Microsoft's
legal team the 98lite Web site at www.98lite.net. Here you can
download a program that purports to strip Internet Explorer 4 and
its components from Windows 98, then replace it with the original
Explorer from Windows 95. Programmer Shane Brooks has written some
software that removes IE4's files, folders and Registry entries,
then asks users to insert a Windows 95 CD, from which the necessary
Windows 95 components are extracted. 98lite lets you remove IE4
altogether, or just remove the desktop integration and keep IE4 as
a browser. He claims _ and user comments on an included message
board back him up _ that the result is a faster, more responsive
operating system that still has all the other benefits of Windows
98, including its improved stability. There are some known problems
in doing this, and Brooks is upfront about it on the site.

   _ Find the fun: The number of specialized search engines that
focus on one particular topic is growing by leaps and bounds. As
the Internet and its World Wide Web become a part of everyday life,
it makes sense to seek out a specialist when you're looking for
specific information. GameSpyder at www.gamespyder.com is one of
this new breed of search engine, devoted entirely to computer
games. Although it's a product of GameSpy Industries _ the company
that brought you GameSpy, which helps find 3-D, multiplayer game
servers on the Net _ it deals with all kinds of game sites,
including sports, simulation, strategy, adventure, classic games,
role-playing and, of course, first-person shooters. You can browse
the listings Yahoo-style, with a directory, or use the search
feature. It's a great place to find cheat codes, walkthroughs,
reviews and screen shots.

   _ All politics are local: A ``wonk'' is defined as someone who
takes great joy out of analyzing and possibly even crafting
government policy. What doubles as Sominex for most of us turns
these folks on with a vengeance. Chances are, serious wonks are
going to love Stateline.org at www.stateline.org, a Web site
devoted to politics and government at the state level. Billed as
``your source for news on state policy innovation,'' it looks at
breaking government news in individual states that normally doesn't
receive national publicity. For example, did you know that
Michigan's legislature is on the verge of passing a law mandating
drug tests for all welfare recipients? Or that Florida's governor
has berated the state's graduation rate as ``lousy''? Or that the
Milwaukee school board has approved a plan to give free laptop
computers to 24,000 high school students? The site generates its
own stories, as well as providing links to government-related
articles in daily newspapers and journals.
</P>
<P>
   _ A thousand words: Cheese Magazine at www.cheesemagazine.com
has nothing to do with dairy products or Wisconsin residents.
Despite its name, this is a showcase for amateur photographers. In
the intro, site operator Tim Kitchen explains why it's for amateurs
only: ``We believe that you don't have to be a photographer to be a
photographer and that sharing pictures bonds people together.''
Cheese takes the pictures it receives and then groups them to make
statements about life. It's very tastefully done. Prospective Web
site developers should check it out as an example of clean,
tasteful page layout.

   _ Morning toons: Saturday morning cartoons have been an American
cultural fixture since the 1950s, and millions of adults have fond
memories of the hours spent in front of the TV watching them. At
Yesterdayland at www.yesterdayland.com, you can literally browse
through your childhood, as one visitor to the site put it. Remember
``Roger Ramjet,'' circa 1965? Or ``Fireball XL-5,'' from the
mid-1960s? The ``Dudley Do-Right'' show, from 1969-70? Or ``The
Electric Company,'' from the early 1970s? You can search for
specific shows, or browse through individual decades, then call up
a synopsis and information about the show's production.

   _ Better mail: CompuServe has updated its mail capabilities to
allow for new features and a better display of mail. The new mail
client features better file attachment handling, including the

   MESQUITE, Texas _ In 1994, id Software's office in this suburb
northeast of Dallas was not a place for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, the game company's employees and owners would
fire up the latest version of Doom for a game of death-match,
supposedly to test the latest round of code. In the heat of virtual
battle, they'd scream epithets that would make a sailor blush.
</P>
<P>
   A large open space had room for pool and ping-pong tables. Level
designers' stereos blared heavy metal music. And co-founder John
Romero's door had a hole hacked in it, the result of an encounter
with a medieval battle-ax.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, a work space only twenty-something computer
game developers could love.
</P>
<P>
   Today, id Software still occupies the same offices _ though
they've expanded to take up more of the sixth floor in the Town
East Tower office building _ but it's a different environment.
</P>
<P>
   The offices where its employees work are almost hushed. Gone are
the pool and ping-pong tables, replaced by a set of free weights
and a boxer's punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor can still hear music, but it's muted.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's time for a round of death-match to test the
upcoming Quake III Arena, there's a lot less profanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone's just grown up,'' said Katherine Anna Kang,
id's director of business development and an ace death-match
player.
</P>
<P>
   The company's corporate culture now mirrors the personality of
John Carmack, the genius 3-D programmer who co-founded id and who
remains the soul of its creative efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After Quake I was completed in 1996, id saw an exodus of some of
its original team, including co-founders Romero and Jay Wilbur, the
company's original ``Biz Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero, known as much for his waist-length hair and rock-star
style as for his ability to design killer game levels, left the
company after Quake was released. He now co-owns Ion Storm, a
Dallas game company that aggressively seeks publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, Romero had the most powerful personality in the
company, and id was viewed by the public through Romero's
persona,'' said Todd Hollenshead, id's chief executive and Wilbur's
replacement. ``But John Carmack is not that sort of a person. When
the people changed, the dominating personalities changed. As a
result, id became more reserved, and that took over the apparent
culture of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, where the old id sought publicity, the company now
avoids it. In-person interviews are rarely granted, photographers
are seldom allowed in id's offices and Carmack doesn't release his
photo for publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one here is interested is being the poster boy for the
company,'' said Carmack, adding that he intensely dislikes what's
necessary to promote a game. He concedes that getting out in front
of the public is going to be more important with Quake III Arena,
because it represents a departure from id's past titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish this was the kind of a world where I just do my
work, we'd put out the game and everyone would just get it,'' he
said.

   .......................
</P>
<P>
   At International World Wrestling, I, Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,
was the headliner, Mr. Magnificent, the Boss Man.
</P>
<P>
   I brought wrestling into the modern age.
</P>
<P>
   I was the one who introduced rock 'n' roll. I was the first to
use loops of accordion wire in place of ropes. I was the one who
introduced pyrotechnics. A flaming genius!
</P>
<P>
   Every night it was a Ring of Fire!
</P>
<P>
   I was the first to employ sweat-seeking cruise missiles in the
ring. The first to use explosives: We liked to have one wrestler
throw another in a Dumpster and blow it up. Our slogan was ``Come
See Extreme Wrestling _ No Children Under 6 _ Not for the Squeamish
_ Don't Wear Your Good Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The blood flowed, the monster truck roared, the ring burst into
flames and the fans went away happy. I was sitting on top of the
world, earning millions, getting a million hits a day at
jimmybigboy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling gets hard when you pass 40, though. Your back hurts
from lifting 300-pound guys and heaving them into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   One night in the Boston Garden, Hump Hooley and I fought a
marathon tag-team match against the Messenger of Death and Mr.
Disaster, a real shorts-scorcher involving quarts of blood,
thousands of vampire bats, a pack of rabid wolves, six suicide
bombers from Hamas and 12 Tomahawk missiles, and in the finale I
hoisted the Messenger over my head and heaved him into the
turnbuckle, only to have him ignite a moat of gasoline around the
ring, and I passed out from the fumes and lay unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were licking at my feet, death seemed near at hand _
and then pain awakened me!
</P>
<P>
   I leapt up and called in an air strike on myself! The cruise
missiles came straight at me! Smoke and flames! Utter confusion!
And when the smoke cleared, there was a heap of ashes in the middle
of the burning ring where I had been!
</P>
<P>
   The crowd screamed: ``No! No! Not Big Boy!'' And then I jumped
up and brushed the ashes away and Old Glory descended from the
rafters and I took hold of a corner and was lifted to safety as the
ring exploded and burned.
</P>
<P>
   When the match was done, I lay on the dressing-room floor, too
tired to shower. The Messenger of Death brought me a beer and Hump
helped me into a chair.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at myself in a mirror and was shocked at the grayness
and blankness of me, the fatuous look in the eyes, as if I were on
powerful medications. Or else, as if I wasn't and should be. I
looked like a snake that had swallowed a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loved the flag bit,'' Hump said. ``Write that into the act
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Boys, I believe I need a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the morning I went to a doctor who diagnosed a nasty case of
testosterone poisoning. The pills I took to keep my energy up were
causing a metabolic vasodilatation of the nerve endings. I was
getting numb above the neck.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One night in Dallas, a man waiting for me in the dressing room
stood as I entered and extended his hand: ``Jimmy, I am Earl
Woofner, the chairman of the Ethical Party of Minnesota. And I've
come a thousand miles to say that our state needs a man like you.''
</P>
<P>
   My skull glittered with sweat, my pink tights were spattered
with blood and I was wearing a peacock-feather headdress, cobalt
blue shades and a cape with 600 flashing light bulbs. Plus, a
python named Virg draped around my neck. Earl did not flinch.
</P>
<P>
   He set down his briefcase and sat on a bench and looked up at me
with utter sincerity and said: ``The people of Minnesota are crying
out for a champion to break the liberal choke hold and open up
politics to common sense and honesty. And I am looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   I took off the glasses and set down the snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about it, Jimmy?'' he said. ``The troops are ready. When
do we get the order to march?''
</P>
<P>
   By rights I should be a Democrat, because I am for the little
guy, but the Democrats are run by yuppie liberals trying to remake
American society into a day-care center for adults. Making folks
stand outdoors to smoke a cigarette. Making a teacher fill out a
14-page questionnaire if she says boo to a kid. Labels on beer cans
warning that alcohol is not good for your health and may cause you
to fall down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats started out with the New Deal, a good idea for its
time, and then delusions of grandeur led them to keep adding on to
it, like a guy who sets out to make carbonara sauce and starts
throwing sausage and peppers and onions in, and pretty soon you've
got peas and anchovies and pineapple swimming around in it and the
thyme and oregano are at toxic levels and nobody is hungry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Democratic platform. Programs for everything _
programs to combat grumpiness, stupidity, discrimination,
covetousness, improper lane changes, low math scores, flat beer,
poor taste and too much air in the Cracker Jack box, and all of the
programs require battalions of social workers and reams of paper.
</P>
<P>
   So I look to the Republicans, and what do I see? The Me First
Party: Squeeze the maximum profit out of everything, strip it
clean, gouge what you can, clear-cut the forest, to hell with
everybody else _ lay off the 20-year guys and hire cheap
replacements, cut costs, inflate the stock, sell out, make your
pile, leave town, head for your compound in Palm Springs, buy an
electronic security system and a team of Rottweilers, sit around
the swimming pool, enjoy your brains out and feel no more remorse
than a fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought, What the heck, why not the Ethical Party, a grab
bag of bikers and bird-watchers and disgruntled dishwashers and
surly seniors and people who call in to talk shows to gripe about
the mailman.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was May 1998. I took a week off from the I.W.W. tour and got
in my Porsche with the ``Mess With the Best, Die With the Rest''
bumper sticker and took a run around Minnesota to think about the
governorship.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the gravel roads, where you can make time, roads that
would shake your fillings out at 30, but at 140 you fly over the
bumps like melted butter. From Moorhead to Worthington, on some of
those straight stretches, I held it at 200 for a while. I think
better when I'm moving fast.
</P>
<P>
   I cruised the state and I pondered the future.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the country, farmers were in hock and going broke, having
bought fancy combines at 20 percent interest, and now the price of
corn was bottoming out and the loans were coming due. In the
cities, the factories had gone south and the old factory buildings
were turned into restaurants serving lamb chops the size of
chickadees, plus an artichoke and a small red potato, for $30.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a picture of a candidate for the Democratic nomination for
governor, eating tofu at a fund-raiser and wearing a T-shirt that
said ``I Really Could Use a Hug Right Now.'' And a picture of a
Republican hopeful dedicating a milk-producing plant where 40,000
genetically engineered Holsteins, heavily sedated and lying on
canvas slings and fed with stomach tubes, could produce 2 million
gallons per day.
</P>
<P>
   I called Earl Woofner. ``I can't do it,'' I said. ``I am not a
politician. I don't have the stomach for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is your strong suit, your honest independent nature,'' he
said. ``Sleep on it. Call me tomorrow. The brochure is at the
printer's, ready to go. The 'Jimmy for Governor' beer is bottled,
all we have to do is slap on the labels.''
</P>
<P>
   That morning, as I often do when I'm on the road and have an
extra minute, I dropped by the local hospital to visit children,
and as it happened, there was one, a 12-year-old boy named Tommy,
who had lost his left hand in a corn picker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Boy,'' he said, ``how can I grow up to become a wrestler
without a left hand?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him: ``You can be anybody you want to be. Don't ever give
up. And it would be a great gimmick. Tommy (the Talon) Anderson.
Jump in the ring with your eagle-feather headdress and clack your
prosthetic device and get the audience to chant, 'He fought the
claw and the claw won.'''
</P>
<P>
   He was a chipper little guy, and he looked up at me and said,
``How did you become what you wanted to be, Big Boy?''
</P>
<P>
   And I was about to say, ``By sheer determination and
imagination,'' and then I thought: ``Hey, I'm not there yet. I want
to be governor. For once in my life, I want to be taken
seriously.'' And I looked down at his freckled face on the pillow
and said, ``Tommy, I came here to help you out, and instead you
helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   I called my wife, Lacy, and told her I had decided to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   There was a long breath of a pause, and she said: ``Fine, but I
don't campaign. I don't do the candidate's wife thing at all. No
fund-raisers, so don't even ask.'' I understood, I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you doing this?'' she asked. I said I was tired of
people making fun of me for wearing pink-feather boas.
</P>
<P>
   Felix, my promoter, offered to manage my campaign. Felix is a
hatchet-faced little guy with a toupee that looks like a raccoon
that got crushed by a semi. He favors livid green-plaid sport coats
and is very sallow and liverish looking, all splotches and rheum
and exploded capillaries, a stub of a cigarette smoldering on his
lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thanks,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I put on my Australian bush hat, my running shoes and my
``Gopher It'' T-shirt, and for five months I rode around Minnesota
in a motor home, green, the interior a soft beige that reminded me
of the inner thighs of a woman I met once in Miami, and lived on
Cheez Doodles, Ho Hos and root beer, which gave me so much gas I
could hardly keep my socks up. I addressed every Kiwanis Club,
Elks, Moose, Jaycees, Sons of Norway, Knights of Columbus, V.F.W.
and Eastern Star that cared to hear me and roamed the coffee shops
and Kmarts, handing out literature, pressing the flesh, chewing the
fat.
</P>
<P>
   I told the people: ``I am not a joke, I am a decent clean person
you could bring home and not be embarrassed by. Yes, I wore a pink
boa and gave flying mules and nipple lifts and atomic handshakes,
and will employ them against the Special Interests. I am no smarter
than anybody else and I don't claim to have all the answers, but it
ain't nuclear physics and I will work hard and accept no special
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   And what I don't know about state government, I'll know a month
after I take office.''
</P>
<P>
   My platform was exactly as follows:
</P>
<P>
   1. I will not tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   2. I make no promise except to do my best.
</P>
<P>
   3. Any tax surplus goes straight back to you, the folks.
</P>
<P>
   4. I will scorn Big Business and Special Interests in favor of
you, the taxpayer and voter. The trough is closed.
</P>
<P>
   5. There will be action, not just a lot of yik-yakking.
</P>
<P>
   6. No weenies need apply.
</P>
<P>
   7. Let's party.
</P>
<P>
   I destroyed my opponents in the televised debates. I hung them
out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   The weaselly Democrat talked about government needing to create
jobs. I said: ``There used to be a country for people like you, but
it doesn't exist anymore. Its capital was Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   He whimpered and looked toward the corner of the studio, where
his advisers and pollsters were standing, holding his cue cards.
They were helpless to save him.
</P>
<P>
   The Wepublican was a scrawny runt with one wet finger in the
wind who used the word ``family'' in every sentence, as if this
might win him an Amana gas range, and said he favored social
welfare programs if they ``strengthened the family.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``If a person is smart enough to live in Minnesota, then
he is smart enough to take care of his own self and not look around
for a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else dared to say it plain like that.
</P>
<P>
   And in gratitude, the people of Minnesota put me in the
governor's office.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was sworn in on Mon., Jan. 4, and the national press was
fawning all over me. Newsweek, Time, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore phoned that morning and wished me luck. ``Thanks, Al,''
I said. ``See you in Iowa.'' He had a coughing fit.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to whipping the pants off Gore, that Cigar Store
Indian, in New Hampshire and Iowa. Al will be the 10-to-1 favorite,
and when he falls he will crumble. When he garners 18 percent of
the vote in New Hampshire, compared with 52 percent for the
300-pound candidate with the big pink noggin, I am going to enjoy
watching him go on TV to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Al will wind up running the Ford Foundation and I will be a
president you can be proud of and land in Air Force One and inspect
honor guards and do my duty, and none of that groping in the West
Wing _ I will do mine upstairs in the First Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Inauguration Day 2001 keeps me toasty warm on
these cold winter nights.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be sitting ramrod-straight in my seat on the flag-draped
platform before the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., dressed in my
black suit and Led Zeppelin T-shirt, a big wad of Copenhagen in my
cheek. On the back of my big bare head I'll feel, like dancing
snowflakes, the cold glares from all the big bonzos in the seats
behind me and I'll smile my Big Boy smile to the cameras on the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   I'll stand and raise my right hand and place my left hand with
the World Tag-Team Champion gold ring on the third finger upon the
Holy Bible held by my foxy wife, Lacy, and look Chief Justice Billy
(the Robe) Rehnquist straight in his black cobra eyes and vow to
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States
and then turn to give Lacy a smooch and hug my daughter, Tiffany,
and my son, Adrian, and shake hands with Bill and Hillary and
squeeze Al Gore's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll bear down a little until his eyes water and he looks
queasy, and say, ``Tough luck, buddy boy,'' and hold my arms up so
that my supporters out in the cheap seats can see me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll cock my ear to that distant cry of ``Jimm-ee, Jimm-ee,
Jimm-ee!'' _ and turn to go to the limo and look up and see every
senator and congressman and justice and ex-president and ambassador
standing, mouth open, in shock and confusion, as if they had just
witnessed the explosion of the Hindenberg, wondering: ``How did
this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   It's called democracy, boys.

 By SUSAN BOLOTIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We all know them, if only by caricature. The parents who devote
hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The
children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The
parents whose phone conversations are really interruptions
interrupted by conversation. The children who won't do their
homework unless their parents are nearby. The parents who intervene
on their children's behalf whenever a teacher delivers a bad grade,
a rebuke, a punishment. The children so incapable of dealing with
frustration they explode in rage whenever something goes any way
other than theirs. The children who think of no one but themselves.
The parents who think of no one but their children.
 &HT;    These are the parents, and these are the children, whom John
Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric.
 &HT;    Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often
Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the
expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute
with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training.
 &HT;    But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars
hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (``Train them by 2!'')
was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional
article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in
about 150 newspapers.
 &HT;    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of
discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a
bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site.
And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million
copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each
of the last two years.
 &HT;    There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ``take it
home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs
being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ``news''
segments to be marketed to television stations.
 &HT;    In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with
Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you
will, in his words, ``fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids,
things will never be the same!' ``
 &HT;    It wasn't a cruise, but they came mostly two by two, as hopeful
of salvation as the animals to Noah _ young married couples, women
walking with the shared gait of friends. They came by the hundreds,
up the steps to Wichita's Century II Convention Center.
 &HT;    They came with the purposefulness of disciples, ready to receive
the wisdom being handed out that day. And they were not
disappointed.
 &HT;    Though Rosemond's posture is stooped _ think John Lithgow on a
bad-back day _ his manner is straightforward, unambivalent. Part of
that authority must come from familiarity with his material. Not
only does he repeat three basic talks hundreds of times a year, but
he also uses the same anecdotes in his shows that he uses in book
after book.
 &HT;    ``Are you the kind of parents who tell your kids to pick up
their toys and then leave the room?'' Rosemond asked. ``Or are you
the sort who wants to have a warm and fuzzy relationship going with
the kid?'' His disdain turned to parodic soprano: ``I know, let's
make a game of picking up the toys. The person who gets the most
will get a bowl of ice cream after supper.'''
 &HT;    Rosemond moved on. ``If you punish your child,'' he advised,
``he will hate you. He won't talk to you for three days.'' Beat.
``It's a blessing. Take a vacation.''
 &HT;    The crowd laughed and clapped. They felt ``empowered'' _ a word
I heard to this side of nausea _ by Rosemond. He may have been
telling them they were jerks, but he was also telling them that
they could change. They could realize that rearing kids is ``a
no-brainer.'' They could learn to ignore the ``mental-health
professionals who have convinced us, with the assistance of the
media, that we were all raised in pathological, dysfunctional
families.''
 &HT;    They could forget everything they've ever heard about building
self-esteem in children. They could see their children as ``direct
descendants of Adam and Eve'' and, as such, ``inclined to
mischief.'' They could start confronting their children every time
they misbehaved, and then they could punish them. They could put
their marriage at the center of the family. They could stop
worrying about their relationships with their children and accept
the challenge of leadership. They could make their children happy
by making them well behaved.
 &HT;    Rosemond has not always thought such thoughts; indeed, the story
of his transformation is proof that there really is no conservative
like an ex-drug-taking, rock 'n' roll-playing liberal.
 &HT;    This is how he tells it: His parents divorced when he was 3;
when he was 7, his mother remarried, to an older man who moved the
family from Charleston, S.C., to Chicago. The marriage was marked
by violence, first verbal, then physical. (``I wasn't traumatized
by it, just scared to death.'') His stepfather believed all
emotions should be kept under wraps.
 &HT;    When Rosemond was 15, he went to live in Georgia with his
father, a golf pro, who gave him his own apartment. (``This was not
good for me.'') He finished his high-school years in Chicago. (``My
mother moved into her own room with a bolt lock and her own
refrigerator.'') He then went to Western Illinois University, where
he eventually received his master's degree in psychology.
 &HT;    While there, he played in a rock band. He did a lot of drugs. He
sported red hair down to his shoulders and a fatigue jacket with a
flag sewn upside-down on the back. But after he was married _ he
was 20; his bride, Willie Herman, was 19 _ it was time to get a
job, at a community-health center in the mountains of North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Their son, Eric, was born in 1969. At first, John and Willie
followed the advice of the ``nouveau parenting experts'' they
despise these days. But their son's rambunctiousness and Willie's
second pregnancy (Amy, their second child, is now 26) combined to
make them reconsider. ``Eric's behaviors were going to destroy our
relationship,'' Willie recalls.
 &HT;    The Rosemonds came to understand that Eric needed discipline of
the old-fashioned kind, and the conversion began.
 &HT;    (``This is Eric,'' Rosemond says, introducing me to his son.
``His career,'' Eric adds, laughing.)
 &HT;    As Rosemond's attitudes toward child rearing solidified, his
politics turned toward the right. These days he cannot abide
no-fault divorce; homosexual parenting; Selma Fraiberg's ``The
Magic Years''; sex-education programs; Thomas Gordon's Parent
Effectiveness Training program; homework planners (``a source of
codependency'' between the overinvolved parent and the
irresponsible child); single parenthood by choice; the inclusion of
spanking in definitions of child abuse; TV; and Hillary Clinton and
Marian Wright Edelman (``ultraliberals, leftists, socialists'').
 &HT;    The Rosemonds' home in Gastonia is Country Living perfect _
sampler pillows, stenciled walls, racks and racks of pipes, George
Washington hanging over the fireplace. But when Eric and his wife,
Nancy, walk in with their two little boys, ready for a lovefest
with Grandpa, it takes on the aura of a stage set. The afternoon
feels rehearsed, and everyone in the cast _ including me _ knows
his or her part.
 &HT;    Eric (``I don't read the books, I don't read the articles'') is
there to scoff at Dad. ``So, do you think he seems harsh, like not
a fun person?'' he asks me right off, laughing. ``Well, I tell
people he can dole out punishment with a smile on his face.''
 &HT;    Nancy casually but firmly minds the children, while Willie
soothes any queasiness Rosemond's beliefs about women might
engender. Rosemond is the well-rehearsed pro.
 &HT;    Here he is, in nutshell version.
 &HT;    _ Parents should stop worrying about developing self-esteem in
their children. If held accountable for their behavior and allowed
to experience hardship and frustration, children will develop
self-esteem on their own. Mothers, in particular, he says, are
guilty of rushing in the minute the child begins feeling unhappy or
distressed.
 &HT;    ``If there are two words that underlie self-esteem,'' Rosemond
says, ``they are 'I can.' Well, I was in a school recently. I
walked into the boys' bathroom. Above the mirror, there was this
sign that said, 'You are now looking at the most special person in
the whole world.' This isn't self-esteem. This is narcissism.
Today's child justifies anything. Bill Clinton is a prime example.
He grew up with a single mother who told him his excrement didn't
stink.''
 &HT;    _ Spanking is fine, if done swiftly, occasionally, privately, in
anger but not in rage, with the hand, on the rear.
 &HT;    _ Attention Deficit Disorder is not genetic _ as much as parents
(who don't want to think it's their fault) and professionals (who
want to continue treatment forever) want it to be.
 &HT;    ``Every 2-year-old has ADD, because the left temporal lobe is
not sufficiently developed,'' Rosemond claims. Parents who pay
attention to their children's proper brain development _ by
shielding them from electronic media, making them focus on adult
authority figures and expecting them to finish tasks _ cause this
innate ADD to disappear.
 &HT;    _ Toilet training should occur by the age of 2; otherwise, a
child will become a spoiled brat. Here's how it's done, on the
now-famous three-to-five-day plan: ``You take their clothes off.
You put the potty where they can see it. When they have an accident
they scream, because they hate it running down their legs. Every
time you hear them screaming you put them on the potty.'' Carpet
cleaning is the final step.
 &HT;    _ Chores are essential. By their teens, children should be doing
all kitchen cleanup, most of the housework and the lion's share of
the laundry.
 &HT;    _ All disobedience, no matter how small the infraction and even
if followed by an apology, must be punished. The punishment should
be unpleasant, memorable and inflicted at a time that is convenient
for the parent.
 &HT;    Rosemond talks like this until dusk, indefatigable, cool, even
when I ask if it might be easier to get his point of view across if
he separated it from his religion (``nondenominational
Jewish-Christian,'' by his description) and his politics: ``People
need to understand that conservatives did not politicize parenting
in America, that the people who did are people like Hillary Clinton
and Marian Wright Edelman.''
 &HT;    I didn't know then that Rosemond has his eye on a possible run
for the House of Representatives, but the information wouldn't have
mattered; my role in our stage play does not include a debate about
who politicized the family, how Clinton and Edelman came to be
linked at the hip or why he's polarizing the debate.
 &HT;    It is very easy to find people willing to take on Rosemond.
According to the executive director of the North Carolina
Psychology Board, Martha N. Storie, the board investigated a
complaint brought against Rosemond in November 1987. After an
informal hearing early the next year, a reprimand was issued.
 &HT;    In September 1995, after the board received another complaint,
Rosemond voluntarily entered into a consent order, which stipulated
that a state supervisor review his columns prior to publication.
 &HT;    (Rosemond, who first told me of these incidents, says the first
complaint referred to a column in which he said there was no
evidence that putting a very young child into therapy was efficient
either in time or money; the second complaint was a response to his
advice to the family of an 18-month-old who had been sexually
abused. He told them to forgo therapy for her, since she would
never remember the incident anyway. His descriptions of the
columns, which he stands by to this day, are generally accurate.
They have been excised from the archives on his Web site.)
 &HT;    Much more recently, Grace Reef, director of intergovernmental
relations for the Children's Defense Fund, told me that Edelman has
never worked on any legislation to make spanking illegal, as
Rosemond claims, and that the CDF knows nothing about any program
that would mandate a visit to every new mother to assess her
ability to mother, as Rosemond inveighs against.
 &HT;    I'm sure I also could have found sociologists more than willing
to label his thinking on women sexist. (``Women don't want men to
be more involved, they just want them to be more at their beck and
call.'') But it seemed too easy.
 &HT;    Besides, writing Rosemond off might suggest I don't recognize
anything of my family in the ones he criticizes. I do, and have to
admit that my husband and I have recently made subtle
Rosemond-inspired shifts in our child rearing. Now when we say,
``This is our car, and we are listening to 'All Things
Considered''' _ that ultimate line in the sand _ we mean it. Our
kids, age 10 and 13, look at each other, roll their eyes and
mutter, ``Brainwashed in Kansas.''
 &HT;    The people who adhere to Rosemond's philosophy would laugh at
that _ for more than the obvious reason of our general wussiness.
Their families had once been out of control, their children more
headache than pleasure, but that's history.
 &HT;    As Amanda Riley, a mother of two from Danbury, Conn., tells me,
hearing Rosemond speak three years ago ``rocked'' her world, though
the change in parenting style was not easy at first. ``My daughter
did not get that there were consequences for bad behavior,'' Riley
recalls. ``Since then, I haven't tried anything from Rosemond that
hasn't worked. He's kind of like a religion to me. What he says is
gospel.''
 &HT;    Rosemond often asserts that all parenting advice can be broken
down into a series of aphorisms. ``I'm going to give you enough
rope to hang yourself.'' ``You paddle your own canoe.'' ``You can't
get something for nothing.''
 &HT;    But what, I wonder, about that other maxim: ``Don't hold a
grudge''?
 &HT;    And that's what troubles me most about Rosemond. I respond to
some of what he says, but not to how he says it. ``Gotcha!'' he
seems to bellow, delighting in every punishment doled out. And
while research has shown that children turn out best in families in
which parental demands are enforced, that is true only if the
punishment is not punitive. Loosey-goosey parenting may not work,
but neither does ``seeing and not hearing'' children.
 &HT;    Besides, where does the fun in rearing children get factored in?
Where is the acknowledgment that complexity is not necessarily bad?
Where is the intellectual adventure that comes from helping kids
learn to discriminate between legitimate and bogus authority?
 &HT;    My time with Rosemond has helped me develop a theory. I call it,
in homage to the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild's ``second
shift'' (the work a woman does after returning home from her paid
job), ``the third shift.'' But unlike Hochschild's work of
scholarship, my theory is based on that grand journalistic
standard: myself and a couple of friends.
 &HT;    Somewhere along the line, my female friends and I took on,
unasked, a ``third shift'' _ the job of family-happiness manager,
juggling not only lessons and games and school events and nights
out with adult friends, but everyone's emotional well-being,
articulated or not. This is a thankless and exhausting task,
particularly if it includes eradicating frustration and boredom
from children's lives while simultaneously making sure they feel
good about themselves.
 &HT;    I accepted this work, without thinking much about its
consequences, until I met Rosemond. And then it came to me like a
nightmare. He might worry I was turning my children into the Bill
Clintons of tomorrow. But I had another concern: What if I was
rearing them to be Monica Lewinskys _ young adults who don't want
jobs where hard work is expected, who turn petulant when they don't
get what they want, even when what they're looking for is their own
happiness.
 &HT;    That realization _ that your kids can't grow up unless you let
them do it for themselves _ is what I'll take away from this
Rosemondian adventure. Or, as the man says, ``You can't get
something for nothing.''

 By SUSAN BOLOTIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We all know them, if only by caricature. The parents who devote
hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The
children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The
parents whose phone conversations are really interruptions
interrupted by conversation. The children who won't do their
homework unless their parents are nearby. The parents who intervene
on their children's behalf whenever a teacher delivers a bad grade,
a rebuke, a punishment. The children so incapable of dealing with
frustration they explode in rage whenever something goes any way
other than theirs. The children who think of no one but themselves.
The parents who think of no one but their children.
 &HT;    These are the parents, and these are the children, whom John
Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric.
 &HT;    Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often
Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the
expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute
with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training.
 &HT;    But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars
hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (``Train them by 2!'')
was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional
article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in
about 150 newspapers.
 &HT;    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of
discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a
bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site.
And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million
copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each
of the last two years.
 &HT;    There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ``take it
home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs
being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ``news''
segments to be marketed to television stations.
 &HT;    In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with
Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you
will, in his words, ``fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids,
things will never be the same!' ``
 &HT;    It wasn't a cruise, but they came mostly two by two, as hopeful
of salvation as the animals to Noah _ young married couples, women
walking with the shared gait of friends. They came by the hundreds,
up the steps to Wichita's Century II Convention Center.
 &HT;    They came with the purposefulness of disciples, ready to receive
the wisdom being handed out that day. And they were not
disappointed.
 &HT;    Though Rosemond's posture is stooped _ think John Lithgow on a
bad-back day _ his manner is straightforward, unambivalent. Part of
that authority must come from familiarity with his material. Not
only does he repeat three basic talks hundreds of times a year, but
he also uses the same anecdotes in his shows that he uses in book
after book.
 &HT;    ``Are you the kind of parents who tell your kids to pick up
their toys and then leave the room?'' Rosemond asked. ``Or are you
the sort who wants to have a warm and fuzzy relationship going with
the kid?'' His disdain turned to parodic soprano: ``I know, let's
make a game of picking up the toys. The person who gets the most
will get a bowl of ice cream after supper.'''
 &HT;    Rosemond moved on. ``If you punish your child,'' he advised,
``he will hate you. He won't talk to you for three days.'' Beat.
``It's a blessing. Take a vacation.''
 &HT;    The crowd laughed and clapped. They felt ``empowered'' _ a word
I heard to this side of nausea _ by Rosemond. He may have been
telling them they were jerks, but he was also telling them that
they could change. They could realize that rearing kids is ``a
no-brainer.'' They could learn to ignore the ``mental-health
professionals who have convinced us, with the assistance of the
media, that we were all raised in pathological, dysfunctional
families.''
 &HT;    They could forget everything they've ever heard about building
self-esteem in children. They could see their children as ``direct
descendants of Adam and Eve'' and, as such, ``inclined to
mischief.'' They could start confronting their children every time
they misbehaved, and then they could punish them. They could put
their marriage at the center of the family. They could stop
worrying about their relationships with their children and accept
the challenge of leadership. They could make their children happy
by making them well behaved.
 &HT;    Rosemond has not always thought such thoughts; indeed, the story
of his transformation is proof that there really is no conservative
like an ex-drug-taking, rock 'n' roll-playing liberal.
 &HT;    This is how he tells it: His parents divorced when he was 3;
when he was 7, his mother remarried, to an older man who moved the
family from Charleston, S.C., to Chicago. The marriage was marked
by violence, first verbal, then physical. (``I wasn't traumatized
by it, just scared to death.'') His stepfather believed all
emotions should be kept under wraps.
 &HT;    When Rosemond was 15, he went to live in Georgia with his
father, a golf pro, who gave him his own apartment. (``This was not
good for me.'') He finished his high-school years in Chicago. (``My
mother moved into her own room with a bolt lock and her own
refrigerator.'') He then went to Western Illinois University, where
he eventually received his master's degree in psychology.
 &HT;    While there, he played in a rock band. He did a lot of drugs. He
sported red hair down to his shoulders and a fatigue jacket with a
flag sewn upside-down on the back. But after he was married _ he
was 20; his bride, Willie Herman, was 19 _ it was time to get a
job, at a community-health center in the mountains of North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Their son, Eric, was born in 1969. At first, John and Willie
followed the advice of the ``nouveau parenting experts'' they
despise these days. But their son's rambunctiousness and Willie's
second pregnancy (Amy, their second child, is now 26) combined to
make them reconsider. ``Eric's behaviors were going to destroy our
relationship,'' Willie recalls.
 &HT;    The Rosemonds came to understand that Eric needed discipline of
the old-fashioned kind, and the conversion began.
 &HT;    (``This is Eric,'' Rosemond says, introducing me to his son.
``His career,'' Eric adds, laughing.)
 &HT;    As Rosemond's attitudes toward child rearing solidified, his
politics turned toward the right. These days he cannot abide
no-fault divorce; homosexual parenting; Selma Fraiberg's ``The
Magic Years''; sex-education programs; Thomas Gordon's Parent
Effectiveness Training program; homework planners (``a source of
codependency'' between the overinvolved parent and the
irresponsible child); single parenthood by choice; the inclusion of
spanking in definitions of child abuse; TV; and Hillary Clinton and
Marian Wright Edelman (``ultraliberals, leftists, socialists'').
 &HT;    The Rosemonds' home in Gastonia is Country Living perfect _
sampler pillows, stenciled walls, racks and racks of pipes, George
Washington hanging over the fireplace. But when Eric and his wife,
Nancy, walk in with their two little boys, ready for a lovefest
with Grandpa, it takes on the aura of a stage set. The afternoon
feels rehearsed, and everyone in the cast _ including me _ knows
his or her part.
 &HT;    Eric (``I don't read the books, I don't read the articles'') is
there to scoff at Dad. ``So, do you think he seems harsh, like not
a fun person?'' he asks me right off, laughing. ``Well, I tell
people he can dole out punishment with a smile on his face.''
 &HT;    Nancy casually but firmly minds the children, while Willie
soothes any queasiness Rosemond's beliefs about women might
engender. Rosemond is the well-rehearsed pro.
 &HT;    Here he is, in nutshell version.
 &HT;    _ Parents should stop worrying about developing self-esteem in
their children. If held accountable for their behavior and allowed
to experience hardship and frustration, children will develop
self-esteem on their own. Mothers, in particular, he says, are
guilty of rushing in the minute the child begins feeling unhappy or
distressed.
 &HT;    ``If there are two words that underlie self-esteem,'' Rosemond
says, ``they are 'I can.' Well, I was in a school recently. I
walked into the boys' bathroom. Above the mirror, there was this
sign that said, 'You are now looking at the most special person in
the whole world.' This isn't self-esteem. This is narcissism.
Today's child justifies anything. Bill Clinton is a prime example.
He grew up with a single mother who told him his excrement didn't
stink.''
 &HT;    _ Spanking is fine, if done swiftly, occasionally, privately, in
anger but not in rage, with the hand, on the rear.
 &HT;    _ Attention Deficit Disorder is not genetic _ as much as parents
(who don't want to think it's their fault) and professionals (who
want to continue treatment forever) want it to be.
 &HT;    ``Every 2-year-old has ADD, because the left temporal lobe is
not sufficiently developed,'' Rosemond claims. Parents who pay
attention to their children's proper brain development _ by
shielding them from electronic media, making them focus on adult
authority figures and expecting them to finish tasks _ cause this
innate ADD to disappear.
 &HT;    _ Toilet training should occur by the age of 2; otherwise, a
child will become a spoiled brat. Here's how it's done, on the
now-famous three-to-five-day plan: ``You take their clothes off.
You put the potty where they can see it. When they have an accident
they scream, because they hate it running down their legs. Every
time you hear them screaming you put them on the potty.'' Carpet
cleaning is the final step.
 &HT;    _ Chores are essential. By their teens, children should be doing
all kitchen cleanup, most of the housework and the lion's share of
the laundry.
 &HT;    _ All disobedience, no matter how small the infraction and even
if followed by an apology, must be punished. The punishment should
be unpleasant, memorable and inflicted at a time that is convenient
for the parent.
 &HT;    Rosemond talks like this until dusk, indefatigable, cool, even
when I ask if it might be easier to get his point of view across if
he separated it from his religion (``nondenominational
Jewish-Christian,'' by his description) and his politics: ``People
need to understand that conservatives did not politicize parenting
in America, that the people who did are people like Hillary Clinton
and Marian Wright Edelman.''
 &HT;    I didn't know then that Rosemond has his eye on a possible run
for the House of Representatives, but the information wouldn't have
mattered; my role in our stage play does not include a debate about
who politicized the family, how Clinton and Edelman came to be
linked at the hip or why he's polarizing the debate.
 &HT;    It is very easy to find people willing to take on Rosemond.
According to the executive director of the North Carolina
Psychology Board, Martha N. Storie, the board investigated a
complaint brought against Rosemond in November 1987. After an
informal hearing early the next year, a reprimand was issued.
 &HT;    In September 1995, after the board received another complaint,
Rosemond voluntarily entered into a consent order, which stipulated
that a state supervisor review his columns prior to publication.
 &HT;    (Rosemond, who first told me of these incidents, says the first
complaint referred to a column in which he said there was no
evidence that putting a very young child into therapy was efficient
either in time or money; the second complaint was a response to his
advice to the family of an 18-month-old who had been sexually
abused. He told them to forgo therapy for her, since she would
never remember the incident anyway. His descriptions of the
columns, which he stands by to this day, are generally accurate.
They have been excised from the archives on his Web site.)
 &HT;    Much more recently, Grace Reef, director of intergovernmental
relations for the Children's Defense Fund, told me that Edelman has
never worked on any legislation to make spanking illegal, as
Rosemond claims, and that the CDF knows nothing about any program
that would mandate a visit to every new mother to assess her
ability to mother, as Rosemond inveighs against.
 &HT;    I'm sure I also could have found sociologists more than willing
to label his thinking on women sexist. (``Women don't want men to
be more involved, they just want them to be more at their beck and
call.'') But it seemed too easy.
 &HT;    Besides, writing Rosemond off might suggest I don't recognize
anything of my family in the ones he criticizes. I do, and have to
admit that my husband and I have recently made subtle
Rosemond-inspired shifts in our child rearing. Now when we say,
``This is our car, and we are listening to 'All Things
Considered''' _ that ultimate line in the sand _ we mean it. Our
kids, age 10 and 13, look at each other, roll their eyes and
mutter, ``Brainwashed in Kansas.''
 &HT;    The people who adhere to Rosemond's philosophy would laugh at
that _ for more than the obvious reason of our general wussiness.
Their families had once been out of control, their children more
headache than pleasure, but that's history.
 &HT;    As Amanda Riley, a mother of two from Danbury, Conn., tells me,
hearing Rosemond speak three years ago ``rocked'' her world, though
the change in parenting style was not easy at first. ``My daughter
did not get that there were consequences for bad behavior,'' Riley
recalls. ``Since then, I haven't tried anything from Rosemond that
hasn't worked. He's kind of like a religion to me. What he says is
gospel.''
 &HT;    Rosemond often asserts that all parenting advice can be broken
down into a series of aphorisms. ``I'm going to give you enough
rope to hang yourself.'' ``You paddle your own canoe.'' ``You can't
get something for nothing.''
 &HT;    But what, I wonder, about that other maxim: ``Don't hold a
grudge''?
 &HT;    And that's what troubles me most about Rosemond. I respond to
some of what he says, but not to how he says it. ``Gotcha!'' he
seems to bellow, delighting in every punishment doled out. And
while research has shown that children turn out best in families in
which parental demands are enforced, that is true only if the
punishment is not punitive. Loosey-goosey parenting may not work,
but neither does ``seeing and not hearing'' children.
 &HT;    Besides, where does the fun in rearing children get factored in?
Where is the acknowledgment that complexity is not necessarily bad?
Where is the intellectual adventure that comes from helping kids
learn to discriminate between legitimate and bogus authority?
 &HT;    My time with Rosemond has helped me develop a theory. I call it,
in homage to the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild's ``second
shift'' (the work a woman does after returning home from her paid
job), ``the third shift.'' But unlike Hochschild's work of
scholarship, my theory is based on that grand journalistic
standard: myself and a couple of friends.
 &HT;    Somewhere along the line, my female friends and I took on,
unasked, a ``third shift'' _ the job of family-happiness manager,
juggling not only lessons and games and school events and nights
out with adult friends, but everyone's emotional well-being,
articulated or not. This is a thankless and exhausting task,
particularly if it includes eradicating frustration and boredom
from children's lives while simultaneously making sure they feel
good about themselves.
 &HT;    I accepted this work, without thinking much about its
consequences, until I met Rosemond. And then it came to me like a
nightmare. He might worry I was turning my children into the Bill
Clintons of tomorrow. But I had another concern: What if I was
rearing them to be Monica Lewinskys _ young adults who don't want
jobs where hard work is expected, who turn petulant when they don't
get what they want, even when what they're looking for is their own
happiness.
 &HT;    That realization _ that your kids can't grow up unless you let
them do it for themselves _ is what I'll take away from this
Rosemondian adventure. Or, as the man says, ``You can't get
something for nothing.''

<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ From high above, you can spy your enemy
approaching through the fog.
</P>
<P>
   He moves quickly, but through the red mist he is only a vague
outline. You can make out the spines on his back, so you know he
cannot be human.
</P>
<P>
   You also know that he's hunting you just as intensely as you are
tracking him.
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to peer through the fog. As you get him in the sights
of your plasma gun _ and you wonder consider whether if your rocket
launcher might not be more effective _ you can hear the sounds of
other battles, in other rooms. There are explosions, grunts of
pain, even screams.
</P>
<P>
   You're about to pull the trigger, adding another kill to your
count, when you hear footsteps from behind. You try to turn, but
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Someone gives you a quick push and suddenly you are
somersaulting through open space, past the bridge, where your enemy
stands and watches you fall through the fog.
</P>
<P>
   You plummet into nothingness. All you see is blackness and now
the screams you hear, well, they are your own.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. Click your left mouse button, and you're back
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
QUAKE III: ARENA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The game is Quake III Arena from id Software, and it's the next
iteration in the kill-it-if-it-moves genre of first-person
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a big difference between this title, due about
midyear, and the previous computer games that have borne the Quake
name. There will be no slavering monsters to kill, no endangered
worlds for individual players to save _ the hallmarks that have
characterized id's games since its early titles, such as
Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, id is creating a game that focuses on what's known as
death-match play, in which the only fiend a player stalks is
another player, usually connected via the Internet. Doom, Quake and
Quake II _ along with a host of imitators _ all have this
multiplayer capability, but until now it's been secondary to the
single-player part of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that ultimately, the most addictive form of game play
is death-match,'' said Todd Hollenshead, the chief executive at id.
``But, I believe that the majority of our customers have yet to
play death-match. The majority have never gotten online.''
</P>
<P>
   Quake III Arena is a calculated risk for id, but not by much.
Game experts say that although the numbers of dedicated death-match
players are relatively few, it's this multiplayer aspect that keeps
id's titles on gamers' hard drives longer than most other games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who still plays Quake II is not playing the
single-player game; they're playing death-match,'' said Gary
Whitta, editor in chief of PC Gamer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   With Quake III Arena, the company hopes to create a breakthrough
title that entices a whole new audience to get online and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against other people, it's like a different game
every time,'' said Whitta.
</P>
<P>
   The new game will take advantage of several developments in the
home personal computer market:
</P>
<P>
   _ More powerful video cards. Most personal computers sold in the
last 18 months have graphics cards with the ability to accelerate
3-D images, which Quake III Arena will require. The market also is
flooded with aftermarket add-on and replacement cards.
</P>
<P>
   _ More people using the Internet. Online usage continues to grow
exponentially, and the No. 1 reason given for home PC purchases is
to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ A move toward home networking. With the dramatic drop in PC
prices, many homes how have two or three machines, and their owners
are starting to link them into home networks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Growing awareness of multiplayer gaming. Most games sold today
have multiplayer capabilities. Sometimes that features Internet
play, though occasionally it is confined to a computer network.
Game owners are used to seeing multiplay touted on the box, even
though they may have never tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Quake III Arena will include features aimed at both veteran
death-match players, as well as those who've never tried playing
online. Newcomers will be able to hone their death-match skills
against computer-generated opponents _ called ``bots,'' as in
software robots _ that will have varying degrees of skill.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the primary single-player aspect of the game.
Players can progress through ever-tougher opponents until they've
beaten the best of the bots. Hollenshead likens it to games such as
Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
   Once novices feel comfortable with death-match play, they'll be
able to use a simple Web page to find a server on which to compete
against others. Click on the server of choice, and the game
automatically launches and connects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is three clicks, and you're online,'' said John
Carmack, the lead programmer on the game and one of id's
co-founders.
</P>
<P>
   Carmack, working with fellow programmers John Cash and Brian
Hook, designed and programmed the game's engine, which controls the
overall look and behavior of the game. Designers Christian Antkow,
Tim Willits, Paul Jaquays and Brandon James built the levels in
which players wander. Paul Steed built and animated the models _
weapons, power-ups and players _ that populate the game. Artists
Adrian Carmack (no relation to John), Kevin Cloud and Kenneth Scott
designed the characters and created textures that are used to give
them a realistic look.
</P>
<P>
   John Carmack, who is considered the best 3-D games programmer in
the world, has given Quake III Arena a new look.
</P>
<P>
   The game is now capable of displaying curved surfaces, something
not possible in the previous Quake titles. As a result, Quake III
Arena is full of arched doorways, curving hallways, bridges and
circular windows.
</P>
<P>
   The program also is better at displaying the textures that cover
surfaces, so they don't turn into a mishmash of pixels when viewed
up close.
</P>
<P>
   The onscreen representations of players _ called player models _
are much more realistic. Rather than the cartoon-like characters in
Quake II, the models in Quake III Arena look almost like moving,
3-D photographs of real people. In fact, many of id's employees
have had their images digitized, and players may be able to pick
from ``skins'' that make them look like John Carmack, Steed or
Willits. The models also have an expanded number of moves. They can
nod their heads, bow from the waist and even do backflips.
</P>
<P>
   The game also will have fog effects that can be controlled by
the designers of each level. For example, fog can be tinted a
color, can be a certain height and have variable thickness. This
adds a new strategy to the game because players can now use the fog
to hide, then pop up and start blasting away.
</P>
<P>
   There are other graphic tricks, such as reflective surfaces and
even mirrors that move. One level features a maze with a mirrored
ceiling, allowing players a view of their opponents' location.
Walls pulsate, as though they were living.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran players will recognize that this is definitely a
game from the Quake lineage. As with Quakes I and II, it's dark and
violent. The action is fast and furious. When players shoot each
other with a variety of weapons _ a shotgun, Gatling gun, rocket
launcher, even a railgun that fires plutonium slugs _ their
opponents don't just fall over. They explode into flying chunks of
pixellated flesh known as ``gibs'' _ as in giblets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with Quakes I and II, anyone will be able to set up and run a
Quake III Arena server on the Internet. And id will once again
publish enough information about the game so that amateurs can
build their own levels.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to do a game that focuses on multiplayer
competition came at a time when id had finished Quake II and was
looking for its next project. Like a rock star who only puts out an
album every couple of years or so, id does one game at a time,
working slowly and methodically. It then licenses its technology to
other companies, gaining revenues from sales of its own titles
along with those of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, we were going to do a true sequel to Quake II _
the press release had even gone out,'' said Hollenshead. But at a
meeting to determine the company's next direction, the idea of a
multiplayer-focused game arose and captured imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of concentrating on a story line, we said, `What if we
focused on game play, on the death-match game, the thing that gives
our games longevity?''' Hollenshead said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmack said the decision made designing the game easier. Rather
than concentrating on what amounts to two different games _
single-player and multiplayer _ the id staff was able to focus on
just one component.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of duplicate code in there. If it's a
single-player game, do this; if it's a multiplayer game, do that,''
Carmack said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Quake III Arena is not due out until mid-year, the
game already is stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could ship this today if we wanted to _ it's been playable
for months,'' said model designer Steed. ``We're just polishing and
polishing. We want to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny id _ only 14 people work at its offices in this northeast
Dallas suburb _ made its initial multiplayer game with Doom in
1993. The title, now considered a milestone in the PC game
industry, featured a lone space marine doing battle on a Martian
moon against creatures from Hell.
</P>
<P>
   The single-player game, with its three-dimensional graphics,
realistic sound and lightning-quick gameplay, was impressive enough
to make it an instant best seller.
</P>
<P>
   But the game made national news soon after its release because
college students were playing death-match Doom across campus
networks. A bug in the code caused some networks to bog down
dramatically, and as a result the game was banned at some
universities and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With Doom, death-match could only be played on a local area
network, or one-on-one via a modem connection. A company in
Houston, Dwango, figured out how to simulate a network, letting
players use modems to connect to file servers.
</P>
<P>
   With its next game, Quake, id expanded the multiplayer
abilities. Like Doom, the single-player story featured a lone hero
battling a horde of monsters _ this time in a dimension that was a
strange mix of medieval and science-fiction themes _ with more
intricate graphics and a true 3-D perspective. Players had a
360-degree, free-motion view of the dark, dank and dangerous world
that id had created.
</P>
<P>
   But the multiplayer part of the game added a new wrinkle _ play
over the Internet. No longer did players need a local area network
to play death-match with more than two people, because anyone who
had a copy of the game could set up his or her own server on the
Internet. Others could then sign on to the server to play _ for
free.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect, along with the fact that id openly published the
design specifications for Quake _ allowing anyone to make new
levels for the game _ created an explosion of growth in an online
community that had already coalesced around Doom.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Quake used the World Wide Web to spread news about the
game, find opponents and propagate home-brew levels. Sites such as
Stomped (www.stomped.com), PlanetQuake (www.planetquake.com) and
Blue's News (www.bluesnews.com) quickly evolved from hobbies into
serious businesses. Jupiter Communications, a New York-based market
research firm, estimates game-related Web sites will earn more than
$58 million in ad revenues this year, and as much as $464 million
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The game also allowed for group play. Almost immediately teams
formed _ calling themselves Quake ``clans'' and using the Web to
challenge each other.
</P>
<P>
   But playing over the Internet required a level of computer
knowledge that the casual home PC user didn't possess. Those who
wanted to jump onto Quake servers had to find them first.
Quake-related Web sites offered lists of servers, but many who
bought the game weren't even aware that the sites existed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, id released Quake II, with even better graphics
and more advanced 3-D physics. It further improved on death-match
play by allowing players to keep a list of favorite servers in an
address book. But still, the game did not offer much help in
finding them.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people playing Quake death-match games in their
various forms is hard to pin down. John Carmack said most market
research firms estimate there are around 50,000 dedicated players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that's a low estimate,'' Carmack said. ``We think
there are a couple hundred thousand playing, and that's without any
direct pointers to the servers that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of player numbers are hard to come by, but Jupiter
believes that consumer spending on online gaming will reach $110
million this year and rise to $622 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of id's games will get their first taste of Quake III when
a technology test is released on the Internet in March. Tentatively
dubbed Q3Test, it will be used to test the game's networking
capabilities. As bugs are found and problems arise, the software
will be updated.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, a larger demo version will be released, and
that will be followed by the full game, available for computers
running the Windows, Macintosh and Linux operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   When it ships, Quake III Arena will not be the only game on the
shelves with a multiplayer emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortly after id announced Quake III Arena, Epic Megagames
said it would do a similar follow-up to its best-selling 3-D
shooter, Unreal. That game, Unreal Tournament, could ship as early
as this spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Valve Software is working on a version of its hit Half-Life
game called Team Fortress 2. The game takes its name from an
amateur-designed modification for Quake I called Team Fortress, in
which teams defend and attack each other's castles.
</P>
<P>
   _ StarSiege Tribes from the Dynamix division of Sierra On-Line
is a multiplayer-only title in which teams or tribes defend their
land against invaders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ultima Online, an online-only version of the popular series of
role-playing games from Austin-based Origin, is now in its third
year and an update, The Second Age, was recently released.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Quake III Arena's death-match focus means it doesn't
sell as much as Quake I or II, that's fine with id. Hollenshead
estimated that, because the company is so small, it need sell only
10,000 copies to break even.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Quake II has just gone over the 1 million-copy
sales mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expected-case scenario is that it will not sell as well as
Quake II, but maybe about 70 to 75 percent of what Quake II sold,''
Carmack said.
</P>
<P>
   If it does flop, id likely will go back to making single-player
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been toying with the name `Doom 2000,''' said
Hollenshead. ``What do you think?''

MILLIONAIRE SEEKS TO UNSEAT SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Clint Reilly, the retired political strategist
who has long harbored a desire to run for office himself, has
plunged into the race for mayor of San Francisco with a pledge to
restore an ``ethic of service'' to government.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly launched his campaign Thursday with a scathing indictment
of Mayor Willie Brown's handling of the city's Municipal Railway
transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sincere in my concern for the future of this city, and I
am sincere in my commitment to restoring an ethic of service to
city government,'' Reilly told about 60 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown, who promised us leadership, has given us only
showmanship, and nowhere does that failure show more than with
Muni,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly offered a 10-point plank that included promises to fire
Muni managers who don't meet performance goals, an end to rules
that allow drivers not to show up for work without consequences and
a city charter amendment to remove a requirement that drivers be
paid salaries that are at least the second highest of any transit
agency in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was in no rush to engage the Reilly, a millionaire real
estate investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to do the job of the city,'' he said. ``I'll get around
to running in September or October.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene, with Reilly standing in the shadow of a subway train
entrance, was meant to focus attention on the chief issue he hopes
to exploit: public dissatisfaction with city transit.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 52, faces a tough challenger even as he attacks one of
the mayor's weakest issues. Brown is a longtime officeholder who is
endorsed by the city's dominant Democratic Party and traditionally
has enjoyed the support of minority groups in this ethnically
diverse city.

PREGNANCY STILL SEEN AS LIABILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Companies like to boast about being family friendly,
but when pregnancies, newborns and sick children collide with
business needs, many times it's not the family that comes first.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of ``Is that still going on?'' consider the case
of Veronica Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said her working life took a definite downward slide
during her annual job evaluation when she was pregnant with her
second child.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Wallace said her boss
gave her an ultimatum during her evaluation: her nursing career or
her family.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had become pregnant with her second child almost
immediately after returning from maternity leave with her first
child and said she was stunned by the directive. She said she had
never missed work because of a sick child or because of her
pregnancies, nor had she been criticized for her job performance.
</P>
<P>
   But while she was pregnant with her third child, she was fired.
Wallace sued Methodist for pregnancy discrimination and was
recently awarded $507,500 in damages by a Houston jury.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital said Wallace was fired for falsifying a doctor's
order, but that's something that nurses routinely do, said Beatrice
Mladenka-Fowler, a Houston lawyer who represented Wallace. When a
doctor gives a treatment plan, he often leaves out several
intermediate steps, Wallace said. So nurses routinely perform the
routine tasks and write up the request as if the doctor had
specifically requested it.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace believes that her pregnancies _ three in three years
_ were viewed by her supervisor as a liability to the hospital.
They had to hire another nurse to fill in, yet the hospital still
had to pay Wallace for her vacation and sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said there were other signs things weren't going well at
work: Tensions escalated when she refused a request to return to
work earlier than she planned after the birth of her second baby.
And when employees were allowed to cut back their shifts by eight
hours every two weeks yet still keep their full benefits, Wallace
said her boss let her know she didn't want her signing up for the
new program. Wallace did anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The petite 35-year-old mother of three daughters, who are now 5,
4 and 3 years old, found herself out of a job four days before
Christmas in 1994. She knew she had a case when a nurse called to
tell Wallace that the supervisor was heard telling co-workers that
Wallace was fired for being pregnant three times in three years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOSPITAL DENIES ALLEGATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Methodist wouldn't talk about the case, but indicated in a
written statement the hospital does not discriminate based on
pregnancy and denies Wallace's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 hospital employees are pregnant each year, and the
decision to terminate Wallace was reviewed and approved by a female
supervisor who did not know she was pregnant, according to
Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   A Methodist spokeswoman said the hospital is confident the
jury's verdict will be overruled or at least the damages will be
reduced by U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers still believe employees can serve only one master
and they want to be that master, said Joe Ahmad, an employment
lawyer who has represented women in pregnancy claims.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ADDING UP THE PROBLEM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the problem persists, pregnancy discrimination complaints
make up a minuscule portion of the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission's workload. Nationwide in 1998, the
commission received 4,219 pregnancy discrimination complaints out
of a total 79,786.
</P>
<P>
   The small numbers, however, don't tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   They could be the result of a coding problem, said H. Joan
Ehrlich, district director of the commission in Houston. If a case
involves a firing, the pregnancy case code may have been left off,
making it appear as though pregnancy weren't involved.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9 to 5, National Association of
Working Women in Milwaukee, says most women also don't do anything
about it because it happens at such a stressful time in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   And almost half of all workers, those who work for firms with
fewer than 50 employees or haven't had enough time on the job, are
not covered under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which
requires employers to give their workers 12 weeks of leave to care
for a newborn.

UC REGENTS SEEK TO EXPAND POOL OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ University of California regents are considering
a plan to make 4 percent of the students in each high school
graduating class eligible to attend the system.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis said the proposal would ``reward excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   University of California President Richard Atkinson called the
plan historic in its attempt to extend opportunity and improve high
schools, but acknowledged that it would do little to increase the
numbers of minorities attending campuses in the University of
California system. The proposal would have no effect on black
enrollment and would mean about a 1 percent increase in Hispanic
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough in terms of providing diversity,'' Atkinson
said after Thursday's regents meeting, ``but we must abide by the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of student groups protested the proposal, saying it
was ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to show how hesitant UC officials are to stop
discriminating,'' said Heather Bergman, a student at Berkeley and a
member of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action By Any Means
Necessary. ``No one is going to fall for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regent Ward Connerly, the architect of the plan that ended
affirmative action in the university system, said he was concerned
that the 4 percent proposal was a ``back-door'' approach to
re-instituting racial preferences. But Connerly did not indicate he
would oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson defended the plan, which is part of a series of
proposed changes to alter admissions policy, as a ``front-door
path'' and ``a loud and clear message that we will reward
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for extending eligibility for admissions to
the top 4 percent of high school students in each graduating class.
In order to do that, the University of California will identify
high-achieving students in their junior year, giving the university
more time to recruit them.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said that no eligible students admitted under previous
admission criteria would be displaced by the new proposal, which is
expected to add about 3,600 students.
</P>
<P>
   Regents generally praised the 4 percent proposal, but some were
skeptical about other proposed changes in the admissions policy
that would give less credit for advanced placement classes and
alter the emphasis given to SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   One change calls for giving students who complete advanced
placement classes half a point boost in their grade instead of a
full point. That would mean that an ``A'' in AP English would be
counted as a 4.5 instead of a 5 in calculating grade point
averages.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change said it would help curb grade inflation
and even the playing field for students who have limited access to
AP courses.
</P>
<P>
   Regent John Davies said he worried that giving less credit for
AP classes would ``lower the bar'' for admission. He asked that the
changes be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   Another change would give more consideration to SAT achievement
tests in specific academic areas as opposed to basic SAT skills
tests.
</P>
<P>
   All the changes are necessary in order to make 12.5 percent of
state's top students eligible to attend the University of
California system, a goal that is part of the system's master plan,
said Keith Widaman, a professor of psychology at Riverside. Widaman
is head of the statewide faculty governing body's Board of
Admissions and Relations with Schools, which generated the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Only 11.1 percent are now eligible, he said. Newly eligible
students would still meet high standards under the proposals, he
said. Two-thirds of those who would be covered by the 4 percent
plan are already eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But many students don't attend even if they're eligible, one
school counselor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see themselves as having the opportunity to go to
UC,'' said Patricia Bunyard, a counselor at Arvin High School in
Kern County. ``Their parents don't expect them to go. They
certainly have the motivation, but they are missing something to
get there.''

 &HT;    'KINDER, GENTLER' GEORGE W. BUSH?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 21, 1999
 &HT;    (NOTE: ``Tonight'' in the 16th graph refers to Sunday, Feb. 21.)
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE and KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On an airport tarmac at one of the dreary final
stops of President George Bush's failing 1992 reelection campaign,
his eldest son, George W., glowered toward a small pool of
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seething. He was kind of rocking on his feet,''
recalled John Harwood, a mild-mannered Wall Street Journal reporter
who was surprised to discover that the son's anger was focused on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harwood had written nothing to trigger the reaction,
George W. was venting because Harwood's newspaper had run a
critical article on the business dealings of the three Bush sons.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Bush recalled late last week precisely what
had ticked him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A six-column story in the Wall Street Journal I thought was a
little much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tense moments on the tarmac passed, but they left Harwood
with the impression that ``Junior,'' as family friends called him,
was a hothead during his stint as a White House aide to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Bush, now governor of Texas, but he allowed that he
didn't shy away from offering ``blunt assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the son who pulls no punches and tells it like he thinks
it is,'' Barbara Bush told her diary.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the less flattering image of an impetuous George W.
that stuck in some Washington minds after his father's 1992 defeat,
in part because so little was known about the son who had worked so
quietly in his father's shadow for years.
</P>
<P>
   George W. was his dad's alter ego and trusted agent for
unpleasant jobs, such as telling White House chief of staff John
Sununu that it was time to leave and telling off campaign aides he
considered to be disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejects talk (''Psychobabble,'' he calls it) of the two
George W.'s: then, a quick-tempered, behind-the-scenes aide; now, a
campaign veteran praised, even by foes, as affable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the same person,'' said Bush, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is aware of conventional wisdom that pegged him
as impulsive and heading for the boiling point when he took on
popular Democratic incumbent Ann Richards, she of the rapier wit,
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, 'He'll blow his stack,' `` said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Stack intact, he won and was re-elected governor in a landslide
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as an invited guest along with other members of the
National Governors Association, he will return to his dad's old
place at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as the king of the unannounced
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Associates and observers from Bush's previous Washington stints
are as surprised as Bush claims he is.
</P>
<P>
   Good ol' boy
</P>
<P>
   Some of the inner circle from his father's White House days say
they never dreamed that George W. would soon become a political
force on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood in the back of a lot of rooms together, watching his
father make speeches,'' recalled Marlin Fitzwater, who served as
the Bush White House press secretary. ``I always thought he had
good sense and good political savvy, but I never thought he'd run
for office because I never heard him talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard him weigh in on issues,'' said Fitzwater.
</P>
<P>
   It was another Bush son, Jeb, now governor of Florida, who
talked politics. George W. preferred regaling listeners with his
encyclopedic knowledge of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up wanting to be president of the United States.
I grew up wanting to be Willie Mays,'' Bush said in what has become
a stock answer to the stock questions about why, having long ago
realized he couldn't hit the curve, he now wants the White House
job.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News anchor Brit Hume, who watched the Bush White House as a
correspondent for ABC-TV, said the younger Bush fit neatly into the
``good ol' boy'' mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some political instincts and advised his father from
time to time, and sometimes did dirty work for his father,'' said
Hume. ``I would not have predicted from knowing him that he would
have emerged as the figure that he has emerged as. I would have
figured that the comer in the family was Jeb.''
</P>
<P>
   The dirty work included the sacking of Sununu, who had played a
key role in getting the elder Bush elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way. I wasn't freelancing,'' Bush recalled
recently about the firing of Sununu, who the White House thought
had become a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, now a top aide in the budding presidential campaign of
Dan Quayle, the elder Bush's vice president, claims it won't be a
grudge match if the younger Bush gets in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I have no conflict with George W., contrary to
what the press has been saying,'' Sununu, a former New Hampshire
governor, said in his home state this month as he escorted Quayle
to pre-campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   The lousy time
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the governor and the Wall Street Journal's
Harwood have marveled together at the turn of events that led
another Bush to the verge of a Republican presidential campaign.
Bush smoothed over his 1992 anger toward Harwood by saying he had
``no hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lousy time and I was defending my dad,'' Harwood said
Bush told him.
</P>
<P>
   So lousy, in fact, that Barbara Bush's tell-it-like-it-is son
revealed a rough edge on other occasions. At the Republican
National Convention in Houston, he stormed out of an interview with
a Salt Lake City TV station when the reporter asked about his
father's marital fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remembers walking off, but says it happened after a
reporter questioned the elder Bush's commitment to family values
because ``you have three crooks in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   And when introduced to ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Gary Trudeau,
he poured out his displeasure at the comic strip creator for
lampooning his father. Bush, who knew Trudeau when they were Yale
undergrads, recently recalled the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suggested George Bush had put his manhood in a blind
trust,'' said the younger Bush. ``I told him I didn't particularly
care for that type of assessment of a good man. I don't think I was
rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the history of blunt assessing, predictions that Bush
would lose control in his own campaigns proved wrong. In 1994, he
ran a respectful campaign against Richards in the face of her
effort to paint him as a rich kid armed with a famous name and
little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing waiting to snap,'' insists GOP consultant Mary
Matalin, who worked closely with George W. in three of his father's
races. ``I thought of it less as anger than as speaking with
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Correct, says Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never going to fly off the handle as a candidate,'' he
says now, acknowledging he got much closer to the boiling point as
a campaign operative than he did as a candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if 'fly off the handle' is the right word, but I
occasionally defended my dad's position. Occasionally somebody
needed to be told. When you have somebody (on the campaign) leaking
information to make themselves look big, I told them I didn't
appreciate that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt assessment ``doesn't mean temper,'' Bush insists. ``I
never had a temper. Have I ever been angry? Sure. Haven't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty straightforward person. Maybe people in
Washington are used to double talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One former Bush aide in Texas believes the governor's anger
might be tested anew if he gets into the White House derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have to re-learn how to take a punch. And as a
presidential candidate you have to throw some back,'' said the
ex-aide.
</P>
<P>
   The new George W.
</P>
<P>
   Deny it though he might, potential presidential candidate George
W. Bush is a different package than was presidential aide George W.
Bush, according to some in the family's extended political family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there was one who grew politically, it was George
W.,'' said Vic Gold, a close family ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was like Prince Hal and Henry V,'' he said of
Shakespeare's playboy character who became a serious king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that he ever caroused,'' Gold quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what George W. might have done in his self-dubbed
``young and irresponsible'' years he has attempted to put off
limits. He does, however, have experience in dealing with sensitive
personal issues. In 1987, he was dispatched to snuff out adultery
rumors about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to the 'Big A' question is N-O,'' he told Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has acknowledged he drank too much until he quit at
age 40, has declared himself a faithful husband but has not offered
details about his distant past. It's a defensive posture that could
be tested if he runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's saying is 'I don't have anything to hide, but I'm
also not going to spend every day talking about every detail about
my previous life,' `` said Robert Teeter, the pollster who managed
the 1992 Bush presidential campaign. ``I think that works as long
as somebody doesn't uncover something that shows he wasn't telling
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has given the personal conduct issue such a wide berth
that he has yet to speak out on President Clinton's sexual scandals
or on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had two stints as an aide to his father. In 1987 and 1988,
he moved from Midland to be ``kind of a general ombudsman'' for the
Bush presidential campaign. He returned for the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the eyes and ears for my dad to a certain extent,'' he
said. ``I wasn't a spy, but I was there to keep a watchful eye on
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint, his office was across a hall from Lee
Atwater, his father's top political adviser. In her memoir, Barbara
Bush said George W. and the late Atwater were ``great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush says he was never shy about making sure Atwater, like
everyone in the White House, understood the mission _ particularly
after Atwater appeared on the cover of Esquire magazine with his
pants around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded Lee he was working for George Bush. I didn't
appreciate the picture or the story. My dad didn't appreciate the
picture or the story. And worse, my mother didn't appreciate the
picture or the story,'' said Bush. ``My dad expected there to be
certain conduct during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush headed to Dallas to serve as managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team after his father was
elected in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But he returned to Washington for what he calls ``the defense of
the incumbency'' in 1992. His title was senior adviser and he said
his job was to ``make sure of everybody's agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In a part of Washington that Bush, a loyalty freak, intensely
dislikes, the candidate's agenda is not always the agenda of
everyone in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the agendas get confused,'' he said. ``I had one
agenda, and that was the best interests of George H.W. Bush. I told
some people in the '92 campaign that I didn't appreciate them
trying to climb off the good ship George Bush before it docked.
And, yes, I occasionally told a member of the press corps that I
didn't like the way they were treating my father.''
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day 1992, when the good ship George Bush ran
aground, Barbara Bush got the news from her eldest child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In late afternoon,'' she recalled in her memoir, ``George W.
told us, based on exit polls, it was over. We would lose. Our boys
had killed themselves for us.''

MERCEDES SUV IS TOUGH AND POSH

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mercedes-Benz decided to get into the sport-utility market,
the German luxury automaker took the task seriously.
</P>
<P>
   While some other designers of high-end SUVs decided to put a lot
of luxury in their vehicles but leave true off-road capability to
the Jeeps of the world, Mercedes chose to build a vehicle that
isn't the most luxurious in the class, but has a unique combination
of excellent on- and off-road performance.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced last year, the V-6 powered ML320 is a smooth and
comfortable passenger car on the highway, similar to driving a
Mercedes E-class sedan.
</P>
<P>
   But off the road, the M-class is a tough machine, thanks to its
rugged body-on-frame construction. Unlike some of its luxury
competitors, including the Lexus RX 300, Mercury Mountaineer and
Oldsmobile Bravada, Mercedes equipped the M-class with a low-range
transmission mode that puts the vehicle in the same class with the
market's best off-road explorers, including the Toyota Land
Cruiser, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Isuzu Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of just $34,950, the ML320 has already proved
to be serious competition for the premium sport-utilities in the
same price range, such as the Ford Explorer Limited, Grand Cherokee
Limited, RX 300, Acura SLX and Mitsubishi Montero.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been so good that Mercedes has announced an expansion
to its Alabama M-class factory that will increase annual output
from the current 65,000 units to at least 80,000, and a European
factory is being set up to provide M-class vehicles for that
market.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the company has rolled out a V-8 version called the
ML430, our test vehicle for the week. It lists for $43,750 and
comes with a list of extra items that aren't included on the base
ML320, including leather seats, power/heated front seats,
leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, privacy glass,
auto-dimming rearview mirror, wood interior trim, trip computer and
a safe box under the front passenger seat. (Those items are
available as a single package in an upgrade for the ML320.)
</P>
<P>
   The ML430's numeric designation refers to the 4.3-liter
displacement of the engine (the ML320 has a 3.2-liter six), which
is rated at 268 horsepower and 288 foot-pounds of torque, compared
with 215 horsepower and 233 foot-pounds of torque for the V-6
model.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-line performance isn't spectacularly different, however.
The ML320 goes from zero to 60 mph in nine seconds, while the ML430
improves on that by only a second. Still, with the extra power, the
ML430 is a more capable tow vehicle for boats, campers and/or horse
trailers. Top speed on both models is electronically limited to 112
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Either one has plenty of power for normal driving, including
freeway merges and passing. Both engines are connected to a
smooth-shifting, electronically controlled five-speed automatic
transmission. The transmission's fuzzy-logic computer control
varies the shifting points to match the driving habits of the
operator, or to keep the vehicle from shifting unnecessarily while
going up or down hills.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things people say when they see the M-class is
that it seems to be rather small. But its exterior appearance is
deceiving. The interior is roomy enough for five adults _ two in
the front buckets and three seated comfortably on the second seat _
and the cargo area is larger than that of the segment-leading Ford
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Explorer and most other midsize SUVs, the M-class has
a third seat available. It seats an additional two people, although
it's best left to children or smaller adults.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mercedes decided to build a sport-utility to compete in
the high-volume mid-$30,000s to low-$40,000s range, the M-class
doesn't have all of the luxury and convenience trappings of luxury
cars in this class, such as automatic climate control. In fact, the
base ML320 has cloth seats and manual seat adjusters _ almost
unheard of in a vehicle priced higher than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Included on the base M-class are manual air-conditioning with
dust and pollen filtering, power windows and door locks, 80-watt
AM/FM/cassette stereo, cruise control, tilt steering, rear
defroster and wiper, dual heated/power side mirrors, alloy wheels,
six-way manual front seats and retractable cargo cover.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features on all M-class vehicles include
four-wheel antilock brakes, electronic stability control,
four-wheel independent suspension, front and side air bags for the
driver and front passenger, and the patented ``Baby-Smart'' front
passenger-seat system that detects the presence of a Mercedes
infant or child safety seat and turns off the passenger air bag.
</P>
<P>
   A new option for '99 is the ``power skyview top'' ($2,395), a
4-by-3-foot sliding sun roof that opens over the front and rear
passengers. A smaller glass sun roof is available for $1,095.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more luxury for the money, try the high-end
Explorer, GMC Jimmy Envoy, Grand Cherokee, Lexus RX 300 or Toyota
4Runner. But for those of you who want a Mercedes, as well as a
vehicle that is as capable off road as it is on the highway, the
M-class is worth your consideration, even in base form.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's worth paying $9,000 more to get the V-8 engine, and
other extras that come with the ML430, is for you to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy for the V-8 model is 15 miles per gallon in the
city and 18 on the highway; for the V-6, it's 17 mpg city/21
highway. The tank holds 19 gallons of gasoline.

SCANNING ISN'T UP TO THE JOB OF RESUMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there a program that will allow me to scan a
resume and then store it in a database where it can be reached at a
later time by typing in keywords?
</P>
<P>
   _ Big-Time TV Guy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIG: As a matter of fact, I once wrote just such a program,
but there was a lot of resistance to its use, merely because it
pulled up my own resume no matter which keyword you typed in.
People can be so petty.
</P>
<P>
   True, scanners can ``read'' text, but you'd probably be better
off hiring a temp to punch the resumes into a database program like
Access or FoxPro. A scanner simply takes a picture of a page.
Text-recognition software then tries to figure out what all the
letters are, then jams them into a text file. If you have enough
patience, you can teach the software to recognize different
portions of the resume as different fields for a database, but that
only works if every resume you get looks exactly alike. One frilly
font, and the whole thing blows up.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you might try is a database program that can store
images as well as text. Then you could scan the resume and stash
the image file along with keywords you type into other fields. Of
course, if you do it right, mine's still the only resume that
should pop up. Did I mention that I could use a job?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there more than one version of Win98 now
available? I would like to buy the latest with the most patches
installed. Can I tell by the package info?
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to Date
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DATE: The only thing you can tell from the package is that
you're about to spend 90 bucks. Don't worry, though. No matter when
you buy Windows 98, it will upgrade itself to the latest and
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   If you have some way to get on the Internet _ and any
self-respecting geek does _ Win98 will go out and check the
Microsoft Web site for updates. Just click on the cleverly named
``Windows Update'' shortcut at the top of the start menu.
</P>
<P>
   If it's your first time there, you'll automatically download a
couple of helper programs, then Microsoft can reach out and poke
around your computer. I know, it's not a pleasant feeling having
Bill Gates groping your gear and pawing your peripherals. It gives
me a new appreciation for what my prom date went through.
Nevertheless, they do a pretty good job of figuring out what you
ought to download. And you won't have to call up your pal Werner
von Foureyes for help, since most stuff installs automatically.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a deal you can download that checks the site for
updates whenever you're on the Net, in case you're too lazy to do
it yourself. Just don't get all paranoid and think that it's some
way for Microsoft to keep track of you. It's merely a way for
Microsoft to keep track of you. Hey! Wait a minute ...
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I only buy the paper to get your comments. The
rest of the paper is trash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wise Beyond His Years
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WISE: That's exactly what I keep telling the editors, but
they never listen. They seem really hung up on all that news stuff.
The ad people are no better, except they occasionally print pizza
coupons and lingerie pictures, which pretty much makes my life
complete.

LINK DOWNPLAYED BETWEEN POLIO VACCINE, TUMOR RISKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Tilde needed over n in Zuniga) 
 
By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ There is no cause for public alarmover new research
that shows a monkey virus that contaminated early batches of the
Salk polio vaccine now is being detected in human tumors, a Houston
doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be considered a very important clue, but no need for
alarm,'' said Dr. Janet Butel, head of molecular biology at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. ``There is no elevated risk for
those who had the vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are uncertain whether the simian virus 40 (SV40)
caused the tumors. Many of those who have the tumors did not have
the Salk polio vaccine, so another method of how the virus was
transmitted needs to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence is mounting that SV40 is associated with certain
types of human brain, bone and lung tumors, Butel said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said a London newspaper misinterpreted her study of
the monkey virus in early polio vaccines when the paper reported
the virus had been proved to be ``cancer-causing'' and could be
responsible for hundreds of cancer deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going one step further than I am prepared to go,'' said
Butel of the London Telegraph report. ``There is no evidence'' that
the virus found in some human tumors came from the polio vaccine,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey virus has been found in the tumors of people who were
not alive in the 1950s and 1960s, when the contaminated polio
vaccine was used, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper based its report on Butel's study, published last
month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Butel and Dr. John Lednicky, also a Baylor molecular virologist,
presented an overview of SV40 in the Jan. 20 issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   SV40, which originated in the rhesus monkey, was discovered in
1960 as a contaminant of polio vaccines given to millions of people
from 1955 through early 1963. Monkey kidney cells that were used to
grow the polio vaccine unknowingly were contaminated with SV40.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the polio vaccine has been purified and no
contamination exists. Butel also stressed that the SV40
contamination occurred mostly in the injected Salk vaccination or
polio shot, and not as much in the popular Sabin vaccine sugar
cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing negative against the polio vaccine which saved
so many lives and so much suffering,'' Butel said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this link between the virus and tumors ``provides
insight for possible causes of certain types of human cancers,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   This would be another step toward a new vaccine to attack SV40
and prevent these cancers, Butel said.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated roughly one-third of bone tumors and up to half of
pediatric brain tumors could be caused by SV40.

WHERE TO FIND THE BOOK THAT LOCATES GHOSTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Eakin Press was scheduled to release a book by Richard
Stewart and Allan Turner called ``Transparent Tales: An Attic Full
of Texas Ghosts'' around Halloween. Where can I find this book?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.E.F., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: You can order the $24.95 book directly from Eakin Press by
calling (800) 880-8642.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparent Tales,'' written by two Houston Chronicle
reporters, contains two ghost stories about downtown Fort Worth
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One describes a ghost haunting the third floor of the building
that used to house Barber's Books, which was once a
turn-of-the-century hotel in the city's red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   The other takes place in the Jett Building at 400 Main St. in
Sundance Square.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to send Sophia Loren snapshots of an old charcoal
drawing of hers. Where can I write to her?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.M., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Loren in care of the William Morris Agency, 151 El
Camino Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Loren, 64, has recently been doing interviews to promote a new
cookbook, ``Sophia Loren's Recipes and Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hospitalized briefly in August for cardiac arrhythmia.
``They did all the checkups here in New York and everything was
fine,'' she told a USA Today reporter earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Loren's next project is ``Destinazione Verna,'' a science
fiction film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. Loren's
26-year-old son, director Edoardo Ponti, also is working on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Red Skelton's first name?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.O., Hardwick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: The comedian and painter was born Richard Bernard Skelton on
July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Ind. His father, a former circus
clown, died two months before his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton left home at age 10 to join a traveling medicine show
and became a vaudeville performer at age 15. Debuting on radio and
Broadway in 1937, he went on to appear in 43 films.
</P>
<P>
   After TV's ``The Red Skelton Show'' ended a 20-year run in 1971,
Skelton made up to $2.5 million a year from his paintings of clowns
and other subjects, and they sell for $120,000 or more today. He
died in 1997.

   STAR-WARS (Washington) _ In 1983 President Ronald Reagan
envisioned an elaborate space-based shield known as ``Star Wars''
to protect U.S. cities against a doomsday nuclear missile attack.

`PASSING GLORY': AN INSPIRATIONAL SPORTS MOVIE THAT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports stories about underdogs defeating expectations have been
a staple of American culture for generations, whether in a dimly
remembered 1950s book for boys called ``Five Against the Odds'' or
in the crowd-pleasing '80s movie ``Hoosiers,'' both of them about
basketball heroics.
</P>
<P>
   The newest tale to join the fold, and a true one, is ``Passing
Glory,'' a television movie on TNT Sunday night. But this story
does its brethren one better. It finds its drama not just in the
inevitable Big Game between the lowly and the lordly but in the
even more momentous conflict between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though the executive producer is Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson and the director is Steve James of ``Hoop Dreams'' fame,
``Passing Glory'' is less about basketball than about bigotry. Or
to put it another way, it's about a group of Southern blacks for
whom the only court promising justice in 1965 is one with painted
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``Passing Glory'' feels familiar, no doubt because it
draws deeply from two often-visited wells: the inspirational sports
movie and the Jim Crow race movie, the latter with its moss-draped
evocations of Deep South languor and menace. These might be reasons
to dismiss the film as warmed-over fare. But in many ways the
merging of the genres gives the movie a surprising freshness; if it
serves up the same old conventions, at least it has made a new dish
out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the story is a powerful one, even if it's easily
recognizable. And it's told well here. Apart from a smattering of
speechifying, the script is taut (written by the actor Harold
Sylvester, who based it on his own experience as a young
ballplayer). The mood, of muffled tension, is faithful to the time
and place, a segregated New Orleans yet to feel the brunt of the
Civil Rights movement. And the acting is uniformly good,
particularly by Andre Braugher, an Emmy Award winner on
``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Braugher offers a complex portrait of contained righteous anger
as the Rev. Joseph Verrett, a native son who returns to New Orleans
to join the faculty of an all-black Roman Catholic high school run
by his former white mentor, the gruff but dedicated Father Grant
(Rip Torn). Verrett, who had been banished as a rebel from the
Baltimore diocese, remains defiant, brooding and impatient with the
pace of racial progress, but in Braugher's layered rendering he's
also capable of quiet moments of humility and humor.
</P>
<P>
   His story dovetails with that of the school's unbeaten
basketball team (unbeaten in a black league, that is) when its
weaselly white coach quits and Verrett, who barely knows the sport,
is forced to take over. Soon he's confronting an echo of his own
rebellious self in the shape of the team's confident but smoldering
star, a role handled with striking subtlety by Sean Squire. The
young man's own story, in fact _ peopled by dropouts from the
projects on the one hand and go-along, get-along elders on the
other (Ruby Dee plays a wise grandmother here) _ is as finely drawn
as Father Verrett's.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Verrett is driving his team toward a barrier-breaking
showdown with the undefeated white league champions from across
town. The outcome may be easily guessed, but what makes its stock
ending bittersweet is what ultimately makes this sports movie more
than one: a kind of unstated truth that lingers in the air after
the final buzzer, reminding us that in 1965, so much was still left
to be won.

AMERICAN GARDENERS CAN TOO GIGGLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Conn., Calif., N.H.)   (af)  
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the exception of a few stray flamingos and a handful of
gnomes, gardening has never been a terribly funny affair in this
country. Mired in compost, knee-deep in axial symmetry and
preoccupied by integrated pest management, gardeners have tended to
be a sober bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The British, of course, have a tradition of incorporating whimsy
into their grounds. In the 18th century, they began littering their
landscapes with follies, false ruins, temples dedicated to mythical
creatures, mirrors that made paths seem to continue indefinitely,
trick water jets that sprayed visitors, and topiary peacocks and
chess pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, after all, was the birthplace of the ubiquitous
pointy-capped, potbellied garden gnome.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow all the merriment didn't translate over here. Initially,
of course, the colonists had the wilderness to tame _ undeniably
serious business. Then there was suburbia to render homogeneous.
American gardens have been called gorgeous, serene and fantastic.
But they couldn't be described as fun, except perhaps in a few
eccentric pockets of California or the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, American gardeners seem willing to crack a grin. As
Bill Thomas, the research horticulturist at the famed Longwood
Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., observed, ``It takes a measure of
confidence to throw caution to the wind, and Americans just didn't
have that assuredness until now.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kent, Conn., there's a two-story silver gazing globe, for
example, and in Berkeley, Calif., a five-foot-tall steel spider web
anchors a front-yard garden. Longwood Gardens has added a
young-at-heart children's garden with topiary bunnies brandishing
real carrots.
</P>
<P>
   And to the north, a four-piece orchestra of five-foot-tall frog
sculptures swing into a jazz piece when they sense motion on a
garden path in La Malbaie, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Although flippant, the humor that increasingly hedges the garden
is more iconoclasm than outdoor sitcom. Gates are positioned where
no one of normal dimensions could possibly enter or leave, paths
are knee-deep in flowering plants that can't be walked on, boots
are planted with thorny succulents, suggestion boxes are placed
safely out of reach at the tip of 20-foot poles, garishly colored
rakes and shovels are stuck business end up where flowers have
failed to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Bishop, who tracks trends for Smith &AMP; Hawken, the
upscale gardening catalogue giant, has noticed a definite incline
toward playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, everyone thought they had to emulate Sissinghurst
or some other grand estate in their backyard,'' she said. ``Now
it's O.K. to have fun. Creativity is now seen as part of gardening.
Even irreverence is allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   My first inkling that a more jovial juncture had arrived
occurred last winter when I encountered the newly positioned Four
Seasons sculptures in Hanover, N.H., of Alice Moir, truly a
tongue-in-cheek gardener. The sculptures, four waifs with wistful
Elizabethan expressions, carried sheaves of wheat or something
equally symbolic of spring, summer, fall or winter.
</P>
<P>
   They were capped in snow and wrapped in Dartmouth mufflers, with
Dartmouth beanies on their heads and varsity sweaters draped over
their shoulders. I couldn't help but smile.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moir's fence pickets are capped with hole-riddled gardening
gloves, she stations seatless footstools in the beds to keep her
iris from flopping and she sticks wooden tulips around the
playhouse ``because they're the only flowers my grandchildren are
willing to tend.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, the trend to comedy began with gazing balls and
bizarre color combinations. When gardeners found they weren't
tarred and feathered for mixing orange with magenta, they took
additional courageous steps.
</P>
<P>
   A few summers ago Peter Wooster, an interior designer and avid
gardener in Roxbury, Conn., surrounded his severely invasive plume
poppies in a spiked cupola resembling the guard tower at Alcatraz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plume poppies are wonderful tall plants with flowers
attracting so many bees that it sounds like La Guardia Airport, but
they are best when controlled,'' he said. He topped the posts of
his Belgian fence with weird metal shapes and supported a vine on a
horse-head hitching post.
</P>
<P>
   Other vines climb up dead tree trunks and recycled street signs,
while chimney pots serve as pedestals. Wooster selects items that
are beautiful, like the nine-foot-tall rusted weather vane that
serves as plant support, and uses each piece inventively.
Everything has a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when you think about it, levity in the landscape
isn't such a stretch. A theological friend points out that
gardening has been steeped in fantasy since the Garden of Eden and
says it's about time gardeners started poking fun at something that
was formerly drenched in sweat of the brow.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. The sharpest garden whimsy spins off from the
drudgery of gardening. In a slightly overgrown garden in
Bridgewater, Conn., I encountered a post bearing directional signs.
The arrow pointing to the east said, ``Nettles,'' the arrow facing
west said ``Bindweed'' and south was marked ``Something Very Nasty
Indeed.''

MILLENNIUM WEAR OUT OF THIS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is your wardrobe ready for the new millennium? Maybe
you'd better check with John Glenn or some of the other high flyers
from NASA.
</P>
<P>
   At the fall 1999/winter 2000 fashion shows here this week, more
than 80 design houses presented their visions of fashions for 2000.
And some of them were out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang's astronaut-like outfits looked like they were ready
for the space shuttle. Yet the silver rubber clothes, with ribbed
elbow- and knee-pads, were street chic. Malibu's futuristic
accessories _ a computer and a vanity mirror attached separately on
the wrist and designed to match one's outfit _ had bestseller
possibilities. (Alas, the wrist computer is still only a concept.)
And Barbara Bui's knee-length hoop skirts and pointy shoulder
shapes were downright Judy Jetson-esque.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is Seventh Avenue trying to tell us? The cultural
statement reflected in the collections is clear: Today's women are
ready for the new millennium. They are confident risk takers (think
potential candidates Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton) and strong
leaders (think Madeleine Albright). In the new era, the designers
suggest, women will dress for themselves in comfortable,
utilitarian clothing. While they may not wear astronaut suits, they
will have fun _ with sartorial touches of luxury and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Since women have suggested they want no-fuss, comfortable
wardrobes, it makes sense that the skirt and sweater continued to
replace the structured pantsuit or skirted suit. Designers such as
Carolina Herrera paired A-line skirts with knee-high boots.
Hemlines remained firmly at the knee or below. And embellished tops
were replaced with decorated skirts. Oscar de la Renta, for
example, showed long wool skirts with large embroidered patterns at
the hem.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s A-line skirts were often matched this week with that
era's three-quarter-length sleeves; bunched, three-quarter-length
gloves; ballet slippers; and fur collars and stoles. While
certainly the look is feminine, ultimately it may be too
costumelike to sell in numbers anywhere but Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As a contrast to the innocent '50s look, glam rock also had a
strong presence on the runway. Many designers showed funky leather
pants, skirts, and three-quarter-length jackets that were hip and
modern.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, who had one of the most exciting shows of the
week, said in his program notes that he has always drawn
inspiration from rock stars. This season, he was influenced by old
punk-rock groups the Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, and the Clash. His
show, which opened with an unexpected live performance by rock
group Sugar Ray at the head of the runway, was attended by
celebrities such as actress Andie MacDowell, guitarist Kirk
Hammett, and singers Lenny Kravitz, Maxwell, and Mya. The
collection included pants, jackets, and boots made of colorful
snakeskin-patchwork prints, along with waxed-leather motorcyle
pants and a cool black leather hooded poncho.
</P>
<P>
   But Hilfiger, whose customers range from rappers to corporate
executives, showed some classic looks as well, though with a twist.
His male and female models paraded the floor in unusual
combinations, like red nylon ski pants paired with a charcoal
cashmere sports coat, and a pink cotton dress shirt with French
cuffs worn with black leather pants, their seams stitched in white.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger, in his program notes, said, ``This collection is about
contrast, which I find sexy, young and intelligent. . . . It brings
sportswear to a new level and it brings luxury into reality. . . .
I constantly have to ask myself, `What makes us different?' And the
answer is that we're mixing high and low as we have always done. A
cashmere sweater from the collection with a pair of nylon pants
from the Tommy Jeans line. That is what I consider modern.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the hottest color for the new millennium?
Interestingly, it's white (after so many years of black).
Considering Princess Leia's futuristic all-white wardrobe in ``Star
Wars,'' maybe it was inevitable. For retailers such as Filene's, it
could be a tough sell, said Robert Rutkauskas, Filene's fashion
director, since ``there's the old adage of don't wear white after
Labor Day.'' He concedes, ``It looks so new, it adds newness to
one's wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan's DKNY line had plenty of white jackets, pants,
dresses, and boots, as did Max Azria's BCBG collection. Indeed, in
an early embrace of the trend, a number of magazine editors already
had on white leather jackets as they watched the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no show this week was as innovative and futuristic as
Helmut Lang's. Virtually every one of his outfits _ presented on
male and female models _ had an interesting detail that made it
unique and utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   A number of jackets, for example, had straps sewn inside,
enabling a jacket to be worn on the back like a backpack (the end
of coat check). A man's tuxedo pants had chaps placed over one leg
(with pockets) in which the wearer could stash keys, cigarettes, or
other items. And several outfits featured silk organza neck rests (
the kind people use on an airplane). The purpose? Maybe busy people
in the new millennium will want to take naps more often.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's clothes _ presented mostly in black, white, silver, and
orange _ weren't for everyone, especially the rubber astronaut-like
ensembles. But Lang's design ideas are still an exciting and
welcome change from the norm. Out-of-the-box dressing (like John
Glenn) is the only way to embrace a new millennium in style.

A LEGEND WHO DOESN'T MINCE WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Every inch a legend, Lauren Bacall gazed
serenely out at a roomful of interviewers like a cat eyeing a
not-particularly-challenging ball of yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Then one intrepid reporter posed the question: Did Bacall have
to audition for her part in CBS's miniseries ``Too Rich: The Secret
Life of Doris Duke''?
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh. ``Audition!'' hissed Bacall, nostrils flaring, eyes on
fire, playing the affronted movie queen to the hilt. ``Do you think
I spent my nightmare life in this business to audition now?''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bacall smiled to show she was kidding _ sort of. But the
room had been put on notice by the woman whose smoky inscrutability
and sultry yet commanding voice first captivated Humphrey Bogart
(and the rest of the world) in 1944's ``To Have and To Have Not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, you have it backwards,'' executive producer Robert
Sertner put in hastily. ``She auditioned us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacall plays Duke, a tobacco heiress who died in 1993 under
suspicious circumstances, in a two-part biopic that starts Sunday
at 9 p.m. and concludes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, Duke is hovering near death, and her
caretaker, a sinister butler played by Richard Chamberlain, does
not appear to be exactly rooting for her recovery. In flashbacks
from the heiress's deathbed, viewers see the story of Duke's life,
including her inheritance of $100 million at age 13, and the many
romantic entanglements she succumbed to in a fruitless search for
love.
</P>
<P>
   Bacall said she met Duke only once, so she based her
characterization on biographies and documentaries about the
heiress. ``You get a sense of the kind of person she was, the kind
of life she led, which was not a happy one, in actual fact,''
Bacall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had a very difficult childhood and she was very
isolated in her childhood,'' Bacall added. `She had a mother who
hated her and was vicious to her. And she had a father who adored
her and overprotected her and told her that no one would ever love
for herself, but only for her money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacall's own life could scarcely have been more charmed. She has
delivered indelible performances in such classic films as ``The Big
Sleep,'' ``Key Largo,'' and ``Murder on the Orient Express.'' She
won the National Book Award in 1980 for her autobiography, ``By
Myself,'' and she also picked up a pair of Tonys for her work in
``Applause!'' and ``Woman of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Too Rich'' is Bacall's first miniseries, she has done
a fair amount of other work on television, including a guest stint
on Chamberlain's ``Dr. Kildare'' more than three decades ago.
Married to Bogart for 12 years till he died in 1957, she was also
married to Jason Robards, a union of actors that produced another
actor, son Sam Robards.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, of course, has a long track record in television as
the star of not just ``Dr. Kildare'' but of many of the medium's
most lavish miniseries (``Shogun,'' ``The Thorn Birds''). He
lamented the decline in the miniseries genre, noting that the
sprawling multinight epic has become increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too bad, because they were tremendous,'' said
Chamberlain. ``Or maybe it's not too bad; I wonder if anybody has
the attention span to watch them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Bacall consent to a television version of her own life?
``Over my dead body,'' she said emphatically, noting she has
rejected offers to film her autobiography. ``Nobody will. I don't
want anyone to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Why?'' she repeated witheringly. ``Because I don't. I did
not live my life so I could be exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the apparent contradiction of portraying someone
else's turbulent life and messy death, Bacall insisted that ``Too
Rich'' does not exploit Duke because it's not ``being done in a
negative way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the 74-year-old Bacall still seems to have
the typical actor's anxiety about where the next role will come
from. She wisecracked that her dream is ``to stay employed.'' After
her much-lauded stint in Barbra Streisand's ``The Mirror Has Two
Faces,'' Bacall said, she was ``the flavor of the month for about a
month, but then she realized ``how quickly they forget, and they
move on to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next Lauren Bacall will be hard to find. She issued a
pointed reminder of that when Sertner, the executive producer,
tried to explain why he chose Lindsay Frost to play the young Doris
Duke. Sertner said he picked Frost because of her resemblance to
the young Bacall, adding, ``And she has that voice down.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated next to him, speaking in the unforgetable timbre for
which she became famous, Bacall issued a non-negotiable demurral:
``She doesn't have the exact voice.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On an airport tarmac at one of the dreary final
stops of President George Bush's failing 1992 reelection campaign,
his eldest son, George W., glowered toward a small pool of
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seething. He was kind of rocking on his feet,''
recalled John Harwood, a mild-mannered Wall Street Journal reporter
who was surprised to discover that the son's anger was focused on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harwood had written nothing to trigger the reaction,
George W. was venting because Harwood's newspaper had run a
critical article on the business dealings of the three Bush sons.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Bush recalled late last week precisely what
had ticked him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A six-column story in the Wall Street Journal I thought was a
little much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tense moments on the tarmac passed, but they left Harwood
with the impression that ``Junior,'' as family friends called him,
was a hothead during his stint as a White House aide to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Bush, now governor of Texas, but he allowed that he
didn't shy away from offering ``blunt assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the son who pulls no punches and tells it like he thinks
it is,'' Barbara Bush told her diary.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the less flattering image of an impetuous George W.
that stuck in some Washington minds after his father's 1992 defeat,
in part because so little was known about the son who had worked so
quietly in his father's shadow for years.
</P>
<P>
   George W. was his dad's alter ego and trusted agent for
unpleasant jobs, such as telling White House chief of staff John
Sununu that it was time to leave and telling off campaign aides he
considered to be disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejects talk (''Psychobabble,'' he calls it) of the two
George W.'s: then, a quick-tempered, behind-the-scenes aide; now, a
campaign veteran praised, even by foes, as affable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the same person,'' said Bush, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is aware of conventional wisdom that pegged him
as impulsive and heading for the boiling point when he took on
popular Democratic incumbent Ann Richards, she of the rapier wit,
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying, 'He'll blow his stack,' `` said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Stack intact, he won and was re-elected governor in a landslide
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as an invited guest along with other members of the
National Governors Association, he will return to his dad's old
place at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as the king of the unannounced
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Associates and observers from Bush's previous Washington stints
are as surprised as Bush claims he is.
</P>
<P>
   Good ol' boy
</P>
<P>
   Some of the inner circle from his father's White House days say
they never dreamed that George W. would soon become a political
force on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood in the back of a lot of rooms together, watching his
father make speeches,'' recalled Marlin Fitzwater, who served as
the Bush White House press secretary. ``I always thought he had
good sense and good political savvy, but I never thought he'd run
for office because I never heard him talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard him weigh in on issues,'' said Fitzwater.
</P>
<P>
   It was another Bush son, Jeb, now governor of Florida, who
talked politics. George W. preferred regaling listeners with his
encyclopedic knowledge of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up wanting to be president of the United States.
I grew up wanting to be Willie Mays,'' Bush said in what has become
a stock answer to the stock questions about why, having long ago
realized he couldn't hit the curve, he now wants the White House
job.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News anchor Brit Hume, who watched the Bush White House as a
correspondent for ABC-TV, said the younger Bush fit neatly into the
``good ol' boy'' mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some political instincts and advised his father from
time to time, and sometimes did dirty work for his father,'' said
Hume. ``I would not have predicted from knowing him that he would
have emerged as the figure that he has emerged as. I would have
figured that the comer in the family was Jeb.''
</P>
<P>
   The dirty work included the sacking of Sununu, who had played a
key role in getting the elder Bush elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way. I wasn't freelancing,'' Bush recalled
recently about the firing of Sununu, who the White House thought
had become a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, now a top aide in the budding presidential campaign of
Dan Quayle, the elder Bush's vice president, claims it won't be a
grudge match if the younger Bush gets in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I have no conflict with George W., contrary to
what the press has been saying,'' Sununu, a former New Hampshire
governor, said in his home state this month as he escorted Quayle
to pre-campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   The lousy time
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the governor and the Wall Street Journal's
Harwood have marveled together at the turn of events that led
another Bush to the verge of a Republican presidential campaign.
Bush smoothed over his 1992 anger toward Harwood by saying he had
``no hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lousy time and I was defending my dad,'' Harwood said
Bush told him.
</P>
<P>
   So lousy, in fact, that Barbara Bush's tell-it-like-it-is son
revealed a rough edge on other occasions. At the Republican
National Convention in Houston, he stormed out of an interview with
a Salt Lake City TV station when the reporter asked about his
father's marital fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remembers walking off, but says it happened after a
reporter questioned the elder Bush's commitment to family values
because ``you have three crooks in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   And when introduced to ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Gary Trudeau,
he poured out his displeasure at the comic strip creator for
lampooning his father. Bush, who knew Trudeau when they were Yale
undergrads, recently recalled the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suggested George Bush had put his manhood in a blind
trust,'' said the younger Bush. ``I told him I didn't particularly
care for that type of assessment of a good man. I don't think I was
rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the history of blunt assessing, predictions that Bush
would lose control in his own campaigns proved wrong. In 1994, he
ran a respectful campaign against Richards in the face of her
effort to paint him as a rich kid armed with a famous name and
little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing waiting to snap,'' insists GOP consultant Mary
Matalin, who worked closely with George W. in three of his father's
races. ``I thought of it less as anger than as speaking with
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Correct, says Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never going to fly off the handle as a candidate,'' he
says now, acknowledging he got much closer to the boiling point as
a campaign operative than he did as a candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if 'fly off the handle' is the right word, but I
occasionally defended my dad's position. Occasionally somebody
needed to be told. When you have somebody (on the campaign) leaking
information to make themselves look big, I told them I didn't
appreciate that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt assessment ``doesn't mean temper,'' Bush insists. ``I
never had a temper. Have I ever been angry? Sure. Haven't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty straightforward person. Maybe people in
Washington are used to double talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One former Bush aide in Texas believes the governor's anger
might be tested anew if he gets into the White House derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to have to re-learn how to take a punch. And as a
presidential candidate you have to throw some back,'' said the
ex-aide.
</P>
<P>
   The new George W.
</P>
<P>
   Deny it though he might, potential presidential candidate George
W. Bush is a different package than was presidential aide George W.
Bush, according to some in the family's extended political family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there was one who grew politically, it was George
W.,'' said Vic Gold, a close family ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was like Prince Hal and Henry V,'' he said of
Shakespeare's playboy character who became a serious king.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that he ever caroused,'' Gold quickly added.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what George W. might have done in his self-dubbed
``young and irresponsible'' years he has attempted to put off
limits. He does, however, have experience in dealing with sensitive
personal issues. In 1987, he was dispatched to snuff out adultery
rumors about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to the 'Big A' question is N-O,'' he told Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has acknowledged he drank too much until he quit at
age 40, has declared himself a faithful husband but has not offered
details about his distant past. It's a defensive posture that could
be tested if he runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's saying is 'I don't have anything to hide, but I'm
also not going to spend every day talking about every detail about
my previous life,' `` said Robert Teeter, the pollster who managed
the 1992 Bush presidential campaign. ``I think that works as long
as somebody doesn't uncover something that shows he wasn't telling
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has treated the personal conduct issue cautiously,
saying only that President Clinton's sexual scandals were
``embarrassing,'' but remaining silent on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had two stints as an aide to his father. In 1987 and 1988,
he moved from Midland to be ``kind of a general ombudsman'' for the
Bush presidential campaign. He returned for the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the eyes and ears for my dad to a certain extent,'' he
said. ``I wasn't a spy, but I was there to keep a watchful eye on
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint, his office was across a hall from Lee
Atwater, his father's top political adviser. In her memoir, Barbara
Bush said George W. and the late Atwater were ``great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush says he was never shy about making sure Atwater, like
everyone in the White House, understood the mission _ particularly
after Atwater appeared on the cover of Esquire magazine with his
pants around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded Lee he was working for George Bush. I didn't
appreciate the picture or the story. My dad didn't appreciate the
picture or the story. And worse, my mother didn't appreciate the
picture or the story,'' said Bush. ``My dad expected there to be
certain conduct during the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush headed to Dallas to serve as managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team after his father was
elected in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But he returned to Washington for what he calls ``the defense of
the incumbency'' in 1992. His title was senior adviser and he said
his job was to ``make sure of everybody's agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In a part of Washington that Bush, a loyalty freak, intensely
dislikes, the candidate's agenda is not always the agenda of
everyone in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the agendas get confused,'' he said. ``I had one
agenda, and that was the best interests of George H.W. Bush. I told
some people in the '92 campaign that I didn't appreciate them
trying to climb off the good ship George Bush before it docked.
And, yes, I occasionally told a member of the press corps that I
didn't like the way they were treating my father.''
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day 1992, when the good ship George Bush ran
aground, Barbara Bush got the news from her eldest child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In late afternoon,'' she recalled in her memoir, ``George W.
told us, based on exit polls, it was over. We would lose. Our boys
had killed themselves for us.''

   CLEMENS-YANKEES CLEMENS ADDS INVINCIBILITY TO MIGHTY (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They were the best baseball team of the past half
century, maybe the best team ever, and that wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees aren't coming off a 162-0 season, so they
had almost no choice but to add a pitcher who is on his way to the
Hall of Fame. Before Roger Clemens gets to Cooperstown, he'd like a
detour to the World Series. Nobody is more qualified than the
Yankees to show him the way.
</P>
<P>
   Arming the Yankees with Clemens to defend their 1998 World
Series championship is like using a sledgehammer to kill an ant. To
make such overkill possible, the Yankees had to subtract
left-hander David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   And lefty reliever Graeme Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   And second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And ... And ... And?
</P>
<P>
   That's it? That's all the Yankees had to sacrifice to pry
Clemens away from the Toronto Blue Jays?
</P>
<P>
   One day, Yankees pitchers and catchers are getting ready to
descend upon Florida for spring training. The next, the Yankees
have crushed whatever hopes and dreams the rest of the American
League may have had for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are the windshield. The rest of the AL is the bug.
The Yankees are Microsoft. The rest of the AL is Apple. The Yankees
are the Roadrunner. The rest of the AL is the Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Without compromising their future one bit, the Yankees added yet
another layer to their aura of invincibility. The Yankees went
125-50 without Clemens, who is the only five-time Cy Young Award
winner in major-league history. And it's not like Clemens is
staggering toward the finish line of his career. At 36, Clemens is
fresh off consecutive Cy Young seasons. His record the past two
seasons: 41-13. His earned run average: 2.33.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Cashman was walking around the Yankees'
Tampa headquarters Thursday wearing sunglasses. After what Cashman
pulled over on the Blue Jays, he should have been wearing a mask.
Even at gunpoint, though, it's hard to imagine how the Blue Jays
surrendered _ and that is the operative word _ Clemens without
receiving any of the Yankees' prized young players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cashman had the good sense not to gloat publicly about
landing Clemens without giving up pitchers Ramiro Mendoza or Andy
Pettitte, outfielder Ricky Ledee or '98 slugging sensation Shane
Spencer. Cashman is 31, and he plans on being around a while. And
you never know. Cashman may need to do business with the Blue Jays
again. The day may come when he needs to pry away Jose Cruz Jr. for
Ledee and/or a case of jockstraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you hate to give up players the caliber of the ones
we sent to Toronto, especially David Wells,'' Cashman said. ``But
when you have the chance to add one of the greatest pitchers in the
game to your staff, you have to make sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   As sacrifices go, this is on the scale of Roseanne giving up
singing the national anthem in public. Look at what the Yankees
gave up for a right-hander who led the AL in ERA and strikeouts
while tying for the lead in victories: A loopy 35-year-old
left-hander who keeps himself in about as good a shape as the
typical slow-pitch left fielder. A 31-year-old reliever whose
collected works from the '98 regular season and playoffs amounted
to 39 innings. And a 26-year-old second baseman who had 71 at-bats
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Wells was the leader of the Yankees' staff last
season. He went 18-4, threw a perfect game and was almost
infallible during the playoffs. Wells loved being a Yankee. He
thrived on the atmosphere at Yankee Stadium. He made a love
connection with the raucous fans. He was the best left-hander in
the AL last year, maybe in all of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His best still doesn't elevate him into the stratosphere of
Clemens. In the year of his life, Wells put up a 3.49 ERA. Clemens
has a career ERA of 2.95. Wells has a career record of 124-89.
Clemens is 233-124, with a career ERA one run lower than Wells.
Boomer is a party animal whose physical skills are liable to erode
overnight. The Rocket is a workout warrior in the Tom Seaver/Nolan
Ryan mold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the spin of Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash make
you dizzy. Ash can talk all he wants about the wonders of trading
one player to fill three positions. Lloyd and Bush are strictly
throw-ins. As effective as Lloyd was (1.67 ERA) in spot duty last
season, he was a microscopic part of the Yankees' success. Yankees
manager Joe Torre called on Lloyd to get four outs in 13 postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, put up a .380 average that will prove to be
a mirage. He was Chuck Knoblauch's caddy _ nothing more, nothing
less. Keep in mind, this is what Bush did in his last minor-league
season: .258, five homers, 17 stolen bases. Bush just might turn
out to be a slight upgrade over Craig Grebek. No wonder AL rivals
flinched when word of the trade circulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, considering what they did last year,'' Detroit
general manager Randy Smith said. ``They're not invincible, but
they've bettered themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only reasonable concern for the Yankees is finding
somebody who will respond to the postseason the way Wells always
has (8-1, 2.33 ERA). Clemens is 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA in nine
postseason starts. He hasn't won a World Series. He hasn't been to
the World Series since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clemens always had to carry his team to the playoffs
when he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox. His arm was beyond
tired by the time October arrived. Pitching in a rotation that
already has David Cone, Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Hideki
Irabu, the only weight Clemens will have to carry is his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he brings a little bit of hunger,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of hunger that will serve the Yankees well. The
rich didn't merely get richer. The rich made themselves as close to
bullet-proof as a team can be.

CLEMENS ADDS INVINCIBILITY TO MIGHTY YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Refiling to those needing.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ They were the best baseball team of the past half
century, maybe the best team ever, and that wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees aren't coming off a 162-0 season, so they
had almost no choice but to add a pitcher who is on his way to the
Hall of Fame. Before Roger Clemens gets to Cooperstown, he'd like a
detour to the World Series. Nobody is more qualified than the
Yankees to show him the way.
</P>
<P>
   Arming the Yankees with Clemens to defend their 1998 World
Series championship is like using a sledgehammer to kill an ant. To
make such overkill possible, the Yankees had to subtract
left-hander David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   And lefty reliever Graeme Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   And second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And ... And ... And?
</P>
<P>
   That's it? That's all the Yankees had to sacrifice to pry
Clemens away from the Toronto Blue Jays?
</P>
<P>
   One day, Yankees pitchers and catchers are getting ready to
descend upon Florida for spring training. The next, the Yankees
have crushed whatever hopes and dreams the rest of the American
League may have had for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are the windshield. The rest of the AL is the bug.
The Yankees are Microsoft. The rest of the AL is Apple. The Yankees
are the Roadrunner. The rest of the AL is the Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   Without compromising their future one bit, the Yankees added yet
another layer to their aura of invincibility. The Yankees went
125-50 without Clemens, who is the only five-time Cy Young Award
winner in major-league history. And it's not like Clemens is
staggering toward the finish line of his career. At 36, Clemens is
fresh off consecutive Cy Young seasons. His record the past two
seasons: 41-13. His earned run average: 2.33.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Cashman was walking around the Yankees'
Tampa headquarters Thursday wearing sunglasses. After what Cashman
pulled over on the Blue Jays, he should have been wearing a mask.
Even at gunpoint, though, it's hard to imagine how the Blue Jays
surrendered _ and that is the operative word _ Clemens without
receiving any of the Yankees' prized young players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cashman had the good sense not to gloat publicly about
landing Clemens without giving up pitchers Ramiro Mendoza or Andy
Pettitte, outfielder Ricky Ledee or '98 slugging sensation Shane
Spencer. Cashman is 31, and he plans on being around a while. And
you never know. Cashman may need to do business with the Blue Jays
again. The day may come when he needs to pry away Jose Cruz Jr. for
Ledee and/or a case of jockstraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, you hate to give up players the caliber of the ones
we sent to Toronto, especially David Wells,'' Cashman said. ``But
when you have the chance to add one of the greatest pitchers in the
game to your staff, you have to make sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   As sacrifices go, this is on the scale of Roseanne giving up
singing the national anthem in public. Look at what the Yankees
gave up for a right-hander who led the AL in ERA and strikeouts
while tying for the lead in victories: A loopy 35-year-old
left-hander who keeps himself in about as good a shape as the
typical slow-pitch left fielder. A 31-year-old reliever whose
collected works from the '98 regular season and playoffs amounted
to 39 innings. And a 26-year-old second baseman who had 71 at-bats
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Wells was the leader of the Yankees' staff last
season. He went 18-4, threw a perfect game and was almost
infallible during the playoffs. Wells loved being a Yankee. He
thrived on the atmosphere at Yankee Stadium. He made a love
connection with the raucous fans. He was the best left-hander in
the AL last year, maybe in all of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   His best still doesn't elevate him into the stratosphere of
Clemens. In the year of his life, Wells put up a 3.49 ERA. Clemens
has a career ERA of 2.95. Wells has a career record of 124-89.
Clemens is 233-124, with a career ERA one run lower than Wells.
Boomer is a party animal whose physical skills are liable to erode
overnight. The Rocket is a workout warrior in the Tom Seaver/Nolan
Ryan mold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the spin of Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash make
you dizzy. Ash can talk all he wants about the wonders of trading
one player to fill three positions. Lloyd and Bush are strictly
throw-ins. As effective as Lloyd was (1.67 ERA) in spot duty last
season, he was a microscopic part of the Yankees' success. Yankees
manager Joe Torre called on Lloyd to get four outs in 13 postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for his part, put up a .380 average that will prove to be
a mirage. He was Chuck Knoblauch's caddy _ nothing more, nothing
less. Keep in mind, this is what Bush did in his last minor-league
season: .258, five homers, 17 stolen bases. Bush just might turn
out to be a slight upgrade over Craig Grebek. No wonder AL rivals
flinched when word of the trade circulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, considering what they did last year,'' Detroit
general manager Randy Smith said. ``They're not invincible, but
they've bettered themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only reasonable concern for the Yankees is finding
somebody who will respond to the postseason the way Wells always
has (8-1, 2.33 ERA). Clemens is 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA in nine
postseason starts. He hasn't won a World Series. He hasn't been to
the World Series since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clemens always had to carry his team to the playoffs
when he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox. His arm was beyond
tired by the time October arrived. Pitching in a rotation that
already has David Cone, Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Hideki
Irabu, the only weight Clemens will have to carry is his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he brings a little bit of hunger,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of hunger that will serve the Yankees well. The
rich didn't merely get richer. The rich made themselves as close to
bullet-proof as a team can be.

SONNY AND CHER -- FROM SONNY'S POINT OF VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, Feb. 22, 1999 and thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ For his portrayal of the late Sonny Bono in
``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story,'' Jay Underwood
got to wear _ and here the actor's voice soars past excitement all
the way to awe _ Bono's (itals)original bobcat vest.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``The strangest kind of feeling went through you,'' Underwood
marveled as he recalled donning the sacred garment. ``You put on
something like that, how could you not, you know, feel like you're
getting into the part even that much more?''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the creators of ``And the Beat Goes On'' (Monday, 9
p.m., ABC) knew they were getting a true believer when they plucked
the unknown Underwood from a casting call to play Sonny, along with
the equally little-known Renee Faia as Cher.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising, given that the docudrama's executive
producer, Larry Thompson, was Bono's attorney, manager, and friend.
Thompson describes ``And the Beat Goes On'' as a ``loving tribute''
to Bono, killed last year in a skiing accident at age 62, and
acknowledges it's the story of Sonny and Cher from Bono's point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man lived through many years when he was `Sonny
Bonehead','' Thompson said. ``He was thought to be the loser of the
group. He lived through decades of that, and certainly proved by
the time of his death that he had many careers in him, and that he
was sort of the guiding light and the tenacity that made Sonny and
Cher happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny Bono was a winner, and that's what our movie says,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Cher? Although Congresswoman Mary Bono, Sonny's
third wife, who replaced him in Congress, had input into the film,
Cher did not. Moreover, the film is based on Bono's autobiography,
and made by a man, Thompson, who represented Sonny in his divorce
from Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Already accused by some of trying to capitalize on Sonny's
death, does Cher now have reason to worry about image damage from
her portrayal in this biopic?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very fair to Cher,'' insisted Thompson. ``I mean,
you have to watch it and make that decision, but it's certainly
truthful and certainly accurate. And I hope Cher is very pleased
with it. I really do . . . I hope she likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Faia, who plays Cher, said she tried to portray her as ``the
strong presence, this independent, free spirit'' that blossomed
after the early years when ``she did go along with a lot of Sonny's
ideas and dreams, and he encouraged her and nurtured her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Underwood, he was determined to portray a Sonny Bono for
whom he has ``utmost respect,'' noting that even while he was
dismissed as a lightweight, Bono was orchestrating the duo's
successful career in music and television, and then going on to
forge his own career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds kind of cliched or just kind of simple, but he never
gave up, you know?'' said Underwood. ``He was absolutely tenacious.
. . . He would never allow himself to be knocked down for very
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono himself tried to interest Fox in a four-hour miniseries
about Sonny and Cher several years ago, but the project was put
into ``turnaround,'' Hollywood code for ``don't call us, we'll call
you.'' Thompson acknowledged that Bono's death heightened interest
in his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Sonny's death brought his face and name and legacy
and Cher to the media's attention,'' he said. ``And there's
certainly a lot more interest in it now than there may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson maintained there is a ``timeless'' quality to the
duo's story. ``It's about people who love each other and how they
grow together and how they grow apart,'' he said. ``And it's about
Americana and music during an era that we all have nostalgia for
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Faia is a former art student who worked as a costumer on
``Seinfeld'' during its first season and came late to acting. She
had only two weeks to prepare for the role from the time she was
cast. So Faia spent late nights studying tapes of Cher's talk-show
appearances, old episodes of ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'' and
``The Sonny and Cher Show,'' and footage of the duo's early
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Faia laughingly noted that while Underwood had to wear 19
different false noses during shooting to portray Bono, she needed
no such help (though she did wear a dozen wigs, and she does
lip-synch to vocals provided by a professional singer).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been told I look like a lot of people, and Cher was one
of them,'' she said. ``When this all came about, I knew that I
could do this.''

ACTION FEATURE `RONIN' FILLS DVD-ROM VOID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ OK, let's do the math: There are something like 1.3
million DVD players sitting atop televisions and stereo systems in
America, swelling to perhaps 2.3 million by year's end.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But 5 million computers already have been sold with DVD-ROM
drives, with as many as 30 million expected by year's end. The
DVD-ROM drives allow owners to not only use any CD, CD-ROM or DVD
movie, but to also run prodigiously sized computer games,
multimedia and other material on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's say you're a movie company with a stunt- and
chase-filled little action film that did decent but not amazing box
office last fall, like, say ``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you just drop your nice little movie on the DVD market, to
compete against the 2,500 or so other titles already there? Or do
you figure out a way to differentiate it, adding features that will
appeal to all those computer owners with DVD-ROM drives who don't
just want to watch a movie on their PC?
</P>
<P>
   Well, MGM Home Entertainment figured that decision was a
no-brainer, even if few others have followed suit (a notable
exception being last fall's feature-laden ``Lost in Space'' disc).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost nothing out there for DVD-ROM,'' said MGM Home
Entertainment marketing manager Dave Miller. ``You've got guys out
there with 300-MHz, 400-MHz machines and nothing to watch on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM hopes to remedy that, at least slightly. So you can buy the
``Ronin'' disc (it hits the market Tuesday), pop it into your DVD
player and watch storied director John Frankenheimer put pros like
Robert De Niro through their paces in a brisk action thriller set
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can drop it into your computer's DVD-ROM drive and on
March 14 watch something really cool: novel hybrid programming
using the Internet, film outtakes cached on the disc and
Frankenheimer's just-created running commentary on the creation of
the film and its much-lauded stunts and chases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sending out what we think is the first truly convergent
product,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Ronin'' wasn't a hugely successful picture, Miller said
it was chosen as a test case because ``it's definitely a guy's
movie, and with Frankenheimer, you have a film director who's
passionate about talking about his craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankenheimer's discussion will be partly based on questions
submitted by fans as they register their discs in the weeks before
the show, said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Those suggestions will be edited down to a 25-minute audio
program with software ``hooks'' embedded in it. When the program
starts playing over the Internet, those hooks will trigger movie
scenes and outtakes on the disc to illustrate Frankenheimer's
points, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That trick will largely eliminate lag time in the program's
transmission, despite its data-dense nature. Afterward,
Frankenheimer (whose credits include the brilliant Cold War
artifact ``The Manchurian Candidate'') will take part in an
hourlong online chat session.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great idea, intriguing enough to draw participation by
Microsoft, which is providing the computer power needed to handle
the expected online audience. And with 8,000 films in MGM's
library, it could be the start of a lot of intriguing new
productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is flexible, as long as we get (the outtakes and
software triggers) into the machine ahead of time,'' Miller said.
``If we think ahead and have all the material put on the disc to
play with, then we can come back to have a talk later. If there's
enough interest in this, we see it as a model for the future.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The music of Wire
</P>
<P>
   One of the fun things about reading Wired magazine over the
years has been the ``Colophon'' section tucked in the back of the
book. Most of the fine print there is devoted to geek-speak about
the hardware, software and other production details behind the
magazine's creation.
</P>
<P>
   But at the bottom is a paragraph highlighting what really made
the magazine possible _ the creative fuel for the month, as it
were.
</P>
<P>
   This month's list included such things as cranberry-date oat
cakes, Squaw Valley, jackhammers and lukewarm Perrier. The list
also usually includes a few interesting albums. Tracking down those
musical references has sometimes led to a great new find, or the
reclamation of a neglected old favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In something of the same way, Wired and Rhino Records have
issued a CD called ``Musical Futurists,'' an offbeat collection
that brings together such out-there artists as lounge god Esquivel,
free jazz freak/prophet Sun Ra, pop iconoclast Todd Rundgren,
hip-hop folkie Beck, ambient wizard Brian Eno and turntable titan
DJ Spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Several well-annotated pages of liner notes explain why each
artist is included in an album that aims to spotlight those who
used technology to create new genres and widely influence other
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the contributions of the artists on this disc, the
music you listen to ... would be very, very different,'' writes
Colin Berry, Wired's music editor.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Though it's a somewhat unlikely compilation _
further leavened with such creative forces as Devo, Tangerine
Dream, Sonic Youth, Laurie Anderson, Steve Reich and Thomas Dolby _
it generally does a good job achieving its goals.
</P>
<P>
   I might quibble with the Rundgren song choice _ ``International
Feel/Never Never Land'' is hardly the most representative or
interesting song in his vast catalog. But including Anderson's ``O
Superman (For Massenet)'' and Godley &AMP; Creme's transcendent ``Cry''
overcomes any sins.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, the album spotlights an array of musicians,
virtually all of whom deserve further investigation, who broke
ground in both music and technology in wildly different genres.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, despite the wide variety, the album indeed somehow
hangs together ``like a great mixed tape, a disc you'd be happy to
pop in for a reprieve from what's spewing from the music-video
channel or commercial-radio frequencies.''
</P>
<P>
   No spew here. Just the real stuff. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Veterans wanted
</P>
<P>
   Veterans have long told their war stories, but now, they have a
place to put them, in the California Military Museum in Sacramento.
The state-owned museum is looking for personal stories, photos and
other memorabilia from California veterans that it can include on
its Web site at (www.militarymuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   If you have material you think may be appropriate, contact the
museum at webmastermilitarymuseum.org, or write to California
Military Museum, attention: CSM Dan Sebby, Web site manager, 1119
Second St., Sacramento, Calif. 93814. You can also call the museum
at (916) 442-2883.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Web site already has an extensive amount of
information, including histories of California military
installations, units and ships; an events calendar; an online
bookstore and lengthy listings of links to other military history
sites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Look ma, no wires
</P>
<P>
   PlayStation gamers chafing at the short leash of their
controllers will welcome Doc's new wireless pair of dual-analog
controllers, which it's selling for a little less than $60 in most
major toy and gaming outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The controllers communicate by infrared beams with a port that
plugs into one of the PlayStation's two controller slots. A
``sleep'' mode conserves the two AAA batteries needed for each
controller.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with a TV remote control, you don't have to point the
device directly at the port to make it work, which is good for
those of us who believe body English will actually help you avoid
that oncoming monster. It has a range of about 30 feet.

AND THE BEAT GOES ON: THE SONNY AND CHER STORY 
Starring: Renee Faia, Jay Underwood 
On: ABC, Monday, 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the recipe on the back of Ritz cracker boxes for
something called ``Mock Apple Pie,'' apparently meant for those who
love apple pie but don't like real apples? Well Monday night ABC is
serving up a made-for-TV movie called ``And the Beat Goes On: The
Sonny and Cher Story'' that's about as appetizing and genuine and
fresh as a slice of Ritz's fakeriffic dessert. It's for people who
love biopics, but don't like anything approaching original
dialogue, true-to-life characters, well-observed nostalgia, or
convincing drama. Executive produced by Sonny Bono's widow, Rep.
Mary Bono, ``And the Beat Goes On'' is so hackneyed and skewed in
favor of Sonny that it's almost fascinating to behold its bold
artificiality _ almost. Mostly, watching the movie is like sitting
in for two hours of impersonation workshop.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that ``And the Beat Goes On'' rehashes only the
most overused tidbits about the singing duo, from Sonny's early
days as a meat delivery boy to the pair's triumphant TV series.
It's that their tale of corrupted innocence, from the manic 1960s
to the fractured 1970s, is presented with minimal gusto or kitsch.
There's only a sense of obligatory forward motion. In a handful of
scenes, Sonny and Cher rise from performing in a tacky bowling
alley to living in a fabulous Bel Air mansion after ``I Got You
Babe'' has reached No. 1 on the charts. And then in a handful of
scenes the duo are down and out of fashion, with Cher bitterly
noting, ``The boy-girl crap just doesn't cut it anymore.'' But
then, in another handful of scenes, they're back on top with ``The
Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'' and their famous banter. It's all one
big biopic cliche, with a dashed-off voiceover that has Sonny
saying scrappy things like, ``I never quit trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movie's costumes and haircuts are eye-catching, as
the couple's bell bottoms and vests seem to sprout fur in the very
strangest of places. Cher's hair goes through all the fun and
familiar phases, from her early bangs to her Pocahontas sleekness,
and we even get a glimpse of her doing her ``V-A-M-P, Vamp'' skit
from the early 1970s. Too bad the period color doesn't get any more
vivid than that, as most of the drama seems to take place in a
low-budget vacuum that contains only two characters. Cher's mother
is portrayed (extremely unappealingly) in only one scene, the
couple's daughter Chastity is seen briefly from behind, and Mary
Bono makes a laughably triumphant appearance at the end. There is a
steady flow of actors imitating music celebrities, including Sam
Cooke, Phil Spector, and David Geffen, but the cameos are never
grotesque or clever. Only Walter Franks takes his Little Richard
characterization and runs with it _ exactly where, I can't say, but
at least it's got oomph.
</P>
<P>
   As Cher, Renee Faia has the manner of her character down pat.
She's the best thing to look at in ``And the Beat Goes On,''
shaking her black hair back and tonguing her lips and rolling her
eyes with an almost mechanical precision. Because the point of the
movie is to portray Sonny as the star-maker and Cher as his
ingrateful creation, Faia's Cher gets lots of time to sulk and to
humiliate Sonny with lines like, ``I wish we were really big, like
Dylan or the Stones.'' Finally, when she sues him for divorce based
on ``involuntary servitude,'' the movie seems to have wrapped up
its case against her, and we flash forward to the 1980s, with Cher
looking humble and emotional as she is reunites with Sonny on David
Letterman's show. Jay Underwood's Sonny is less effective, partly
because the real Sonny wasn't as entertaining as Cher, but mostly
because Underwood doesn't quite nail Sonny's knowing cluelessness.
He invests his character with a little too much sunny, childlike
innocence. After all, we can't forget that the tenacious mensch
with the Prince Valiant hairdo did go on to become a Congressman
from California.

 SAN FRANCISCO, Guatemala: not claim it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the case of Fred Sandberg's pickup _ a gray 1996 Dodge
Ram 2500 extended cab with a diesel engine and four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Though vital parts of the truck's history are missing, nearly a
dozen interviews and an extensive search of Guatemalan computer
records and court files offer a general picture of how the truck
got here from Houston. The pickup's story shows how easy it is to
register a stolen vehicle in Guatemala and how nearly helpless
police are to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, 1996, four months after buying the truck, Sandberg
drove it from his Santa Fe, Texas, home to meet a friend for lunch
at a hotel in west Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back from lunch an hour later, and it was gone,''
recalls Sandberg, who promptly notified hotel security and then
reported the theft to Houston police. Sandberg collected the
insurance money but says he lost about $7,000 or $8,000 on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan customs records indicate the truck entered this
country July 22.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the anomalies begin. Import records show that the
truck entered Guatemala from El Salvador, which lies south of
Guatemala. No one can explain how a truck from Texas got to El
Salvador first. El Salvador has no Atlantic port, so shipping the
car from Houston would prove problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan police say they believe the car was driven to Central
America and the customs paperwork falsified to show the port of
entry as El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other paperwork was also doctored. The title
presented to Guatemalan customs officials did not name Sandberg as
the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it listed another man and gave an address on ``Karson
St., USA TX.'' The omission of a city name in the address did not
catch the attention of Guatemalan customs inspectors, many of whom
do not speak English.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle identification number given for the truck was
correct, however. Had customs officials run a check on the number,
they would have learned that the vehicle had been reported stolen
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The official paperwork shows the truck was brought to Guatemala
by Manuel Romero Veliz, who declared it worth $31,000 and paid
$6,500 in import taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, a cattle farmer on the southern coast of Guatemala,
declined to be interviewed for this story. But his attorney said
that Romero bought the truck from another man, who drove it from
the United States. The attorney refused to name the man who
imported the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping the truck for about 1 1/2 years, Romero sold it to
Walter Montejo, the treasurer of the town of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Romero) assured me it wasn't stolen,'' Montejo said,
adding that he paid Romero about $25,000 for the truck. Police note
that Montejo makes less than $200 per month at his job as San
Francisco's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, police based in Guatemala City who were working with
Salazar drove to the northern part of the country to search for
stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They pulled over Montejo driving a Mitsubishi pickup, which,
they said, turned out to be stolen. A few days later, police went
to Montejo's house, where they reported finding two other stolen
vehicles _ a Suzuki Sidekick and Sandberg's Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained Montejo, but the case against him quickly
disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Citing lack of evidence, local prosecutors declined to bring
charges, and he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Sandberg learned that his stolen Dodge Ram had
turned up in Guatemala. By then, he had long since been paid off by
his insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from some outfit in California that supposedly
was going to help me recover it,'' Sandberg said. ``But it wasn't
mine to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he passed the information on to his insurance company.
According to Guatemalan court officials, no insurance
representative from the United States has so far expressed interest
in recovering the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   If no one from the United States recovers the truck within the
next few months, both Montejo and Romero have the right under
Guatemalan law to file claims for it. Romero is still listed as the
``owner'' in Guatemala, because the title transfer had not been
completed when police confiscated the truck from Montejo. Romero,
therefore, stands a better chance of getting it.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of seeing either man drive away in the Dodge Ram is
not a pleasant one for the Guatemalan police who confiscated the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out there impounding and impounding and impounding, but
then no one ever comes down to reclaim these cars,'' said one
Guatemalan officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts our confidence.''

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Plastic gloves are better than nothing when
you're scrubbing walls with harsh detergent or polishing silver,
but the liquid cleaners always seems to drip inside the gloves. To
avoid the itchy chemical reactions or to protect your nails from
paint or oil stains, slip your hands into the lotion called Gloves
in a Bottle. It isn't sticky like some other products, and lasts
for about four hours. And best of all, Miz Hot Tips discovered the
product acts like a paraffin wax treatment at a salon to
temporarily lock in moisture and make your hands feel softer.
</P>
<P>
   Gloves in a Bottle costs $4.95 for 2 ounces (about 60
applications), at Home Depot; Bed, Bath, and Beyond; and Sally
Beauty Supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   FRESH FROM THE FREEZER: For years (and years) we've been putting
baking soda in our garbage pails, down our garbage disposals and
keeping an open box in the fridge to absorb odors, even though it
was originally designed for baking. After 139 years, Arm &AMP; Hammer
finally recognized what we !ital!really!off! use it for and has
produced a new box with the same product called Arm &AMP; Hammer Baking
Soda Fridge &AMP; Freezer. The bright blue box is designed with cloth
filters that expose more baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), plus
it's got a patented flow-through action to absorb and lock in tough
odors, which means food will taste even fresher than before. No
matter which box you buy _ the standard baking soda or the Fridge &AMP;
Freezer variety _ you're supposed to replace it every six months.
</P>
<P>
   IF ONLY FLUFFY COULD FLUSH:!off! Potty training for kids is
difficult, but cats refuse to sit on the toilet, much less put the
lid down when they're finished. However, cleaning their sandbox is
a bit easier with a new cat litter called Scoop 'N Flush by Cat's
Pride. It's made from recycled paper _ just like toilet paper _
dissolves quickly in the toilet bowl, won't clog pipes, yet feels
like traditional clay cat litters.
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips also liked its wild cherry fragrance and the news
that it's endorsed by the American Humane Association. Scoop 'N
Flush costs $5.99 for a 7-pound box at supermarkets and pet
stores. &QL;

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton finally played his first round of golf of 1999 the
other day. Despite the layoff, we bet he had some good lies.
</P>
<P>
   The president's recent golf game was played at the Army Navy
Country Club in Arlington, Va. Are the bunkers real there and the
water hazards mined?
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether hard feelings in Congress left by
impeachment can be overcome. The answer will be no if, on C-SPAN,
you hear them call each other ``The extinguished gentleman. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders will meet with Mr. Clinton next week to
talk about the 1999 legislative agenda. That was the one good thing
about the impeachment trial. It prevented risks like this.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton says she's giving ``careful thought'' to
running for the Senate from New York. Will she also think about
living there?
</P>
<P>
   Insiders think Mrs. Clinton eventually will decide not to run
for the Senate. For one thing, if she wants to replace Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, she doesn't own nearly enough bow ties.
</P>
<P>
   No previous first lady has held major elective office. Well,
unless you count the public choosing Jackie Kennedy as a
demi-goddess.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy has been sold at auction for
$255,500. Isn't that about what running backs today get paid per
touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   In less than 20 years, the proportion of meals Americans eat
away from home has jumped from 16 to 29 percent, it's reported.
Won't we lose our moral compass if we rear a generation that
doesn't get leftovers?
</P>
<P>
   A new study says Americans eat more healthful meals at home than
in restaurants. Duh. Isn't that why we eat out?
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner suggests eliminating adultery from the Ten
Commandments. This will surprise all the folks who didn't know it
was in there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show lots of new homes are being built across the
country. Great news for the home-repair industry.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft officials are found guilty in the current trial,
maybe they should be placed in solitary confinement _ a room
without Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are starting to criticize the details of Mr. Clinton's
plan to save Social Security. Well, it does seem odd that he hasn't
suggested putting Ken Starr's budget into the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand at the dawn of a new century,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Actually, we sit, regretting the computer we sit in front of wasn't
invented much earlier so the millennium bug could have been solved
by Y1K.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' says the president, ``cannot be everywhere or do
everything overseas.'' Unlike, say, McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Counsel Act expires this year and may be revised
or killed. We bet any new version will be called the Catch a
Falling Starr Act.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to put this all in perspective is to remember that
some day Kosovo probably will be as memorable as Quemoy and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another idea for saving Social Security: Make credit card
companies kick in a little of the interest Americans under, say,
50, are paying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where the future will take me,'' says Liddy Dole.
In our own case, we hope to have at least a little say in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDNEY AND TILLIE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after Sidney died, his widow, Tillie, was finally able
to speak about what a thoughtful and wonderful man her late husband
had been.
</P>
<P>
   `Sidney thought of everything,` she told them. `Just before he
died, Sidney called me to his bedside. He handed me three
envelopes. 'Tillie,' he told me, 'I have put all my last wishes in
these three envelopes. After I am dead, please open them and do
exactly as I have instructed. Then, I can rest in peace'.`
</P>
<P>
   `What was in the envelopes?` her friends asked.
</P>
<P>
   `The first envelope contained $5,000 with a note, 'Please use
this money to buy a nice casket.' So I bought a beautiful mahogany
casket with such a comfortable lining that I know Sidney is resting
very comfortably.`
</P>
<P>
   `The second envelope contained $10,000 with a note, 'Please use
this for a nice funeral.' I arranged Sidney a very dignified
funeral and bought all his favorite foods for everyone attending.`
</P>
<P>
   `And the third envelope?` asked her friends.
</P>
<P>
   `The third envelope contained $25,000 with a note, 'Please use
this to buy a nice stone'.`
</P>
<P>
   Holding her hand in the air, Tillie said, `So, do you like my
stone?` showing off her ten carat diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A minister gave a talk to the Lion's Club on sex. When he got
home he couldn't tell his wife that he had spoken on sex, so he
said he had discussed horseback riding with the members. A few days
later, she ran into some men at the shopping center and they
complimented her on the speech her husband had made.
</P>
<P>
   She said, `Yes, I heard. I was surprised about the subject
matter, as he's only tried it twice. The first time he got so sore
he could hardly walk, and the second time he fell off.`
</P>
<P>
   A man hasn't been feeling well, so he goes to his doctor for a
complete checkup. Afterward the doctor comes out with the results.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm afraid I have some very bad news,` the doctor says. `You're
dying, and you don't have much time left.`
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, that's terrible!` says the man. `How long have I got?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ten,` the doctor says sadly.
</P>
<P>
   `Ten?` the man asks. `Ten what? Months? Weeks? What?`
</P>
<P>
   `Nine...`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YOU'RE NOT COMING? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The housewife answered the phone and listened with relief to the
voice in her ear. `How are you, dear? What kind of day are you
having?`
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, mom, the baby won't eat, the washing machine is broke, I've
not been able to get out of the house to shop, I twisted my ankle
and have been hobbling around. On top of that, the house is a mess
and we're supposed to have two couples over for dinner tonite.`
</P>
<P>
   `Now dear, just stay calm. Sit down, relax, close your eyes, and
I'll be over in 1/2 hour. I'll do the shopping, clean up the house,
and cook your dinner for you. I'll take care of the baby when I get
there and call a repairman I know who'll get the washing machine
fixed. In fact, I'll call George at the office and tell him he
ought to come home and help out for once.`
</P>
<P>
   `George? Who's George?`
</P>
<P>
   `Why, that's your husband, dear.`
</P>
<P>
   `Mom, I don't have a husband.`
</P>
<P>
   `Is this 234-5678?`
</P>
<P>
   `Uh, no, it's not. I think you have a wrong number.` The
housewife paused.
</P>
<P>
   `Uhhh, does this mean you're not coming over?`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAKE UP CALL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Following an especially angry argument, Mr. and Mrs. Smith went
to bed not speaking to each other. Needing to arise early the
following morning, Mr. Smith left a note on his wife's bedside
table that said `Wake me at six.`
</P>
<P>
   An exasperated Mr. Smith awoke at ten the following morning and
rolled stiffly out of bed to see a note on his bedside table:
</P>
<P>
   `It's six, you bum! Get out of bed!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REMEMBER THE ALAMO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Texan, trying to impress a Bostonian with tales about the
heroes of the Alamo, said, `I'll bet you never had anyone so brave
around Boston.`
</P>
<P>
   `Ever hear of Paul Revere?` asked the Bostonian.
</P>
<P>
   `Paul Revere?` said the Texan. `Isn't he the guy who ran for
help?`
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshireman stops by a cafe for breakfast. After paying
the tab, he checks his pockets and leaves his tip-three pennies.
</P>
<P>
   As he strides toward the door, his waitress muses, only half to
herself: `You know, you can tell a lot about a man by the tip he
leaves.`
</P>
<P>
   The man turns around, curiosity getting the better of him. `Oh,
really? Tell me, what does my tip say?`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, this penny tells me you're a thrifty man.` Barely able to
conceal his pride, the man utters `Hmm, true enough.`
</P>
<P>
   `And this penny, it tells me you're a bachelor.` Surprised at
her perception,
</P>
<P>
   he says, `Well, that's true, too.`
</P>
<P>
   `And the third penny tells me that your father was one too.`

   NEW YORK _ At a dress rehearsal on Thursday for Tommy Hilfiger's
fall collection at Roseland, on West 52nd Street, Hilfiger watched
models test-walk the runway while the pop band Sugar Ray played him
a love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw your arms around me, Tommy,'' Mark McGrath, the band's
lead singer, crooned. Riffing on the lyrics for the band's 1997
hit, ``Fly,'' he swapped the fashion giant's first name for the
word ``baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the calm before the storm,'' Hilfiger told his
creative director, Stephen Cirona, as they headed backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger is calling 1999 ``The Year of Music,'' and although his
clothes have long been staples among hip-hop's cognoscenti, in the
past few seasons he has been recutting his image as a rock
supergroupie. He sponsored and designed the stage clothes for the
Rolling Stones' ``No Security'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   And the scene backstage at his show looked like a Lollapalooza
tour stop, only the road-ies were replaced with cover girls, and
everyone, smoking and drinking Heineken, was better dressed.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Hammett, the lead guitarist of Metallica, surfaced looking
snazzy in a black suit offset by an ivory-colored tie by Hilfiger.
The actress Andie MacDowell arrived in a slim royal blue leather
suit, also Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   In between television interviews, the 46-year-old designer
bumped into a childhood friend now known as Michael H., an aspiring
rock star with a group called Bender, dressed in a leather coat
with a fox collar and rose-tinted glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger invited his pal to the after-party at Brown's, a new
restaurant on East 61st Street, promising to make it to Bender's
midnight performance at Continental. Then he turned to Nur Khan,
designer of Sway, a new SoHo nightclub, and offered to stop by
there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the name,'' Hilfiger said. ``Sway'' is Track 2 on the
Rolling Stones' ``Sticky Fingers'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Ray kicked off the show promptly at 7:30. When it was
over, Karen Elson jumped onstage with two fellow models, dancing
and head-banging while the quintet finished its hit ``Every
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a band,'' Ms. MacDowell said, making her way backstage.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger took a limo to hop a few fashion fetes before he
arrived at his own after-party at Brown's, fashionably late at
10:15 p.m. Well-wishers applauded him. ``Thank you,'' he said to no
one in particular and high-fived Thomas Gibson, the ``Dharma and
Greg'' actor.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger pushed up the sleeves of his cashmere sweater _ the
only discernible sign he was loosening up. Lenny Kravitz shook his
hand, and then played air guitar to the Rolling Stones' ``Brown
Sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger took a passing glass of Cristal. MTV's Ananda Lewis
offered Andrew Levy of the Brand New Heavies a Tic Tac before
hopping onto his lap.
</P>
<P>
   On the cell phone, Hilfiger told Bridget Hall he was heading to
Continental to catch his friend's gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it cool if we roll down with you?'' a model asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Hilfiger said over his shoulder as he exited.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight at Continental, Hilfiger waited in the basement line
for the bathroom across from a sweaty teen-ager sporting an orange
Mohawk. After the band ripped through a 20-minute session, Hilfiger
left and found his brother Andy and Hammett waiting for him outside
a nearby McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we're going out,'' Hilfiger said, herding the crowd
to a first-anniversary party for the TriBeCa club Shine. ``We're
not here for the McVeggie burgers.''

DESPITE DEATH ON SLOPES, SKIING SEEN AS A SAFE SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Larry Glosten thought he taught his nine-year-old
daughter Madeline all he could about skiing safely. He taught her
to be cautious, not to go too fast, not to ski beyond her control.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Madeline lost control as she went down an
intermediate trail at Ski Plattekill in the northwestern Catskills.
According to her father, she had spent most of the day on easier
terrain, and wound up going too fast. She veered off the side of
the trail and crashed into a patch of small, scrubby trees.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered severe head injuries and died a day later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was feeling a little bit confident,'' Glosten said
from his apartment on the upper west side of Manhattan. ``You can
imagine that I think I didn't make her aware enough. That's the
fact ... she didn't understand. She made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the death of Madeline Glosten, experts say skiing is
predominantly safe _ much safer than bicycling, skateboarding or
recreational boating. But accidents do happen. And more and more,
parents are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is worry,'' said Mary Lane, a non-skier from Clifton
Park, N.Y., whose 13-year-old son Colin skis every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're getting the instruction and supervision,'' she
said. ``I know he's got good sense. (But) I'm afraid he's going to
crack his head open.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are worried enough to buy ski helmets for their
children. A few years ago, it was rare to see anybody but racers
wearing the light, padded plastic helmets on the slopes. Now,
they're so common store owners have dozens of models to chose from
and say they sell hundreds each year.
</P>
<P>
   But the helmets have their limits _ hit a tree going faster than
about 12 mph and a helmet will probably not make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Ski Area Association, child fatalities
are rare. Last winter, of 26 fatalities, only one involved anyone
age 10 or younger. The highest number of child fatalities in recent
years were two in both 1996-97 and 1993-94 _ still a small
percentage of overall ski deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A Rochester Institute of Technology professor, who has studied
ski accidents for years, found that the most likely candidate for
trouble is a male in his late teens to late 20s _ a
better-than-average skier traveling fast, usually on the edge of a
trail where the good snow is often found.
</P>
<P>
   Ski resorts say the best way to keep the child skier safe _ and
immune to the seduction of dangerous speeds _ is by taking a class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't impress upon them the dangers of skiing,'' said Jay
Barranger, director of Jiminy Peak's ski and snowboard school in
upstate New York. ``We impress upon them the act of skiing safe.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the ubiquitous Skier's Responsibility Code, which
asks all mountain riders to ski in control, give right-of-way to
skiers in front, not to obstruct a trail and observe all warning
signs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, there is still the risk, noted the mother of
the late Madeline Glosten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids fall and grownups fall, and there's this tiny percentage
where there's a disaster,'' Diana Shobrys said. ``And we got it.''

YO-YO MA GIVES A CELLO A NEW LEASE ON ITS FORMER LIFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands)   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Yo-Yo Ma records on a period cello for the
first time,'' a press release from Sony Classical proclaims of Ma's
latest CD, a collaboration with Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam
Baroque Orchestra in concertos by Boccherini and transcriptions of
Bach. Yes and no. In fact Ma has long played a ``period'' cello, or
rather two of them: the Davidoff Stradivarius, from 1712, and a
Montagnana, from 1733.
</P>
<P>
   So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Ma's cellos, like most string instruments of similar vintage,
were modernized over the centuries: fitted with end-pins, allowing
them to be propped on the floor rather than cradled between the
knees, wider fingerboards and steel strings, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the Sony recording and for a series of concerts with
Koopman and the orchestra beginning Sunday afternoon at Avery
Fisher Hall, Ma has reversed the course of evolution on his
Stradivarius, restoring it to a condition that he calls ``75
percent virginal.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might suspect that Ma simply is looking for an excuse to
take up the six Bach cello suites all over again, now that he has
recorded them a second time in versions released a year ago,
complete with multimedia interpretations on video. Not that anyone
who heard Ma play the suites on the Montagnana instrument last
March at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan would be
likely to complain if he did so.
</P>
<P>
   Others might accuse Ma of resorting to gimmickry, as some have
done before: notably, a few years ago, when he joined forces with
Mark O'Connor, a country fiddler, and Edgar Meyer, a bassist, in a
Sony crossover album, ``Appalachia Waltz.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is he just trying to keep up with his longtime friend and
colleague Emanuel Ax, who has recently been performing and
recording Chopin concertos on a period piano? Ma explains matters
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes this profession work, to me, is to make
sure that everything you do is special or different, that you never
repeat something,'' the 43-year-old Ma said last week at the
Harvard University Faculty Club here. ``It's the opposite of mass
production.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the stripped-down cello, Boccherini seems to have
afforded at least as strong a motive as Bach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the Boccherini concertos for years, and I've never,
ever, wanted to play them on a contemporary cello,'' Ma said. ``I
just didn't think they sounded good. Yet I've always yearned to be
able to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma first worked with Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra
some eight years ago, and has since performed with other
period-instrument specialists, including the conductor Roger
Norrington, occasionally borrowing a ``period'' cello for the
purpose. But the prime impetus to alter his playing style and
instrument came, he suggests, from the collaboration with O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the esthetic of not vibrating unless you really
have to for a particular effect is the same in both fiddling and
Baroque playing,'' he said. ``And in order to play with him, I had
to change my bow stroke, or bow style, which ended up being more
Baroque.''
</P>
<P>
   These changes, fine distinctions in most cases, were effected in
part by gripping the bow a little closer to where it touches the
strings, much the way a baseball player might choke up on a bat to
achieve a quicker, more flexible stroke (with, perhaps, some loss
of power). At the same time that he was working with O'Connor, Ma
said, he was recording the Bach suites, and he altered his playing
more and more in Bach as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many found Ma's recent Bach performances more Romantic than his
earlier ones, in particular, his 1983 recording of the works.
``Inspired by Bach,'' Sony called the new audio and video
recordings, and though not entirely dismissive of the performances,
Allan Kozinn wrote in The New York Times, ``One has to wonder:
shouldn't the set's title have been `Inspired by Casals'?'' ( Ma,
who cites Casals as a formative influence, not so much for any
lingering Romanticism as for his sparing use of vibrato, may in any
case have been flattered.)
</P>
<P>
   But for this listener the greater expansiveness of the St.
Ignatius performances, the more penetrating thoughtfulness, the
added freedom and grandeur of expression all enhanced Ma's
interpretations without mitigating the pinpoint focus and the
clarity of line that have always been hallmarks of his playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `Romantic,''' Ma said. ``What does it mean? My music
teacher, Lowell Lindgren, used to say that all music is Romantic in
its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do with this round of Bach suites was to be
more courageous in identifying how Bach worked things out
polyphonically. In other words, since you can't really sustain
notes, how do you do it aurally in such a way that it fits
together?
</P>
<P>
   You have to commit yourself to it, so if there's a pedal point
that lasts for 30 measures, even though you occasionally can't hear
it, you make yourself hear it, and then you react accordingly. The
seeming freedom actually comes from a kind of aural discipline, to
say, `I'm going to make sure that I'm reacting to this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Montagnana cello itself undoubtedly was also a factor in the
impression of bigness, the sense of spaciousness, the ease with
which Ma's sonority filled the church. The instrument's strong
bass, Ma suggested, was crucial to that illusion of long-sustained
notes underpinning the counterpoint. He called the Montagnana an
``earthy instrument that's right for Bach,'' in contrast with ``the
beautiful, Italianate, cultured-sounding Stradivarius.''
</P>
<P>
   That refined Stradivarius, Ma had long thought, was not entirely
happy in its life as a ``modern'' instrument. ``Strads don't like
to be pushed,'' he said. ``It's almost like there's a fine line,
where you push it too hard and it stops giving. I always felt a
little bad putting the Strad under all this pressure, souped up for
maximum horsepower. You're always trying to find the right way to
make an instrument sing.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ma finally decided to give the instrument a lease on its
former life.
</P>
<P>
   The end-pin is a simple matter: don't screw it in when you
remove the instrument from its case to play it. But its fixture
remains in the base of Ma's instrument, part of the 25 percent that
is not ``virginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma had instrument makers in London and Paris restore the bridge,
which lifts the strings off the instrument, and the tailpiece,
which anchors them. (Higher bridges are used today, to add tension
and brilliance, as are plastic or metal tailpieces, to add
resonance.) He replaced the steel strings with gut and tuned the
instrument lower, to what is now widely accepted as Baroque pitch.
He commissioned a reproduction of a bow from Bach's time, also with
less tension.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of restoring the narrower fingerboard,
which would also have required changing the neck of the instrument,
where the strings are attached and tuned with posts. Nor did he
strip off the modern varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last summer, he started to practice. The results had his
wife and two children questioning his sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gut strings are unreliable,'' he said. ``They sound a little
reedy. They squeak and squawk at times, and they constantly go out
of tune. But what I learned is that with less volume, the
experience is more private, more intimate. Playing with less
tension encourages you to think, to reflect more. It's extremely
pleasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   All those modernizations were made with a purpose, of course,
precisely as music was moving from private, domestic and courtly
rooms to ever larger public arenas: in Ma's words, ``to suit a
2,700-seat hall.'' That is, the likes of Avery Fisher Hall. So how
well can Ma and the orchestra expect to be heard on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a question of how we take possession of the
space,'' Ma said. ``We need to treat every hall as an instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   So now that Ma and Ax are on the same historical page, more or
less, will they combine their antiquarian pursuits? Both say they
are eager to do so, but the matter is complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still 100 years away,'' said Ax, who has fallen in love
with an 1851 Erard piano in Birmingham, England. ``I'm not so happy
with fortepianos,'' he said of earlier instruments, noting that the
Erard already had the steel frame characteristic of the modern
piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll experiment with late Romanticism,'' he said,
but he seemed dubious that he and Ma would find common ground on
period instruments in anything later than, say, the Mendelssohn
sonatas and trios of the 1830's and 40's.
</P>
<P>
   What is the next surprise to be expected from Ma?
</P>
<P>
   The next one he is willing to discuss is a festival in 2002 at
the Smithsonian Institution, centering on aspects of the musical
history of the Silk Road between China and the West, as gleaned
from exotic instruments and other artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to make sense of all the things I see when I
travel, and the things I've picked up from Mark O'Connor about oral
tradition and the like,'' Ma said. ``You realize that there are
these transnational cultures that have somehow moved things around,
and I'm interested in how things have moved along the Silk Road
over the last 2,000 years.''

MORE BOOGIE NIGHTS: THE PLAYBOY MANSION IS AGAIN A HIP PARTY SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 21.)  
(lh) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was a mansion party all right: Charlize
Theron flirted with Jack Nicholson by the pool, and vice versa.
Couples canoodled in the Grotto. Humid blondes in Bunny suits
gyrated around a grinning gray-haired guy in silk pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?'' Valentine's Day party at the
Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles last weekend was startling evidence
that not only is Hugh Hefner back in action (after separating from
his wife last year), but so is his stately pleasure dome.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Stiller showed up with Rick Rubin, the hirsute rap producer.
The baby Baldwin, Stephen, was in the house, as were Brett Ratner,
who directed ``Rush Hour,'' and Tori Spelling. Liam Neeson came
early and stayed almost as long as Geoffrey Rush, who tore himself
away around 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was clearly delighted to be there. ``It's a fun place,
you know?'' he said. ``When I'm in town, it's a cool place to come
and hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mansion is once again a major night-life destination for
young Hollywood in search of raw, retro fun. Leonardo DiCaprio,
Cameron Diaz, Courtney Love, the Foo Fighters, Korn and Joaquin
Phoenix have all made the scene. They jammed the New Year's Eve
party, the Halloween party, Hef's Midsummer Night's Dream party,
the ``Saturday Night Fever'' party, Hef's 72nd birthday party. They
mingled with habitues from the old days _ Tony Curtis, James Caan,
Jack _ and frolicked among the Bunnies and other fauna that
populate Hefner's five lush acres high in the Holmby Hills.
</P>
<P>
   This hipster elite could, let's face it, be anywhere. And yet,
they're there, hanging out with this fossil from the Stone Age of
whoopee-making.
</P>
<P>
   A generation that was born during the sexual revolution but came
of age amid a backlash against it seems to be rediscovering the
guilt-free image of sex that Hefner has always preached and sold.
</P>
<P>
   He's lived large for so long that he contains multitudes of
retro references, from the movie ``Swingers,'' to the Rat Pack and
Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many young people, male and female, were waiting for me to
be out there,'' Hefner said of his return to circulation. ``It was
like spotting Elvis at the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   For twentysomethings well enough connected to be on Hefner's
guest list, boogie nights at the mansion are a heady aphrodisiac,
an intoxicating cocktail of crass and class.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Duritz, the lead singer of the Counting Crows, came to the
Valentine's party with a group that included Alyssa Milano, one of
the stars of the WB series ``Charmed.'' He said: ``Hey, I met Tony
Curtis here. That's cool, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction: The press is generally not invited. Unlike
so many Hollywood events, mansion parties are not publicity-driven
media ops. Celebrity guests can cavort free from the prying lenses
of the stalkerazzi or ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's many hungry-looking young dudes _ some sporting
tight red-leather pants and snakeskin boots, others in fishing hats
and elephantine cargo pants _ trolled for Playmates with tattoos
and toe rings. As ever, the joint was stocked like a trout pond
with the sort of women S.J. Perelman once described as ``balloon
smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Chicago mansion, purchased in 1959, was a mod,
martini-soaked playpen for swells in skinny ties and ``chicks'' in
go-go boots. In 1971, Hefner went west and bought a clubby,
wood-paneled manor in the old Hollywood style. By the late 1970s,
this polyester palace of disco excess boasted butlers passing
around ``dexies'' on silver platters, nude ``Olympics,'' and a
collection of monkeys and rare birds in Hefner's private zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the small study where he receives guests, Hefner
considered his mansion's revival among a new wave of swingers.
``They felt as if they had missed the party,'' he said. ``It
reminds me of when I was growing up during the Depression. I felt I
had missed the party because I looked back at those exciting images
from the Roaring '20s. The short skirts, the jazz. In a similar
way, people of a certain age feel as if they missed the swinging
'60s and '70s. And my part in all that, and my mansion, is a focal
point.''

</P>
<P>
   The typical mansion party has always had an eclectic guest list.
In the Chicago days, Norman Mailer might rub up against Miss July.
Lenny Bruce could crack wise with Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hollywood equivalent is the Academy Award-winner
Geoffrey Rush, star of ``Elizabeth'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
mingling with Shana Hiatt, a 23-year-old Playmate and former
Hawaiian Tropic Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he came to be here, a slightly bewildered Rush said,
``I met Hugh at the Four Seasons, and he invited me,'' adding what
a ``marvelously genial'' host ``Hugh'' was.
</P>
<P>
   Rush was apparently unaware that the only person who has called
Hef ``Hugh'' in the last 50 years was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Hiatt's fiance, Jimmy Van Patten, could be heard
talking trash with Kato Kaelin. Van Patten has written a movie
called ``Flunky,'' about Hollywood hangers-on and wants Kaelin for
a cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin is, perhaps not surprisingly, a regular. ``I see more
business cards getting passed around here,'' he said, writing out
his phone number on a cocktail napkin and listing various book and
television projects he hopes will pay off in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if networking had replaced debauchery at the mansion,
Kaelin started to describe an R-rated episode in the Game House,
then veered off the record.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish actress, Sofia Eng, recounted how a friend had warned
her to stay clear of the mansion. ``I told someone I was going
here, and she was like, `Oh, it's so sleazy,''' said Ms. Eng, 24,
who has a part in ``Wild Wild West,'' a movie opening this summer.
``And it's not sleazy at all. Then she was like, `Can I go?' It's
not the easiest thing to get on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Male plus-ones, for instance, are frowned upon. Swedish
actresses, on the other hand, are not.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is obvious. Consider the following mansion
conversation:
</P>
<P>
   MALE VISITOR: ``Do you have Playboy in Sweden?''
</P>
<P>
   SWEDISH ACTRESS: ``We just got it. In my country, nudity is no
big thing. All the beaches are topless. If you don't go topless,
people stare at you.''
</P>
<P>
   MALE VISITOR: ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Hef do it? He is a man of obvious intelligence and
worldliness. And yet he has spent a lifetime in similarly inane,
libido-driven conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, I have never gotten most of my
intellectual stimulation from parties,'' he said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Hefner looked younger in person than in pictures.
He admitted to a little plastic surgery, to nip what he called some
``Thanksgiving turkey'' skin around his neck. Otherwise, the man
comes as advertised _ black pajamas, red smoking jacket, Diet
Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on the edge of a heavy leather couch, he jutted his prow
of a jaw over the coffee table in front of him, which is outfitted
with two backgammon boards (his gaming obsession) and didn't seem
at all sleazy. Just a nice old guy with a wicked smile.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the famous plaque on the front door of the
mansion, with its Latin warning, ``Si Non Oscillas Noli
Tintinnare'' (``If You Don't Swing, Don't Ring''), seemed a sad
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the murder of Dorothy Stratton, Playmate of the
Year in 1980, cast a pall over the place. After weathering feminist
attacks, Hefner's Playboy Philosophy came under siege from the
Moral Majority. The chain of once hopping Playboy clubs died. The
magazine's circulation dropped to half of its high of 7 million.
AIDS had become a national crisis, attributed by some critics to
the kind of sexual libertinism associated with Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Hefner suffered a stroke. A year later, Newsweek
pronounced, ``The Party's Over,'' on a cover featuring a graying
Hef and his girlfriend at the time, Carrie Leigh, who was known to
interrupt business meetings wearing nothing but a live boa. In
1989, Hefner married Kimberly Conrad, a 1988 Playmate, and
cloistered himself among the mansion's other museum pieces, the
Picassos, Pollocks and Kandinskys.
</P>
<P>
   The Hefners had two children.
</P>
<P>
   That sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Hefner's friends. They do not look back on his married years
fondly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Valentine's party, James Caan recalled his old buddy's
lapse from bachelordom into ball-and-chaindom. ``The idea,'' Caan
shouted over the din, ``that after 40 years, a guy could change his
whole philosophy for what? A blonde?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bann, a film historian and Hefner intimate, was equally
appalled. ``Kimberly wouldn't let the Playmates anywhere near the
place,'' he said. ``They had no access to Hef!''
</P>
<P>
   Bann described this unthinkable situation with a historian's
gravity, as if, during the Cuban missile crisis, key Kennedy aides
had been denied access to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Hef what was happening, he couldn't believe it,''
Bann said.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Hefner is back in business. Stock in the company,
which is run by his daughter, Christie Hefner, is at an all-time
high. The first new Playboy Casino in years will open next month on
the island of Rhodes. And 1999 happens to be, as Playboy's new
billboard in Times Square points out, the Chinese Year of the
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Events at the Playboy Mansion in recent months suggest another,
slightly modified, Latin motto for Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Veni, Vidi, Viagri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some Viagra parties,'' Hefner said. ``It was the
girls who suggested it.''
</P>
<P>
   His longtime physician prescribed the drug as a 72nd birthday
present, he said. ``The girls'' are Hefner's three concurrent
girlfriends: Brande Roderick, 24, and Sandy and Mandy Bentley,
20-year-old identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the founding editor of
Playboy magazine would be dating a threesome with rhyming central
casting names: Sandy, Mandy and Brande. This arrangement raises,
among other issues, the question, Are these young women really
comfortable with sharing the same man?
</P>
<P>
   ``More than OK!'' Hefner exclaimed exuberantly. ``It's the
happiest time of their lives!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roderick confirmed this statement. ``We all love each
other,'' she said of the twins, who were wearing matching red and
black Bunny costumes at the Valentine's party. ``We're like a
family.'' The disco anthem ``We Are Family'' blared over the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of pretty women seems to have been a constant in
Hefner's life, but of course they have changed over the years. He
and his magazine changed them. Now, almost all of them look like
Pamela Lee, whose ``Baywatch'' career was jump-started by a Playboy
pictorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you meet an attractive girl today in this town,'' Hefner
said, ``nine times out of 10, they're very interested in getting
into the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes his three girlfriends. So who's exploiting whom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer hardly seemed important. Not with Hefner surrounded
by 200 of his close, personal friends of the moment, shuffling his
slippers around the dance floor with anyone who can keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't watch,'' Caan said, averting his gaze. ``He makes me
feel too lonely.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGETOWN, N.Y. _ The Dow Jones industrial average is still in
the clouds, but I'm not up there with it. I'm in the basement,
troweling fresh gray concrete onto the pocked walls of my major
investment. My devotion to this house _ I'm on my knees, literally
_ could be a form of financial recklessness that I'll regret
bitterly at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite booming equity markets, most of my life savings remain
embedded in my home, a 1912 Dutch colonial. And while the resale
values of houses in the New York metropolitan area have been
rising, the gains are nothing like the astonishing returns on Wall
Street in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   With so many market investors redoubling their wealth, I feel as
if my nest egg has been sewn into a couch cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Houses are the slow-moving steamships of assets. Prices of
existing homes went up 5 percent in 1996 and 4.8 percent in 1997,
says the National Association of Realtors. Adjusting for inflation,
the resale values of existing single-family homes have hardly
budged since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife, Elaine, and I bought our house almost five years
ago, we put $50,000 down, all we had. It was the only way to buy
because our work as journalists did not give us enough income for a
mortgage greater than $150,000. But we worry that we've missed a
historic opportunity by not joining the ride toward Dow 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   For psychological rather than financial reasons, home ownership
remains the centerpiece of our economic life. None of our parents
owned a home until late in life. To correct what we saw as a
mistake, Elaine and I have owned homes for all of the 16 years
we've been married: First, a small loft in SoHo in Manhattan, sold
at a $100,000 gain in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Then a row house in Park Slope, Brooklyn, sold in 1993 for what
we paid in 1988, with transaction costs and taxes eating up almost
half our equity. Now this freestanding three-bedroom house in
Rockland County in the Hudson Valley. (We're only about 18 miles
from midtown Manhattan, the school district is excellent, and the
countryside is easy to reach.)
</P>
<P>
   Each move was an agonizing leap into forbidding economic
territory, justified only by calculating our after-tax costs.
Always we violated the precept of limiting housing costs to 25
percent of family income. And always our real costs, including
upkeep, came out higher than we had expected.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved here, I predicted to a friend that our home's
resale value would rise 6 percent a year. But by 1996, as the bull
was galloping onward, our $200,000 house was worth perhaps
$205,000.
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, two hard-working 40-somethings with modest
income and two children, caught with more than $50,000 in frozen
equity. I felt like ripping out the bay window and exchanging it
for shares of Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we had $4,000 to $5,000 invested in mutual funds and
stocks. But we had a vegetable patch, too, and that didn't make us
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   We faced a choice. We could borrow at low cost against the
equity in the house and reinvest the money. Or, as we ultimately
decided, we could borrow to pour more money into the house and into
suburban living: a roof repair, badly needed new windows and then a
second car.
</P>
<P>
   And the house kept making new demands. Instead of watching for
the next NASDAQ juggernaut, I spent my free time wrestling a new
stockade fence into place, going flat on my stomach to dig the last
few inches for the shafts by hand. Again, I was prostrate before
The House.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1996, the bull started to pull our home along, and
resale prices in our neighborhood started to spurt. Last year, our
house was conservatively reappraised at $235,000. Finally, the 6
percent-a-year appreciation I had hoped for was materializing, but
so what? We had missed the chance to switch from real estate to the
much higher returns of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Our savings remain locked up in a house that we may never sell,
an obsession we may never escape. If our home's resale value
doesn't stay ahead of inflation, the final cost could be higher
than we ever realized: a joyless, austere retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Investing, of course, isn't foolproof, and you can't live in
your stocks. We trade on line and enjoy it, but never in blocks
worth more than a thousand dollars, never in deals approaching the
scale of our home purchases and financings.
</P>
<P>
   The equity in our home may have grown 70 percent on paper, but
the transaction costs for getting at that equity remain high, even
if we were willing to move. There are no $20 Internet trades in the
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is that our house dominates our
subconsciousness as well as our net worth. Instead of locking in
shares of the next Amazon.com, I'm more likely to be locking in the
integrity of our deck with two coats of Thompson's Water Seal. And
screens? They're for keeping out mosquitoes.

REGIONAL STUDIES IN VOGUE AT U.S. UNIVERSITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Academic centers are popping up everywhere to bore into the soul
of the Southwest and the Great Plains, the South and New England.
As if they were cataloging newly discovered planets, scholars are
busily cobbling together vast compendiums, modeled after ``The
Encyclopedia of Southern Culture,'' on the nation's regions and
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The study of regional culture and politics, folkways and
eccentricities, long dismissed as the minor leagues of academic
scholarship, is fashionable at American universities as it has not
been since at least the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid the celebration of regional distinctiveness, a
nagging question persists: Are there still distinctive regions to
celebrate?
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars, certainly those involved in regional studies,
argue that regional differences persist _ may even be accelerating
_ despite a commercial landscape of McDonalds, Starbucks, Walmart
and the Gap that can look the same whether in Boston, Baltimore,
Boise or Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus on regions is also part of a larger discussion
about the nature of culture and how regional differences persist in
the face of all the broader forces increasingly pushing toward a
homogeneous national culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleague George Tindall says it's the cultural equivalent
of your life passing before you as you drown in the mainstream,''
said John Shelton Reed, a sociologist and expert on the South at
the University of North Carolina, referring to the eminent Southern
historian. ``But it's not that simple. I don't think massification
and globalization and all those other `izations' are necessarily
hostile to regionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, American history began as regional history told by
Virginians or Bostonians, but it was soon supplanted by a national
narrative, if one dominated by a New England perspective. In the
1930s, as the age of mass society dawned, sociologists and
geographers began to focus again on regional differences _ in
literature, politics, folkways and art. But that interest soon
faded, as national issues again became pre-eminent, and since the
1950s the study of specific regions has had about the same cachet
in academia as a small-town mayor does compared with a U.S.
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provincial, antiquarian backwaters. Unanalytical.
Unreflective. Nostalgic. That's pretty much what you heard,'' said
Patricia Limerick Nelson, a historian and chairwoman of the board
of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado at
Boulder. ``It was very uncool.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the dominant cultural cliche came to be that
regional differences were disappearing into the great national
strip mall, the study of regions suddenly became hot. Most regional
programs are aggressively interdisciplinary, as likely to study
desert cactus as Navajo poetry or New England immigration patterns
or Revolutionary War history.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first regional study institutions was the Center for
Great Plains Studies at the University of Nebraska, which opened in
1976. Since then there has been a proliferation: There is the
Appalachian Regional Studies Center at Radford University in
Virginia and the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at
East Tennessee State University. There is the Center for the Study
of the Southwest at Southwest Texas State University and the
Southwest Center at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the
University of Mississippi and the Institute for Southern Studies at
the University of South Carolina. And there is the Center of the
American West at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the New
England studies program at the University of Southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Center for the Study of Southern Culture made a big
splash with its ``Encyclopedia of Southern Culture'' (University of
North Carolina Press). Since then similar volumes have been begun
or completed for the West, the Midwest, New England, Appalachia and
the Great Plains as well as various cities. In New York alone, the
last few years have seen the publication of ``The Encyclopedia of
New York City'' (Yale University Press, 1995) and ``Gotham''
(Oxford University Press, 1998), a history of New York that in
1,383 pages gets only to the year 1898.
</P>
<P>
   A further push has come from William Ferris, who for 18 years
presided over the Center for the Study of Southern Culture and was
the co-editor of the Southern encyclopedia. Considered a godfather
of regional studies, he is now the chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities. Not surprisingly, his most cherished
proposal calls for establishing 10 regional centers around the
country to support projects in fields as diverse as folklore, law,
medicine, historic preservation, the environment and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have interstates and national television programming,
and we all watch the same `Seinfeld' and see the same evening
news,'' said Ferris. ``But when we sit at the dinner table, we hear
a very different voice that's rooted in the home and the community
in which we live. It's the most powerful anchor of who we are as
Americans, and ironically that's the world we have failed to study
and understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris also cites the economic importance of cultural tourism as
one reason to study and celebrate the music of the South or the
cowboy culture of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some scholars this is an odd time to adopt
regionalism as a primary lens for viewing American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still important regional differences in this
country,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, who teaches media studies at
New York University, ``but it's also true that those differences
have been eroded greatly by the media and the consumer culture. So
this study can be valuable as long as it addresses the actual
plight of regional distinctiveness. If it just concentrates on
these cultural differences it can become a kind of nostalgia, a
bookish exercise in looking back at what is now disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But many scholars like Ferris say that the rise of a mass
culture, rather than diluting regionalism, has made people much
more anxious to acknowledge and preserve the alternatives to
carbon-copy franchise culture.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Levine, who teaches history at George Mason University,
does not argue that regionalism is as vital a factor in American
life as it once was. But he says it remains a compelling force and
an important counterweight to the popular notion that the country
is more divided than it used to be. ``There are all these people
today screaming about fragmentation as if the country was once a
unified place and now there are all these competing ethnic
groups,'' he said. ``America was never a unified place. It was
always divided by ethnicity, by region, by geography, by
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say regional studies programs can become mere
conservators of fading cultural eccentricities _ the blues in the
South, the whaling industry in New England, the Indian culture of
the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Wilder, director of the Southwest Center at the
University of Arizona and editor of the Journal of the Southwest,
said it was precisely the urge to turn regional culture into a
comfortable commodity that makes serious study and analysis so
important now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nouveau riche can move to Santa Fe, but no matter how many
Southwestern trinkets they bestow upon themselves or how they
decorate their fake adobe with other people's religious artifacts,
they're not really touching the indigenous reality,'' he said.
``We're not here to celebrate quaint indigenous customs. Our job,
in part, is to make sense of the dynamic of change and to make sure
that important knowledge, other narratives and stories which are
threatened by mass culture, aren't lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it may be that one's image of a region's culture is
as important as the substance. Thus, said Burt Feintuch, a
professor of folklore and English at the University of New
Hampshire and the editor of the Encyclopedia of New England
Culture, due out later this year, the landscape of New England has
over time been made to look more like an imagined New England than
it ever was in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the approach that regionalism is a state of mind and
that regional identity remains every bit as strong as it ever has
been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is willing to go that far. Instead, they
say, the way to view regionalism is as a counterweight to the
prevailing pull of mass culture, producing a blend of distinctive
regional cultures and homogenous mass ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something unsatisfying about the formulation that
regionalism is as powerful as it ever was,'' said Jackson Lears, a
history professor at Rutgers University. ``It denies the real power
of corporations to reshape culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say there's now a force that steamrollers everything
in its way. But you can't say nothing has changed, either. That
ignores and trivializes the impact of this enormously concentrated
power of big corporations and the corporate media to disseminate
ideas.''

 &HT;    Common bird feeders for the beginner
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guide to common bird feeders, from the Illinois-based National
Bird-Feeding Society :
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Platform feeders: Next to sprinkling seed on the ground, the
most basic bird feeding arrangement is the platform feeder, which
is a tray, possibly with raised edges to prevent the seed from
falling off. It attracts dozens of creatures, and you can go
through a lot of seeds in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hopper feeders: These feeders feature platforms with
receptacles attached to them to hold the food, and are used by such
birds as cardinals, blue jays, grosbeaks, finches, nuthatches,
chickadees and titmice. On the ground below to snatch up morsels
knocked out of the feeders will most likely be mourning doves,
juncos, various sparrows and towhees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Window feeders: Generally made of clear plastic, window
feeders attach easily to the glass with suction cups. The benefit,
of course, is that you get outstanding views of birds with window
feeders. A disadvantage is birds sometimes crash into the glass.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tube feeders: There are several variations of tube feeders,
but they all operate in the same way to dispense seed. The size of
the feeder holes on the side of the tube determines the seed to be
used, from large sunflower seeds to smaller ones. Separate perches
put space between the birds, which reduces some of the competition
and squabbling seen among the feathered creatures when they
congregate on platform feeders.
</P>
<P>
   The species of birds you attract depends primarily on the seeds
you offer. ``For finches, we put only thistles in one our
feeders,'' says Victoria Sampson. In general, black oil sunflower
seed is the hands-down favorite of all the birds that visit tube
and hopper type feeders. A tube feeder with black oil sunflower
will attract goldfinches, woodpeckers, titmice, chickadees and
nuthatches. Adding a tray to the tube feeder also will attract
cardinals, white-throated sparrows, jays and house finches and
purple finches.
</P>
<P>
   Some other combinations: A platform feeder or tube feeder and
tray with peanuts will attract cardinals, grackles, titmice, jays,
sparrows, juncoes, house finches, chickadees, starlings and others.
A hanging suet feeder brings in woodpeckers, chickadees, kinglets,
creepers, wrens, nuthatches, thrashers and others. A peanut butter
suet lures woodpeckers, juncos, thrushes, kinglets, wrens,
bluebirds, goldfinches and others.

 &HT;    Backyard Birding
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For John and Victoria Sampson, the joy of nature is
just outside their living room window _ a vibrant red northern
cardinal on a bleak day in February; a ruby-throated hummingbird on
a bright day in May; a bright yellow goldfinch on an apple-crisp
morning in October.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other Americans, the Sampsons, who live in the
Shakerag community in north Fulton County, have found that bringing
the joys of nature close to home pays off in hours of pleasure,
fascination and a special kind of serenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given us these beautiful creatures, and I feel like a
child all over again learning about them,'' says Victoria Sampson,
a retired flight attendant with Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Sampsons are among about 60 million Americans who buy about
$2 billion worth of seed and feeders every year. ``We have six bird
feeders, two of them for hummingbirds,'' says Victoria. ``We also
have two birdbaths _ water is very important for attracting birds _
and we make sure they are full and clean all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sampsons, in fact, dedicate most of their three acres in
north Fulton to attracting wildlife. For that, the National
Wildlife Federation recently certified their lot as a Backyard
Wildlife Habitat site. Joining more than 22,000 property owners in
the United States and Canada, the Sampsons cultivate trees, shrubs
and flowers to offer a variety of food and cover for birds,
butterflies, frogs, small mammals and other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my husband last year that instead of buying me a
regular present like jewelry for my birthday, I wanted some
serviceberry trees for the yard,'' Victoria said. ``Songbirds love
the berries of the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to become part of this popular pastime. Backyard
birding is now the nation's second most popular hobby next to
gardening, says the Illinois-based National Bird-Feeding Society.
There is no best or worst time to start. Start anytime. Right now,
the birds can use your help while their natural seed sources are
scarce. And backyard birding is a great way to teach children about
wildlife and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the National Audubon Society and the Cornell
University Laboratory of Ornithology are asking everyone,
regardless of skill level, to help in the Great Backyard Birdcount,
which began Friday and continues thorugh Monday. To participate,
simply identify and count the number of birds in each species you
see during at least a 15-30-minute period. Report your tallies to
the Web site http://birdsource.cornell.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Getting started with birdwatching is as simple as getting some
seed and placing it in an easy-to-see spot outside your window. But
if you're serious about attracting birds, you most likely will want
a genuine bird feeder. Any store specializing in birding supplies,
such as Wild Birds Unlimited franchises in the metro Atlanta area,
can recommend feeders. The bird food and the type of feeder _ and
where you place it _ may depend on the birds you want to attract
and your tolerance of pesky squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   If, like the Sampsons, you want to make a more concerted effort
to turn your backyard into a wildlife haven, contact the National
Wildlife Federation at Backyard Wildlife Habitat program, 8925
Leesburg Pike, Vienna, Va. 22184. There is a $12.95 charge for a
packet of materials on how to create a backyard wildlife habitat.
For more information call 703-790-4100 or visit the organization's
Website at www.nwf.org.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Sampson says the colorful and melodious songbirds in
her yard make her a happier person. ``In the springtime, we hear
the 'cheep, cheep' of many little babies all around us, and it is
wonderful,'' she says.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Breathe easy: Free CPR training available
 &HT;    By Amanda Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Exley hears life-and-death stories all the
time. He wants them all to have happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of weeks ago, when he took his daughter's wedding
dress to the cleaners, he heard another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man told me that when his son was 3 months old, he
had (breathing) problems in the middle of the night and turned
blue,'' Exley said. ``He told me, `I think my training saved his
life.' And that's why we have CPR Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Exley will be among the certified instructors teaching the
life-saving technique at 14 sites to more than 4,000 metro
Atlantans on March 6. The free annual training session for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation is sponsored by the American Red
Cross and Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   A retired Georgia State University recreation instructor, Exley,
58, has been associated with the American Red Cross for more than
50 years, first as a swimming student and later as a volunteer. The
Stone Mountain resident sees CPR training as among the Red Cross'
most vital missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood services are extremely important, but preparation for
disaster is equally important, and CPR happens at the earliest
stages of disaster,'' he said. ``When a person quits breathing, if
you don't do something to get oxygen to them immediately, it's
going to damage their brain and organs.''
</P>
<P>
   CPR is credited with saving thousands of lives every year,
according to Red Cross spokesman Bill Maddox, though exact numbers
are hard to come by because no agency collects them.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross offers CPR training throughout the year, and more
than 2 million people nationwide complete classes annually. But CPR
Saturday is the only free event, and classes fill up fast. Anyone
age 12 and older can sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Training includes how to recognize the symptoms of a heart
attack or breathing emergency, how to care for an adult who has
stopped breathing or is choking, how to give CPR and how to use the
emergency medical services system effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Classes take a maximum of four hours, but people often can
complete training in an hour, particularly if they're brushing up
on their skills. But don't assume that getting reacquainted with
CPR Annie _ the Red Cross' teaching mannequin _ can be put off for
years at at time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new things _ we're modifying the techniques
all the time _ that people really should be recertified every year,
certainly every two years,'' Exley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to say that if you're called on to do something for a
family member of friend, you want to be sure you're doing your
absolute best.''

 &HT;    Pressure builds to reopen the unsolved murders of rights
activists in 1960s
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATCHEZ, Miss. _ On Feb. 27, 1967, Wharlest Jackson was driving
home in a downpour from his job at the local tire plant. Three
weeks before, he had been promoted to a position previously held
only by white men. It was a dangerous step up the ladder: Many Ku
Klux Klansmen worked at the plant, and there were rumors that any
black man taking ``white men's jobs'' wouldn't live to enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   But in the war for equal rights for blacks in Mississippi, as
well as the daily struggle to support a family, the promotion was a
victory that Jackson savored.
</P>
<P>
   A little after 8 p.m., Jackson, a 37-year-old husband, father of
five and NAACP officer, turned his pickup truck onto Minor Street
in the black section of town. That's when the bomb planted in his
truck detonated, blowing the truck and Jackson to bits. Witnesses
said the police had to pick up his body in pieces, which they
placed into plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   The murder didn't go unnoticed. About 15 FBI agents came to
Natchez and stayed long enough to record more than 6,000 pages of
notes and evidence. But neither the local police nor the federal
agents arrested anyone. The statute of limitations on federal civil
rights cases expired after a decade, so the FBI closed its case and
stored the file in Jackson, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no statute of limitations for murder, and for 32
years the case, represented by a thin folder labeled ``Wharlest
Jackson,'' has remained open at Natchez police headquarters. Open
but ignored by five police chiefs, one of whom was black. Then,
last spring, under pressure from the media and a resolution by the
Natchez Board of Aldermen, Police Chief Willie Huff assigned two
officers to travel monthly to Jackson to comb through the 6,000
pages of FBI files. They're looking for something that might lead
to an arrest and a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good two-thirds of the way through, and so far it
hasn't been productive at all,'' Huff said. ``There are a lot of
names in there, but a lot of the names are folks who are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusting off old files
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Wharlest Jackson is one of several unresolved
cases from the bloody, fractious days of the civil rights movement
now being reinvestigated by local police chiefs, district attorneys
and sheriffs. At least seven cases, four in Mississippi, two in
Alabama and one in Louisiana, have been reopened in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest is due in large part to the 1994 trial and
conviction of Byron De La Beckwith for the murder of Medgar Evers
31 years earlier in Jackson. It was Beckwith's third trial for the
slaying: He was tried twice in the 1960s, but both juries
deadlocked. Decades later, evidence surfaced that Beckwith had
tampered with the all-white juries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last summer, a jury of blacks and whites in Hattiesburg
convicted former Ku Klux Klan leader Sam Bowers of ordering the
1966 fatal firebombing of Vernon Dahmer's home. Dahmer, a voting
rights activist, died protecting his family from carloads of
Klansmen who burned down his house. Another Klansman will go on
trial this year on charges of participating in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   As Beckwith and Bowers, both in their 70s, spend their golden
years behind bars in state prisons, district attorneys and police
chiefs, some too young to remember the '60s, are dusting off old
files, hunting out suspects and trying to jog the memories of
witnesses in other unresolved cases.
</P>
<P>
   Huff was a senior in high school when Wharlest Jackson's truck
blew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't fully understand the situation,'' said Huff, who
added that he took little interest in civil rights issues because
he was too busy ``doing schoolwork and chasing girls.'' But he
remembers that it was a ``tense, turbulent time'' in his hometown
and in the state as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 slayings listed on the civil rights memorial in
Montgomery, only two resulted in a first-degree murder conviction
at the time. Several more have been prosecuted in recent years, but
many crimes against civil rights workers remain unpunished, not to
mention countless murders of black people not involved in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people killed _ lynched, hit in the head,
thrown in rivers by white people who had all the power and just
didn't care,'' said Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center
in Montgomery. ``They just killed them because they were black. My
attitude is you should look at these cases not as simple murder
cases. It was a crime against a whole class of people, like the
Holocaust. You should pursue these cases forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The convictions of Beckwith and Bowers convinced local
prosecutors that such trials are feasible, even with dead witnesses
and lost evidence. And the convictions encouraged the families of
victims to pressure local authorities to reopen cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can only come about because of the civil rights
movement,'' said David Ingebretsen, director of the Mississippi
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Because blacks won
the right to vote and won the right to sit on juries, they now have
the power to pressure district attorneys to try these cases. That's
what people like Vernon Dahmer died for.''
</P>
<P>
   A fatal accident?
</P>
<P>
   Ollie Mae Brown sits in her small house near downtown Jackson
and waits for justice. She is 80, and surrounds herself with photos
of her four children and her many grandchildren. She takes a
picture of her son Benjamin down from the wall behind the
afghan-covered sofa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to talkin' about it, it gets me upset,'' she says
when asked about May 11, 1967, the night her son was shot in the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brown was an outspoken civil rights worker who led
protests and boycotts even in high school. His death was written
off by the Jackson police as accidental, caused by a stray bullet
meant to be fired into the air to disperse a protest at Jackson
State University. His mother says Brown wasn't involved in the
protest that night; he was walking to his apartment after buying
his pregnant wife a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses say that not all the police were firing into the
air, but that some put their guns to their shoulders and took aim
at the protesters. But authorities never identified the shooter.
Ollie Mae Brown filed a lawsuit against the city, but because the
police wouldn't release the investigation records, the suit went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 32 years later, at the request of Jackson City Council, the
city police are re-investigat-
</P>
<P>
   ing Brown's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad if they do,'' his mother says. ``I didn't think
it was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers that her son often was chased home from his job by
police officers who were just ``mean'' and who, she said, didn't
like his working to better himself.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers her neighbors knocking on her door on May 11,
saying, ``Mrs. Brown, Ben got shot.'' He died a day later, on his
21st birthday. She has said that no one from the city ever came to
her and apologized for her son's death, or even offered an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to go to college that fall,'' Brown says. ``I
just want justice, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson police say that, so far, they have turned up very
little evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guys are re-interviewing the witnesses they can find to see
if they can find anything not found in previous investigations,''
said Deputy Chief Eddie Wilson. One suspect, a state trooper, is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Killed by the Klan
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Michael Schwerner, a 24-year-old Cornell University
graduate, and his wife, Rita, went to Meridian, Miss., to join the
civil rights struggle. As Schwerner, Mississippi native James
Chaney, 21, and Andrew Goodman, 20, of New York were driving home
from the remains of Mount Zion Methodist Church, which had been
burned down by the Klan because of the congregation's civil rights
activities, they were stopped by a sheriff's deputy. They were
handed over to Klansmen, who killed all three and buried them on a
Klansman's farm near Philadelphia, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   It took six weeks of intense searching by a huge team assembled
by the FBI to recover the bodies. The case _ which was the subject
of the 1988 movie ``Mississippi Burning'' _ attracted national
attention and led to the arrests of 21 Klansmen and lawmen,
including Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence Rainey. Seven Klansmen
were found guilty of federal civil rights violations; Deputy
Sheriff Cecil Price was convicted and sentenced to six years.
Rainey and several others were acquitted. Sam Bowers, now in prison
for Vernon Dahmer's murder, served time in a federal prison from
1968 to 1976 for civil rights violations in the deaths of
Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   But the state of Mississippi never charged anyone with those
murders.Some of the Klansmen are dead, but some survive, and
Schwerner's widow, Rita Schwerner Bender, has been pressing the
local district attorney to reopen the case. In January, District
Attorney Ken Turner requested the original FBI files and the
federal court transcript from the 1967 trial.
</P>
<P>
   If arrests and a trial result from a new investigation, it
probably would receive even more national attention than the
Beckwith trial. Another case _ that of four girls who died in the
1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham _
would also capture the nation. Only one man, a Klansman named
Robert Chambliss, went to prison for that bombing, and that wasn't
until 14 years after the fact. It is widely held that at least four
men, and maybe more, were involved in planting the dynamite. The
case was reopened more than a year ago, and a grand jury has been
hearing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a legal pitfall to pursuing these cases, Dees said. If
the defendant can prove that his rights to a speedy trial have been
violated, the case could be thrown out. That defense didn't work in
the Beckwith and Bowers cases, because they were tried shortly
after the murders. Any delay in seeing justice served was caused by
their own tampering with their juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between having a hung jury and having
no trial at all,'' Dees said. ``Maybe they didn't try some of these
people out of prosecutorial prejudice or because they knew they
couldn't get a conviction. If that is the case, is there a good
enough reason to retry them now? I'd like to see them all convicted
and in jail until they die, but there are legal realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning from painful past
</P>
<P>
   Bender, Schwerner's widow, who remarried and is now a Seattle
lawyer, said that while it's painful to dig up the past, it's
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years now I have heard people in high positions in
Mississippi say, `That was then and this is now and we have to move
on,' '' she said. ``Then I think about (Senate Majority Leader)
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and how he is involved with what can only be
described as the reconstructed white Citizens Council _ and I say,
wait a minute.'' (Lott has had many dealings with the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a group accused of racist leanings that is
considered to be the modern version of the Citizens Council, an
unabashedly racist group of the '60s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the people who would rather forget need to come to terms
with things that continue to happen that, in their own ways,
encourage violence,'' Bender continued. ``The Citizens Council
never got its own hands dirty _ it just created an atmosphere that
allowed the Klan to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   Although race relations remain a central issue in Mississippi
and elsewhere, everyone agrees that things are better than they
were 30 years ago. Huff is very concerned that outsiders not see
his city, famous for its plantation homes and Old South festivities
centered on the spring pilgrimage, as racist. ``Natchez is not the
Old South anymore,'' he said. ``We're a very open-minded
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's new convention and visitors bureau has a black woman
on the staff whose sole job is to ensure that African-American
history and heritage are documented and publicized, Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local tire plant where Wharlest Jackson worked, workers
are still protesting, but for a different cause: A new company has
taken over the plant and wants to quash the local union. Workers
picketed outside in a light rain on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're opening up all the old murder cases, aren't they?''
asked employee Willie Singleton, 54, who marched outside the metal
fence. ``That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bender said, the only way to learn from mistakes is to
keep talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have recently become more convinced that these murders are
unfinished business and we shouldn't let it go,'' she said. ``This
is national unfinished business _ if we are to learn from our past,
we can't ignore our past.''

 &HT;    The fellowship that wouldn't die
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fellowship is as sweet as the iced tea around the
long table at Butch's Chicken House in Jonesboro on the second
Thursday of the month.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Ladies' Bible Class of Mountain View Baptist
Church gathers for an evening out together.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that their church is defunct and their town
disappeared, literally eaten up by Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport almost 20 years ago. Two or three dozen of
them, their husbands and other former members of their church drive
in from across south metro Atlanta determined to keep the spirit of
the Sunday school class alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened happened at church,'' says Louise
Brown, 74, former lunchroom manager of the old College Park High
School, who now lives in Union City (Ga.). ``We raised all our
children there _ all of us. Everything centered around the church.
We all feel more like brothers and sisters than friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close-knit church up there,'' says Geraldine
Underwood, 72, an Avon cosmetics saleswoman in Riverdale (Ga.).
Underwood lived in Hapeville (Ga.) but attended church in Mountain
View (Ga.). ``A lot of the old families were right there. You
didn't dare say anything about one person, because they might be
related to another one.'' She is now a member of Poston Road
Baptist Church in Jonesboro (Ga.), a congregation established in
1981 from a remnant of Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked after each other's children,'' says Marjorie
Hood, 75, a retired executive secretary who moved to Mountain View
as a bride 57 years ago. ``Everybody knew everybody and knew
everybody's business, which could be good and could be bad.'' Hood
now lives in Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View, about a 1-square-mile area on the north edge of
Clayton County, was chartered in 1949 as a town and in 1956 as a
city, and was home to about 2,000 people. It was dissolved in the
late 1970s by the Georgia General Assembly upon the recommendation
of the Clayton delegation, which branded it ``a blight on Clayton
County'' because of feuding and corruption in local government. At
the time, Mountain View had legal sales of beer and wine while the
rest of the county was dry.
</P>
<P>
   The death knell of the community was already sounding, in the
form of noise from the jet planes of Atlanta's rapidly expanding
air traffic. Families on the west side of Old Dixie Highway and the
railroad tracks went first, when about 400 homes were bought out
with $16.5 million in federal and local funds in a land acquisition
project that began about the time the city's government ended. In
the wake of their departure, businesses closed and most of the few
remaining residents from the east side followed.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, the former city officially became a part of
Hartsfield when work crews literally dug up part of the area for
fill dirt for runway extension.
</P>
<P>
   The community of Mountain View, which took its name from the
view of Stone Mountain (Ga.) possible on clear, sunny days, long
predated the town's incorporation _ as did the Baptist church,
which was incorporated in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Green of Rex (Ga.), a retired hairstylist from the old
Davison's Department Store and now in her 80s, was 15 when she
moved to Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a church there then,'' she says. ``Then, we
finally built a church there and everybody began to move their
membership to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Jarrett, 76, moved to Mountain View with her husband in
1955 and helped run his construction business from their home.
``The people there were so friendly,'' she says. ``You felt like
the whole church was just a family.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Sunday schools in previous decades, men and women were in
separate classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, I think there's things you'd like to discuss
that you wouldn't discuss in a coed class,'' says Jarrett. In the
Ladies' Bible Class, she says, ``I kind of felt like all of them
were sisters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's mother, sister and mother-in-law died while she was a
part of the class at Mountain View. ``They were the most caring
people you would ever find anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1980, the women and their families were
scattering to about a dozen different churches.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 25, 1980, the women's Sunday school class met in Helen
(Ga.) to talk about how to maintain their friendship. Minutes show
that they voted to organize as the Former Mountain View Club, meet
monthly, and charge dues of 50 cents a month, or $6 a year.
</P>
<P>
   They elected Louise Brown's husband, Walter, former postmaster
of Mountain View, as president of the group. Except for a few
months, he has continued in that office since the inception.
</P>
<P>
   Some things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we were younger, we'd carry a covered dish,'' says
Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have barbecues, but the man died,'' says Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And dues have been raised to the whopping sum of $7 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the original members have been lost to death or
distance, and the remaining heads are grayer, but the essential
nature of the group remains the same. Each gathering includes
celebrations of birthdays, news of health and families, an
inspirational reading, prayer and lots of hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I declare, people had rather miss most anything than that
meeting because we look forward to getting together,'' says Hood.
``I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping in touch. It just
shows you what kind of community Mountain View was.''

 &HT;    Impressionists at the High Museum
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Organizing an art exhibition is no ivory-tower
endeavor. After coming up with the concept and researching it comes
the real work: securing the works of art on the wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Curators, the men and women who organize the shows, usually hit
the road becoming, in the process, skilled diplomats. They barter.
They schmooze. They debate. They observe body language and gallery
installations. Sometimes they call upon official diplomats to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Dumas and Michael Shapiro were the diplomats behind
``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by Europeans Museums,''
opening Tuesday at the High Museum of Art, then traveling to art
museums in Seattle and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionism was a great moment in art history,'' said
Shapiro, the High's chief curator. ``People love it. I love it. (A
big impressionist exhibition) hadn't been done here. The trick was
how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers don't really care how it's done. They just want to
see the paintings. Most museums, however, are weary of lending
these works. Because of the wear and tear of travel and because
these pieces are often the reason people visit their museums,
administrators demand that there be a good reason, a contribution
to scholarship, to merit the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the premise was no easy task. Impressionism has
been dissected, feted and reassessed more than any period in art
history. In just the past year, American museums have organized
``Impressionism in Winter,'' ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' ``Mary
Cassatt'' and ``Degas in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   One-man shows. Done to death. Seasonal themes. Too close for
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The High decided to focus on the collectors, dealers and museums
brave enough to purchase and show impressionism in its early years.
The show would consist of examples of impressionist paintings
collected when it was a controversial thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The museum hired London-based Dumas as guest curator. Now a
free-lancer, she has 20 years of museum experience and recently
organized an exhibition of Degas' art collection at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Next, the High developed a
wish list with help from Paris-based researcher Robert Parker, who
had access to European museum catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Then the footwork began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to write a letter,'' explained Dumas in an
interview from London. ``You have to go and visit the directors and
curators.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumas always prepared carefully for each visit. She studied each
museum's collection so that she could talk intelligently about it.
If she was meeting with a museum person she didn't know, she found
out about him or her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important,'' she says, ``is one's commitment to the show.
Essentially, you have to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was happy to discover that many provincial museums were
cooperative because they were pleased by the attention paid to
their institutional history and by the prospect of American
exposure. But even then, there were complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into a museum in Cambrai in northern France to see
that the painting by Marie Bracquemond that I wanted was the
centerpiece of a gallery installation of 19th-century French
portraits. The gallery would fall apart if it were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The High does not have much in the 19th century to barter
with, so I called upon our co-sponsors and was able to work out an
exchange using a Corot and a Renoir from the Denver (Art) Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro went along when he felt it would help and engineered
some creative exchanges. The High wanted ``Morning Awakening'' by
Eva Gonzales from the Kunsthalle Bremen in Germany. The Kunsthalle
had an interest in American painter Morris Graves, so Seattle's
agreement to lend some of its Graves holdings for a future
exhibition became the quid pro quo. In other cases, the High sent
its conservator to restore a painting and exchanged consulting
services for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Loyrette, director of the Musee D'Orsay in Paris, was
skeptical of the premise and engaged the High diplomats in a lively
debate _ in English and French _ on its scholarly merits. Shapiro
may have swayed him with some auxiliary arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that cities outside of New York and Los Angeles
have sophisticated audiences who want to see these things and that
it was his duty to be a good lender. I told him Atlanta was an
up-and-coming center that made up in energy and initiative what it
lacked in its collection. We got six paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro chalked up Oslo's generosity to ``the Gudmund Vigtel
factor.'' (The High's director emeritus is a native of Norway.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all their efforts were successful. The Hermitage in Russia
wouldn't lend. Sometimes a curator from another museum had already
been there. For example, nearly all the late Monets were spoken
for. Shapiro and Dumas stopped asking for any painting with snow.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 39 museums lent works, and Shapiro is pleased with
the diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an opportunity to learn about impressionism from
beginning to end. All the major figures are included, from the
early 1860s to postimpressionism. There are also lesser-known
artists and a cluster of women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro considers the exhibition ``a win-win situation.''
Visitors who want to look no further than the pretty pictures can,
while others can gain a greater understanding of the movement. Says
the curator: ``It won't be the last, but I think it's the best
impressionist show that's ever been here.''

 &HT;    Celebrating the `radical' notion of spontaneity
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is difficult to fathom that impressionism, so
beloved in our time, was once so radical and appalling that a
cartoonist depicted a guard urging a pregnant woman not to enter
the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   We are so used to ``scandalous'' art that it takes bullwhips and
dead cows to raise any ire these days, but as Ann Dumas explains,
``Standards were so much more rigid then. It was easier to be
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The curator of ``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European
Museums,'' Dumas recounted the ways that the impressionist defied
the status quo, as defined by academic painters such as Adolphe
Bouguereau. First, the impressionists ignored the existing
hierarchy of subject matter, which favored elevating content, such
as myth or history, in favor of focusing on ordinary life. Second,
they ignored the rules of technique, which emphasized drawing and
anonymous brushwork. They painted directly on the white canvas
instead of applying gesso (a plaster of Paris and glue mix used as
a base for paintings), thus introducing a much more vivid palette
than accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   But what was most disturbing was the brushwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they exhibited looked like an unfinished sketch to the
public,'' she says. ``It was free and spontaneous, a record of
immediacy and luminosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics and visitors were enraged that an artist would
display something so raw. This exhibition celebrates the visionary
people who, early on, recognized its merit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imaginative product planners have morphed sedans with pickups,
off-roaders with minivans, military vehicles with station wagons.
Isn't it about time somebody crossed a sport utility with a UFO?
</P>
<P>
   From the looks of it, Isuzu has come close with its Vehicross. A
product of the Star Wars school of design, this stubby two-door
looks like nothing else on the road _ or on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a piece of construction equipment at a space colony
far, far away, or a giant version of the Transformers, those sci-fi
toys that change form if you twist this part and fold that one.
(``It's an off-road vehicle! It's a mutant flying crab! It's an
intergalactic robot warrior!'')
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, a Japanese company that left the car market to
concentrate on trucks and sport utilities, calls the Vehicross ``a
techno-design suited to the new millennium.'' A concept vehicle at
the 1993 Tokyo auto show, the Vehicross went into production in
Japn in '97, when it was voted Japanese Car of the Year. It goes on
sale Monday in the United States; Isuzu will import fewer than
3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Vehicross is a breath of nitrous oxide in a sport utility
market that was starting to take itself too seriously, but it's
good for more than a laugh. Indeed, it's quite competent.
</P>
<P>
   It manages to look both high (it has 8.4 inches of ground
clearance, and its styling makes it seem to hover) and low (the
steeply raked windshield sweeps onto the roof of a cabin that looks
flattened). The roof doesn't just look low, it (italics)is(end
italics) low; I smacked my head on it the first time I got in.
</P>
<P>
   Lower body panels are covered with black plastic affixed with
exposed screws. This thick unpainted band of polypropylene wraps
clear around from grille to cargo door.
</P>
<P>
   The styling quirks go on. The grille has two vertical teeth,
giving the front end the look of a shark after dental surgery.
Halogen headlamps gaze from clear covers with hornlike protrusions
at the top edge. Stare at this face for a while and you may start
to see the serpent from Eden.
</P>
<P>
   The inner part of the hood is matte black to reduce glare, and a
round carrier bulging from the cargo door houses the full-size
spare. There are thick ribs on the side doors, and the fuel filler
mimics a jetliner's. The 16-inch alloy wheels glisten, a clue that
the Vehicross is more likely to preen in Marina del Rey than go
prospecting in Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the Vehicross sends mixed messages, for
Isuzu considers it a combination of sport utility and sports car.
It would be easy to dismiss this as a delusion if the vehicle
didn't perform so well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the sluggish acceleration, ponderous handling and
vague steering of a small sport ute, the Vehicross has a capable
3.5-liter V6, great road-holding and recirculating-ball steering
that is accurate and nicely weighted, with good feedback.
</P>
<P>
   The Isuzu embraces a curving country road, staying flat on
maneuvers where you'd expect a sport utility to list and stumble,
and it is an effortless cruiser that stays on track. With its
truckish body-on-frame construction, it's no Corvette, but it feels
substantial. On the Interstate it's more Grand Cherokee than Grand
Vitara.
</P>
<P>
   With a wheelbase of 91.8 inches _ an inch and a half shorter
than a Wrangler _ the ride can be rough. Rear and side visibility
is limited by thick pillars and a mirror view blocked by the big
spare carrier and the back-seat headrests.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu calls its full-time four-wheel-drive system ``Torque on
Demand.'' It has a low gear range for severe conditions, but for
regular driving, the rear wheels get the power until sensors detect
slippage. Then, torque is redirected by varying degrees to the
front wheels. A pictogram indicates which wheels have the power,
and approximately how much.
</P>
<P>
   The setup handled snowy, hilly roads just fine, but it is not
invincible. The Vehicross managed to get stuck in a two-foot
snowbank in my driveway. Using low range and alternately using
forward and reverse gears, I was able to rock it free.
</P>
<P>
   With styling so unusual, not just any old furniture could go in
the cabin. The seats are fancy leather Recaro Trends with
recliners, adjustable thigh bolsters and a bold red-and-black color
scheme. (Exterior colors are black, silver or, for the ``Ironman
Edition,'' white.)
</P>
<P>
   The doors have inserts of plastic ``carbon fiber''; there is
more faux fiber on the too-small gauges.
</P>
<P>
   I had two problems with the Isuzu. Radio reception was abysmal;
just 20 miles from New York the seek function found only one FM
station _ a religious broadcast warning of damnation. And the
folding back seat was next to impossible to use.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't the seat, which is adequate, but a lack of
access to it. Scoot a front bucket all the way forward and there is
a tiny gap between the cushion and the door frame that one must
wriggle through. Only small children or supermodels will fit, and
even they can't crawl in gracefully because the door sill is so
high off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet is wriggling back out. Keep a cell phone handy in case
you get stuck and have to be extricated by the local fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Contortions may not trouble the 20-somethings most attracted to
the Vehicross. (``It's really different _ that's what I like about
it,'' said one young man in a crowd that gathered around it at a
convenience store.) But the price could be a problem. At $28,000,
the Vehicross costs a lot more than a RAV4 or a Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it answers those complaints that Japanese cars have no
character. The Vehicross has lots of personality, even if it
sometimes reminds you of your weird cousin Harold.

<P>
   ``Don't just shop at Home Depot,'' signs in the retailer's
760-odd stores will soon say. ``Own a piece of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, based in Atlanta, is one of roughly 500 companies
that sell shares directly to investors _ both the initial stake as
well as subsequent investments and reinvestment dividends _ without
paying commissions to a broker.
</P>
<P>
   But in late December, Home Depot took its plan a step further by
offering it on its Web site (www.homedepot.com), making it easier
for Internet shoppers to buy its shares than to buy its hammers
(currently not available on line).
</P>
<P>
   The initial cost to participate is $5. Depending on when they
are received, orders are executed at that day's closing price or
the next trading day's close, is deducted from the buyer's bank
account, but proceeds from stock sales are mailed. Shareholders can
also review their accounts on line.
</P>
<P>
   Others companies are expected to follow suit with their own
on-line plans, with Compaq Computer now testing one.

   Attention Brokerage Firms: This Is Only a (Year 2000) Test
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 brokerage firms, along with securities markets and
clearing organizations, will gauge their Year 2000 computer
preparedness with an elaborate industrywide test of trading and
settlement procedures over six Saturdays in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities Industry Association, an industry trade group,
said the test would let the brokerage firms check for Year 2000
problems involving their computers' interaction with those of the
stock markets and clearing and settlement organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Computers will be converted to simulate particular dates near
the turn of the year. Simulated stock trading on March 6 will
substitute for Dec. 29, March 13 for Dec. 30, and so on through
April 10, which will substitute for Jan. 3, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The association did not disclose what the price of Yahoo would
be in its simulation.

 Public aid for Oz park seems an odd move  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most questionable thing about the proposed Wonderful World
of Oz theme park is how its backers' quest for public-sector
support clashes with the traditional justification for such
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for socializing private investment risk has always
been the promise of jobs. The investors' reward from having
taxpayers share some risk has been deemed acceptable if sufficient
employment opportunities resulted to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not merely the jobs created by the subsidized enterprise,
either. It's also the jobs created by the multiplier effect from
the investment. This extends to the construction industry and those
involved in providing the new enterprise with goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Oz project, though, finds itself in the paradoxical position
of seeking a public-private partnership when the area labor market
is excruciatingly tight. Therefore, it could be argued that if
government uses its powers of subsidy to help transform the Oz
project from development dream to community reality, there's a
potential for unintended consequences to do as much economic harm
as good.
</P>
<P>
   The area's unemployment rate hit an unprecedented low of 2.8
percent in December. Add to this the fact that the area labor force
participation is unusually high, and the local labor market is
likely a lot tighter than even the jobless rate indicates.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Oz backers succeed in getting the public
support needed to make the project a go? The first challenge will
be finding enough quality workers to build it. Once it's built,
where will its operators find enough workers to staff it?
</P>
<P>
   Simple economics suggests an already squeezed labor market will
get squeezed much harder. Wages will be bid up even higher than
they already are. This may be good for workers, but is it fair for
government to go out of its way to create a situation that boosts
labor costs for existing businesses already struggling to keep
enough employees?
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. It's not as though subsidies don't create
economic inequities even when conditions might justify government's
role in spurring development. This is one of the concept's most
objectionable aspects. Even so, exacerbating these inequities when
there's no compelling justification for government to do so raises
serious questions about the limits government should observe when
taking an economic development role.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is how circumstances have changed since
the Oz project surfaced in the early '90s. The economy was then in
the early recovery stages from the 1990-91 recession. Moreover, the
project's proposed site was in Wyandotte County, an area where
recovery could have been expected to lag the overall metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now is now. Next month the U.S. economy enters
its ninth year of expansion, and the area work force is stretched
thinner than it ever has been. In the meantime, the proposed Oz
site has been shifted from Wyandotte County, which can always use a
boost, to Johnson County, one of the most dynamic county economies
in America.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it's interesting to ponder what gives Oz
developers so much apparent traction in their bid to partner up
with the taxpayers.
</P>

NEW GAMES FOR PLAY SYSTEMS 
 

</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So Santa was very good to you, my little gamer
friend, and brought you the PlayStation or N64 of your sugarplum
dreams, or maybe just that video accelerator card for your
computer, or the Color Game Boy you wanted. Well, here's a quick
guide to some of the latest releases in the usually slow winter
season that can help dress up your new toy: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
PC/Mac &LR;
</P>
<P>
   StarCraft: Brood War expansion pack (Blizzard): StarCraft was
last year's best-selling PC game, with terrific play balance
between three competing races duking it out for control of the
cosmos. Blizzard is the same company that created the
somewhat-related and equally brilliant WarCraft franchise. Brood
War is Blizzard's first StarCraft expansion, adding new units and
scenarios, and broadening the game. And of course, it means loads
more fun on Blizzard's free Battle.net online gaming site.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad Tycoon II (Gathering of Developers): Build your own
railroad empire on any of three continents and with a variety of
systems in this wonderfully involved economic strategy game. All
aboard!
</P>
<P>
   Tomb Raider III (Eidos): Bosomy adventure chick LauraCroft is
back in another round of puzzles to solve and places to explore. If
you liked her before, this one'll probably float your boat as well.
Otherwise, it's more of the same thing you didn't care about in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy Gear 2 (Activision): This simply gorgeous robot soldier
game is what's left after Activision lost the MechWarrior
franchise, but it's definitely not reheated leftovers. Fluid
graphics and great controls make for an excellent adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Heretic II (Activision): This top-notch shooter returns in fine
sequel form, with gorgeous graphics and Quake II's great game
engine undergirding the action.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie the Pooh &AMP; Tigger Too Animated Storybook (Disney
Interactive): The latest in Disney's terrific series of storybook
titles, this one follows our favorite bear through a series of
reading and puzzle-solving activities for children 3 through 6
years old. Thumbs up from the Personal Entertainment Testing System
units (my children, my P.E.T.S.), though they're slightly too old
for this title.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-Putt Enters the Race (Humongous Entertainment): A very
sweet adventure involving a talking car that must find various
items to help others while making it possible for him to run in the
big race. A series of mini-games are sprinkled in among educational
material pitched for kids between 3 and 8. It has absorbed my
P.E.T.S. for weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brain Thinking Games: Puzzle Madness (Knowledge Adventure):
Outwit an evil alter ego and restore a ravaged futuristic city by
figuring out puzzles that change every time they're played. It
focuses on problem solving, logic and sequence recognition. Both
for ages 9 and up, Mac and PC.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brain Thinking Games: IQ Adventure (Knowledge Adventure):
This Windows-only game sends a player into an alternative world
where she must solve hundreds of puzzles to get through 15 levels
of missions. Clever graphics, free Internet play, which includes
the possibility of cooperative or competitive scenarios with
others, and a chat feature. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nintendo 64
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars Rogue Squadron (LucasArts): I can't say enough good
things about this game, which puts you in the pilot's seat of a
variety of ``Star Wars'' fighter craft, fending off the Imperium
baddies. It's particularly gorgeous and cinematic if you have the
Expansion Pak, which doubles the N64's memory. A great game that
shows off the N64's graphical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Party (Nintendo): This somewhat indescribable collection
of dozens of ``mini-games'' covering all sorts of genres lets up to
four people play against each other as noted Nintendo characters.
The array of games and their multiplayer nature make this a great
title for families and friends who like to play together.
</P>
<P>
   South Park (Acclaim): This eagerly awaited game was released
just a few days before Christmas and allows you to be any of the
four foul-mouthed third-graders from the animated Comedy Central
hit. It shares that show's funny foul mouths, but not nearly enough
additional inspiration to keep it from getting quickly repetitive.
Good for a weekend rental, though.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Pool (Crave): Like its PC/Mac cousin, this billiards
simulator looks really great and comes packed with a variety of
games, both U.S. and U.K. rules, trick-shot practice and more.
Well-done and no smoke-filled pool hall required. Of course, that
means no smoking biker babes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Milo's Astro Lanes (Crave): A decent bowling game with a twist:
roll your ball through various powerups that allow you to disrupt
your opponent's ball, or protect your own. The game is at its best
when revenge spices up such head-to-head play.
</P>
<P>
   Magical Tetris Challenge (Capcom): Disney characters meet the
durable puzzle favorite, with an extra level of head-to-head
competition and character story lines that goose up the standard
block-clearing challenge. The story line is superfluous, however,
though competing head-to-head is a nice addition. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PlayStation
</P>
<P>
   Civilization II (Activision): The much-beloved PC strategy game
goes PSX, with all the joy of building your own civilization
through the ages. The unit icons are annoyingly difficult to
differentiate on a TV screen, but the game play and balance remains
magnificent. Civ II also requires a whopping 10 memory blocks to
save your progress, but it's worth buying a couple of spare memory
cards just to keep your empires at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune (Hasbro Interactive): Hasbro has
turned these two game shows into solid if unsurprising PlayStation
games, featuring Alex Trebek and Vanna White. My kids and their
playmates loved Wheel, which is simple enough for anyone to play.
Jeopardy, with thousands of the same obscure questions seen on the
show, is probably best for the family trivia freak.
</P>
<P>
   Contender (Sony): Boxing may be in these days, but some of us
still have a profile we'd like to preserve. With Contender, we can
whale away on an opponent and still look OK the next day when we
walk into work. Train and develop your own boxer from a choice of
20, then fight your way up to the world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Metal Gear Solid (Konami): This much-vaunted, long-in-coming
shooter actually emphasizes stealth and tactics over brute force
and blasting away. It's winning plaudits as best of breed from many
directions _ and for good reason. If you like to use some brains
with your bullets, start here.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA Final Four '99 (989 Sports): A pretty good basketball game,
just in time for March Madness. Comes with about every team you can
think of, authentic uniforms and floors, and even team tendencies
that mirror the real world. Controls are kind of a pain, but it
seems like it's that way with virtually all sports games. This
one's better than most. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Game Boy
</P>
<P>
   Hexcite the Shapes of Victory (Ubi Soft): I'm still trying to
figure out the best strategies for this addictive one- or
two-person strategy game, which involves piecing in various shapes
on a game board for points and bonuses. Like many of the best
games, this one has simple rules that create complex challenges
with endless replayability. A good one for puzzle freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Pitfall (Crave): Take another swing at the Pitfall franchise,
with challenging game play from virtually the first seconds.
Well-done, attractive sidescroller.
</P>
<P>
   Looney Tunes Twouble! and Carrot Crazy (Infogrames): Both these
games use the Color Game Boy's talents wonderfully and are
otherwise engaging little adventures. In Twouble! Sylvester the Cat
has to dodge obstacles in Granny's neighborhood while trying to
catch Tweety Bird. In Carrot Crazy, Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny have
to navigate a challenging world to collect all their stolen
carrots. I thought both of these were striking looking and
well-done.
</P>
<P>
   Gex Enter the Gecko (Crave): This game is cute enough and
relatively well-done, though it lacks the gleeful smarm and mocking
media sendups that made Gex our favorite Hollywood lounge lizard on
other platforms.
</P>
<P>
   MIB: Men in Black, the Series (Crave): Based on the television
show based on the movie, this is a mediocre sidescroller that at
least has great animations between each level.

REDWOOD FOREST DEAL FACES DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 and ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The federal government is offering a
California lumber company one last compromise to end a marathon
dispute over a $480 million deal to acquire the nation's last
privately held old-growth redwood forest.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before money to buy the Headwaters forest in Northern
California disappears, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is pushing
the Pacific Lumber Co. to accept environmental restrictions
designed to protect endangered species living on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going from crisis to crisis for four years,''
Feinstein said Thursday. ``This is it. There is no flexibility. My
advice to the company is to wrap it up with the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new proposal, Feinstein said, Pacific Lumber could
request changes to the environmental plan and have changes approved
or denied by federal officials and a panel of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein characterized the offer as a way to get Pacific Lumber
to sign off on the Headwaters deal as it is written. But it would
also give the company a way to arbitrate disputes even before
federal scientists have finished their five-year study of how the
logging changes the Headwaters landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The offer comes as Pacific Lumber continues to complain about a
massive federal logging plan for 211,000 acres of trees that
surround the Headwaters groves. The Scotia-based company says
federal officials have substantially reduced where and when their
workers can log, jeopardizing the deal and the company's financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement must be reached by March 1 or the federal
government will rescind $250 million it set aside to purchase part
of the forest. California agreed to spend $230 million more for its
share of the 10,000 acres of old-growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for buying the trees, the government wants
assurances Pacific Lumber won't destroy the nearby habitat for
endangered coho salmon, marbled murrelet and northern spotted owls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my view that the money will never be available again,''
Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Wildlife Conservation Board is scheduled to meet
Wednesday to formally approve the purchase of the land from
Houston-based Maxxam Corp., the parent of Pacific Lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The board also will consider an agreement that requires Maxxam
to explicitly follow the Headwaters environmental plan for the next
50 years. That proposal, which the company disputes, is being
written because state lawmakers fear Pacific Lumber will try to
weaken environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber was purchased in 1985 by financier Charles
Hurwitz. Because he mainly used junk bonds in the $900 million
hostile takeover, Hurwitz needs to sell the trees to pay his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said the logging plan as
it stands would not allow Pacific Lumber to survive. The company
estimates it will have to harvest an average of 210 million
board-feet of softwood _ redwood and other conifers _ during the
first year of the agreement to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   But a computer model predicts ``an annual harvest estimate ...
that is well below the required minimum level,'' the company said
in a statement.

MORE BOOGIE NIGHTS: THE PLAYBOY MANSION IS AGAIN A HIP PARTY SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 21.)  
(Repeating for all needing)

 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This was a mansion party all right: Charlize
Theron flirted with Jack Nicholson by the pool, and vice versa.
Couples canoodled in the Grotto. Humid blondes in Bunny suits
gyrated around a grinning gray-haired guy in silk pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?'' Valentine's Day party at the
Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles last weekend was startling evidence
that not only is Hugh Hefner back in action (after separating from
his wife last year), but so is his stately pleasure dome.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Stiller showed up with Rick Rubin, the hirsute rap producer.
The baby Baldwin, Stephen, was in the house, as were Brett Ratner,
who directed ``Rush Hour,'' and Tori Spelling. Liam Neeson came
early and stayed almost as long as Geoffrey Rush, who tore himself
away around 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was clearly delighted to be there. ``It's a fun place,
you know?'' he said. ``When I'm in town, it's a cool place to come
and hang out.''
</P>
<P>
   The mansion is once again a major night-life destination for
young Hollywood in search of raw, retro fun. Leonardo DiCaprio,
Cameron Diaz, Courtney Love, the Foo Fighters, Korn and Joaquin
Phoenix have all made the scene. They jammed the New Year's Eve
party, the Halloween party, Hef's Midsummer Night's Dream party,
the ``Saturday Night Fever'' party, Hef's 72nd birthday party. They
mingled with habitues from the old days _ Tony Curtis, James Caan,
Jack _ and frolicked among the Bunnies and other fauna that
populate Hefner's five lush acres high in the Holmby Hills.
</P>
<P>
   This hipster elite could, let's face it, be anywhere. And yet,
they're there, hanging out with this fossil from the Stone Age of
whoopee-making.
</P>
<P>
   A generation that was born during the sexual revolution but came
of age amid a backlash against it seems to be rediscovering the
guilt-free image of sex that Hefner has always preached and sold.
</P>
<P>
   He's lived large for so long that he contains multitudes of
retro references, from the movie ``Swingers,'' to the Rat Pack and
Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many young people, male and female, were waiting for me to
be out there,'' Hefner said of his return to circulation. ``It was
like spotting Elvis at the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   For twentysomethings well enough connected to be on Hefner's
guest list, boogie nights at the mansion are a heady aphrodisiac,
an intoxicating cocktail of crass and class.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Duritz, the lead singer of the Counting Crows, came to the
Valentine's party with a group that included Alyssa Milano, one of
the stars of the WB series ``Charmed.'' He said: ``Hey, I met Tony
Curtis here. That's cool, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction: The press is generally not invited. Unlike
so many Hollywood events, mansion parties are not publicity-driven
media ops. Celebrity guests can cavort free from the prying lenses
of the stalkerazzi or ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's many hungry-looking young dudes _ some sporting
tight red-leather pants and snakeskin boots, others in fishing hats
and elephantine cargo pants _ trolled for Playmates with tattoos
and toe rings. As ever, the joint was stocked like a trout pond
with the sort of women S.J. Perelman once described as ``balloon
smugglers.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Chicago mansion, purchased in 1959, was a mod,
martini-soaked playpen for swells in skinny ties and ``chicks'' in
go-go boots. In 1971, Hefner went west and bought a clubby,
wood-paneled manor in the old Hollywood style. By the late 1970s,
this polyester palace of disco excess boasted butlers passing
around ``dexies'' on silver platters, nude ``Olympics,'' and a
collection of monkeys and rare birds in Hefner's private zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the small study where he receives guests, Hefner
considered his mansion's revival among a new wave of swingers.
``They felt as if they had missed the party,'' he said. ``It
reminds me of when I was growing up during the Depression. I felt I
had missed the party because I looked back at those exciting images
from the Roaring '20s. The short skirts, the jazz. In a similar
way, people of a certain age feel as if they missed the swinging
'60s and '70s. And my part in all that, and my mansion, is a focal
point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The typical mansion party has always had an eclectic guest list.
In the Chicago days, Norman Mailer might rub up against Miss July.
Lenny Bruce could crack wise with Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hollywood equivalent is the Academy Award-winner
Geoffrey Rush, star of ``Elizabeth'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,''
mingling with Shana Hiatt, a 23-year-old Playmate and former
Hawaiian Tropic Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he came to be here, a slightly bewildered Rush said,
``I met Hugh at the Four Seasons, and he invited me,'' adding what
a ``marvelously genial'' host ``Hugh'' was.
</P>
<P>
   Rush was apparently unaware that the only person who has called
Hef ``Hugh'' in the last 50 years was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Hiatt's fiance, Jimmy Van Patten, could be heard
talking trash with Kato Kaelin. Van Patten has written a movie
called ``Flunky,'' about Hollywood hangers-on and wants Kaelin for
a cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin is, perhaps not surprisingly, a regular. ``I see more
business cards getting passed around here,'' he said, writing out
his phone number on a cocktail napkin and listing various book and
television projects he hopes will pay off in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if networking had replaced debauchery at the mansion,
Kaelin started to describe an R-rated episode in the Game House,
then veered off the record.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish actress, Sofia Eng, recounted how a friend had warned
her to stay clear of the mansion. ``I told someone I was going
here, and she was like, `Oh, it's so sleazy,''' said Ms. Eng, 24,
who has a part in ``Wild Wild West,'' a movie opening this summer.
``And it's not sleazy at all. Then she was like, `Can I go?' It's
not the easiest thing to get on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Male plus-ones, for instance, are frowned upon. Swedish
actresses, on the other hand, are not.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is obvious. Consider the following mansion
conversation:
</P>
<P>
   MALE VISITOR: ``Do you have Playboy in Sweden?''
</P>
<P>
   SWEDISH ACTRESS: ``We just got it. In my country, nudity is no
big thing. All the beaches are topless. If you don't go topless,
people stare at you.''
</P>
<P>
   MALE VISITOR: ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Hef do it? He is a man of obvious intelligence and
worldliness. And yet he has spent a lifetime in similarly inane,
libido-driven conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, I have never gotten most of my
intellectual stimulation from parties,'' he said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Hefner looked younger in person than in pictures.
He admitted to a little plastic surgery, to nip what he called some
``Thanksgiving turkey'' skin around his neck. Otherwise, the man
comes as advertised _ black pajamas, red smoking jacket, Diet
Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on the edge of a heavy leather couch, he jutted his prow
of a jaw over the coffee table in front of him, which is outfitted
with two backgammon boards (his gaming obsession) and didn't seem
at all sleazy. Just a nice old guy with a wicked smile.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the famous plaque on the front door of the
mansion, with its Latin warning, ``Si Non Oscillas Noli
Tintinnare'' (``If You Don't Swing, Don't Ring''), seemed a sad
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the murder of Dorothy Stratton, Playmate of the
Year in 1980, cast a pall over the place. After weathering feminist
attacks, Hefner's Playboy Philosophy came under siege from the
Moral Majority. The chain of once hopping Playboy clubs died. The
magazine's circulation dropped to half of its high of 7 million.
AIDS had become a national crisis, attributed by some critics to
the kind of sexual libertinism associated with Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Hefner suffered a stroke. A year later, Newsweek
pronounced, ``The Party's Over,'' on a cover featuring a graying
Hef and his girlfriend at the time, Carrie Leigh, who was known to
interrupt business meetings wearing nothing but a live boa. In
1989, Hefner married Kimberly Conrad, a 1988 Playmate, and
cloistered himself among the mansion's other museum pieces, the
Picassos, Pollocks and Kandinskys.
</P>
<P>
   The Hefners had two children.
</P>
<P>
   That sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Hefner's friends. They do not look back on his married years
fondly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Valentine's party, James Caan recalled his old buddy's
lapse from bachelordom into ball-and-chaindom. ``The idea,'' Caan
shouted over the din, ``that after 40 years, a guy could change his
whole philosophy for what? A blonde?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bann, a film historian and Hefner intimate, was equally
appalled. ``Kimberly wouldn't let the Playmates anywhere near the
place,'' he said. ``They had no access to Hef!''
</P>
<P>
   Bann described this unthinkable situation with a historian's
gravity, as if, during the Cuban missile crisis, key Kennedy aides
had been denied access to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Hef what was happening, he couldn't believe it,''
Bann said.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Hefner is back in business. Stock in the company,
which is run by his daughter, Christie Hefner, is at an all-time
high. The first new Playboy Casino in years will open next month on
the island of Rhodes. And 1999 happens to be, as Playboy's new
billboard in Times Square points out, the Chinese Year of the
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Events at the Playboy Mansion in recent months suggest another,
slightly modified, Latin motto for Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Veni, Vidi, Viagri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some Viagra parties,'' Hefner said. ``It was the
girls who suggested it.''
</P>
<P>
   His longtime physician prescribed the drug as a 72nd birthday
present, he said. ``The girls'' are Hefner's three concurrent
girlfriends: Brande Roderick, 24, and Sandy and Mandy Bentley,
20-year-old identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the founding editor of
Playboy magazine would be dating a threesome with rhyming central
casting names: Sandy, Mandy and Brande. This arrangement raises,
among other issues, the question, Are these young women really
comfortable with sharing the same man?
</P>
<P>
   ``More than OK!'' Hefner exclaimed exuberantly. ``It's the
happiest time of their lives!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roderick confirmed this statement. ``We all love each
other,'' she said of the twins, who were wearing matching red and
black Bunny costumes at the Valentine's party. ``We're like a
family.'' The disco anthem ``We Are Family'' blared over the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of pretty women seems to have been a constant in
Hefner's life, but of course they have changed over the years. He
and his magazine changed them. Now, almost all of them look like
Pamela Lee, whose ``Baywatch'' career was jump-started by a Playboy
pictorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you meet an attractive girl today in this town,'' Hefner
said, ``nine times out of 10, they're very interested in getting
into the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes his three girlfriends. So who's exploiting whom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer hardly seemed important. Not with Hefner surrounded
by 200 of his close, personal friends of the moment, shuffling his
slippers around the dance floor with anyone who can keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't watch,'' Caan said, averting his gaze. ``He makes me
feel too lonely.''

TOOTHBRUSH, SANDING WILL GET TO MOLDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. A paint stripper (5F5) took most of the varnish off four or
five chairs I'd like to refinish, but I can't get the varnish out
of grooves and molding. The stain on the chairs is in good shape
and flat, which means most of the varnish is gone. What else can I
do?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK HIGGINS, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A toothbrush will help get the varnish out the moldings,
using stripper as you go along. Or, fold sandpaper to sand off the
ingrained varnish. A hot air gun will soften the varnish so you can
pick it out. Guard against charring the wood, and do the work
outside.
</P>
<P>
   If the stain is intact and good looking, why not apply a satin,
polyurethane varnish? If you use an oil-based polyurethane, you may
not have to get rid of all the old varnish. This will not work with
water-base polyurethane, unless you take all the varnish off,
because the two types of varnish are not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the oil-based because water-based is difficult to work
with and is less forgiving; if you don't keep the coats very, very
thin, the finish is likely to remain cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to remove the stain to achieve a lighter color or a
different color, you have to sand it off, then restain before
varnishing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a single-pipe steam heating system, which has begun to
bang like crazy. The banging seems to be originating in the boiler.
It all began when my wife overfilled the boiler. I tried reducing
the amount of water in the boiler without success. The banging is
not in the radiators themelves, so I don't think it is a matter of
water remaining in the radiator when the steam comes up. But I
can't figure out what is happening. Can you?
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATED CALLER
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you figured it out right, that there is too much
water in the system. Curing it is another matter. I think your only
choice is to contact a plumber-steamfitter. He should be able
adjust the amount of water to where it was before the overfilling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My vacation house in Maine is heated with hot water. Can I
replace the water in that system with an antifreeze when I leave
the house in winter? I drain the domestic water and have a freeze
alarm system, which alerts us to any threat of freezing.
</P>
<P>
   LIESE ELERIN, Dracut, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can, but you don't have to replace all water. Add
enough so the water will not freeze; I don't know the formula of
antifreeze in the system; a heating engineer can tell you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the caller who could not get the grout haze off his ceramic
tile floor, the handyman suggested rubbing with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Steve Buscone of Wilmington, Mass. suggested: ``Use
sawdust. It works wonderfully. I did it as a kid when I helped my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Steve Buscone; in fact, any kind of abrasion will
work, and a dry cloth or sawdust (it doesn't have to wet) will
provide just enough abrasion to remove that haze.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I put Homasote on my garage ceiling, but a kind of dusty
powdering is on it now. The garage is heated. Can I paint it to
keep that dusting down? If so, can I use exterior paint that I have
left over from a house job? Can I fill the joints with joint
compound and tape?
</P>
<P>
   D.R., Halifax, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Do not use exterior paints, especially since the garage is
heated, making the space more interior than exterior. A white,
solid color latex stain would be OK for this purpose despite its
being designed for outdoor use. Two coats will do nicely. Or, use a
white latex ceiling paint. Again, two coats. No primer is needed
with the stain or ceiling paint.
</P>
<P>
   Do not try to fill the joints in the Homasote. Cover them with a
wood trim. Homasote is a papier-mache (pressed paper) panel, and
has a rough finish. Any joint compound treatment would make the
joint covers smooth, and they will stick out like sore thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My cesspool (not a septic tank) actually passed a Title 5
inspection, and I guess I am pleased. What kind of maintenance is
needed to keep it healthy and working well?
</P>
<P>
   MARY ELLEN KAIN, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just keep using it, and have it pumped every two years or so.
The interval of pumping depends on how many people use the system.
There is nothing you have to add to to the system; what goes in
naturally will keep it functioning properly. You could put in a
pound or so of baking soda once a month, and while this will do
some good, it is not essential.
</P>
<P>
   A cesspool differs from a septic tank in that it is simply a
hole in the ground, lined with stone; liquids seep out through the
walls into the leaching field, which is simply the ground around
the cesspool. A septic tank is a separate container, with pipes
leading to a specific leaching field.
</P>
<P>
   Cesspools are illegal to install; yours is grandfathered,
meaning that it existed before the law was enacted to outlaw them,
so you don't have to change it.

CLINTON ASSESSES HIS IMPEACHMENT AND HIS WIFE'S CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, looking ahead to ``two good
years here,'' said Friday his 13-month struggle to survive the
sex-and-cover-up scandal shows that the American people will stand
by a president who sticks to business.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told a White House news conference that he would
work to elect first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate in
2000 if she decides to seek the seat being opened up by the
retirement of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be strongly supportive of whatever decision she makes
and will do all I can to help, on this and any other decision, from
now on, just as she's helped me for the last 20- plus years,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president made the comments at a joint news conference with
French President Jacques Chirac following their discussions about
the showdown in Kosovo and U.S.-European trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and
obstruction of justice last week following the first Senate
impeachment trial of an elected president in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, preparing for a post-impeachment summit with the
bipartisan congressional leadership early next week, said Americans
now expect both the Republican-led Congress and the White House to
``get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The public expects ``us either not to have any destructive
feelings _ or if we do _ not to let them get in the way of our
doing their business,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that any of us can afford to let what has
happened get in the way of doing our best for our own people and
for the future,'' Clinton said. ``I'm going to do my very best to
do that, and I think that we should all discipline ourselves with
that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I expect to have two good years here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the impeachment struggle triggered by his efforts
to cover up a sexual dalliance with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky shows that the American people will stand by their
chief executive if a president focuses on ``what you believe you
ought to do for the country and focus on it and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The American people ``will respond if you work at it, and if
they sense that you're doing this for them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaborating, Clinton said that he had ``learned a lot of
personal lessons'' over the past year. He said he hoped that the
presidency had ``not been harmed'' by his experience, adding: ``I
can't say that I think this has been good for the country. But we
will see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke shortly after his wife met in the White House
residential quarters with Moynihan to discuss whether to seek his
Senate seat in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said the two discussed voting patterns in New York and
other challenges to a potential Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said the meeting
with Moynihan was a chance for Mrs. Clinton to listen and ``an
opportunity to explore thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berry said Mrs. Clinton would take some time to reach a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be like watching grass grow,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said she would do ``a fabulous job'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   But he counseled patience.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has ``just been through a very exhausting year,''
Clinton said. ``I think some time needs to be taken here. I would
like to see her take some time... get some rest, listen to people
on both sides of the argument'' and then make her decision.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll in New York for the Senate race in 2000
shows Mrs. Clinton would defeat either of her most likely
Republican rivals _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani or former Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A Marist Institute poll completed Jan. 24 showed Mrs. Clinton
leading Giuliani 53 percent to 42 percent in a hypothetical match
up. The poll showed Mrs. Clinton leading D'Amato 57 percent to 38
percent.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-KOSOVO _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is meeting
Friday with French President Jacques Chirac and expected to discuss
the tense ongoing negotiations between Serbs and Albanians over the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. The United States, which already
has committed some 2,000 troops to the region, has issued a warning
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that unless a deal is done
by noon (Paris time), 6 a.m. EST, on Saturday, U.S.-led NATO
airstrikes on Serb targets could begin within 24 hours. Developing.
(Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Includes material from Clinton and Chirac news conference.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MEDIA _ Developing. As of now, TV isn't jumping on
Juanita Broaddrick's story that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 in a
Little Rock, Ark., hotel room. NBC, which has interviewed
Broaddrick, still says it is researching background. CNN and other
news outlets haven't picked up more on it following the Wall Street
Journal's inside-page unveiling of the story. Dribs and drabs have
been reported on outlets for the past few weeks. For the Journal's
part, the reporter is talking about how the story developed from a
media coverage piece into a full-scale depiction of Broaddrick's
tale. (Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-EASTTIMOR _ LIQUICA, Indonesia _ Ragged coffee farmers
in this disputed territory of East Timor are battling with bows and
arrows, while teachers and doctors are packing to flee out of fear
of chaos. ``All of us are in danger,'' said Gregory N.M. Dos
Santos, who this week gave harbor in his home to five skinny,
glassy-eyed warriors who had escaped nearby fighting. Two of them
were 12 years old. They share his sentiment that East Timor must
gain independence from Indonesia, and this is the issue that has
sparked the escalation of violence. The 800,000 people of this
jungle-covered half-island, a colonial remnant still suffering deep
poverty and feudal polarization, suddenly have been offered the
choice to remain a part of Indonesia or to become independent. They
are almost certain to opt for independence, a status for which East
Timor is unprepared and which risks throwing them back to a
fruitless and anarchic past. (Kunstel-Albright, Cox News Service).

abused as a child, suicidal as a child, diagnosed schizophrenic and
stone cold murderer. Last minute appeals are filed but are not
likely to spare the man who says he wants to die. (Beyerlein,

   FLIPPER _ WASHINGTON _ Nearly 60 years after Henry O. Flipper's
death, President Clinton is to pardon the Army's first commissioned
black officer at a ceremony in Washington tonight. Retired Gen.
Colin Powell, who kept a photo of Flipper on his wall while serving
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is expected to attend

through hours of graphic testimony, but jurors in the dragging
death trial have already divulged to the court their horror at the
crime. ``Horrible,'' said one. ``I was sickened by it,'' said
another. The 12 men and women chosen to hear the case reacted much
like the nation. And in many respects, they are like your next-door
neighbors. They watch Wheel of Fortune and Walker, Texas Ranger,
they believe honesty is the most important value to impart to
children and their personal heroes are their spouses and others
close to them. A portrait of a jury, based on testimony and their
responses to questionnaires. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman)

   BANKER-SHOOTS-SON _ GEORGETOWN, Texas _ A prominent Georgetown
banker shot his 16-month-old son to death early Friday morning
before turning the shotgun on himself, leaving friends and
co-workers baffled and in shock. Joe Ross Duncum, 44, was vice
president of lending for Walburg State Bank, on the Georgetown
Chamber of Commerce board and helped produce the city's new Urban
Design Guidelines. Many people who knew Duncum said there was no
warning. (Lindell, Austin American-Statesman)

GOP GOVERNORS ARE PARTY'S SHINING STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill
struggling to recover from low poll ratings, the nation's GOP
governors are riding a tidal wave of voter popularity as role
models for the party on Election Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the 31 Republican governors are a practical,
hard-nosed lot with state coffers awash in budget-surplus cash.
Their upbeat mood is in stark contrast to that of congressional
Republicans stung by their failed effort to oust President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Republican governors enjoy a
popularity that many in Washington can only envy,'' said Clifford
May, communications director for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana said in an interview that in
the public service arena, being a governor is ``the best job in
America. It puts you close to the people you serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors, he said, have to be practical and rely on common
sense. ``They have to produce results for the people they serve.''
He added that ``learning from our experience could be beneficial''
for GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Racicot spoke as the Republican governors, along with their 17
Democratic and two independent gubernatorial colleagues, met here
for the annual four-day National Governors' Association meeting
that began Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kettl, director of the LaFollette Institute of Public
Affairs at the University of Wisconsin, said statehouse success
stems from the hands-on, problem-solving nature of a governor's job
in contrast to Capitol Hill lawmakers' more nebulous task of
fighting policy wars.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and the Republican Congress transferring power and
decision-making in many areas to states over the last several
years, ``states are becoming places where things have to happen.
... The governors have seized the possibilities and run with
them,''
</P>
<P>
   Racicot and other GOP governors such as George Pataki of New
York, George W. Bush of Texas, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin have been credited with making the Republican
vision of smaller-but-more-effective government a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking office in 1993, Racicot tried to win voter
approval for a 4-percent sales tax to eliminate a $200 budget
deficit. Voters turned him down by a 3-1 margin. So he cut
spending, which eventually produced a $22 million surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson started welfare reform in Wisconsin in 1987, nine years
before Congress approved national legislation limiting the time
recipients can receive aid and requiring most of them to go to
work.
</P>
<P>
   In one form or another, Bush, Pataki and Engler have all cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For these Republican governors, however, achieving political
success has often entailed deviations from GOP orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Engler of Michigan led the charge in 1993 to eliminate the use
of property taxes to fund education. But when schools faced a
budget shortfall up to $7 billion the following year, he got
Michigan voters to approve a 2-percentage-point hike in the state
sales tax. It was either that or a boost in the state income tax,
he told them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who bills himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' lost a
battle in his first term to offset a $3 billion property tax cut
with a sales tax increase and a new tax on professional
partnerships including those of doctors and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, he used the state's budget surplus in 1997 to
lower property tax bills by $1 billion. Having won reelection last
year with 69 percent of the vote, he is now proposing a property
and sales tax cut of $2.6 billion. But he also wants to spend $3.6
billion to reimburse school districts for lost tax revenue, as well
as for higher teacher salaries and instructional programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has zig-zagged on spending and taxes. With a surplus of
about $2 billion, he called last month for a 1.8 percent spending
increase. Last year he pushed through a 13 percent budget increase,
principally for Medicaid and education _ and easily won a second
term.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee
and, until last month, governor of Colorado, said,``You have a
different Republican Party for governors than you do for the House
and Senate. ... Republican governors win out there because they
have an ability to reach toward moderate voters while retaining
their (Republican loyalist) base.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of success has eluded GOP lawmakers in Congress, Romer
said, adding: ``Conservatives have a stranglehold on (Senate and
House members) that they don't have on the governors.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Hill Republicans are still trying to recover from their
political miscues in the impeachment debacle, from the government
shutdowns of 1995 and 1996 and from conservatives' charges that in
their budget agreements with Clinton in 1997 and 1998, they gave
too much to the Democrats.

TINKY WINKY FALLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday Feb. 22)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think the Rev. Jerry Falwell showed great courage when he
revealed in the National Liberty Journal that the purple Teletubby,
Tinky Winky, is gay.
</P>
<P>
   I have always suspected Tinky Winky was gay but I never told
anyone for fear I would be laughed at or made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you a little old to be watching Teletubbies?'' is one
of the questions I feared being asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you expect of something named Tinky Winky? It's
not exactly a name you'd give to a professional wrestler, you
know,'' is another.
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell has demonstrated many times over the years that he
is not afraid of looking or sounding like a fool. While some people
may wonder why a man of his accomplishments (I still get all tingly
when I think of the time Falwell urged General Motors to withdraw
its sponsorship of the TV sitcom ``Ellen'' after the main character
revealed her homosexuality) would waste his time outing a cloying,
purple puppet that some of your more discerning 2-year-olds have
trouble stomaching, I think Falwell should be congratulated for his
courage and unwavering sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   While some conservative televangelists might have just said that
Tinky Winky is gay and let it go at that, Falwell took it one step
further: He offered proof. Not only is the name Tinky Winky
suspicious in itself, but there is the purple coloration. Purple is
the gay-pride color, which is something I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of Tinky Winky's antenna. It is shaped
like a triangle. Triangle shapes are another symbol of gay pride,
which is something, again, that I did not know but Falwell
obviously did.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not forget for a minute the far from insignificant
matter of Tinky Winky's purse. Tinky Winky's spin doctors, of
course, denied that Tinky Winky carries a purse but described it,
instead, as a ``magic bag.'' This pathetic attempt at damage
control is unlikely to change anyone's mind about Tinky Winky's
sexual persuasion, least of all the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about all of this is that by ``blowing the
whistle,'' so to speak, on Tinky Winky, Falwell has given the show
free publicity and may have unwittingly enhanced viewership as
curious people tune in in the sick hope of catching Tinky Winky and
Dipsy doing the dirty deed. (This is one example of what the
editorialists term the ``fallout'' of the Clinton scandal.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what, if any, effect this controversy will
have on the preschoolers who are the core of Tinky Winky's fan
base. Boys might learn that it is unwise to carry a purse when
appearing on national television, at least not during those times
when the Rev. Jerry Falwell is watching. Girls might think twice
about dyeing themselves purple (definitely a good thing) or about
doing up their hair in the shape of a triangular antenna (probably
a good thing).
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the lessons are more obvious. For one thing, you
should never, ever, under any circumstances, name your son or
daughter Tinky Winky. Also to be avoided are the names Dipsy,
Laa-Laa and Po, as these are the names of other Teletubbies on the
show who have come into contact, if you will, with the morally
challenged Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also avoid watching ``Teletubbies'' (not that big
a sacrifice, by the way) in case Tinky Winky and his friends are
putting out subliminal messages more nefarious than the usual ones
urging the purchase of sugary cereals and expensive toys.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Falwell did this nation a great service by outing Tinky
Winky. Now, if he could just get something on Barney, we'd be
eternally in his debt.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, heavy snow fell in portions of western
North Carolina as a low-pressure system passed through the southern
Middle Atlantic states. Residual moisture on the western flank of
the low may bring a brief period of snow to eastern Virginia and
the Del Marva peninsula early Saturday morning before the low moves
well off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this same low will pass several hundred miles off the
New England coast. The projected path will bring the risk for snow
along the immediate coast, particularly across Cape Cod and the
Island. Farther inland, partly to mostly sunny skies will cover the
interior Northeast with chilly breezes from the north developing
during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As cold air flowing southward from Canadian high pressure
gathers moisture in transit across the unfrozen Great Lakes, light
snow showers will form near the southern shores of the lakes. A
light accumulation of snow is possible in a few locations.
</P>
<P>
   Dry conditions will stretch across the South Saturday from the
Southwestern deserts to the Southeast. Skies will be partly to
mostly sunny throughout the region, though moistening onshore
breezes will cause clouds to increase near the Texas coast.
Abundant sunshine and comfortably warm air will cover Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Thickening clouds will yield to a steady rain over central and

   Focus: Erroneous Chill
</P>
<P>
   A state record minimum temperature of -55 that was recorded in
Allagash, Maine, on Jan. 14, was erroneous. The instrument was sent
to a testing facility where it was immersed in a special substance
that remains liquid at temperatures as low as -90. Its readings
were compared to laboratory thermometers that have an accuracy of
one-thousandth of a degree. The thermometer was found to be
increasingly inaccurate as lower temperatures were tested. At an
actual temperature of -38, the Allagash instrument read -55 causing
officials to disallow the apparent record chill.

   COKE-WATER _ ATLANTA _ The Coca-Cola Co., the nation's leader in
carbonated soft drinks, will begin selling bottled water in the
United States this year. The water, to be sold in a light blue
plastic bottle, is called Dasani. It's expected to be available
nationwide before this summer. Coke already sells bottled water
overseas, but the 113-year-old company has long been reluctant to
add water to its line of soft drinks in the United States. (Atlanta

Roswell High graduate Scott Pohlman are solid, but the Tigers have

   TRADE-REPORT (Washington) _ The trade deficit in goods and

full year. December's deficit shrank to $13.8 billion from $15.3
billion in November. Exports declined 0.6 percent, reflecting
weaker foreign demand for industrial supplies and auto parts.
Imports fell 2.1 percent, partly because of lower oil prices. In
all of 1998, the deficit expanded to a record $168.6 billion, up
from the previous year's $110.2 billion, in a reflection of the
dollar's strength and the domestic economy's vigor. By David E.

   SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ Outside in the balmy tropical
air, residents with deep tans and hefty girths like to relax
beneath the palm trees that shade the long white beaches on this
tiny Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a garment factory, rows of workers from China perform
robotic motions under dull fluorescent lights all day long, sewing,
ironing and packing. In fast-paced, mind-numbing sequence, they
yield box after box of shirts and skirts, all to be sold by
American retailers like the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Sears, Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese workers have propelled the remarkable success of the
garment industry here, pushing sales to nearly $1 billion in 1998.
But the industry was hit with a legal bombshell in January when
lawyers filed a class-action suit here and in California, accusing
garment makers and major U.S. retailers of systematically
underpaying and mistreating workers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that in dozens of factories in Saipan, the capital
of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth where most
federal laws apply, workers are forced to work inhuman hours and to
live in overcrowded and vermin-infested conditions. It even
suggests that the workers are enduring a form of slavery, trapped
in Saipan with impossible debts and with little freedom to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with dozens of Chinese workers here tell a story
that is not so stark. Chatting easily as they stroll freely in the
warm evening air after work, they describe orderly factories and
clean dormitories, a view borne out in visits. They say they come
to Saipan voluntarily to earn about five times what they made in
China, typically heading home after two years with $6,000 to
$10,000 saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to make money, not to travel,'' said Li Jingshan,
23, who recently arrived and chafes at having to rest two days each
weekend. ``I want overtime. I want to work every day.''

<P>
   Saipan is a curious halfway point between the United States and
China, most clearly reflected in the disparity between the
ambitions of Chinese workers and the objections of American
lawyers. Where lawyers and some federal officials see a flagrant
violation of law, many Chinese see an opportunity to make money.
Where lawyers and federal officials see a careless indifference to
policing the garment industry, local officials say they lack the
manpower or ability.
</P>
<P>
   Work conditions and pay scales are clearly better than in China,
but they fall short of U.S. standards. The contracts that workers
sign before they leave China include promises _ not to strike, not
to discuss problems with outsiders, not to become pregnant _ that
are acceptable to Chinese workers, even though they shock American
investigators. Such contracts are illegal in the United States but
are signed in China. Their status here is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a culture that stresses obedience and respect for
authority, where there is little freedom to speak openly in the
workplace, many Chinese workers here seem perplexed that a lawsuit
has been filed on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they be doing it for us?'' Wen Xiaoli, 29, said as
she shopped for apples and bananas at an outdoor market one
evening. ``They must be doing it for their own reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the Saipan suit, which seeks more than $1
billion in damages, say their intention is to compensate victims
cheated by abusive employers. The lawyers themselves, led by the
firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach, which recently
helped win a major settlement for Holocaust victims from Swiss
banks, could earn substantial fees for handling a successful suit.
</P>
<P>
   For garment manufacturers, the beauty of Saipan is that it is
exempt from quota or duty restrictions that apply to garments made
elsewhere in Asia and shipped to the United States. Just a few
hours' flight from China, an endless pool of cheap labor, Saipan
also enjoys special exemptions from U.S. immigration and labor
laws, allowing manufacturers to bring in thousands of Chinese
garment workers and pay them Saipan's minimum wage of $3.05 an
hour, well below the prevailing $5.15 an hour in America.
</P>
<P>
   Like other garment workers here, Ms. Li works 40 to 60 hours a
week, depending on demand, and after her first 40 hours at $3.05 an
hour she is paid $4.50 an hour for overtime. She says she is saving
about $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan's garment industry has vaulted from sales of $5.4 million
in 1985 to $124 million in 1988 to nearly $1 billion in 1998. There
are 15,000 Chinese workers now employed in 36 garment factories
here, making clothes that carried the label ``Made in the USA.''
until federal government objections forced a switch to the tag
``Made in the Northern Mariana Islands, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has prospered from Saipan's garment business more than
Willie Tan, an ethnic Chinese businessman who runs three factories
here that sold $100 million of garments last year. His family-owned
Tan Holdings, with interests in shipping, real estate and
publishing, took in $240 million worldwide in 1998, and he denies
all charges in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Saipan, and we will stay here as long as we can
survive,'' Tan said in a telephone interview from Cambodia, where
he is planning another factory because the labor is even cheaper
there. ``We love our employees. We never run from our
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overstating it. Like their counterparts around the
world, many garment factories in Saipan, including Tan's, rely on
unskilled laborers who have been exploited in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 court decision in California fined Tan Holdings $9
million for systematically underpaying workers, the largest award
ever made in a suit brought by the Labor Department. The court
ordered Tan Holdings to install a salary-monitoring system overseen
by the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   The factory floor at TransAsia, one of three Tan Holdings
factories that sells garments to Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and
Liz Claiborne, among others, is more spacious and orderly than many
garment factories in New York City that are also staffed by recent
Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As different as Chinese and U.S. expectations are, it is hard to
argue with assertions by federal officials that on U.S. soil,
federal laws should rule. Yet with little local or federal
enforcement, even U.S. laws are useless.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials, when asked about labor abuses, typically offer
a mixture of denial, apology and insistence that things have
improved. But their comments betray a flimsy grasp of the situation
in the industry they are meant to oversee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, there hasn't been much enforcement of federal
laws,'' said Mark D. Zacheres, secretary of labor and immigration,
adding that he lacks the staff and know-how to police the industry
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Though Zacheres and other officials say they would like to pass
responsibility to the federal government, they strongly oppose
broader efforts by Washington to expand control over Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Labor and Interior Departments in Washington
now argue that Saipan's special exemptions from minimum-wage and
immigration laws have become inappropriate. What irritates many
federal officials is that local authorities pleaded for the
exemptions by arguing that a small island of 10,000 residents had
to be protected with especially tough immigration and labor laws
from potential waves of Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But then those very immigration and labor laws were manipulated
to make entry procedures looser rather than tougher, and planeloads
of Asian workers started arriving. By 1998, there were 68,000
people on Saipan, and 40,000 were foreign contract workers, mostly
Chinese garment workers and Filipinos working in hotels that cater
to Japanese tourists.

 SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands: Japanese tourists.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, federal officials express outrage over Saipan's use of
its exemptions to make money, duty free, while taking advantage of
workers by abusing what the officials see as basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the U.S. suffer a continuing financial loss of $200
million a year in tariffs, a fifth of a billion dollars, for the
dubious privilege of explaining to the rest of the world why it
tolerates the CNMI human rights record?'' said Allen Stayman, a
senior official in the Interior Department, who oversees the
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by the Interior Department's efforts to revoke Saipan's
exemptions from federal law, Saipan's government organized an
extensive lobbying campaign. Dozens of congressmen have been flown
out for golf-and-swimming visits to Saipan, where they are told
that bureaucrats in Washington want to interfere with the island's
fragile economy. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, has
visited Saipan repeatedly and defends its special status.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who was born in the Philippines and is now an American
citizen, argues that since duty-free status is the main reason
garment makers come to Saipan, revoking it would simply force them
to go elsewhere. Standard labor costs in Cambodia are just $50 a
month per worker, Tan pointed out, compared with $110 in China and
$488 in Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   But because they are outside their homeland, Chinese workers are
still vulnerable to abuses. Factory-floor managers wield enormous
power over employees, deciding who gets overtime and sometimes
asking workers for ``loans'' and other favors in exchange for
better hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers from China are never told exactly what deductions
are made from their paychecks, typically $100 a month for housing
in an eight-person-a-room dormitory and another $100 a month for
meals in a cafeteria. In some factories, workers can live outside
the barracks, as the dormitories are called, but are still docked
for room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Factories are also legally required to pay time-and-a-half for
overtime after 40 hours per week. But some workers say that when
they fall short of quotas set by a floor manager, they are forced
to work extra hours ``off the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   As serious as these abuses are, lawyers in the class-action suit
seem to exaggerate conditions here, citing a few worst-case
examples as typical.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Chinese workers are generally required to pay a
``recruiting fee'' of $1,000 to $3,000 to work here, which is
typically borrowed privately in China and then repaid with the
first few months' salary. A smaller number of Chinese women who
come through unofficial channels often pay as much as $7,000 to
$10,000 and end up working as prostitutes in one of the dozens of
bars and massage parlors that dot the island. Yet lawyers describe
a $7,000 fee as the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the Saipan suit say that 23 anonymous workers
are willing to testify about abusive conditions and systematic
underpaying. Two workers, both women, agreed to an interview in a
lawyer's office here, on condition that their names not be made
public because they fear recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The women told compelling tales of unfair working conditions,
but the accusations were not as serious as the allegations in the
suit. Nor did these women seem representative of the larger Chinese
population here. They appeared to be spirited individuals unsuited
to monotonous factory work.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Courts here and
in Los Angeles, seeks damages from 22 garment makers in Saipan for
systematically mistreating and underpaying 50,000 Chinese workers
over a period of 10 years. A third related suit was also filed in
state court in San Francisco by the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, known as UNITE, and human rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel legal tactic, the lawyers also invoked racketeering
charges against 18 leading U.S. retailers _ including the Gap,
Tommy Hilfiger and Sears _ arguing that garment makers and buyers
actively conspired to deprive garment workers of proper pay and
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several defendants have denied the charges and
affirmed their commitment to strict fair-labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   As economists point to the growing irrelevance of national
boundaries in global trade and as consumers everywhere increasingly
value quality and price over country of origin, Saipan may
eventually lose its cachet as an ideal place to make garments. The
American quota system, a protectionist relic of earlier days, is
already scheduled to be phased out.

<P>
   JINXIANG, China _ From this remote coastal town ringed with
barren hills, Chen Jiashu's influence spreads all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   He lends authority to police officers on the streets of New York
and to U.N. peacekeepers in the hills of Macedonia. His presence is
felt every time a Ghanaian customs inspector frisks a smuggler or
an American bail enforcement officer tracks down a criminal who has
skipped town.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, Chinese troops give testament to his skill. And
all across America's heartland, Lions Club members hold his work
close to their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 46, is the owner of China's biggest manufacturer of badges
and pins, a world leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years,'' he said, flipping through books displaying
his products, ``we've been making insignia for Ford, badges for the
U.S. police forces, emblems for the U.N. forces and, I'm pretty
sure, for the U.S. military, too. Though I'm not really sure which
is which, of course, since I can't read any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Deng Xiaoping opened China's markets 20 years ago,
people in Jinxiang and other rural towns around the city of Wenzhou
have been transforming themselves from the poorest of farmers into
the country's ultimate capitalists, with a strong libertarian bent.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for their aggressive entrepreneurial skills,
Wenzhou-area business people like Chen have spent the last five
years plowing money not only into their private factories and homes
but also into roads, bridges _ even the city's first train station.
</P>
<P>
   In the world's largest communist country, they have created a
free-market paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wenzhou region, an isolated swath along the coast of
Zhejiang province, there are few state-owned enterprises. In fact,
there are few truly public works at all. Even parks, highways and
tunnels are often _ partly or totally _ privately financed. Here,
almost every family has a factory and every town a product.
</P>
<P>
   The road north out of Wenzhou, the only real metropolis in the
region, winds through a succession of farming hamlets with
three-story concrete homes whose dirt yards double as storerooms
for the local product: playground equipment, stone lions to flank
doorways, huge sanded logs. Jinxiang, Chen's hometown, makes
badges.
</P>
<P>
   As Lin Xiuheng put it, ``This area used to be a blank, and now
we are filling it in.'' Lin is deputy magistrate of Cangnan County,
which includes Jinxiang. ``Our living standards have increased
dramatically,'' he added. ``All over China you'll find people from
here doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, cars traveling along the
Beijing-to-Guangzhou highway had to make a time-consuming detour
around the broad base of Zhoufeng Mountain, 20 miles south of
Wenzhou. Then Zhang Licheng, a local farmer-turned-entrepreneur,
offered to blast a three-mile-long tunnel through the mountain _ if
the government allowed him to charge people for using it for the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Today his tollbooths and uniformed toll collectors guard the
tunnel, and every car, no matter how well connected its occupants,
pays him $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're from the government or not _ you
pay,'' a young collector told the grumbling driver of an official
black Audi who had tried to wave himself through with his official
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Although Communist Party hard-liners relentlessly criticized the
``Wenzhou model'' until the early 1990s, they have since then
offered occasional praise, or at least left the region alone. And
these days, with much of China suffering from layoffs and worker
discontent, party loyalists are unlikely to tinker with a region
whose economic growth exceeds 10 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a sense, the Wenzhou people had no choice but to rely on the
market, since nature and history gave them little else to work
with. This densely populated region is surrounded, on three sides
by mountains and one by sea. Only 16 percent of the land is arable.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the central government has made few
capital investments in the area, which because of its location was
deemed a likely casualty in any conflict with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, the people here seized every opportunity that
legally came their way _ and then some. Here in Jinxiang, selling
crude homemade pins and badges had long provided a supplemental
income to farmers. During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when
private business was strictly forbidden, they sold Mao pins to the
Red Guards.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed only natural for Chen to start a badge factory when he
was discharged from the army in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   At first he joined the legions from the region who fanned out
across China on ramshackle ferries and long-distance buses to sell
local products. At a time when a strict system of residence permits
forced Chinese to work in or near their hometowns, 8 percent of
Wenzhou people were living outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of hard work and suffering went into building all
these large houses we've seen go up here in the last few years,''
Chen said, sitting behind a vast desk in his marble-floored office.
``I would often have to stand on a train for two or three days and
would eat nothing but rice for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   These traveling peddlers gave the region a head start on the
rest of China, which did not move vigorously toward the market for
another five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very quickly set up a national network of distribution and
sales,'' said Lin. ``Since there were many shortages in those days,
we were able to identify niches that we could exploit.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, enterprises like Chen's have grown and become
more sophisticated. As restrictions on travel and private business
have eased, Chen's once small workshop has become a large factory
with the latest European machines, operated by migrant workers. The
army of traveling salespeople has given way to elegant
representative offices catering to international clients in
Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's life has changed as well. On a dusty plot in the middle
of Jinxiang's four-story apartment blocks, Chen is now building a
modern mansion. He has an apartment in Shanghai, 250 miles north,
which he uses for his frequent business trips, and last year he
sent his 13-year-old daughter away to private school in Wenzhou.
Ninety percent of people in the Wenzhou area own their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in the town still work on a smaller scale, like
Feng Ziyuan, 43, whose family runs a badge stall and workshop on a
tangled street lined with dozens of identical storefronts in the
old part of town. Feng and eight family members sell mostly to
people from nearby villages _ making nameplates for furniture,
school insignia, that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why badges?'' Feng said. ``Well, we didn't know any other
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the people in the Wenzhou region have
now left the land _ although many are still officially classified
as farmers. And that means they still have to hand over to the
government a yearly grain quota.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Since owning factories is far more profitable than
farming, a number of residents pay farmers from poorer provinces to
till their fields.

THE INTERNET HAS SPAWNED A LANGUAGE OF ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the linguistic life of Andrew Walker, 12, a k a Off
Cpring. Like most seventh graders, he talks quite a bit to his
friends and parents. He also writes any number of school reports
and the occasional Christmas card or thank-you note.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is his fluency in the chat room, where written and
spoken language slur together. Here, a correctly spelled word is a
sign of the inarticulate and an innovative abbreviation is prized
above all else.
</P>
<P>
   OFF CPRING: Wuzup?
</P>
<P>
   PRETTYFLI5: n2m
</P>
<P>
   OFF CPRING: well g/g c ya
</P>
<P>
   Loose translation: Not too much is up with Prettyfli5, and Off
Cpring has got to go and will see Prettyfli5 later.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, Andrew slips, like the time he lapsed into
onlinespeak in a social studies paper: ``Surplus is an excess,'' he
wrote, ``But surplus can also mean 2much.'' His teacher took off 10
points.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Andrew, of Woodstock, N.Y., continues to log on to
America Online three or four times a day. And no one is worrying
about whether he's going to get into college. But the protocol of
informality that marks electronic communication for Andrew and
millions of others has set off a debate about whether the Internet
invigorates language or strips it of its expressive power.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Internet has done is to create a space for language
that runs and slips over the boundary of public and private
language,'' said James J. O'Donnell, author of the recently
published ``Avatar of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace''
(Cambridge University Press, 1998). ``And so people find themselves
gradually using language in public in ways they never would have
before.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, a classics professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, argues that the trend toward informality points to a
society moving toward less institutional control, a less
hierarchical social structure and a more democratic marketplace of
ideas. That is a trend he says should be embraced, even if it will
probably lead to the elimination of tenured authorities like him.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of how the Internet is shaping language was
discussed at the annual meeting of the Modern Languages Association
last month and is a focus of several new books and online forums.
</P>
<P>
   Although judgments vary, what seems clear so far is that the
Internet has propelled the traditionally deliberate pace of
language evolution to higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a setting that is a hotbed for change,'' said Susan C.
Herring, an associate professor of linguistics at the University of
Texas in Arlington. Her scrutiny of thousands of Internet e-mail
messages found that sentence complexity was not reduced, although
politeness was. ``The Internet is a giant context that invites
informal communication, and there is lots of experimentation going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   She would get little argument from people who regularly type
e-mail all in lowercase letters or forsake standard grammar for
stream-of-consciousness or incorporate acronym cliches into
standard sentences. (Even chat room neophytes know to use LOL to
signify ``laughing out loud.'') Indeed, the linguistic foibles of
Internet communication have been well documented since the early
1990s, when the computer network morphed from an academic preserve
into the general public's favored receptacle for business memos,
political rants and love notes.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial fascination with cyberspace shorthand _ like the
emoticons used to convey tone of voice :-) :-( _ has evolved with
the syntax itself. Sanguine e-mailers now seem to prefer a more
direct description of the implied sentiment placed in parentheses,
such as (grin) or (shrug). Likewise, the novelty of watching old
words take on new meaning (spam, flame, surf) has worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   Now linguists are studying the qualitative changes in the
construction of ideas that have brought on the casual spelling and
the multitude of parentheticals that mark Internet exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sven Birkerts, an English professor at Bennington College, is
not so optimistic about what he agrees is the melding of public and
private communication in the context of the Internet. Birkerts, who
mourned the fate of electronic age reading in his 1994 book, ``The
Gutenberg Elegies,'' touches on the unraveling of language in a new
collection of essays to be published by Greywolf Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never see a sentence with a semicolon in it anymore,''
Birkerts said in an interview. ``People don't tend to read the kind
of writing that has semicolons. We tend to read the prose of the
age, and the prose of the age, influenced by the ethos of
electronic communication, is almost overwhelmingly flat, punchy and
declarative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Birkerts consoled by the evidence that people who would
not ordinarily write letters take quickly to e-mail, or that those
who would never write a book happily self-publish on the World Wide
Web. It is precisely the Internet's seductive instantaneousness, he
argues, that leads to the impoverishment of language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there are floods of five-line communiques going
back and forth between the circuits has little to do with the
health of the language,'' Birkerts says. ``Have we added anything
to the world if a lot more people are dashing off written things in
the key of casual conversation?''

   To avoid the pitfalls of instant delivery, The Paris Review, a
leading fiction journal, refuses to take submissions by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to encourage anything that causes writers to slow down
and think about what they're doing,'' said Daniel Kunitz, its
managing editor. ``With e-mail, it's too easy for them to throw
anything that seems like less than a first draft at us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Friedlander, a professor of English at Stanford
University, where a required humanities course for first-year
students has been revamped to include e-mail and Web site design,
says the informal nature of Internet communication has improved his
students' language skills. As students discuss readings in online
forums, he says, they are using the technology to develop what he
calls ``collage text writing,'' incorporating fellow-students'
responses and other resources into their own work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills you see emerging quickly are qualitatively
different from the ones students had before,'' Friedlander said.
``They are learning to quickly formulate ideas into written
language and create an argument. What gets lost is a certain kind
of polish and formal organization. But what they're getting is a
fluency in writing that they didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The professors who organized the Stanford class also considered
how language should be defined when technology is changing the ways
people communicate, enabling them to mix words with graphics, sound
and video. For example, Friedlander explains that by encouraging
students to design Web sites to express their ideas, ``we're trying
to accept what the conceptual cultural climate is and to move
forward instead of acting like it doesn't exist.'' People forget
that ``language is a tool,'' he said. ``It's a tool with which we
bring things together and create intimacy in our lives.''

   RINGOES, N.J. _ You know you're in trouble,'' says Arnie
Gervasio, ``when at age 50 you make your living bent over a horse's
foot with your rear end above your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio is a farrier, a fancy word for horse-shoer. He travels
from stable to stable with blacksmithing tools and manufactured
horseshoes, which he molds to the horses' feet after trimming and
cleaning the hoofs.
</P>
<P>
   When you visit his own 20-acre horse farm in this bucolic hamlet
in the heart of New Jersey's horse country, the only shoeless
animal you're likely to encounter is Spike _ a half-corgi mutt with
a penchant for darting under moving cars in the driveway. But Spike
is still canine gentry _ a great-grandson of Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis' purebred corgi.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, Gervasio shod thoroughbreds at Mrs.
Onassis' farm in Bernardsville, N.J., where weekend fox hunts were
de rigueur. ``A couple of sniffs of brandy and, tallyho, off they'd
go,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now he jets off to tend to the mounts of the Olympic equestrian
medal winner Robert Dover during international competitions and,
closer to home, cares for the residents of Bruce Springsteen's
stable in Red Bank, N.J., and for some of the horses owned by
members of the Essex Fox Hounds Club.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not always ridden so high. His parents were Italian
immigrant factory workers who wanted him to work at General Motors
or attend college. ``I did neither,'' he said, ``though my sister
has a master's in mathematics from Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gervasio was 7, his family moved to a horse farm in Ewing,
N.J., operated by a retired Virginia cavalryman. It was equestrian
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Gervasio was spending all his spare time there, and he knew
that he would devote his life to working with horses. ``Back
then,'' he said, recalling the days of his apprenticeship, ``the
old-timers did everything _ doctoring, shoeing, training,
breeding.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, after high school, he started training and showing
quarter horses. ``It was tough to make a living, and people were
always asking me to shoe their horses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One shoe led to another _ for all sorts of horses _ and by 1968
Gervasio had backed into the business of shoeing full time. In 1972
he also became an official farrier to the All American Quarter
Horse Congress, which runs competitions. He held that post for the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio says his 300-horse business provides a healthy
six-figure income. ``I started off 30 years ago getting a buck a
shoe, and now it's around $200 a horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his quadruped customers need to be shod every month. ``A
horse's foot is constantly growing, just like your fingernail,'' he
said. ``Maintaining the feet is crucial for the horse to have good
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends half of every winter month tending equine clients in
West Palm Beach, Fla., home of the Winter Equine Festival. Most are
hunters, jumpers and dressage competitors. He prefers tending to
these horses, which perform complex and beautiful movements, to
working with their race track counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio had a brief fling with entrepreneurship in the 70s,
when he invented the first sliding plate shoe, used on horses that
perform especially intricate steps. But he became discouraged
because the design was too easy to copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big companies had to do was change some little thing
and they could make it themselves,'' he said. ``They made a fortune
on that shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn LeDonne, a longtime client, describes Gervasio's
business style as level-headed, not leveraged. ``The ironic thing
about Arnie is that some of his clients are living these lavish
rich-and-famous life styles on borrowed money,'' Mrs. LeDonne said.
``Meanwhile, he clumps around in jeans and a flannel shirt but with
his farm, horses, custom truck and house all totally paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio says he has never had so much as a mortgage. ``My
parents knew about hard work, not borrowing or investing,'' he
explained. When cash starts accumulating, he invests in what he
knows. ``I bought a yearling for $3,000 and sold her for $35,000
two years later,'' he said. ``Another one I paid $10,000 for and
sold for $70,000. But of course they don't all work out like that.
One horse caught pneumonia and died.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does an investor determine which Pegasus will be the
next equine Ebay? ``You have to know exactly what characteristics
make a really good dressage horse, hunter and jumper or quarter
horse and look for those traits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gervasio came up through the old-fashioned route of
apprenticeship, he suggested that future farriers attend one of the
nation's 59 training programs. Courses are as short as 12 weeks or
as long as two years and can cost $2,000 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Gervasio isn't shoeing his regular clientele or jetting to
Florida, he's busy getting his passport stamped. Last year he shod
horses competing in the World Cup Dressage competition in Europe.
And there's a good chance you'll find him, hammer in hand, at the
2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, tending to the horses is like coaching a human
runner, he explained. ``Somebody has to monitor everything,'' he
said. ``If the weather is looking dry I have to make sure the feet
have moisture and don't get bruised.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio's customers discuss his abilities with awe, even
suggesting that he is a real-life ``horse whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him say something to a horse that no one else could
get near, and afterwards that animal ate out of his hand,'' Mrs.
LeDonne recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Gervasio scoffs at notions of mystical powers. ``The
difference between me and someone just nailing shoes on a horse's
feet is that I stay ahead of the problems _ take care of them
before they happen,'' he said. ``For the rest, any good horseman
learns to read the signs _ a shy horse, one that's going to bite
you. It's like knowing your dog.''
</P>
<P>
   (So what did he whisper into the ear of that recalcitrant mount?
``I said, `Hey, how would you like a chain saw for a bit?' '' he
recalled.)
</P>
<P>
   Now if only Gervasio could whisper something to keep that little
dog out of the driveway.

COAL'S HOT COMPETITION FORGES A BREED OF GIANTS

 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Coal mining is no longer a huge industry but its role
in the economy is still crucial. That is because coal is burned to
generate more than half the electricity produced by American power
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been difficult to make money in coal, partly because
there is simply so much of it and partly because of environmental
regulations. So with overproduction and competition helping to hold
prices down, many mines are going on the block, while a few giants
are seizing the opportunity to gain even bigger market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very brutally competitive business,'' said
Steven F. Leer, chief executive of Arch Coal Inc. and chairman of
the National Mining Association. ``People have become very
efficient in their mining techniques, and now you're seeing those
efficiency drives spill over to the consolidation and trying to
reduce overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 companies control 61 percent of the nation's coal
output, up from 35 percent in 1988, according to a study by Arch,
now the country's No. 2 coal producer behind the Peabody Holding
Co. And experts predict that the consolidation trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest companies to offer their coal interests for
sale are Chevron, the oil industry giant, and Cyprus Amax Minerals,
a copper mining company.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffling has multiple causes, including changes in mining
technology and in the practices of electric utilities. Like some
other industries, coal is increasingly dominated by well-financed,
sharply focused large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions by Peabody, which is based in St. Louis, have
helped strengthen its lead. It had 13.8 percent of total production
in 1998, up from 7.5 percent a decade ago. Peabody itself was
bought last year by Lehman Merchant Banking Partners II for $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Arch, also based in St. Louis, has jumped from No. 16 in 1996 to
No. 2, with 9.7 percent of production, by merging with Ashland Coal
and acquiring the ARCO coal unit of Atlantic Richfield for $1.7
billion. Kennecott Energy of Gillette, Wyo., a subsidiary of Rio
Tinto PLC, a mining giant based in London, became No. 3 by buying
several large mines in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Now up for sale are the rest of Cyprus Amax Coal and Chevron's
Pittsburg &AMP; Midway Coal Mining, both based in Englewood, Colo., a
suburb of Denver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coal tonnage used by utilities has nearly tripled since
1970, but no one worries about running out of supply.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still has more than 1,000 recoverable tons of
coal for every resident, enough to last more than 250 years at
current rates of consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in coal mining offers economies of scale beyond
the usual savings on shared overhead. Big improvements in
productivity, like the use of ``longwall'' mining machines for
underground work and heavy earth-moving equipment for surface
mines, have pushed the amount of capital needed to open a
competitive mine beyond the means of smaller producers.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller coal companies also have a disadvantage in negotiating
freight rates, said Daniel A. Roling, a senior metals and mining
analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. ``If you only are a
one-mine company shipping on one railroad, you have no leverage,
and you're going to pay dearly to move your coal,'' Roling said.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for negotiating coal prices with utilities. ``The
customers keep consolidating and getting bigger,'' he added. ``If
you're going to have any kind of negotiating strength, you have to
negotiate from size.''
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins are being squeezed as lucrative long-term
contracts written in the 1970s and 80s expire and utilities demand
progressively lower rates in new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mad scramble to reduce the cost of power
production,'' said Gerald E. Vaninetti of Resource Data
International, an energy market research and service company in
Boulder, Colo. ``The last couple of years it has really gotten
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Clean Air Act, meanwhile, has pushed utilities away
from coal with high sulfur content, mined in northern Appalachia,
the Middle West and other areas, in favor of low-sulfur Western
coal, especially from the vast Powder River Basin of Wyoming and
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with coal mined underground in the East, Powder River
coal produces less heat per ton, but it is much cheaper to extract
with surface mining and is cheaper for Midwestern utilities to burn
even after shipping costs are included.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, production is steadily shifting west. The National
Mining Association calculates that coal mines west of the
Mississippi will produce 546 million tons in 1999, approaching the
575 million tons from the East. Coal production in the East has
been flat since 1980, while Western production has more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is going to capture all additional growth,'' said J.
Chris Leshock, an energy forecaster at Resource Data International.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is reinforced by Phase 2 of the Clean Air Act, which
will cut sharply the allowable sulfur dioxide emissions from most
generating plants, starting next January.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities have installed ``scrubbers,'' which reduce
pollution, in coal-burning plants, to meet the new requirements
while still burning high-sulfur coal. Some have bought emission
credits that allow their plants to exceed the standards. But most
have found it more economical to switch to low-sulfur coal, or use
a blend of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Leshock said that demand for coal to generate electric power
would continue to grow, because coal remains cheaper than natural
gas, but that nearly all the growth would be at existing coal-fired
plants, which tend to have ample excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Most coal analysts say there is only a remote chance the United
States will impose tough curbs on carbon dioxide emissions, as
outlined in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, aimed at curtailing greenhouse
gases. The National Mining Association has deplored the Clinton
administration's signing of the pact and opposes Senate
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Leshock said the Kyoto restrictions ``could wipe out something
on the order of one-third of the U.S. coal industry'' and ``make it
uneconomical overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyoto aside, coal is a ``dog-eat-dog industry'' but one where
the big dogs can be healthy, said Joel Price, an energy consultant
in the Denver suburb of Lakewood. ``Those that can hang on long
enough,'' Price said, ``will divide up the spoils _ not get rich,
but do fine.''

WHEN A BUDDY MAKES IT BIG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Ohio, Va.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Aldrich and Kent Kille have been good friends since
junior high. They lived on the same street in Chapel Hill, N.C.,
played basketball after school and attended the University of North
Carolina together. They're both 29, married and hard-working. But
there's one glaring disparity: Aldrich is worth about $10 million,
and Kille, well, isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich was the co-founder of an on-line brokerage site that was
sold to Intuit in 1996; he now is president of Intuit Insurance
Services. Kille teaches political science at the College of Wooster
in Ohio and is working toward a PhD at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two are still close, keeping in touch through
e-mail, holiday cards and occasional visits, Kille sometimes
wonders if he went wrong somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Christmas, I was with Steven and two other friends, one of
whom gave up academia to go into business, and I thought, `Did I
make the right decision?''' said Kille (pronounced KILL-ee), who
lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Wooster.
</P>
<P>
   Their contrasting stories are hardly unique, especially in a
world where more and more 20-somethings seem to be founding
technology companies and selling them for rich sums.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census Bureau, the median annual income of 25-
to 34-year-olds was $21,821 as of last March _ and some, burdened
with debt, have negative net worth. But Jeff Skoll, 33, a founder
of Ebay, the on-line auction service in California's Silicon
Valley, has already piled up $10.2 million in stock. Or how about
Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, co-chief executives of
Theglobe.com, a shopping, news and business information site that
went public in November? By the end of the company's first day of
trading, they were each worth about $50 million. Not bad for a
couple of 25-year-olds from Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these young impresarios say they aren't all that different
from you and me. Unlike many of their counterparts in the
entertainment industry, who live in Beverly Hills castles and
travel with entourages, they are almost apologetic about their
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them say they have no time to spend their cash. And if
they did, what would they buy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us in the Valley work so darn hard,'' Skoll said.
``It's not like we have much of a chance to slow down and
appreciate the finer things.'' Like houses. Skoll still shares a
home in Los Altos, Calif., with four roommates.
</P>
<P>
   Though Aldrich lives in a town house overlooking the Potomac
River in Alexandria, Va. _ ``we're the youngest in our neighborhood
by about 30 years'' _ he carries a mortgage and drives a beat-up
1992 Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Krizelman and Paternot breeze into their office in jeans and
Theglobe.com T-shirts, ``partly for brand-building, but also
because that's who we are,'' Krizelman said. They are also quick to
point out that they know about suffering.
</P>
<P>
   They started their company in a fraternity house, paid employees
in pizza, nearly flunked out of school and had no social life to
speak of. When they moved to Manhattan in 1996, they rented tiny
apartments _ 280 square feet in Paternot's case.
</P>
<P>
   Three years and many dollars later, they say that only the sizes
of their offices and apartments have changed. Otherwise, their
wealth is on paper. ``All our money's tied up in stocks _ we can't
sell it, we're not planning to buy boats,'' Krizelman said.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, his wealth has a greater effect on others
than on him. ``The irony is that the people around you change,'' he
said. ``Not our good friends _ most have become lawyers or bankers
and are earning significant cash _ but people who were never
friends and now want to be. You're sensitive that people might pay
attention to you because of the company, and you look for people
who don't have any interest in that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Aldrich, his money lets him and his wife, Allison,
indulge in some dreams. ``My wife went to school to get her
master's in art history, which is something she wouldn't have been
able to do without the financial wherewithal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Aldrich sees Kille and his wife, Nicola, as proof that
wealth is not essential for personal fulfillment. ``They're really
happy,'' he said. ``It's not an issue of sitting around saying,
`We've done well and you haven't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich often picks up the check when he dines with Kille, but
it's not expected.
</P>
<P>
   Kille said Aldrich comes across as a regular guy with a large
piggy bank. ``I'm happy for him,'' Kille said. ``He's worked hard,
and it's not like he's Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't think Steven's
going to be on the front page of the National Enquirer or Teen Beat
any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kille said, he's not opposed to earning a few extra bucks
himself. ``I love teaching and interacting with my students,'' he
said. ``But if someone wanted to pay me a couple hundred thousand
dollars to do it, that would be fine.'' &QL;

   LAINEZ, Honduras _ Dr. Henry Moore comes from a world unlike
that of the Hondurans who walk hours to seek his care.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, with his sandpaper Texas drawl, is the first doctor to
visit the village of Lainez since Hurricane Mitch hit last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't hurt,'' Moore said in Spanish as he put his
stethoscope inside the thin cloth shirt of Marco Gabriel Gravis,
18.
</P>
<P>
   The young man stared at the foreign doctor with the rough,
gentle hands. His four siblings laughed as Moore demonstrated how
to say ``ahhh.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sent the family away with aspirin, medicine for pinworms,
lice shampoo, vitamins and cough medicine. ``Adios, familia
buena,'' he said, thumping Marco on his back.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Moore, 66, has traveled to remote hamlets in
Honduras as an Episcopalian medical missionary. He carries basic
remedies like aspirin and pills for diarrhea to peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, he led several doctors and nurses from the San
Antonio area to Honduran subsistence farmers still reeling from
what has been called the worst natural disaster in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The average Honduran here in the southern mountains doesn't own
a bank account. Most cannot read. They farm to feed themselves. If
they could afford a car, they would drive on dirt roads.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the peasants carried babies in their arms for miles to
visit the American doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane called Mitch pummeled the tropical country from
Oct. 25 to Nov. 2, taking more than 5,000 lives and leaving 2
million people homeless. It wiped out the corn and bean fields that
are staples.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other people died in El Salvador, Honduras and
Nicaragua. The hurricane caused some $4 billion in damage in
Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until early February that Moore could arrange for a
13-member medical team to go to El Paraiso, a Honduran state along
the Nicaraguan border. Every day for five days, the team weaved
along winding roads to treat hundreds of villagers suffering from
parasites, head colds and aching bones.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of lives were lost in the cities of Danli and El
Paraiso, although the body count was lower than in the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa and along the northern coast. The hurricane
lacerated fields that produce the region's only cash crop, coffee.
The fields will not produce coffee beans until four years after
they are replanted.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran subsistence farmers have tilled the land for centuries,
fashioning corn into tortillas and harvesting beans. The hurricane
left them without food. They won't plant again until September.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling water and washing hands for personal hygiene could
eliminate chronic health problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, Moore said, firewood is costly, and so is soap. The
hurricane exacerbated the poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they weren't badly hurt in the mountains, but we felt
we should say we love you and we know you've been hurt, and we'll
be with you until this is resolved,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the border region of Honduras was battered by the
civil war between the Sandinistas and contras in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived the war,'' said Alejandro Chirinos, an Episcopal
deacon in the city of El Paraiso. He recalled a period of five
years when children stumbled on hand grenades, mines blew up pickup
trucks and shells fell on the school where he taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped from the contras and Mitch fell on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his team climbed a dusty road one day to Lainez. The
town is little more than a clearing rimmed with pine trees, home to
84 families, an Episcopal church, a school, a community center and
a sloped soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Delmi Sagrario Rodriguez and her children hopped in Moore's
pickup truck after walking two hours from her hillside home to see
the American doctors. Her other option was to walk two more hours
to the small city of Yuscaran.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Yuscaran's public clinic might prescribe a medicine
for her infant's recurring cough. But, Rodriguez said, the cost
would be beyond her means. She pays the Episcopalian team of four
doctors, three nurses and six helpers five lempiras, about 35 cents
per child.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's diocese, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas, raised and
sent $30,000 in aid to Honduras. Moore raised an additional $5,444
and spent $800 of his own money for his 13-member brigade, $3,771
for medicine and the rest for plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathered one day at a community center in Las Crusitas
to wait for the American doctors and nurses. Nearly 730 people live
in hills a 90-minute drive on a dirt road from Yuscaran and the
nearest doctor. On Feb. 9, the Episcopalians treated 232 people,
then braved the potholed and unlighted road after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Moore began his medical missionary work 14 years ago, after Leo
Frade, the Episcopalian Bishop of Honduras, spoke at St. Andrew's
Episcopal Church in Seguin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was called to do it,'' Moore said. He laughed. ``I thought
the message was very clear.''

FASHION EDITORS MEET SEARS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a misty Tuesday evening in February, a
limousine was cruising along the far reaches of Brooklyn,
transporting two impeccably stylish, impeccably thin women in very
high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, do you really know where you're going?'' Marin Hopper,
the fashion director of Elle, asked the driver. Unconvincingly, he
said that he did, but that it would take 20 minutes more to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anybody know where we are?'' Nina Garcia, Elle's senior
fashion market editor, asked plaintively. Her question was left
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The editors knew they were going to the Sears at the Kings Plaza
mall in Brooklyn, and that was all. Of course, they'd never been to
the Sears at the Kings Plaza mall. Ms. Garcia, in fact, a Latin
American with socialite-straight blond hair and Army-green Daryl K
pants, had never been to any Sears, ever. ``Is it very large?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied Ms. Hopper, the daughter of Dennis Hopper.
``But there's no designer floor like at Macy's. That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopper and Ms. Garcia were two of 20 fashion editors
recruited by Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. for a program that set them up as
personal shoppers for a young bank teller who has been off welfare
for a year. Sears found the teller through Dress for Success, a
nonprofit organization that accepts and distributes donations of
professional clothing for low-income women looking for work.
Besides paying for two outfits for each of the 12 women in its own
program, Sears is donating $100,000 to Dress for Success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be meeting a bank teller,'' said Ms. Hopper,
who had just returned from the couture shows in Paris, where she
was excited to see Valentino's new embroidered mules for fall.
``Elle's philosophy has always been to keep it real, but we do lots
of fantasy, so this is a chance to get back to the real side of
things.'' Very real, indeed. ``It must be hard to work behind one
of those windows in a bank all day long,'' she mused. ``The
lighting alone is enough to die.''
</P>
<P>
   As they cruised through Brooklyn, they discussed looks for their
``client,'' who, they had been advised, preferred neutrals.
(``Well, we could do white,'' Ms. Hopper said. ``White is
seasonless now.'') They took calls on their cell phones. (``I don't
know why we're going to Sears and not Target, but, OK, I'll check
out the fuzzy slippers,'' Ms. Hopper told a Hollywood caller.) They
even pondered the notion of what ``work appropriate'' means in this
supercasual moment. Then, as they were starting to wonder if they
would ever get there, a big red Sears sign appeared through the
mist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' Ms. Garcia said. ``It's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Old Navy and Target are on the style trail, it isn't
surprising that Sears has become trend-friendly, too. ``They have
to, or they're going to lose all their customers,'' said Stan
Herman, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of
America, who was also around when Halston's name was bought and
democratized by J.C. Penney. ``That didn't work because that was
still a time when fashion had to look expensive,'' Herman said.
``Now, everything is coming from the streets and from sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears may have been one of the last lower-end chains to get with
it, but in the last few years it has been trying to get with it in
a big way, by hiring fashion designers to ``interpret'' the key
trends in any given season and consulting with color and fashion
forecasters. As a result, apparel sales have increased by 50
percent since 1996, said Linda Blakely, a Sears spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new interest the fashion world has in stretch and
synthetics, however, Sears' old reputation for uninspired,
budget-priced clothes persisted. Something clever had to be done to
get the word out.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Fashion Takes Action, the store's program for pairing
style editors with women ``in transition.'' It also presented a
fashion week photography exhibition, portraits of Dress for Success
star clients _ former prisoners, homeless women and abuse victims
who now have good jobs. ``We have been wanting to get fashion
editors into our stores for a while now,'' said Lana Cain-Krauter,
the senior vice president for women's apparel. ``So this was the
perfect way to do it. It also gives us a presence in New York
during fashion week.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunistic, sure. But in this day of diminished government
spending for social services, who would dare criticize Sears for
kicking in?
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store at Kings Plaza, Ms. Hopper and Ms. Garcia were
introduced to Rose Grant, a shy young mother of three from Crown
Heights. She was wearing an ochre-colored suit that was a little
large for her diminutive frame, and she seemed slightly overwhelmed
by the photographers, publicity agents, Sears executives and others
who had been at the store all day, monitoring the coming and going
of editors like Renee Sheffey-Brown of Essence and Andre Leon
Talley of Vogue. (Talley had begun shopping with his client in the
handbag department, declaring, ``It's all about the bag!'' and
ended up putting her in silver lame and black velvet.)
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Grant, a survivor of domestic violence, quietly
confirmed that she had just received a promotion at her bank, the
concerned circle around her exploded into supportive applause.
Then, after a photo op, it was time to get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the games begin,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   And they did, although it wasn't much fun at first. ``We
understand you don't like colors,'' Ms. Hopper was saying as she
and Ms. Garcia took Ms. Grant on a quick tour of the store. ``But
what about just a shot of color, maybe in a coat or jacket?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant was slow to respond. ``I can't really wear color,''
she said. ``It's too much of a power move.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopper persisted. ``But you just made a power move. You were
promoted.'' Ms. Grant did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   Coming upon a display of fuzzy slippers in neon colors, Ms.
Hopper exclaimed, ``Look, Rose! Tweetybird slippers! Color! These
are so you at work!'' Ms. Grant, who reads Elle but does not
traffic in fashion irony, seemed to fold up into herself in
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding,'' Ms. Hopper said remorsefully. Quietly, they
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Grant fell madly in love with the black suede boots
that Ms. Hopper seized for her (``Always start with the shoes,''
she declared, ``and build from there''), the operation picked up
speed. While Elizabeth Crow, the editor in chief of Mademoiselle
shopped nearby with a woman from East New York who now works for
Dean Witter/Morgan Stanley, Ms. Hopper and Ms. Garcia went digging
around like two ferrets on speed. In their quest for just two great
outfits, they were turning the entire store upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Michael Kors,'' Ms. Garcia said of a cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So directional,'' Ms. Hopper said of a skimpy camisole in
lipstick colors. ``Can you wear it to work?'' Ms. Grant thought so,
probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``This denim is so Helmut,'' Ms. Garcia said. ``Even I could
wear it.'' They swooped and scooped, declared and despaired. Love
this! Having a Prada moment here! So modern! Army green! This
stretch is genius! The store, in fact, was a real trend pond. There
were fashion colors, butterfly motifs, cargo pockets, gray options,
twin sets and lots and lots of pleats. ``Actually, I'm over
pleats,'' Ms. Hopper said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As she watched the clothes accumulate on a rolling rack, Ms.
Grant said very little. Mostly she nodded. It worried Nancy Lublin,
the earthy, hands-on founder of Dress for Success, who had put Ms.
Grant in her first suit for work a year ago. ``Listen, Rose, if you
don't like something, you can tell them,'' she said from the side.
``It's your choice. You've got to wear these clothes to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant didn't say anything. Ms. Hopper did. ``We've asked her
every single time,'' she said abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just pulling everything for now,'' Ms. Garcia added.
``We'll edit later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant, who had never really thought of shopping at Sears in
the first place (``I'm sort of a snob, and I thought it would be
all polyester stuff,'' she said), was actually starting to have
faith in her dogged personal shoppers. As they scurried around in
their Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choo heels for four hours, without
even stopping for a sandwich, she relaxed and let them do all the
work. When there weren't jackets in her size downstairs, they
stormed the boys' department upstairs and found a sensationally
seasonless white blazer.
</P>
<P>
   As the night went on, and more and more excellent options turned
up, Ms. Grant's smiled widened. She had just been promoted at work.
She had free child care for her three sons (through the
professional women's networking group run by Dress for Success).
Now, these two unimaginably glamorous editors had stepped off the
masthead of a magazine that she read, and they were going all out
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream come true,'' she said. ``These women really
understand what I like.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was in 1996 that Ms. Lublin, then a New York University law
student, inherited $5,000 from a great-grandfather and started
Dress for Success out of her apartment. When The New York Times
published an article about the organization last winter, things
exploded. Beautiful clothes came pouring in. Candice Bergen even
sent a couple of Murphy Brown suits. Since then, 2,000 women have
come to a church basement on West Fourth Street to pick out gently
used or new suits, new shoes (courtesy of Coach and Nine West) and
an invitation to join a networking group for a new life. There are
now 25 Dress for Success programs in this country and Canada, and a
Web site: www.dressforsuccess.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a for-profit organization, we'd be on the stock
exchange,'' said Ms. Lublin, 27, who oversees the local and
national effort, and is organizing a benefit masquerade ball and
auction on March 13 at the Waldorf-Astoria. Although a fashion
outsider, she is impressed by the generosity of the fashion world.
``Eileen Fisher invites two of our clients to her store in SoHo to
shop every week,'' she said. ``She does that quietly, without
asking us to promote it at all. Ferragamo dumped a ton of clothes,
shoes and jewelry on us, too. They asked for nothing in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher and Ferragamo, of course, aren't alone in quietly
doing good for New York. Not long ago, Norma Kamali set up a
T-shirt business with the students of Washington Irving High
School. The Gap has a mentoring program for students as well. Bobbi
Brown, the makeup mogul, has adopted one shelter, and Lane Bryant
has adopted another. Donna Karan and Stan Herman, meanwhile, have
designed spiffy uniforms for business improvement district workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Herman said, ``the city has to look good to feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking and feeling very good at Sears, Rose Grant was ecstatic
with her new day wear _ a black-leather-jacket-driven look that had
both spunk and class and a flattering brown and burgundy ensemble
that was as directional as it was professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so you,'' said Ms. Garcia, who was slumped over in a
dressing room as if she'd just given birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the new way of dressing for work,'' Ms. Hopper added.
</P>
<P>
   Later, near the door, Ms. Grant was speaking to a friend who had
just been dressed by Mademoiselle. ``I learned so much tonight,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' her friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burgundy and brown, girl,'' Ms. Grant replied. ``It's a
combination I never thought I'd wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding home, the two exhausted fashion editors felt triumphant
about teaching someone not to be so afraid of color. ``She was
nervous at first, but in the end, she really got it,'' Ms. Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopper, who thinks that brown is having a resurgence and
will be important again for fall, nodded. ``It's really fun to get
someone excited by showing them something new,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what fashion is all about, isn't it?

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Hunched over their oscilloscopes and diode
circuits on the third floor of McConnell Hall at Smith College on a
wet, gray morning, all 12 students in Professor Nalini Easwar's
electronics class say they hope to pursue careers in physics or
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing all that unusual there _ Smith, a women's college, has
long had a contingent of hard-science majors. Moreover, many
male-dominated professions have filled so rapidly with women over
the past two decades that today nearly equal numbers of men and
women are graduating from the nation's schools of law and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But engineering is different. Five out of six engineering
students across the country are male, as are 96 percent of
engineering faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help alter the imbalance and to change its
lingering white-glove image, Smith, one of the nation's premier
private schools, is planning to become the first women's college to
open an engineering department. Its trustees are expected to
approve the $12.5 million plan on Saturday, with the first course
to be offered in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people who will say, `This can't be serious,'
since it's for women,'' Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Smith,
said. ``There needs to be a critical mass of women moving through
engineering together so that guys don't ever again say, `Dearie,
let me show you how it's done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond an effort to bring more women into engineering, Smith's
plans are part of an effort by a largely white, historically elite
institution to attract more immigrants, foreigners and
first-generation students _ the groups that are most drawn to
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is a sign of how women's colleges are seeking
ways to reinvent themselves. While all universities face difficult
identity choices _ whether to emphasize training or learning,
research or teaching _ women's colleges have a bigger challenge
than most. Application rates, up in recent years, are much lower
than at academically comparable coeducational institutions, and
even many of the students here insist that they see no particular
need to segregate themselves from men in college.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Simmons, an African-American Harvard graduate who is the
12th child of a Texas sharecropper, is keenly aware of the need for
her college to reach out to a more diverse group of high school
students, ``the kind of students we don't get enough of,'' as she
put it.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Connolly, Smith's provost, noted in his proposal for the
engineering department that in California last year, 70 percent of
high school seniors who expressed an interest in engineering were
members of minority groups. ``We assume that this group currently
ignores places like Smith, since we do not offer what they want to
study,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Of Smith's 2,655 students, 99 are black, 82 are Hispanic, 232
are Asian-American, 24 are American Indian and 183 are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the nation's largest women's college and one of the
first, has undergone many changes since it opened in 1875 with 14
students and six professors.
</P>
<P>
   While it has had a franchise in producing alumnae famous for
whom they married _ including Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush _ it
has also encouraged a certain feminine boldness. It played the
first game of women's collegiate basketball in 1892, ended
mandatory lights-out in dormitories in 1922, acquired an ``atom
smasher'' in 1940 and educated both Betty Friedan and Gloria
Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   So engineering offers an opportunity for Smith to demonstrate
anew its significance in the coming decades. Only a tiny number of
liberal arts colleges have engineering departments _ Swarthmore in
Pennsylvania and Trinity in Hartford are the best known _ and men
still far outnumber women in those departments.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, for Smith students who had wanted to study
engineering, the main option has been to do so at the nearby
University of Massachusetts, through an exchange program involving
five institutions in the region. Heather White, a 21-year-old
junior from Hollywood, Calif., who was building semiconductor
circuits in class Thursday morning, has done just that and found
herself, as she put it, ``one of 3 women among 80 frat boys.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said she was accustomed to studying among men and had
no problem with it. On the other hand, she recalled that in her
advanced placement biology class in high school, she and another
girl received grades that Ms. White felt were lower than they
deserved and that she suspected were a reflection of the teacher's
lower expectations of girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been there; we've all dealt with it,'' Ms. White
said, referring to the small, unquantifiable slights that some
women in science say they have suffered. They are what Mary P.
Rowe, an ombudswoman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
has called ``micro-inequities'' for women in study and work.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Grace Duffy, a partner in Charles River Consulting Inc., an
organizational consulting firm in Cambridge, who has assessed the
climate in science and engineering departments at various
universities, said that while much had changed, things were still
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it is still a chilly climate, although it used to
be freezing,'' Ms. Duffy said. ``Vicki Schultz in the April 1998
Yale Law Review said sexual harassment today is not the blatant
kind of an earlier era, but a kind of competency undermining. I
think that's a useful way to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, the Smith provost, said there seems to be more
reverting to sexual stereotypes in a field like engineering than in
other fields, for reasons that are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Streett, a former dean of engineering at Cornell
University, spoke about women and engineering at a conference of
the American Society of Civil Engineering last July in Boston and
said many aspects of engineering and its training could be traced
to the field's military origins.
</P>
<P>
   Streett said the nation's first engineering program was offered
at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1817 and drew on the
French system from the Ecole Polytechnique, which educated a
largely homogeneous male-only student body drawn from the lower
nobility and upper middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Mary J. Sansalone, a professor of engineering at Cornell and a
vice provost there, says the best way to right the balance of sexes
in engineering is to restructure its curriculum to include more
nonscience courses at the undergraduate level, leaving full
professional training for graduate school, a move she considers
vital anyway to broaden the base for all engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is a concept that humanists have the words to
debate, but engineers cannot even begin the discussion,'' Ms.
Sansalone said. ``Engineers, particularly engineering faculty, are
nearly a homogenous group in thinking and attitudes. Smith has a
unique opportunity to create a really forward-looking engineering
experience, avoiding the stereotypes and attitudes of the past and
incorporating language and cultural studies, ethics and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Doreen A. Weinberger, a physics professor at Smith, agrees,
saying that engineering today is in flux because of the growth of
nanotechnology _ very tiny mechanisms often used in medicine _ and
information technology, making its borders with computer science
and biology more blurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a liberal arts school, we can use knowledge of other
things,'' Ms. Weinberger said. ``Industry tells us that it needs
broadly educated graduates who can think critically across a
spectrum. And at Smith, women get the support to pursue fields they
might not otherwise try. That's why we think there is such
potential here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The initial money for the new engineering department is coming
from a $5 million gift by Harvey Picker, chairman of Wayfarer
Marine Corp., and dean emeritus of the Columbia University School
of International and Public Affairs. Picker's late wife, Jean
Sovatkin Picker, was a Smith graduate and a former U.N. official.
Two other gifts add another $1 million; the rest of the $12.5
million still has to be raised, Smith officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes hiring four professors and graduating the
first class of engineering majors in 2004. The hope is that 25
majors will graduate each year.
</P>
<P>
   All are likely to face fine career prospects. The National
Science Foundation anticipates growth in engineering-related jobs
in the coming decade at a rate three times higher than that for
jobs generally.

UNUSUAL NEBRASKA CASE BEING WATCHED BY DEATH-PENALTY EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ If everything had gone according to schedule,
Randolph Reeves would be dead by now, executed in the state of
Nebraska's electric chair for killing two women nearly 19 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But very little about Reeves' case has been predictable.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, in an overwhelmingly pro-death-penalty state,
some of those arguing most strenuously that Reeves' life be spared
are his two victims' relatives, who say they will be devastated if
Reeves is put to death.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because Reeves, an Omaha Indian adopted as a
child by a white Quaker couple, was raised in that faith, which
shuns all violence, and because his two victims, one of them a
Quaker, were both strongly opposed to the death penalty. They were
killed in March 1980 in a Quaker meetinghouse in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   National Quaker organizations have recently taken up Reeves'
cause, arguing emphatically that his death would only hurt his
victims more.
</P>
<P>
   But even more striking was the 11th-hour decision on Jan. 12 by
the Nebraska Supreme Court to grant Reeves a stay of execution
after his lawyer appealed under a new amendment to the Nebraska
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which guarantees all Nebraska citizens equal
rights under the law, was approved in November by voters who
apparently did not expect it to be used to try to overturn a death
penalty sentence. (Most proponents of the measure had said they saw
it as a formality, a clause that most other states already had and
would make little practical difference in Nebraska.) But because of
the Reeves case, the new law could have repercussions well beyond
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Reeves filed an appeal asserting that he had been
the victim of a death penalty sentence that discriminates against
minorities. The lawyer said that although Indians and blacks make
up 4 percent of Nebraska's population, six of the 20 death-row
inmates _ 30 percent _ are members of these minority groups, as
were two of the three inmates executed in Nebraska since the state
reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This was the argument that the state Supreme Court said it would
consider when it halted Reeves' execution two days before he was to
die.
</P>
<P>
   If Reeves is successful in his appeal, it would be the first
time that a death sentence was overturned based on an argument of
racial discrimination, and death penalty experts are closely
watching to see how the Nebraska case turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for death-row defendants have long sought to make the
case that the system disproportionately imposes death sentences on
members of minorities or on defendants whose victims were white.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,549 inmates on death row in the United States, 1,499,
or 42 percent, are black, according to the Death Penalty
Information Center, a research group. Blacks make up 13 percent of
the population. Hispanic inmates and those of other minorities make
up 391 of the people on death row. There are 1,659 whites awaiting
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, most experts thought the door was closed on
racial-disparity arguments when the U.S. Supreme Court found, in
the case of a Georgia black man, that it was not enough to show a
statistical pattern of racial disparity on death row without proof
that a jury or judge intentionally discriminated against a
particular defendant, something that is extremely difficult to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, states have begun to examine racial
discrimination arguments. In cases in New Jersey, North Carolina
and Colorado, state courts have suggested that they may be swayed
solely by a statistical pattern of discrimination, even though they
said they had not found a convincing pattern in the cases before
them, said Jennifer Friesen, a professor at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the death penalty law, passed in 1995, explicitly
allows for defendants to appeal by claiming that members of their
racial group are disproportionately sentenced to death. And last
year, Kentucky passed a law that allows defendants in capital cases
to make such claims even before they are put on trial, allowing
them to seek a guarantee that they would not get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nebraska case, Reeves' lawyer, Paula Hutchinson, says she
believes that the discriminatory argument has a chance because the
language in Nebraska's equal protection clause, she says, suggests
that as long as there has been a discriminatory effect, no proof of
intentional discrimination is required.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say they would be stunned if the death sentence is
commuted on grounds of discrimination. Others say the outcome is
impossible to predict. Some point out that it is significant that
the argument is being considered at all by the Nebraska court,
which is viewed as fairly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last minute this new law opens up some possible relief
and we're just watching to see if that happens,'' said Richard
Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
``Clearly, it's going to affect more than the Reeves case. Most
cases could be affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 42, was convicted of using a kitchen knife to stab to
death Janet Mesner, 30, and Victoria Lamm, 28, in the early morning
of March 29, 1980. Ms. Mesner was living in the Quaker meetinghouse
and working as its caretaker, and her friend Ms. Lamm, who was 15
weeks' pregnant, had returned for a visit after moving to Oregon.
Ms. Lamm's 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Audrey, was also in the house,
but does not remember anything about that night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mesner lived long enough to call police and identify Reeves
as the killer. Reeves, a construction worker on temporary jobs who
was known to be a drinker but not a violent man, later confessed to
the killings, but said he remembered little about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Reeves say his actions were a result of heavy beer
drinking combined with the use of peyote, a cactus that causes
hallucinations. To counter that argument, prosecutors said that if
that Reeves had been so drugged he did not know right from wrong,
he would have been too impaired to commit the murders.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 3, Reeves was removed from a troubled family on
the Omaha Indian Reservation and adopted by Donald and Barbara
Reeves, who lived on a farm in Central City. The Reeveses are
distant cousins of the Mesners and attend the same meetinghouse in
Central City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched him grow up,'' said Mildred Mesner, Janet Mesner's
mother. ``I taught him in Sunday school class. He was close with
one of our sons. I know he didn't have any hatred toward Janet.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Reeves' parents have generally stayed in the background
in the case, unwilling to ask for support even though they are
adamantly opposed to the death penalty and Donald Reeves has worked
for national Quaker organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Randolph Reeves' lawyers have appealed on various
grounds, sending the case before the Nebraska Supreme Court four
times and the U.S. Supreme Court twice.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have complained that Nebraska law gave jurors a
choice only of convicting Reeves or acquitting him of first-degree
murder, without making allowance for a lesser crime, something the
jury foreman now says he would have supported. The lawyers have
argued that Reeves' intoxication had not been taken into account at
the trial or in sentencing, and they have cited what they say were
procedural errors in the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have supported the way the original trial was
conducted and declined to order a new sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hutchinson's latest appeal asserts that in addition to
racial discrimination, her client's equal protection rights were
violated in two other ways. One occurred in 1991 after errors were
found in Reeves' original sentence, she says, when a Nebraska
Supreme Court resentenced him to death without sending his case
back to the trial court for another hearing. She also asserts that
electrocution, Nebraska's only means of execution, is a cruel and
unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Janet Mesner's parents have lobbied against the
execution of Reeves, their efforts eventually getting the support
of national Quaker organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nebraska, we're very much a minority,'' Mrs. Mesner said.
``Seventy-five to 80 percent of the people here believe in the
death penalty and so it's been very lonely for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamm's husband, Gus, and her daughter, Audrey, now 21,
joined the protest only recently. The two, like Ms. Lamm, are not
Quakers but oppose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm, a mental health therapist in Portland, Ore., said he had
paid no attention to the case since the conviction. He said that
although he knew Reeves had been sentenced to death, he expected
him to end up serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Lamm said, he received a telephone call from a
Mesner relative, who told him about the impending execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `No, no, no,''' Lamm recalled. In a few short weeks,
the Lamms have become strident advocates for Reeves, shouting at
Gov. Mike Johanns after a meeting of the state Pardons Board and
deluging his office with flowers in a gesture of protest. Audrey
Lamm has decided to leave Oregon and move to Nebraska, where she
plans to work for several months for Reeves' lawyer, Ms.
Hutchinson. The Lamms even visited Reeves in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm said he saw the incident as though ``three lives had been
lost that night,'' the lives of the two women and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Audrey, said, ``I now feel I can approach Randy
not as the daughter of his victim but as someone with whom I can
find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Lamms seem to feel much less enmity toward Ms.
Lamm's killer than they do toward her father, brother and sister,
who support the death penalty for Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want that man out of sight,'' said Alan Zessin, Ms.
Lamm's father, who lives in Republican City. ``It's been 18 years
that my family has had to suffer from Randolph Reeves. I'd been
looking forward to Thursday, Jan. 14, 10 a.m., for a while. I
thought he was finally going to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Johanns and Attorney General Don Stenberg, two of the three
members of the Pardons Board, are also disappointed with the stay
of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Robinson, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said
Stenberg ``felt there was no new evidence in this case that would
contradict any of the rulings by previous courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Johanns, who was elected in
November, said the governor believed ``that to keep putting it off
and putting it off is not what the will of the public is and he's
frustrated by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the governor, a Republican, had not supported the
equal protection clause on the ballot in November, fearing that it
might ``open the door to frivolous legal wrestling that would clog
the court system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hutchinson, the lawyer, is simply grateful for any extra
chance the case can get. She said she had not even been aware that
the equal protection clause was on the ballot until she walked into
the voting booth. Then, she said, she exclaimed loud enough to be
heard by her husband in another booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what I was looking for,'' Ms. Hutchinson said.

EUROPE WON'T BE PRESENTING UNITED FRONT AT MEETING OF G-7 FINANCE
MINISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ As finance ministers from the Group of 7
industrialized countries prepare to meet in Bonn on Saturday,
Europe is far less united than its new single currency, the euro,
would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is bracing for disagreements with Germany and
France, which are campaigning for a ``new architecture'' to control
exchange rates and reduce turbulence in world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But European countries disagree among themselves about those
issues, and the new European Central Bank is dead set against the
French and German proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is not even close to having a united front, and if they
were, they wouldn't get anywhere,'' said Klaus Friedrich, chief
economist at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new left-leaning minister of finance, Oskar
Lafontaine, is expected to push hard on Saturday for new proposals
to regulate exchange rates among the United States, Japan and the
11 countries using the new single currency.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France expressed similar ideas in
Washington on Thursday, when he called for a new ``highway code''
to govern capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas are anathema to the U.S. treasury secretary, Robert
E. Rubin, who has repeatedly dismissed attempts to manage exchange
rates as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany and France also face heavy opposition to those ideas
at home. On top of that, European financial influence remains
limited as economic growth in Europe has slowed while American
growth has defied predictions and surged once again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new euro has weakened steadily against the dollar.
Since its start on Jan. 1, the euro has slipped nearly 4 percent
against the dollar, from $1.17 to $1.124. The extent of the slide
has surprised many experts and officials in the European Central
Bank, but it reflects the economic weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Just Friday, Germany's central bank estimated that the German
economy contracted by four-tenths of a percent in the last quarter
of 1998 from the prior quarter, largely because renewed financial
turmoil in Asia and Latin America have severely hurt German
exports. But for all of 1998 the economy grew by 2.6 percent, up
from 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   France reported Friday that industrial production fell 1.6
percent in December, more than expected and the largest drop since
November 1997, when output fell 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about a further slowdown have complicated the arguments
about trying to stabilize exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the European Central Bank adamantly argue that
trying to coordinate exchange rates will play havoc with normal
economic policy. They say such attempts would inherently clash with
the bank's primary responsibility to preserve price stability. In
addition, they warn, it could force the bank into perverse
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stabilized exchange rates, we would end up with interest
rate swings, and those are even more damaging than exchange rate
swings for investment activities and the credibility of monetary
policy,'' said Sirrka Hamalainen, the Finnish member of the board
of the European Central Bank, in a German newspaper interview
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the European economy slows more than it has already, she
said, the Central Bank might have to raise interest rates to
support the euro's value _ a move that would slow the economy even
more.
</P>
<P>
   European finance ministers are also divided over basic monetary
policy. Lafontaine has loudly pressed the Central Bank to lower
interest rates, attending a board meeting on Thursday to argue that
the European economy needs the lift that cheaper money would
provide.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts failed to budge the bank, and appear to have irked
some of Europe's other finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have that debate externally is useless _ it causes the ECB
to stick to its position and close itself off,'' said Jean-Jacques
Viseur, the finance minister of Belgium, in an interview with the
Belgian newspaper De Morgan. Gerritt Zalm, the finance minister of
the Netherlands, also said that Lafontaine should soften his
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France, argued
Friday that the European economy does not need to be rescued. ``We
have a situation that appears to be under control,'' he said. ``We
are not worried about the risk of inflation, and we're not worried
about the risk of deflation either.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say that the policy divisions mirror economic
disparities within Europe. The German and Italian economies have
both slowed sharply in the last few months, and most economists
predict that unemployment will remain above 10 percent in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   But France appears to be growing a bit more rapidly, and smaller
countries are doing even better. The Netherlands, Finland, Spain,
Portugal and Ireland are all growing much more robustly, despite
the problems roiling Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is a prime example of how divergences in
the real economy are making it difficult to speak with a single
economic voice,'' said Thomas Mayer, senior economist at Goldman,
Sachs in Frankfurt. ``Fifty percent of Euro-land's gross domestic
product is in trouble. Obviously, Lafontaine is the voice for this
trouble. His comments reflect the anxiety that many Germans have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Lafontaine's campaign to tame the world's markets also
springs from deep convictions. A garrulous and pugnacious
politician, Lafontaine has argued for years that Germany's high
unemployment stems in large part from the high value of the German
mark and tight-fisted, orthodox monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   That has placed him at odds with most economists and virtually
all of Europe's central bankers, who say that European unemployment
stems largely from rigid regulations and the high cost of wages and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Lafontaine has seemed more interested in stoking a
debate against economic orthodoxy than in actually winning
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   He almost certainly knew he had no chance of persuading the
European Central Bank to lower interest rates by attending the
bank's board meeting on Thursday. Conventional wisdom holds that
overt attempts to put pressure on central bankers simply push them
in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he went ahead anyway, and even ratcheted up the debate by
dismissing the Central Bank's criticism that German budget policies
were too lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lafontaine is a politician with convictions, and he believes
that the market is a wild animal, a beast that you have to
control,'' remarked Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank Julius Baer
in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   In campaigning for a new system to retrain the movement of the
world's major currencies within ``target zones'' or practicing
other forms of ``coordination,'' the German finance minister does
have support from France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, both Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, flatly reject such ideas. Rubin
contended this week that the only real way to insure stability was
for all countries to have sound fundamental economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministers, meanwhile, will spend much of Saturday
discussing proposals by Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German
Bundesbank, to strengthen supervision of global financial markets.

 &HT;    Can't beat the tap
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Remy del Rosario wants a sip of refreshing water,
she gets it the old-fashioned way _ at the sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink eight to 10 glasses a day and I wouldn't do that if it
wasn't safe,'' says del Rosario, Atlanta's Commissioner of Water.
``The tap water we produce is the best. Tap water is tested every
day (for contaminants), sometimes every hour. It's free of bacteria
and it's disinfected. Why would I waste my money buying bottled
water?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, as the city czar who oversees the daily disbursement of 125
million gallons of water, she may be biased. But del Rosario sees
no reason for Americans to be spending $4 billion annually on
packaged water.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Americans buy bottled water because they think it
contains fewer impurities than tap water, that may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Tap water is closely monitored by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the city water department. The site and source of
bottled water, on the other hand, could go three years between
inspections by its regulatory agency, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, deadly bacteria still sneaks into tap water. In
1993, 69 people died from cryptosporidium in Milwaukee's water.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorine and fluoride are the two substances most often cited by
health experts as differences between tap and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal water systems use chlorine to stop the growth of
bacteria. Bottled water contains no chlorine, unless its source is
not a mountain spring or a deep well. One study found that the
source of 25 percent of bottled water actually came from the same
place as tap water: municipal water systems. Many bottlers then
filter and purify the city water, as Coca-Cola plans do to with its
new product, Dasani.
</P>
<P>
   While health-conscious trendy types clutch bottled water like a
baby clings to a pacifier, their avoidance of tap water may come
back to bite them _ in their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water contains no fluoride, a fact that's beginning to
worry dentists because consumption doubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   When fluoride was added to the country's water supply decades
ago, the rate of cavities decreased by 25 percent, said Dr. Susan
Muller, an oral pathologist at Emory University School of Medicine.
``What's being hypothesized is that with the increased use of
bottled water it could potentially increase the cavity rate
again,'' said Muller.
</P>
<P>
   Some water companies have added fluoride to their products for
children. But fluoride is not just for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps adults as well, assuming they have all their natural
teeth,'' said Dr. Scott Presson of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Coca-Cola's new product will not contain fluoride,
officials said.

 &HT;    Coke dives into bottled water market with Dasani
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Coca-Cola Company would like you to know that
Dasani is not a knock-off of an Italian fashion line or a spicy
Indian dish. It's water.
</P>
<P>
   The company confirmed Friday that it is entering the U.S.
bottled water market, a $4.3 billion segment that grew faster last
year than the much larger market for carbonated soft drinks. Coke's
noncarbonated water will be called Dasani _ a word made up to fit
the product. The drink will be on shelves by midyear in the United
States and Canada. The company declined to discuss specifics of
which markets it would roll out in first or what sales goals it has
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the distribution capability of Coca-Cola and
bottlers will help to quickly make the product available across the
country,'' company spokeswoman Polly Howes said.
</P>
<P>
   The water will come from municipal water systems. But the
company said it will further clean the water and add minerals. The
final product won't have fluoride. Dasani will be packaged in light
blue bottles in 20-ounce, 1-liter and 1.5-liter sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said it test-marketed the name Dasani to see how it would
go over with consumers. ``It conveyed a lot of the attributes we
want to build around the brand as far as its pureness, its
crispness,'' Coke's Howes said. ``It's something we can build the
meaning in connection with the product itself.''
</P>
<P>
   She quoted Coke Chairman and CEO M. Douglas Ivester as jokingly
saying the product was named after the ``Roman god of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right name for a consumer product is always
important. When it comes to bottled water, it's particularly
crucial, says Ira Bachrach, president of NameLab Inc., a San
Francisco, Calif.-based company that has come up with names such as
Acura, Geo, The Olive Garden and Slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All water is basically the same. It's the packaging. It's an
idea,'' Bachrach said. ``The name is even more important than it is
for colas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach praised the name, adding that his company has named
three competing brands of water on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Naming professionals size up names with the discrimination that
connoisseurs use to assess vintage wines.
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach finds in Dasani ``smooth rolling sounds which suggest
it seems to mean pleasant but not aggressive flavor.'' It is also
``suggestively Italian.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming consultant James Dettore, president of the Miami-based
Brand Institute, said Dasani ``sounds like it could be a
destination, an exotic destination. I would see it as a very
emotional type of personality to it. Very warm. Very approachable.
Very consumer friendly. At the same time it is exotic enough with
the vowel ending that it could bring a premium association with the
name which could allow a superior position and type of higher
pricing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 'D' is a harder sounding prefix. It could allow itself to
be understood as more refreshing,'' he said. ``The actual 'sani'
grounds itself with a mystical type of suffix that could take your
imagination into almost any part of the world as far as its origin
is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   That could help if Coke ever wants to take the Dasani name
international, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke says it doesn't plan to. Howes said that outside the United
States and Canada, the company will stick to its existing BonAqua
bottled water brand. She said the company could not get the
trademark for BonAqua in the United States or Canada.

 &HT;    Online newspapers should stress utility, executive says
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Memo to online newspapers: News isn't nearly as
important as you think it is.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Web, you have to be ready to present and
parse that information in different ways for a different medium.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message from keynote speaker Peter Winter,
president of Cox Interactive Media, to the 1,300-plus attendees at
the Editor and Publisher Interactive Newspapers '99 conference at
Atlanta's Hyatt Regency hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most newspapers are building online extensions of
themselves,'' Winter told the group. ``They are two-dimensional and
textual. They're not meeting the product challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than remodeled newspaper content for the Web, Winter and
Cox Interactive Media favor creating self-sustaining Internet
brands in each of the markets where Cox Enterprises has a presence.
(Cox Interactive is a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.).
</P>
<P>
   Access Atlanta (http://www.accessatlanta.com) is an example of
Winter's philosophy at work. The site includes news, but packaged
with search, chat, community and commerce areas unique to the
Internet and helps users find what they are looking for quickly,
whether its news, sports scores or movie times, phone numbers or
even horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in informing (users),'' he told the
obviously surprised audience, composed of experts in informing
people. ``I want to save the user time. It's about utility. It's
about helping busy people manage their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Winter pointed to recent Media Metrix data
illustrating how local newspaper sites fared in their own markets.
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta was 10th in the Atlanta market compared with all
Web sites. Newspaper sites in other cities, with the exception of
The Washington Post, ranked lower in their respective markets.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's theme of utility paired with Thursday's conference
themes of content and community seem to be working for many online
papers. Analysts agree newspapers must adapt to the new medium to
stay competitive with everyone from Yahoo! to MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about news. There must be some utility,'' says
Jupiter Communications analyst Patrick Keane. ``I do think
newspapers have to transfer a lot of their other businesses online,
like classifieds. But I do believe brand recognition in local
markets will drive users to newspaper sites not just for local, but
national and international news from a paper and reporters they
know.''

BRUINS NEED A QUICK FIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Ristuccia Center in suburban Wilmington was
deserted Friday morning at the time the Bruins were scheduled to
practice. A late-arriving flight from Ottawa, along with the fact
that the team doesn't play again until Sunday in Chicago, accounted
for the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Much has gone wrong for the Bruins of late. Some of it is easy
to explain, some hard to fathom. Whatever is ailing them, they need
to find a solution and soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are 27 games left in the regular season, one third of the
schedule. That may sound like a lot of time, but the Bruins are
losing ground every day. In its last 13 games, Boston has stumbled
to a 2-9-2 record, including losses in its last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Against Ottawa Thursday night, the defense wasn't bad but the
offense was nonexistent. The result: a 2-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   A check of the standings Friday morning showed the Bruins in
last place in the Northeast Division. Their 53 points were good for
only 10th place in the Eastern Conference. In other words, if the
playoffs were to begin today, the Bruins would be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch last season, the Bruins were 16-9-2 in their
final 27 games and finished fifth in the conference. This season,
however, with the East in such a dogfight, that may not be enough
for the Bruins to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns has never missed the postseason in his 10-year
coaching career and said he has no intention of being shut out this
time. But in order for him to keep his record unblemished, the
coach will have to get his team to play a complete game, something
it hasn't done all season.
</P>
<P>
   Contract squabbles disrupted the first part of the season.
Injuries have derailed a number of players' seasons. Inconsistency,
especially on the top scoring line, has been a killer, especially
when you consider that the Bruins have not had a regular second
line all season. Joe Thornton has been the second-line center for
much of the season, though sometimes he's been pushed to the wing;
but for the most part, the wing positions on the second line have
been a revolving door of legitimate NHLers and auditioning hopefuls
from the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's loss to the Senators was particularly dismal in
that the Bruins looked like they just didn't have it from start to
finish.
</P>
<P>
   There's no fire, no chemistry, no results. Unlike last year's
squad, which seemed determined and had a feisty attitude, this
year's looks tentative, lacking in confidence, and out of sync. The
problem has nothing to do with effort _ the players are trying. But
if last year's team was a well-oiled machine firing on all
cylinders, this year's is a backfiring model that could use a
tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   When the goaltending or defense is solid, the offense produces
no goals. When the offense is clicking, there is no defense. As
Burns and his staff search for answers, the Capitals continue to
gain ground, as they did Thursday in a 2-2 tie with Carolina. The
Florida Panthers, too, picked up a point on Boston in a scoreless
tie with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger blow was the Canadiens' big victory over the
East's best club, Philadelphia, which gave Montreal 54 points,
pushing the Habs a point ahead of the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is doing what he can with the roster he has, often having
to put players in roles in which they don't belong. In Ottawa, he
dropped right wing Dmitri Khristich, who is struggling badly, off
the top line and installed Anson Carter with Jason Allison and
Sergei Samsonov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try something,'' said Burns. ``We still had no
goals to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two thirds of the season is gone. The stretch run is here.
Goalie Byron Dafoe says he and his mates have to hurry up and get
on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   But can they? Burns said he's heard all the right things from
his players, that it's time to take charge, it's time to make a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on my knees for a while now saying, `C'mon, let's
go,' '' the coach said. ``We need everybody.''

full year. December's deficit shrank to $13.8 billion from $15.3
billion in November. Exports declined 0.6 percent, reflecting
weaker foreign demand for industrial supplies and auto parts.
Imports fell 2.1 percent, partly because of lower oil prices. In

   New Protection Likely For Two Tax Credits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class families seeking a $500 tax credit this year for
each child under 17 may soon rest easier that they won't lose part
of that benefit by falling under the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a similar problem was averted when Congress adopted a
bill sponsored by Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass., to exempt from the
AMT both the child credit and the new education tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   Neal's law was only for 1998. But there is agreement between
President Clinton and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of
the House Ways and Means committee, that another fix is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The AMT, passed 30 years ago to make sure that the wealthy did
not escape all federal income taxes, has its own rates and tougher
rules. It has been a growing burden on the middle class because
Congress has not amended the law to account for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, people making as little as $27,404 can be subject to
the AMT, if their tax credits and personal exemptions are high
enough. And, without a fix for the child credit, the tax could also
affect a single parent with two children and income of $50,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposed budget includes a two-year
extension of the 1998 moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Archer wants to eliminate the AMT, which has failed in its goal
of zero tolerance for tax avoidance by people making more than
$200,000 a year. About 2,500 families a year make more than
$200,000 but pay no federal income taxes, up from 155 families when
the law was passed.

   Shopping, and Giving, on Line &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From E-commerce now comes E-charity: In a campaign to turn the
explosion of on-line retailing to the benefit of nonprofit
organizations, new Web sites are allowing shoppers to designate
some of their on-line spending for charitable groups.
</P>
<P>
   For the shoppers, no extra money is involved: They simply visit
sites like &QC; Socialgoods.com and Shop2give.com and designate
charities they want to support. The sites have shopping links to
retailers that have agreed to send the charities part of the
shopper's payment.
</P>
<P>
   Socialgoods.com has charitable partners including CARE and Oxfam
America, an international relief agency, and shopping links to
companies like Etoys and Amazon.com. Shop2give.com lets shoppers
designate any of the nation's charitable nonprofits, with shopping
links including J. Crew and Barnes &AMP; Noble. Charities typically
receive about 5 percent of the amounts spent.
</P>
<P>
   A new entry, Greatergood.com, takes a different tack, creating
shopping links at the sites of individual charities. Users then
click from the charities to the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   For charities, the potential is enormous: On-line retailing is
expected to grow to $18.1 billion this year, up from $7.8 billion
in 1998, according to Forrester Research, and to $108 billion by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hallett, an Internet consultant whose E-commerce company,
NMP/Appnet, develops Web sites for charities, says charities will
ultimately attract more users through their own sites, with links
to retailers, than through more general sites that offer access to
several charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who become serious supporters of any cause or
charity have a passion and a concern for what that organization is
dealing with,'' he said. &QL;

BEING WITH RED SOX GOOD THERAPY FOR COLEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He was, in many ways, as reluctant to see a
psychiatrist as the Matt Damon character was to see Robin Williams
in the film ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Michael Coleman's idea. It had been sprung upon him,
he said, after a July game in Pawtucket, when PawSox manager Ken
Macha told him that Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette wanted him
to undergo counseling. If he didn't, Macha said, the manager had
been instructed to bench him.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who had been in the big leagues at the end of the 1997
season and was a candidate for an outfield job last spring, was in
need of an ``attitude adjustment,'' in the words of Duquette. It
appeared that he hadn't gotten over not sticking with the major
league club, especially when his roommate, Donnie Sadler, was on
the Opening Day roster.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette felt he wasn't giving the PawSox the effort or
performance the organization expected _ he appeared to be coupling
a big leaguer's arrogance with a bush-league indifference. ``Prime
Time'' nickname, nowhere game.
</P>
<P>
   There was the game in Ottawa in which he hit a home run and took
his time circling the bases. When he slowed to a walk between third
and home, he nearly touched off a brawl. And there were too many
times when he jogged to first, let a ball drop in front of him in
the outfield, or threw to the wrong base.
</P>
<P>
   It had to stop. Macha had spent futile hour upon hour talking to
Coleman, trying to explain what was at stake, and finally Duquette
decided some sessions with a psychiatrist were in order.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a week, Coleman chose to sit on a bench
instead of a couch. ``I just didn't know how to react to it,'' he
said. ``Nobody's fault, but it just caught me off guard. It was
like a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like there was something wrong with me, but that's just
how I am. Being cocky, being the way I am, that's just the football
mentality I have. It was like they wanted me to change, for them,
for Boston, for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I felt like I couldn't let the season go to waste, I
had to suck it up and do it. It was like I didn't have any rights,
but I felt like you're the man, you're signing the checks, I'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman went to see a Providence-based psychiatrist to whom he'd
been referred by the club. In their first meeting, Coleman said,
neither man spoke more than a few words, much like the initial
Damon-Williams encounters. But gradually, said Coleman, he opened
up. Some trust formed, and the words began to flow. He brought with
him notecards filled with things he'd jotted down at the ballpark.
With the help of the psychiatrist, he began grading himself on his
performance, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Where there had been hurt and confusion, understanding crept in.
Coleman still wishes the club had not tied counseling to an
ultimatum, but he acknowledges that what had once seemed an insult
eventually became something to which he looked forward. Coleman and
his psychiatrist talked by phone at least once every couple of
weeks, and last month, when Coleman was sent by the Sox to the
major league rookie development seminars, he talked openly of his
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys would have been ashamed to talk about it,'' he
said. ``Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   But whereas Coleman was once considered the Red Sox center
fielder of the future, he barely draws a mention these days. Scouts
from other teams would pass through Boston last summer raving about
his natural ability but saying their clubs wouldn't touch him.
Coleman remains on the Red Sox roster, but when the open right
field job is discussed, Duquette refers to rookie Trot Nixon as the
heir apparent, not Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Coleman said Friday. ``Last year, I heard the
same words about me. I came into last spring thinking this is my
job to lose, and it really wasn't. I really wasn't given a shot to
win a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just as good as the outfielders out there that I'm
in competition with. I just want a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman acknowledges doubts as to whether he'll get a fair
shake. He knows he alienated Duquette with his initial rebuff of
counseling, and he suspects he rubbed Jimy Williams the wrong way
last spring, when he went into the manager's office, demanded to
know his status, and told Williams that if he was going to be sent
down, make it now rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he liked that,'' Coleman said. ``If I was going
to go down, I wanted to go and get my head right, but it may not
have come across that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman hit just .253 with 14 home runs at Pawtucket last
season, a season in which he came back too soon from arthroscopic
knee surgery. But he rehabilitated all winter at a clinic near his
Nashville home, spent some time here working out, and was among
this week's early arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to come down here, keep my mouth shut, and play,''
he said. ``If I bust my butt and I have a bad spring, then it's on
me. All I ask for is a shot, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Affixed to his locker is a photo of an infant. ``That's my
daughter, Mykyla,'' he said. ``Six weeks old today. I think she
changed a little bit of everything. I've got to look after her, No.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette assigned his aide, Lee Thomas, to speak with Coleman
through this winter, urging him to prepare for spring, encouraging
him to step up his game.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is considering another option if things do not work out
in baseball. A high school All-America running back and defensive
back, Coleman turned down a scholarship to Alabama to accept a
modest $50,000 bonus from the Red Sox when drafted in 1994. ``If
he'd gone to Alabama,'' says his high school coach, James ``Bubba''
Spears, ``he would have won two or three SEC football
championships, gone to the College World Series, and probably would
have been drafted by both sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he was at a low point in Pawtucket, Coleman
called Spears on numerous occasions, asking him for help to get
back into football. He'd done the same thing his first year in pro
ball, when he was so homesick he was ready to quit. This winter in
Nashville, Coleman ran into Ronnie Cottrell, Alabama's assistant
head football coach and chief recruiter. Cottrell had tried to
recruit Coleman for Florida State out of high school, but was now
in Tuscaloosa. ``He said, `Are you ready now to play football?' ''
Coleman said. ``I was laughing, but he was dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears said that he has no doubt Alabama would want Coleman, who
has 4.4 speed in the 40, if he elected to play football again. ``If
baseball gave Michael the pink slip, I'd be calling coach
Cottrell,'' said Spears. ``And there'd be other schools that would
want him, too. As a cornerback, Michael will knock your breath
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who turns 24 in August, acknowledges that the idea has
some appeal. ``I have no doubt that I could play and start,'' he
said. ``Other guys have gone back, like Josh Booty. And who knows
down the road, maybe the NFL?''
</P>
<P>
   Booty, a former high school All-America quarterback, was the
Marlins' No. 1 pick in 1994, but he quit this winter so he could
play football at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman said he's not ready to give up on baseball. There's
also Mykyla to think about. ``I don't want to feel like I gave up
too easily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spears hopes he continues to play baseball. ``Michael's a good
kid,'' said the coach. ``He's been immature, but his first love is
baseball. He'd run through a wall to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to go to Alabama out of high school, but when
you're from the inner city, that baseball contract looks like a lot
of money. But he's put five years in it now, and he can play
baseball. I know he still wants it.''

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SELLING STOCKS TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a coin comes up four heads in a row, what will happen on
the fifth flip? Many people mistakenly say the odds strongly favor
its coming up tails, because, they figure, tails must be overdue.
In fact, of course, the coin doesn't remember its previous flips.
The odds of its coming up heads are always 50 percent, regardless
of what happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Investors often make a similar mistake when choosing which
stocks to sell: They base their decisions on whether they're
holding a stock at a profit or a loss. But just as with the coin,
that's irrelevant: Whether that stock is a good investment for the
future has nothing to do with the price at which they bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Amazon.com. Is it a good investment today at $101.875 a
share? Analysts have widely different opinions on the issue, and
few can agree even on which factors to consider. But one thing
certainly has nothing to do with Amazon's prospects: Whether a
particular investor bought it earlier this year, when it was
trading at more than $180 a share (and are thus holding it at a
loss), or instead bought it 12 months ago, when it was trading near
$10, (and thus have a handsome paper gain).
</P>
<P>
   Many investors don't see it that way. Extensive research has
shown that they are more likely to sell Amazon, or any stock, if
they are holding it at a profit than if they're holding it at a
loss. Known among researchers as the ``disposition effect,'' this
behavior can cost an average active investor thousands of dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive study of the disposition effect was conducted
recently by Terrance Odean, an assistant professor of finance at
the Graduate School of Management at the University of California
at Davis. Odean tracked the trading histories of 10,000 individual
investor accounts from January 1987 through 1993. He found that
instead of cutting their losses short and letting their profits run
_ two widely cited bits of portfolio advice _ the average investor
did just the opposite. Investors realized only 9.8 percent of the
losses they could have realized, compared with 14.8 percent of
their profits.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that behavior depends as much on psychology as it
does on finance. Investors, it seems, will go to some lengths not
to sell a stock at a loss. After all, as long as they avoid selling
a loser, they can rationalize that it will recover someday, thus
vindicating the original decision to buy. By contrast, once they
sell a stock, investors cannot avoid the fact that they lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance to realize losses, of course, has major tax
costs. Investors who choose to sell their winners, and not their
losers, must not only pay more taxes because of the capital gains,
but they also forgo the deductions they would receive for realizing
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Immunizing yourself from the disposition effect isn't easy
because no one behaves this way as a deliberate policy. The first
step is to understand that your psychological need to avoid losses
may compromise your objectivity. You may (italics)think(end
italics) there are good reasons to sell your winners and hang onto
your losers, but there's a good chance that you're kidding
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You often need objective guidance to help distinguish between
the cases in which you really should sell a winner and those in
which you want to sell just because you hate to realize a loss. One
good source of objective guidance is the Value Line Investment
Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, it divides 1,700 of the country's most widely held
stocks into five categories according to their prospects over the
next 12 months, based on quantitative factors _ primarily earnings
and price momentum.
</P>
<P>
   This service has an excellent record: it's in first place among
all newsletters tracked by Hulbert Financial Digest since mid-1980,
producing an 18.2 percent annualized return, versus 16.8 percent
for the Wilshire 5000 through 1998. Because it is completely
objective, its advice on a stock cannot be swayed by the
disposition effect.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has become fashionable for investors to think they
no longer need brokers to help them with their investments. A
computer, a modem and an on-line account, so the thinking goes, are
all you need to make a fortune in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a big part of an honest broker's job is keeping
his or her customers away from investment mistakes, a task that not
even the smartest machine can do.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, today's electronic access to stocks requires of
on-line investors a heightened responsibility for their own
actions. Few investors may yet realize just what this
responsibility involves.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may not know, for example, that if their on-line
trading firm is a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers and problems crop up in their accounts, they may be left
holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 brokerage firms offer on-line trading services. Those
that are members of the New York Stock Exchange abide by its rules;
firms that belong to the NASD follow its regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known but crucial difference between the two sets of
rules leaves investors who use NASD brokers more vulnerable. The
difference involves ``suitability,'' a pillar of the securities
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange essentially requires its members to
make sure that an investment is suited to a client's needs and
circumstances before making the sale, even if the transaction was
the investor's idea, not the broker's.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if a customer trading through an NASD firm buys a
stock that has not been recommended by the broker, the firm is
under no obligation to evaluate whether the investment is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Although this difference has existed for years, the recent
popularity of on-line trading makes it a deeper concern. A customer
of an NASD member firm who trades his way into huge losses from an
inappropriately risky investment cannot sue the firm to recover on
suitability grounds unless the firm recommended the investment.
(Clouding the issue is the fact that many on-line firms offer
research reports that make recommendations.)
</P>
<P>
   The NASD rule creates a major gap in investor protection, said
Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at Tolins &AMP;
Lowenfels, a law firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the nation's on-line trading is done at NASD firms. Of
the top 15 on-line brokerage firms in the United States, according
to Gomez Advisors Inc., eight are members of the NASD. These
include the giants Ameritrade, E(star)Trade, Datek and Suretrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suitability is one of the main avenues of protection under
federal securities laws for investors,'' Lowenfels said. Indeed,
the issue of suitability looms large among investors unhappy with
their brokers' performances.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NASD, an average of 29 percent of arbitration
cases filed with it each year since 1995 involved investments
alleged to have been unsuitable for the customer who bought them.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD says it is re-examining its rule, given the recent
surge in on-line trading. ``The technology offered by these firms
is very enticing,'' Lowenfels said. ``With that enticement,
shouldn't their responsibilities rise to what the New York Stock
Exchange requires?''

SIGHTING HIGHFLIERS IN AIRLINE STOCKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please forgive owners of airline stocks for looking more than a
little perplexed these days.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy economy and very low fuel prices provided solid
fundamental underpinning for the stocks last year. Trouble was,
almost all of them tanked.
</P>
<P>
   AMR, the parent of American Airlines, saw its stock fall more
than 7 percent. Continental Airlines shares were off more than 30
percent, and Northwest Airlines was down 46.6 percent. Delta Air
Lines declined 12.6 percent. And so on. The one bright spot was
Alaska Air Group, which rose 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shift to 1999. Many of the positive economic factors are still
in place. But now there are also a significant number of negatives.
</P>
<P>
   So are airline stocks bargains, or just dogs? Kevin Murphy, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, spent some time last week
discussing the pros and cons. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In your view, what are the positives for airline
stocks?(end italics)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Over all, the domestic economy is still strong. Business
travel budgets, which softened in the fourth quarter, particularly
on Wall Street, are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Also, through the first half of 1999 the airlines will have
lower fuel costs than they did in the first six months of last
year. And the cut in travel agents' commissions will also help
their cost structure.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about three weeks ago the industry raised domestic
fares by 2 percent to 4 percent. That is the first time they have
done that in 18 months, and you can't do that unless demand is
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)That still leaves the international component, which
has been suffering. How important are international flights to
United States carriers?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For the big players _ AMR, United and Delta _ international
represents about 35 percent of revenues and about 40 percent of
profits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So is it safe to assume that carriers that do more
domestic business will do better than those with heavy
international traffic?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Southwest Airlines should have no trouble posting record
earnings this year. Business couldn't be better for them.
</P>
<P>
   We expect per share earnings at Alaska Air to increase about 8
percent, to $5.60. At US Airways, we are forecasting a per-share
earnings gain of nearly 10 percent over 1998. But Continental,
which has international exposure, will see earnings drop a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The others are going to get hit.
</P>
<P>
   We think AMR's earnings per share will fall by nearly 30
percent. That decline is due to weak Asian and trans-Atlantic
business, but most especially because of this labor difficulty,
which will cost $150 million on a pretax basis.
</P>
<P>
   United suggests it could have flat to up earnings for the year.
We respectfully disagree, due to softness in international travel.
We think its per-share earnings will be down about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta will also see earnings drop, but not so much. They are
seeing some weakness in Europe, but that is offset by domestic
strength. And with the stock selling at 7.5 times earnings, it is
pretty cheap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In the last few months we have had a strike at
Northwest Airlines and a job action at American. Is it likely we
will see more problems with labor?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Returns on capital for this industry are still substandard,
and the only way to boost return on assets is through
consolidation. But this boiling cauldron of labor, management and
shareholders is going to go on for a couple of years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You talk about the need for consolidation, but even
as that happens companies like Southwest are expanding into the New
York area and an entirely new airline is being formed by David
Neeleman to fly out of Kennedy International Airport.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. People Express proved that there is a raison d'etre for a
low-cost, low-fare carrier. They went out of business because they
were poorly managed, not because there was a lack of demand. I
think Southwest will get plenty of business in New York and that
David Neeleman's new airline, which has George Soros as an
investor, will do well. The surprise has been that for whatever
reason New York has not seen this sort of service for the last 12
years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Airline stocks have been battered. Are there some
that you like?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We like Southwest Airlines a lot, and have a 12-month target
price on it of $35. It is the only airline we look at as comparable
to an S&AMP;P 500 stock.
</P>
<P>
   Our second pick is AMR. Labor problems may limit the upside, but
its valuation is exceedingly compelling. At the moment, the airline
division itself, excluding its reservation system, is selling at
just 5.2 times projected earnings. We have a target price on the
stock of $75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is principally a domestic carrier, Alaska Air will
outperform the market. We have a $55 price target. And at 5.3 times
our estimate for 1999 earnings, Continental is also a good value.

   NATIONALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Kurds, Bosnians, Scots, former
Soviet republics, central African tribes, Marshall Islanders and
others: there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism is militantly bucking the trend toward
globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a new vengeance
from a half-century of enforced quiescence. Or is it? Many of the
new nationalistic movements are fighting not each other but simply
trying to better position themselves in the new global marketplace.

   POLICE-BRUTALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Can the `zero tolerance'
anti-crime policies that have come into vogue over the last decade
be implemented without the trampling of innocent people's rights?
Embedded in the public angst over police brutality, there is a dark
underbelly to the superficially unassailable goal of stamping out
crime: Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of
brutality from their police officers, but also, in ways subtle and
unsubtle, to encourage it. By Frank Bruni. (`a' category)

</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Angered and puzzled by
President Clinton's acquittal, some conservatives have come to an
extraordinary realization, which may carry grim implications for
the their movement: They blame not themselves for mishandling the
whole episode, but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
But blaming the prevailing public can be risky, particularly in an
age when politicians find that very public to be increasingly
aloof. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-JOBS-REVIEW (Bad River Reservation, Wis.) _ Many Indians
are returning to their ancestral homes, not just for funerals and
weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has spawned a

the profits are often invested in locally, enlivening formerly
moribund tribal economies. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-CLEMENS-REVIEW (New York) _ Roger Clemens, the best
starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15 seasons and one of
the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance, possibly his last, for
the World Series ring that will validate his career. The Yanks get
the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or close to it. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATORS-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Albany, N.Y.) _ State legislatures
have always had their farmers, teachers, engineers and
entrepreneurs, but from the early days of the Republic, no group
has been as over-represented as lawyers. But for the last three
decades, even as the profession has grown in numbers, its grip on
state capitols has steadily slipped, a trend that continued in the
turnover brought by the 1998 elections. By Richard Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL-POLICE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the growing trend
in Congress to federalize crimes that are traditionally handled by
state and local authorities. Federal law enforcement agents are
being asked to track down car-jackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers
and low-level drug dealers. Some legal experts warn of the
emergence of a national police force. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   TABLOIDS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The National Enquirer and the

   TOY-FAIR-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the 96th American
International Toy Fair, where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle
their wares to 20,000 buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't
hit stores yet. Some are still prototypes and failed in
demonstrations; others succeeded in demonstrations and will still
fail in stores. A look at some of the toys exhibited. By Jenny Lyn
Bader.

   IRAQ-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon does not like to say
it, but almost-daily skirmishes between U.S. pilots and Iraqi
forces have quickly turned into a low-level war of attrition that
appears to have no end in sight. Not since the Persian Gulf war in
1991 _ and, before that, Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such
routine combat in such a sustained way over such a prolonged
period. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the political
consequences of the recent economic crisis in East Asia and Brazil;
they are as varied as the countries themselves. Even as the world
economy seems to be stabilizing after 20 months of chaos, the
political tensions engendered by those events are only worsening.
From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who once talked,
Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a globally
integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of the

 &HT;    Realtors face influence of technology
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology and Internet-based listings are the latest
major influence on the residential real estate industry this
century.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Sharon Millett, president of the National
Association of Realtors, will give an audience today at the NAR's
midwinter meeting in Atlanta. About 3,000 people are expected at
meeting, which runs through Monday at the downtown Hilton Hotel and
Towers.
</P>
<P>
   The other forces, both of which occurred during the first half
of the century, were the licensing of real estate agents and the
founding of multiple listing services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, about five years ago, we came to grips with the fact
that technology is real and challenging, and we had the ability to
move (to embrace it),'' Millet, a broker from Poland Springs,
Maine, said during an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Realtor.com, the NAR's Internet site established in 1996, had
430 million hits in January as 9 million consumers logged on
looking for house listings, she said. With 1.3 million homes
online, Realtor.com offers a look at 95 percent of the properties
listed in the country, Millett added.
</P>
<P>
   Although she acknowledged that the Internet may be the wave of
the future, she said Realtors' demands on it probably exceed its
current ability to meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers need speed, accessibility and constant availability of
data,'' Millett remarked, ``and the Internet may not yet be ready
for us. It can be slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pending development is the ``e transaction.'' This
technology would take sales contract information and make it
available to a network for participating parties. These might
include lenders, credit and title agencies, inspectors, appraisers
and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think you could shrink $21 billion from closing costs and
improve buyers' ability to buy, if you automated the paper trail
created for each home sale,'' Millett said.

   Stephen King has been a Sox fan for 40 years, a season
ticket-holder for more than a decade, and now he's used the Olde
Towne Team as a vehicle for his latest novella, ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon is flattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an unbelievable thing,'' the Sox closer said
Friday after throwing at the team's minor league complex. ``I've
always enjoyed Stephen King's work. My whole family is a big fan of
his.''
</P>
<P>
   King is in Florida visiting family and plans to hang out with
Flash sometime next week. Gordon, an early arrival at Sox camp,
will join the rest of Boston's pitchers and catchers for the first
formal workout Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Flash is thinking about going fishing when his new best friend
and author comes to Fort Myers. ``I'm going to try to see if I can
charter a boat,'' he said. ``I'd like to take him deep sea fishing.
And if he hangs around, maybe we'll hit the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon'' (Scribner, $16.95) is a
224-page reader in which the main character is a 9-year-old girl
who gets lost in the back woods of Maine. She copes with the
situation by listening to Sox radio broadcasts (Joe Castiglione can
be very soothing if you are lost in the wilderness). Gordon is her
make-believe friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``(King) wrote me a letter sometime around last October,'' said
Gordon, ``but I didn't get it until I came up for the Baseball
Writers' Dinner in January. Since then I've met Stephen and his
wife. He's a great man. And his wife and my mom got along great.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he's always been a fan of the mystery man. He said
his favorite King work is the film version of ``The Shawshank
Redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   King knows his way around the ballfield. He went to his first
Red Sox game at Fenway in 1959 and saw Al Kaline homer in a
rain-shortened Detroit victory. He claims he went to Fenway at
least once a year for the next 10 years and never saw the Red Sox
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling author was teaching at the University of Maine
during the 1978 season and canceled classes after the Red Sox lost
their one-game playoff to the Yankees. He wrote a piece in The New
Yorker about his son's championship Little League field and built a
$1.5 million ballpark for Bangor. King was first to predict that a
Red Sox-Cubs World Series might trigger the apocalypse _ ``Red Sox
win three, Cubs win three, and then nuclear war breaks out.'' If
the Red Sox ever go up for sale, King would be a logical
prospective buyer. And wouldn't that be a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the first time the Red Sox have crossed into pop
culture. Sam Malone of ``Cheers'' fame was supposed to be a former
Red Sox pitcher, and Fenway Park has been used as a prop for a
range of television shows and movies, including ``Ally McBeal'' and
``Field of Dreams.'' Ted Williams was the subject of a legendary
story by John Updike, and Jimmy Piersall's life story was made into
a book and movie, starring Anthony Perkins of ``Psycho'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon'' is scheduled to go on sale the
same week the Red Sox open their 1999 season in Kansas City. Gordon
has not seen an early version of the novella, but said, ``I think
he's got me signing a hat for her. She likes me as a player. I'm
glad he made me a good guy in the book. I consider myself a good
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   King was unavailable Friday, but last summer he talked about
future works involving his love of baseball. The author said:
``I've often thought that I would like to write a story or even a
novel where some columnist finds this old guy who's never seen the
Red Sox lose. He's been to a lot of games and they find out that
when they bring this guy into the park, they always win, so they
prop him up and get to the World Series and the guy has a couple of
strokes and a heart attack and they're still bringing him in. Of
course, the kicker is, he dies before the seventh game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a true baseball horror story. Meanwhile, Tom Gordon
and the rest of us wait for ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.''

GREEKS EXPRESS SHAME AT GOVERNMENT HANDING OF OCALAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ In the cafeteria of Pantion University, three
students spoke morosely about national pride and how they felt
robbed of it. Across town, in Zonar's cafe, three retired
executives, old enough to be the students' grandfathers, spoke in
the same angry, wounded tones about the events that allowed Turkey
to wrest a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, from Greek
protection.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth friend, a retired army officer, refused to join in,
muttering, ``I'm ashamed to be Greek,'' as he moved away.
</P>
<P>
   Since Turkish security forces seized Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya,
where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy, and triumphantly
hauled him, blindfolded, to Turkey for trial on charges of
terrorism, Greece has been nurturing a deep identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks are concerned for Ocalan, whose fight for Kurdish
independence from Turkey is one that many Greeks view as an echo of
their own effort nearly 180 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And there is disgust with the government of Prime Minister
Costas Simitis, whose bungled effort to protect Ocalan in secret
was viewed as so humiliating that it forced the resignation of
three top ministers on Thursday. A fourth , the intelligence chief,
was ousted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks have renewed loathing Turkey, seen as gloating over its
victory, and have expressed anger at the United States, because
many say they believe Washington had a hand in Ocalan's capture.
There is a sense of betrayal, because Europe stood by and did
nothing to help Greece out of its predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all that, the Ocalan affair has provoked a national
conversation on shame, pride and the Greek identity.
</P>
<P>
   One word keeps cropping up, ``philotimo,'' a Greek word for
inner pride or self-esteem that people say is too intrinsically
Greek a concept to translate accurately. Greeks love to remind
foreigners that they invented democracy. They also stake a first
claim on national pride.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs, they say, is 3,000 years old and like no other. ``This
was a direct hit at our philotimo,'' Yannis Kapsis, a former
foreign minister and a parliamentarian from Simitis' Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Kapsis, who has been one of the government's harshest critics
over the Ocalan case, said such a blow to Greek pride could not be
surmounted easily. ``The side effects will be felt for months, if
not years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern about pride, echoed on television talk shows and in
newspapers, as well as in cafes and kitchens, stretches across
generations and sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful,'' said Paghona Simou, a 21-year-old student in
public administration. ``This is something that leaves us with no
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled prime minister struggled Friday to regain some of
his, making his first public appearance since the scandal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis told reporters that his government had made mistakes,
but he also cast some blame on his European colleagues. He
reproached European nations for refusing to act together to seek a
solution to the problem and, instead, turned Ocalan away when he
flew from airport to airport in search of a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also share responsibility for subsequent developments,''
Simitis said. He announced that Greece would push European
governments and the European Parliament to pressure Turkey to
accept international observers at Ocalan's trial. He said that he
would also ask them to put Kurdish rights at the top of the
European agenda with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed highly unlikely that Simitis' statement would comfort
many countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Socialist, I vote for the government party,'' said
Christos Emmanuel, 19, a social anthropology student at Pantion.
``But I believe they did not give Ocalan to the Turks by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small county. We need money and protection. I feel
like our old character, our Greek identity, has disappeared. I
never expected this from a Socialist government. My ideals are
shaken.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Emmanuel and his friends said they thought idealism was part of
the national character. ``Ours is a history of struggle for
democracy, and this is not in line with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the loss of face in slightly less idealistic terms. ``I
felt frustration,'' said Jason S. Stratos, the president of the
Federation of Greek Industries. ``No matter what we do, Turkey
manages to get the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few Greeks say they think that Greece should have offered
Ocalan asylum, an act that would have been tantamount to a
declaration of war with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they bemoan Greece's weakness, first in failing to
prevent Ocalan's supporters from sneaking him into the country and
then for lending him ineffectual secret support that landed him in
a Turkish prison.
</P>
<P>
   He came here as an ``iketis,'' Kapsis said, using a word meaning
``supplicant'' that is derived from a religious law in ancient
Greece which required sanctuary be given to those who sought it in
a temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he got into our country, we were morally obliged to
shelter him,'' Kapsis said. ``The mistake was letting him in. There
was no moral obligation until he set foot here.''

THE NEXT GENERATION

 (For release Sunday, February 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Venture capitalist Mitt Romney's willingness to take over the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics should
be of more than passing interest to the business community _ and
not just as an opportunity to restore luster to a somewhat damaged
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue mission also offers a glimpse of hope for the future
of the Republican Party, in the form of an intellectual and
spiritual program far more robust than the ``neoconservatism'' that
recently has brought the GOP low.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Romney is just another specimen of one of those
intergenerational parlays that, when they work, work well. His
father, George, was a familiar feature of the political landscape
during the 1960s. A former chairman of American Motors Corp. and a
three-term governor of Michigan, Romney was an unsuccessful
candidate for president in 1968. He was noted for small cars and
doubts about the Vietnam War. Well-respected, he died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mitt Romney was the youngest of four children. He enrolled at
Stanford University in 1965. After a couple years in France, he
transferred to Brigham Young University, married, and graduated as
valedictorian of his class. He then entered a joint degree program
at Harvard's law and business schools, graduated in 1975, and
joined the Boston Consulting Group when it was at the height of its
fame.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later he walked out in the famous separation
that led to the founding of rival consultants Bain &AMP; Co., and in
1984, with several friends founded Bain Capital, a small firm that
had enormous successes in the next decade fueling the growth of
start-up firms such as Staples, Bright Horizons, and Domain Inc.
Despite the success (or perhaps because of it) his interest in
politics grew, and in 1994 he ran a pretty good but unsuccessful
race against perpetual incumbent Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing to understand about the Romneys is that they are
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints _
Mormons, as they are known, after their book of revelations. That
means the Romneys don't drink, smoke, or swear. It means they marry
for life and refrain from sexual relations until they do. It means
they contribute 10 percent of what they earn to their church.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, that means they are believers in a faith
revealed to Joseph Smith in upstate New York in the 1820s,
including the history of a lost tribe of Israel in North America
whom Jesus had visited immediately after his resurrection. Its
adherents suffered remarkable persecution for their beliefs _ Smith
himself was murdered by a mob in Nauvoo, Ill. _ until they found
safety beside the Great Salt Lake in 1847. The combination of
revelation and experience led the Mormons to a creed that is
remarkable for its many secret rites _ and its emphasis on family
values, industry, thrift, hierarchy, and collective action.
</P>
<P>
   The story usually told about the Mormons today has to do with
the extraordinary proseletyzing that has made it one of the world's
fastest-growing religions. The church has added more than a million
members in the last decade, bringing its membership to 5 million or
so, thanks to young members for whom two years of knocking on doors
as missionaries is a rite of passage into adulthood. (That's what
young Mitt Romney was doing in France.) Immigrants in particular
and the poor in general are drawn to the sense of community and
longer-term order that it provides.
</P>
<P>
   It is equally the case that members of the LDS church (as the
Latter Day Saints are more familiarly known) have been very
successful during the last 30 years or so working at the very high
end of American life _ business, medicine, and education in
particular. Romney is a conspicuous example. Several leaders of the
Harvard Business School are LDS members, including Kim Clark, an
economist who serves as dean. Boston therefore has a large and
vigorous church; business school professor Clayton Christensen is
preparing a history of it, and the congregation is building a large
new temple in suburban Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Latter Day Saints has been undergoing a slow but
remarkable evolution in recent years. A hundred years of isolation
in Utah permitted all the exotic aspects of the Mormon faith to
flower. Polygamy long has been a thing of the past, but firm
beliefs persist among the faithful in a hierarchy of heavens, the
necessity of baptizing long-dead ancestors, and the durability
throughout eternity of both personality and the bonds of marriage.
Women were relegated to subordinated roles for many years. Until a
special revelation in 1978, African Americans were forbidden to
serve as priests.
</P>
<P>
   All that has been slowly changing. Mormonism itself is moving
toward the religious and cultural mainstream, according to the
authoritative Christian Century magazine. For one thing, the church
now has more members outside the United States than in; it is
growing especially quickly in Africa. Gordon Hinckley, the
octagenerian president of the church (and also its prophet, seer,
and revelator) has taken advantage of his early work in radio to
make landmark appearances on ``60 Minutes'' and the Larry King
show. Saints now refer to themselves as members of the Church of
Jesus Christ; they emphasize their Christianity, instead of their
differences with Catholic and Protestant churches.
</P>
<P>
   To find anything like this Mormon metamorphosis, you have to go
back to the Society of Friends in 17th century England. For the
first quarter century or so after the sect arose in the ministry of
George Fox, the ``Children of Light'' and ``Friends of Truth'' also
presented society with extreme beliefs. They declined to pay
tithes, to take off their hats, or to knuckle under to what they
called a ``hireling ministry.'' So obstreperous were the Quakers in
pressing for the ``rule of saints'' that four were hanged in Boston
between 1659 and 1661.
</P>
<P>
   Persecution and repression brought a huge turnaround. Prevented
from holding office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, young Quakers
went into business _ and flourished. Their strict code of conduct,
ruthlessly enforced, led people to trust them with their money.
Their insistence on fixed prices instead of bargaining strengthened
their reputations for integrity and broadened their markets. And
frugality and family values led to large fortunes. What had begun
as a radical egalitarian sect in one century re-emerged in the next
as a creator and purveyor of mainstream values. Wholesome,
admirable Quaker qualities were played up; radical Quaker beliefs
were played down.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much imagination to see the resemblances. Mitt
Romney is about as different from the older generation of Mormons _
Utah senators Orrin Hatch and Robert Bennett, for example _ as it
is possible to be while still holding fast to the same core
beliefs; as different, say, as William Penn from George Fox.
Indeed, Romney maintains an very different political stance from
the ``neoconservatives'' who have prated about civic responsibility
since the early 1970s. Let me mention just two examples.
</P>
<P>
   Romney ran against Ted Kennedy in 1994 without attacking him
personally. He told the Globe's Ben Bradlee Jr. at the time that he
wouldn't have bothered to oppose John Kerry, Massachusetts' other
Democratic Senator, because Kerry's ``political views will come and
go.'' Kennedy, on the other hand, ``is really the champion for a
political philosophy for an entire country whose time has passed.''
Compare that principled willingness to offer an alternative to the
recent orgy of Clinton-hating!
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Romney spent $50,000 of his own money for a series of
newspaper ads during the 1996 presidential primaries in Iowa, New
Hampshire, and Massachusetts. He asserted that GOP candidate Steve
Forbes' flat tax plan would mainly benefit the rich. ``It's a tax
cut for fat cats,'' Romey said, ``a zero tax on the wealthy and a
17 percent tax on working Americans.'' Compare that willingness to
shoulder the financial burdens of democracy with the incessent
whining about taxes that has characterized the right wing of the
GOP for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when you think about it, the Mormon religion has been
practicing the very virtues that the neoconservative moment has
been merely preaching in recent years. Fiscal responsibility,
business integrity, philanthropic generosity, family values,
tolerance within its sphere, the ethical treatment of others:
Mormons could well serve as exemplars for us all. That is all the
more reason for why the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics turnaround
will be worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, one big difference between the Quakers and
the Mormons. Because of their beliefs about the Inner Light,
Quakers were ultra-Democratic and anti-intellectual. Mormons, on
the other hand, emphasize the need of external authority, such as
the Ten Commandments, the Bible, and the Elders of the Church.
</P>
<P>
   And in this, they more nearly resemble the puritan Yankees of
New England, of whom the sociologist E. Digby Baltzell in his
classic ``Puritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia'' wrote years ago,
``By and large, in a society that is led by an established and
authoritative class there will be more self-respect and pride,
among both the leaders and the led, than will be the case where a
privileged class falls back on its wealth, leaving the reins of
society to an egalitarian and democratic elite.''

SIDNEY POITIER HELPS DAUGHTER MAKE A NAME FOR HERSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Tamiia'' is wedged in there to break up the obvious, but
c'mon. Sydney Tamiia Poitier is Sidney Poitier's daughter, from the
dancing eyebrows to the disconcerting smile to her penchant for
making the lightest of dramatic moments appear life-altering.
``It's strange,'' Sydney says by phone. ``My parents never said
`don't' do this and they never said `do' this ... they just kind of
let me know in uncertain terms that (acting) wasn't the most stable
thing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Sydney, one of six Poitier daughters, three of whom
decided to try that life of instability, was working as a
record-company assistant when Dad called to ask, ``Are you sitting
down?''
</P>
<P>
   With little success, he'd been peddling the script of ``Free of
Eden,'' a talkie, female version of ``Straight Out of Brooklyn''
(or an inner-city rendition of ``Lilies of the Field,'' take your
pick). What probably scared off studios was its commercial
unfeasibility. It opens with a big gun-toting hoodlum mowing down a
couple fast-food workers for a few bills. But from there, gang
activity or gunplay is nil. Hollywood minds must have been
pondering: Who will pay to see this?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Free of Eden,'' premiering at 7 p.m. CST Sunday night
on Showtime, is a touching, uplifting drama about the relationship
between a teen-age girl from the projects and the rich businessman
she asks to rescue her from hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, in a fierce footrace with HBO for stars and fresh
concepts, saw both in ``Free of Eden.'' Sidney Poitier wanted the
lead role, and one can only imagine the marketing ideas going off
in producers' heads when he strolled in with the audition tape of
his 25-year-old daughter for the other lead.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume was feather-light. She'd had tiny roles in tiny
theater productions like ``Titus Andronicus,'' ``Hello, From
Birtha,'' and ``Our Town,'' where everyone played every character.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside: She had studied at New York University's Tisch
School of the Arts and the Stella Adler Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters how much experience the daughter of Sidney
Poitier has. When her dad called to say ``They want you for the
lead,'' she, like the young woman she was being hired to portray,
sat down and thought hard about her life.
</P>
<P>
   Most hard-working people don't summon up a lot of sympathy when
Sydney talks of the difficulties of growing up with a door-opener
named Sidney Poitier. ``It's a help, it's a hindrance, it's a
burden, it's a joy,'' says Sydney, who landed a small role in Clint
Eastwood's ``True Crime'' but who drew a bigger one in the May
miniseries ``Noah's Ark'' with Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that casting directors are eager to see
you. But there's no question that these unbelievable expectations
are placed on you. I'm just starting out, but people expect me to
be as good as my father. That's kind of insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney admits that acting has a glamorous appeal _ if a
distorted one _ for offspring of successful actors. She saw the
riches and acclaim of her father, but rarely got a glimpse of the
struggles, even when he went through long dry spells during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior in high school, she started to think seriously about
acting, and by then it was clear that her advantages came with a
psychological price.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started at NYU, I was nervous, worried that
people would question my qualifications for being there,'' says
Sydney. ``After a while I let those insecurities go, and now don't
carry them around anymore. Now I just worry about what everyone
else worries about: Am I too old, too young, too tall?''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Free of Eden,'' it's a watchable production that seems
a lot like Sidney Poitier the actor _ it tries awfully hard to make
us feel every uttered word.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's Nicole Turner witnesses a murder _ the robber
fails to see her hiding behind the counter _ she decides that
enough is enough. She wants out of the environment that has trapped
her and has her mother convinced that getting a minimum-wage job is
more valuable than getting an education.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier's Will Cleamons grew up in those projects but left his
ideals behind long ago, after becoming discouraged by a failed
teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free of Eden'' focuses on the teacher/student relationship
between them, and its best moments are when the two banter over
generational differences and, of course, Ebonics.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney will undoubtedly get some flack for her meek portrayal of
a hard-edged sister from the streets. Experience will teach her how
to disappear into a character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I did a good job with the speech patterns and the
mannerisms,'' Sydney says. ``But, you know, these things will come
in time. I'm in this for the long haul.''

<P>
   Which is why Sydney, one of six Poitier daughters, three of whom
decided to try that life of instability, was working as a
record-company assistant when Dad called to ask, ``Are you sitting
down?''
</P>
<P>
   With little success, he'd been peddling the script of ``Free of
Eden,'' a talkie, female version of ``Straight Out of Brooklyn''
(or an inner-city rendition of ``Lilies of the Field,'' take your
pick). What probably scared off studios was its commercial
unfeasibility. It opens with a big gun-toting hoodlum mowing down a
couple fast-food workers for a few bills. But from there, gang
activity or gunplay is nil. Hollywood minds must have been
pondering: Who will pay to see this?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Free of Eden,'' premiering at 7 p.m. CST Sunday night
on Showtime, is a touching, uplifting drama about the relationship
between a teen-age girl from the projects and the rich businessman
she asks to rescue her from hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, in a fierce footrace with HBO for stars and fresh
concepts, saw both in ``Free of Eden.'' Sidney Poitier wanted the
lead role, and one can only imagine the marketing ideas going off
in producers' heads when he strolled in with the audition tape of
his 25-year-old daughter for the other lead.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume was feather-light. She'd had tiny roles in tiny
theater productions like ``Titus Andronicus,'' ``Hello, From
Birtha,'' and ``Our Town,'' where everyone played every character.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside: She had studied at New York University's Tisch
School of the Arts and the Stella Adler Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters how much experience the daughter of Sidney
Poitier has. When her dad called to say ``They want you for the
lead,'' she, like the young woman she was being hired to portray,
sat down and thought hard about her life.
</P>
<P>
   Most hard-working people don't summon up a lot of sympathy when
Sydney talks of the difficulties of growing up with a door-opener
named Sidney Poitier. ``It's a help, it's a hindrance, it's a
burden, it's a joy,'' says Sydney, who landed a small role in Clint
Eastwood's ``True Crime'' but who drew a bigger one in the May
miniseries ``Noah's Ark'' with Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that casting directors are eager to see
you. But there's no question that these unbelievable expectations
are placed on you. I'm just starting out, but people expect me to
be as good as my father. That's kind of insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney admits that acting has a glamorous appeal _ if a
distorted one _ for offspring of successful actors. She saw the
riches and acclaim of her father, but rarely got a glimpse of the
struggles, even when he went through long dry spells during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior in high school, she started to think seriously about
acting, and by then it was clear that her advantages came with a
psychological price.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started at NYU, I was nervous, worried that
people would question my qualifications for being there,'' says
Sydney. ``After a while I let those insecurities go, and now don't
carry them around anymore. Now I just worry about what everyone
else worries about: Am I too old, too young, too tall?''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Free of Eden,'' it's a watchable production that seems
a lot like Sidney Poitier the actor _ it tries awfully hard to make
us feel every uttered word.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's Nicole Turner witnesses a murder _ the robber
fails to see her hiding behind the counter _ she decides that
enough is enough. She wants out of the environment that has trapped
her and has her mother convinced that getting a minimum-wage job is
more valuable than getting an education.
</P>
<P>
   Poitier's Will Cleamons grew up in those projects but left his
ideals behind long ago, after becoming discouraged by a failed
teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free of Eden'' focuses on the teacher/student relationship
between them, and its best moments are when the two banter over
generational differences and, of course, Ebonics.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney will undoubtedly get some flack for her meek portrayal of
a hard-edged sister from the streets. Experience will teach her how
to disappear into a character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I did a good job with the speech patterns and the
mannerisms,'' Sydney says. ``But, you know, these things will come
in time. I'm in this for the long haul.''

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT IN 1998 WAS WORST EVER
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. trade deficit soared 53 percent last year,
to a record high of $168.8 billion, the Commerce Department
reported on Friday, as the global financial crisis helped to
produce the first decline in U.S. exports in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Political sensitivities to the fast-rising trade deficit are
increasing _ particularly in hard-hit industries like steel _ even
while consumers benefit from low-cost gasoline, computer chips and
electronic goods. This year the trade imbalance is expected to
widen even further, especially if Japan remains mired in its
deepest recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in the deficit, U.S. officials said, came
from remarkably strong consumer spending for foreign-made goods.
But the deficit for December narrowed unexpectedly, to $13.8
billion, a 10 percent decline from November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the biggest increases in the trade deficit
originated from the hardest-hit nations of Asia. The deficit with
Japan rose to $64 billion, up from $56 billion in 1997, bringing it
back to the levels that touched off some of the fiercest trade
tensions with Japan a decade ago. Those have been alleviated
recently by the continuing strength of the U.S. economy, which has
muted the 1980s accusations that Japanese imports were taking
American jobs. The trade deficit with China rose to $56.9 billion,
the highest with any nation other than Japan, a 15 percent increase
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the best face on a deteriorating trade balance, a
senior Commerce Department official said on Friday that there were
signs of a ``spotty recovery'' of U.S. exports to Asia,
particularly to South Korea and Singapore. But both are relatively
small markets, and overall in 1998 the trade deficit with all
Pacific Rim nations totaled $160.3 billion, up from $121.7 billion
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest political challenge for the Clinton
administration, and for Vice President Al Gore as he begins his
campaign for the presidency, arises from the falloff in U.S.
exports. For six years, the administration has cited its drive to
increase exports as a key element of U.S. financial health,
boasting that exports had created vast numbers of high-skill,
high-wage jobs. The financial crisis that has spread from Asia to
Latin America and Russia has robbed Gore of that claim, and the
issue could easily turn on him if the U.S. economy slows and
joblessness begins to rise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``The deficit tends to reflect the falloff in U.S. exports
rather than any surge of imports,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S.
trade representative, said on Friday. ``And that is explained
entirely by recessionary conditions in 40 percent of the world
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already administration officials are taking every opportunity to
mention the benefits of low-priced imports, noting that they have
helped contain inflation. And there is no question that the world
financial crisis, and the glut of commodities, including oil and
farm products, has enabled U.S. consumers to save billions of
dollars. U.S. industry has also benefited, because the financial
crisis has lowered the cost of industrial inputs _ from steel to
machine tools to computers _ even while it has damped companies'
ability to export.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst may yet be ahead. Ian Sheperdson, the chief U.S.
economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in
Valhalla, N.Y., noted on Friday that `'exports of aircraft have
already fallen sharply this year.'' This decline may continue with
China's recent announcement that it is suspending the delivery of
all new aircraft for two years, while it wrestles with an
unexpectedly severe slowdown. Sheperdson also noted that oil prices
are now stable, meaning that manufacturers and consumers will
probably not get the added economic boost of continued price
declines.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The $168.8 billion trade deficit reported on Friday is the
highest in U.S. history. The previous high for trade in goods and
services came in 1987, when the figure reached $153.3 billion. It
declined drastically, to $31 billion, in 1991, but that was a
reflection of the weakness of the U.S. economy in the midst of a
recession. The last trade surplus was posted in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   While goods exports fell in 1998, exports of services were up
modestly, by about $2 billion. Those numbers include business and
financial services, travel and royalties and license fees. But
imports of services rose more than $10 billion. Still, exports
accounted for a surplus of $79.4 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the curious features of the latest report was the light
it cast on the economies of nations that the International Monetary
Fund, with U.S. backing, sought to bail out in late 1997 and 1998.
When their currencies were sharply devalued, many experts projected
that their exports to the United States would surge. It never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. imports from South Korea held steady, hovering around $23
billion. But exports to Korea fell drastically. The same pattern
held for Indonesia. The numbers suggest that in both countries, the
absence of trade financing made it difficult for the nations to
increase their exports to U.S. markets, even though their goods,
once priced in dollars, were significantly less expensive.

HONEYMOON OVER FOR GIULIANI? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps more than any other neighborhood of
Manhattan, the Upper East Side is Rudy Giuliani country. Mostly
white and white-collar, the wealthiest Zip code in America, its
residents voted to reelect him as mayor by a 4-to-1 ratio a little
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of them are growing a bit tired of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him, I think he's done a lot of good things, but I
think he's gotten a little out of control,'' Tim Devitt, a director
of TV commercials, said Friday as he left Eli's Manhattan, an
upscale food emporium on 80th Street and Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   George Blumenthal, a retired business executive who also voted
for Giuliani, said much the same: ``New York City has made
tremendous achievements under his term, but the man is very
autocratic. He lacks the grace that you need in a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   All over the city, Giuliani seems to be slipping. The biggest,
or most immediate, cause seems to be the way he responded to the
police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant in the Bronx. But
judging both from polls and from people's comments, the reaction to
that response may be an extreme instance of a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey taken last week by the Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute, only 44 percent of the city's residents approve
of the way the mayor is doing his job, down from 60 percent three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is still favored by most white residents, but even among
them, his positive rating has fallen, from 84 percent to 63
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This decline comes at a time when Giuliani is being seriously
discussed as a contender for higher office _ as a US senator, or a
Cabinet officer, or even a vice president in a Republican-occupied
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Friday on the ``Today'' show that he was giving
``careful consideration'' to a Senate race, but that several things
must come together first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund-raising has to come into place. You have to feel you
have the support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani runs for Senate, as many suspect he will, just 18
percent of the city-dwellers surveyed said they are likely to vote
for him. Another 18 percent said they were ``somewhat likely'' to
do so. But 49 percent said they were ``not at all likely'' to pull
his lever in the voting booth, and another 11 percent said they
were ``not very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac institute,
attributed much _ but not all _ of the decline to the killing on
Feb. 4 of Amadou Diallo, a much-liked, hard-working and unarmed
African immigrant, by plainclothes police who fired 41 bullets at
him as as he stood outside his apartment house in the Bronx shortly
after midnight on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's foes, not least the Rev. Al Sharpton, blamed
the mayor for the killing _ or at least for its excesses. The view
was that in his zeal to cut crime, he has encouraged aggression and
arrogance in his police force.
</P>
<P>
   At least on a level of political perceptions, Giuliani made
matters worse. He voiced public regret for, but did not condemn,
the action. He did not suspend, much less arrest, the four
officers. He did little to reach out to the black community. And he
called a news conference to lay out statistics showing that New
York's police are less hair trigger than other cities' forces _
which, though apparently true, seemed strangely tone-deaf.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Diallo's parents arrived in New York to retrieve
their son's body, Sharpton was in control of events, leading big
rallies, speaking in passionate but dignified and moderating
language, while Giuliani was so isolated, the parents declined to
see him when he came to call.
</P>
<P>
   The shoppers on the East Side all cited Giuliani's mishandling
of the Diallo affair as one reason for their growing disenchantment
with the mayor _ but just one reason.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Blank, a lawyer, said, ``He's gone a bit far generally.
Diallo is just an example.'' She cited, as others, the barricades
he has placed around City Hall and his grandiose plans a few months
back to build a high-tech command post in case of terrorist
attacks. ``It sounded so weird,'' she said. ``He's not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's style _ blunt, scrappy, unabashedly in-your-face _
has been appealing to many New Yorkers, especially when it was
accompanied by results, most notably the city's drastically lower
crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   There were nearly 2,000 murders in New York City in 1994, the
year Giuliani became mayor. Last year, there were just over 600.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, the Quinnipiac pollster, acknowledged that the mayor's
falling ratings ``might be a short-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mal Eisenberg, a teacher, was one of a few people coming out of
Eli's Friday whose admiration for the mayor has not diminished.
``Sure, he's obnoxious and rude,'' Eisenberg said. ``But we voted
for him, knowing this _ just like people voted for Clinton, knowing
about him. He's done a lot for this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Siegel, professor of urban history at Cooper Union College,
said Giuliani's current political problems might be caused, in
part, by this success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more crime goes down and the more you try to reduce crime
further,'' he said, ``the more interactions you'll have between
police and people who are not engaged in criminal activity _ and
this unavoidably creates problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said, ``Is there some level below which you can't reduce
crime any further without creating an intolerable situation?
Giuliani is running into that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Giuliani's critics say his hard-nosed style makes it
difficult for him to deal with the alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Former mayor Edward I. Koch, who says he agrees with 80 percent
of Giuliani's policies but disagrees with 90 percent of the way he
carries them out, put the matter bluntly: ``Rudy has built no
reservoir of good will toward him. When he starts to go down, all
the people who suffered will kick him down the steps.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, MILOSEVIC FACE OFF OVER KOSOVO, AS DEADLINE LOOMS FOR
NATO AIRSTRIKES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim at 600 words.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With additional U.S. warplanes bound for the
Balkans, President Clinton warned Friday that American forces are
ready to strike Serb positions if Belgrade misses a Saturday
deadline for making peace in war-torn Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to rule out an extension of the deadline -- 6
a.m. (EST) Saturday -- saying ''it would be a mistake'' to give
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic another chance to avoid
air strikes the White House first threatened last October.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, however, was defiant, refusing to meet with U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill, who traveled to Belgrade to issue a
last-ditch ultimatum to the Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not give away Kosovo, not even at the price of
bombing,'' Milosevic was quoted as saying by the official Tanjug
news agency, a government mouthpiece in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Clinton responded, saying that Milosevic faces a
stark choice between war and peace, on U.S. terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an option,'' Clinton said during a
White House news conference with French President Jacques Chirac,
following a meeting focused on NATO's plans for dealing with the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is an effective peace agreement, NATO stands ready to
help implement it,'' said Clinton. ''We also stand united in our
determination to use force, if Serbia fails to meet its previous
commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo and if it fails to accept
the peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at Clinton's side in the ornate East Room, Chirac
echoed Clinton's threats, saying the two were in agreement
''without the shadow of a doubt,'' and that Serbs would face ''very
serious consequences,'' if Saturday's deadline is missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our continent to be at peace,'' Chirac said, through
an interpreter, ''and we will not accept that a situation such as
the present situation in Kosovo should continue.''
</P>
<P>
   As the men spoke, some 200 U.S. warplanes were already within
striking distance of Serbia, and dozens more were preparing to join
them from the United States in what would be called Operation:
Determined Force.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered six giant B-52 bombers -- capable of launching
long-range cruise missiles at Serb targets from hundreds of miles
away -- to fly from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana to the
Royal Air Force Base in Fairford, Britain. They were expected to
leave over the weekend if Saturday's deadline passes with no
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Also earmarked to got to the region were a dozen F-117 stealth
bombers, 10 EA6B Prowlers, used to jam electronic air defense
systems, and 29 tankers used to refuel warplanes in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were at least five U.S. warships -- each
capable of launching long-range cruise missiles into Serbian sites
-- in the Mediterranean Sea, along with the aircraft carrier, the
U.S.S. Enterprise, at port in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the United States would have some 260 warplanes in the
region by early next week. Air strikes, however, could begin before
that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued an activation order last October, in effect
giving NATO authority to order air strikes, with U.S.
participation, against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   If launched, the attacks would likely begin with the launch of
scores of cruise missiles targeting Serb anti-air defense systems
and support facilities. The idea would be to help clear a path for
warplanes, should additional strikes deep into Serbian territory be
required.
</P>
<P>
   Without describing the specific targets, Clinton said the
strikes would follow a ''strategy which would at least reduce
(Milosevic's) capacity to take further aggressive military action
</P>
<P>
   against the Kosovar Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid talk of war, however, there was a last-ditch effort at
diplomacy underway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Rambouillet. She was to arrive just hours before the Saturday
deadline to try to eke out a last-minute deal that might avert NATO
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators representing the Serb Republic, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic, and ethnic Albanians from its southern province
of Kosovo have been meeting this week in a 14th Century castle in
Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.S. plan, Serbs have been told to pull their security
forces out of Kosovo and allow autonomy there for the majority
ethnic Albanians, or face NATO air strikes. In exchange, ethnic
Albanian rebels have agreed to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs agree to withdraw, some 28,000 NATO troops -- about
4,000 of whom would be Americans -- would go into Kosovo
immediately to ensure compliance with the three-year agreement and
safeguard the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, have chaffed at the repressive rule of the minority Serbs
ever since Milosevic stripped the region of its autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, open warfare has broken out between Albanian
rebels operating as the Kosovar Liberation Army, and Serb security
and para-military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States blames the Serbs, however, for the vast
majority of atrocities that have taken place in the province, where
some 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced
from their homes during the harsh winter.
</P>
<P>
   The terror in Kosovo has followed the pattern Serbs used to kill
or run off hundreds of thousands of ethnic Muslims and Croatians in
nearby Bosnia and Croatia from 1992 until November 1995, when NATO
airstrikes and U.S. diplomacy forced the parties to sign a peace
treaty near Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, a U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping force
has overseen the fragile peace in Bosnia. Clinton has warned that
the fighting in Kosovo threatens the stability in the volatile
region and must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace plan the United States is insisting that
Milosevic agree to, Kosovo would remain -- for at least three years
-- as a part of Serbia, but ethnic Albanians would replace Serbs as
the controllers of the provincial government, legal and security
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested on Friday that the alternative would be
independence for Kosovo, which is widely supported by ethnic
Albanians and rabidly opposed by Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe it's the only way (Milosevic) can
preserve Kosovo as a part of Serbia,'' Clinton said. ``We're trying
to give this a chance to work, not trying to
</P>
<P>
   provide a wedge to undo Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not officially endorsed independence for
Kosovo and has instead insisted that all parties respect the
territorial integrity of present-day Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a time out here,'' said Clinton. ''We need a process
within which we can get the security forces out, as Mr. Milosevic
said he would do before, and build some internal institutions
within Kosovo capable of functioning, and then see how it goes.''

U.S., MEXICO STRUGGLE WITH `FAMILY' PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ When all was said and signed, when the
presidents of Mexico and the United States left and this sun-filled
colonial city in the Yucatan Peninsula returned to its customary
revelry, this question arose: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   In a whirlwind visit last week that barely lasted 23 hours,
President Clinton, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and their top
Cabinet members signed nine ambitious accords dealing with most of
the contentious issues dividing the two neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Amid smiles, bear hugs and the wailing of Clinton's saxophone _
he played ``My Funny Valentine'' for first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at a private dinner _ the two leaders said they were
embarking on a new era of mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than neighbors,'' Clinton said Monday. ``We belong
to the same family.''
</P>
<P>
   The family problems of drugs, immigration, border violence, law
enforcement, wildfires, tuberculosis and a generous credit line of
$4 billion _ so Mexico can buy U.S. products _ were seemingly dealt
with, at least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today between Mexico and the United States there is a new
understanding, based on respect, dialogue and friendship,'' Zedillo
said after the accords were signed. ``A new understanding that
makes the relationship between Mexicans and North Americans strong
and mutually advantageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how.
</P>
<P>
   The accords established good will, but it remained to be seen
how they will go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, similar agreements were signed between Clinton and
Zedillo in Mexico City. And in the two years since, U.S.-Mexico
relations have in many ways become frostier, particularly in the
areas of immigration and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to have accords than to not have them,'' said
researcher Jorge Bustamante, former president of the Tijuana-based
Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a nonpartisan think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is an enormous distance between what is said and
what is decided in the legislative branch. In the United States,
the power doesn't rest so much with Clinton as with Congress,''
Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was timed to occur before he decides whether to
certify Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs, an annual ritual
that this year could be rejected by Congress. If a country fails to
win certification, it can face economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process, in effect since in 1987, rankles the
30 countries that endure it each year. Mexico has always been
certified. Colombia and several other countries have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems have become politicized ... there are elements of
xenophobia, superiority and racism,'' Bustamante said. ``Many
Republicans treat Mexico as if it were an enemy, not a partner.
There is a huge gap between politics and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But to opponents of certifying Mexican compliance, Mexico is
clearly not doing its share. Shortly before the Merida summit
between Clinton and Zedillo, the Zedillo government announced a
$500 million program to combat trafficking by investing in
high-tech equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems these are the same feel-good agreements we have every
year, and they never result in anything,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas. ``Last year the president certified Mexico and said the
flow of drugs would decrease. Well, the drug flow has increased ...
the arrests of drug dealers have gone down, and Mexico is refusing
to extradite known drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration is another touchy issue. The accord signed by the
two leaders promises cooperation in resolving border violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and American human rights groups blame hundreds of
deaths on increased U.S. vigilance along the border, including the
so-called Operation Guardian, a policing program that centers on
populated border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, immigrants have veered off to more deserted
stretches, going longer distances without food or water. Last year,
360 immigrants died of thirst, hunger, drowning or exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, co-sponsor of a 1996 bill that revamped and strengthened
U.S. immigration laws, said blaming American policies and the
Border Patrol for the deaths ``is like blaming victims of crime for
the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the various measures and accords send mixed,
confusing signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, the immigration laws are too severe. They shouldn't
lead to fatalities,'' said Carlos M. Sada, the consul-general for
Mexico in San Antonio. ``I hope these accords translate into action
that benefit Mexicans who aren't criminals but are coming across
because of economic necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Santibanez, an immigration specialist who is the new
president of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said the Merida
accords have advanced the immigration issue on at least two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, they establish that immigration is a problem of the two
countries and that both of them are prepared to address it,'' he
said. ``Second, they recognize the importance of the border as a
joint region. That's completely new. We'll have to see how they do
it. It's an open question.''

AFL-CIO FOCUSES ON COMPANIES THAT RESIST UNION ORGANIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ In his three years as president of the
AFL-CIO, John Sweeney has repeatedly given a stark message to the
labor federation's 70 unions: organize or die.
</P>
<P>
   With union membership plunging to 14 percent of the work force
today from 35 percent in 1955, Sweeney has warned that unless
unions attract millions of new members, labor's influence in
bargaining and politics will continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Many unions have begun taking Sweeney's warnings to heart, and
as a result, the discussion at the AFL-CIO's executive council
meeting here often this week focused on how to woo more workers to
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the talk was nearly comical: There was a debate about
whether union organizers who visit workers at their homes should be
barred from wearing tongue rings. To the dismay of some of its hip
organizers in California, the Service Employees International Union
has decided to prohibit them, concluding that such rings would
alienate potential members.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the discussion was serious. One important strategy
that emerged was to ask politicians, community leaders and
clergymen to bring their moral and political weight to bear on
companies that resist unionization drives. Sweeney made clear that
organized labor would also make a big push to unionize three groups
of workers viewed as especially ripe for labor's message: low-wage
workers, minority workers and female workers. One of labor's
selling points is that unionized workers earn 34 percent more on
average than nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said the best welfare program is a job, but lots
of people who have jobs are earning the minimum wage and they still
need welfare or food stamps,'' said Kirk Adams, the federation's
organizing director. ``We're saying the best welfare program is a
union job.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is also mounting a nationwide campaign to publicize
labor's view that American companies are systematically trampling
on the right of workers to form unions. In speech after speech,
union leaders complained that companies illegally threaten to close
operations if workers vote to join a union and illegally fire
thousands of workers each year merely because they support
unionization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers are constantly faced with harassment, intimidation,
firings and threats of firings,'' said Arlene Holt, director of the
AFL-CIO's campaign to defend the right to organize. ``The
environment is not conducive to workers who want to freely form and
join unions. We want to change that, and we intend to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO not only plans to argue that the right to organize
is a fundamental right, but it also hopes to turn the campaign to
protect the right to join a union into a civil rights crusade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, the AFL-CIO held a forum at which it sought to
test-drive many of these ideas, among them that the right to join a
union free of intimidation is a civil-rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, which was attended by more than 200 workers,
several workers described the roadblocks and harassment they face
in trying to form a union. Their efforts were endorsed by a panel
of community leaders, including Bishop Thomas Wenski of the
archdiocese of Miami and two members of Congress from Miami, Carrie
Meek, a Democrat, and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the community engaged in your struggle,''
John Due, widely viewed as Miami's foremost civil-rights leader,
told the forum. ``We might have to get arrested to protect the
right to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the forum, labor leaders said, was to stress that
civic leaders should fight for unions because when workers unionize
it often helps communities by raising living standards and helping
foster a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   After unions did little organizing for two decades, recruitment
efforts are picking up. But Sweeney said far more needs to be done.
The United Steelworkers of America has budgeted $40 million to
organize workers, while the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees has approved $35 million for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The service employees union is engaged in the largest organizing
drive in 60 years: About 80,000 home-health-care aides in Los
Angeles County are voting this month on whether to unionize. The
Association of Flight Attendants is seeking to recruit nearly
15,000 attendants at Delta Airlines while the International
Association of Machinists is organizing 12,000 limousine drivers in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of union
members rose by 100,000 last year, reversing several years of
losses, but it was still too small to stop the decline in the
percentage of workers in unions. The 100,000 gain was far less than
the 475,000 members organized that unions reported. The difference
is partially explained by the many union members who lost jobs when
their plants closed or downsized.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Thomas Donohue, who was in
Florida to become the first chamber president to speak at an
AFL-CIO executive council meeting, said unions were blaming
companies for their own problems in attracting workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that no company is breaking the law,'' Donohue
said. ``There are probably 20 million companies in America, and my
experience is companies are tending to live within the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who received heavy applause when he
spoke to the executive council Friday morning, was far more
supportive. Thursday, the federation announced that it would wait
at least until August before endorsing a presidential candidate for
2000. It urged individual unions to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very deeply in the right to organize,'' Gore said at
a news conference. ``The decisions by some employers, thankfully a
minority, to use tricky loopholes to frustrate and ultimately deny
workers from joining a union is unfair, and it must stop.''

TOO MUCH ADO ABOUT GIVING REFERENCES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to get a detailed reference on a prospective employee these
days, and you're likely to hit a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Most managers balk at giving anything but the most basic
information about former employees. At larger companies, inquiries
are usually referred to the human resources department, which will
probably only verify dates of employment, according to a recent
survey by the Society for Human Resource Management.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 percent of the 854 respondents in the survey would give
a reference-seeker a reason why an employee had left, and only 13
percent would say anything about work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't people give substantive references any more? Because
of a pervasive spoken or unspoken fear of being sued by former
employees who take issue with what they had to say _ or failed to
say.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to C. Patrick Fleener, a management professor at
the Albers School of Business and Economics at Seattle University,
``the fear of being sued and losing is not well founded.'' Fleener,
co-author of a study of federal and state court records nationwide
from 1965 to 1970 and 1985 to 1990, found only 16 defamation cases
arising from reference checks. And plaintiffs prevailed in only 4
of the 16, he found.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rechtschaffen, an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson
in San Francisco, said: ``Part of the reason you don't see so many
of these cases, from the plaintiff's perspective, is that they're
quite difficult to bring. There are real problems of proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rechtschaffen's ``standard'' advice, like that of most
employment lawyers, is to ``give out minimal
name-rank-and-serial-type information.'' That goes for good workers
as well as bad, he said, since sticking to neutral facts only for
less-than-stellar former employees would get ``into the problem of
the employee alleging, `Well, their failure to give me a reference
is in and of itself a negative.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, keeping quiet is sometimes as dangerous as speaking up.
A California case involved a school that neglected to mention to a
prospective employer that its former vice principal had ben
accused of molesting a teen-aged student.
</P>
<P>
   After the vice principal was accused of molesting a 13-year-old
girl at his new school, the California Supreme Court ruled that the
referring school could be held liable for that omission.
</P>
<P>
   But few of us are in the position of having to recommend child
molesters (at least ones we know about). Despite widespread belief
to the contrary, it is possible to give references safely and
ethically _ both positive and negative _ as long as they are
truthful. Of course, if you're malicious or retaliatory, or show
bias toward a group of people protected by civil rights law, you're
asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most people know they can still get the dope on
prospective employees if they really want to.
</P>
<P>
   To get or give a reference these days, ``you have to build a
very Rashomon kind of convoluted Byzantine structure,'' said Dr.
Pierre Mornell, a psychiatrist and author of ``45 Effective Ways
for Hiring Smart'' (Ten Speed Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``If a lawyer or HR person calls a manager or CEO about
somebody, they're not going to say anything,'' Mornell said. ``But
they will talk back-door with somebody at their own level whom they
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The former personnel director of a 5,000-employee company in
northern California, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged as much: ``While our company's policy was name, rank,
and serial number, off-the-record references were given all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days, however, when you could count on your
reputation following you from job to job _ for good or ill. For
managers, hiring has necessarily become more of a crap shoot,
infused with suspicions about the veracity of any references
received and fear about those given.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen states are considering laws that would shield
employers who give accurate information about former employees. But
with lawyers and personnel departments already taking truthful
discretion out of our hands, do we really want government stepping
in, too?
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it make more sense to take some of the more than $5
billion spent on employment lawyers every year and put it toward
freeing managers from fear of litigation by teaching them how to
give fair, above-board references? &QL;

NEW GENENTECH CORONARY TREATMENT DISAPPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest trial yet of a hot new concept _ using drugs to grow
new blood vessels for hearts with blocked arteries _ has produced
disappointing results, but specialists Friday called the outcome a
setback, not a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   They were reacting to an announcement by the California biotech
company Genentech, which came more than two weeks before scientists
are scheduled to report the study data at a New Orleans heart
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results, the company said, show that injections of a
blood vessel growth factor into the ailing hearts of human
volunteers did not produce the hoped-for improvement in the
patients' ability to exercise on a treadmill without chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the preliminary view of the data,'' Dr.
Susan D. Hellmann, Genentech's chief medical officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers speculated that the company made the unusual
announcement to dispel any suspicion of insider trading during the
next two weeks before the scientific conference, or to cushion any
fall in the company's stock price that might result if expectations
of a positive result are dashed next month.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not disclose any details, and even the lead
researcher in the national trial, Dr. Timothy D. Henry of
Minneapolis, said he had not yet seen the data that prompted
Genentech's announcement. Henry is scheduled to present the results
on March 9 at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot of excitement about this approach,'' Henry
said. ``The field is based on sound concepts and very solid data in
experimental animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry and others said the results may signal that the techniques
used were wrong, but not the concept. In the Genentech trial,
researchers injected a genetically engineered protein called
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, or VEG-F, directly into
patients' coronary arteries. The study enrolled 178 heart patients
divided into three groups, who got either a high dose of VEG-F, a
low dose, or injections of an inert substance called a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The heart injections were followed three, six, and nine days
later by intravenous doses, through a vein in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The first results are based on exercise tests of the study
subjects 60 days after the initial injections, presumably enough
time for new coronary vessels to grow and nourish areas of the
heart muscle that were previously starved for oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's announcement apparently means there was no
significant change in patients' exercise capacity two months after
the VEG-F injections. But several experts, including Henry, said
this does not necessarily mean that it is not possible to grow new
coronary arteries, a concept called coronary angiogenesis. It may
mean, for example, that the VEG-F protein is washed out of the
coronary circulation too rapidly to stimulate or sustain new blood
vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has always been a concern about the protein, which has a
circulating half-life of less than three minutes,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston. ``The
hope had been that enough VEG-F might be soaked up by the tissues
that it would remain there in a biologically active way.''
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation of the study results, Isner said, is that
success will depend on a longer-lasting supply of growth factor.
The approach he and some others favor is gene therapy _ injecting
the gene for blood vessel growth factor directly into heart tissue,
rather than the protein made by the gene.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, whose research is funded largely by Vascular Genetics, a
company he helped found, has used the VEG-F gene therapy approach
in 24 heart patients. One did not have clear evidence of new vessel
growth, and another was recently admitted to the hospital for chest
pain that required artery-clearing angioplasty for a blockage that
Isner said was not related to the gene therapy.

   The other 22 patients, Isner said, have had striking reductions
in their angina pain plus evidence of improved blood flow on
radionuclide scans of the region where the VEG-F genes were
injected.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers remain skeptical of Isner's results, partly
because the St. Elizabeth's group has not compared treated patients
with a control group that received only placebo.

   ``Some have been intensely critical of that, but I'm not,''
Henry said. ``When you first start using a drug, you have to start

   Dr. Michael Simons of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston is scheduled to report in March the results of two early
studies involving 90 patients who received injections or implants
of a different blood protein, fibroblast growth factor, or FGF.
</P>
<P>
   Simons said he was not discouraged by Genentech's announcement,
even though he expects some will interpret it as bad news for the
coronary angiogenesis field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting field to be in, and I think it has a real
potential to change the face of medicine, more than anything we've
seen in the last 30-40 years,'' Simons said.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ ``Ninety percent of our clientele is
celebrities, the tall-and-thin club,'' Rita Watnick says.
</P>
<P>
   Now she tells me.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rest of America, I watch the fashion parade every
year at the Oscars, while delivering a commentary that makes Joan
Rivers seem kind. At each commercial I'm on the phone to my sister
shrieking, ``Did you see that?''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few years, certain stars _ Demi Moore, Wynona
Ryder, Nicole Kidman _ have been wearing the most delicious gowns,
drop-dead elegant and fitted like a dream. When asked where they
came from, they say, ``Rita, from Lily.''
</P>
<P>
   Lily is shorthand for Lily et Cie, possibly the most opulent
collection of vintage haute couture and top-end manufacturers from
the 1920s to the 1970s assembled in the country. Even Tiffany
Dubin, the fashion director at Sotheby's, calls it ``phenomenal,
the Madison Avenue of vintage.'' Movie stars who need a rest from
staid Armani or splashy Versace come here to ogle mint-condition
Pierre Balmain, Balenciaga (Tea Leoni married David Duchovny in
one), Christian Dior and Norman Norell.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since Ms. Watnick has been in business, she has
spent millions building her inventory. Between her store at 9044
Burton Way and her warehouse, she now has 500,000 pieces _ 100,000
dresses, gowns or suits, including the largest collection of Rudi
Gernreich in the country, 450 pieces. The rest are hats, bags,
scarves, shoes and accessories _ everything from gloves to bras to
unworn stockings from the '20s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   To walk into Lily et Cie is to experience a thoroughly romantic
time warp. Within minutes I'm yearning to carry a hatbox to lunch.
One wall is lined only with little black dresses _ ``cocktail
clothes from the '50s and '60s,'' Ms. Watnick says _ with labels
like Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass for Maurice Rentner and Miss
Sophie, Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   One couture dress has no label, but its seams are hand-stitched,
the slip constructed from horsehair and tulle. There are bouffant
skirts, slim skirts, netting and sequins and beads and lace, each
more intoxicating than the next. Cinderella's fairy godmother
definitely shopped here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love these!'' I shout, presenting Ms. Watnick with three I
want to try. Never mind that they're each from $500 to $900 _ and
this is the cheap rack. Some designer gowns go as high as $45,000.
I can feel that shopping high coming on, where the real world
evaporates and I'm suddenly convinced that Tracy Lord in ``The
Philadelphia Story'' is my best and closest friend.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. Ms. Watnick shakes her head. ``Too small,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   I am crestfallen. How can she tell? She holds the waist of each
dress against mine, explaining it would have to go halfway around.
None do. And she is adamant about the trying-on policy: No one
tries on anything unless she says so. Each dress is one-of-a-kind,
and the wear and tear of forcing a seam over a too-thick waist or a
too-wide hip can damage the garment. This is not Antique Boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another jump up altogether from what people call
vintage,'' Ms. Watnick explains in her husky, authoritative voice.
A 50-ish Los Angeles native with movie star skin and a Lhasa apso
named Trouble by her side, she is able to cast one look at a dress
or person and make a pronouncement that is instant and unerring. If
one of her assistants speaks, she speaks louder. ``I interrupt all
the time,'' she says. ``It's my favorite thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the 1,000 customers she sees only by appointment seems
to mind. ``They either buy the first dress I put on them or they
buy everything I put on them,'' she proclaims. These women include
Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Cameron Diaz, who actually fit into
one of the doll-size dresses on the front rack that I couldn't, a
hand-beaded silk chiffon. Ms. Watnick's customized ministering has
even included assisting Wynona Ryder with jewelry choices at Harry
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that leaves the store is meticulously altered, since
she prides herself on her eye for the perfect fit. ``I've sold
150,000 pieces of clothing over 20 years, and I know more about the
construction of clothing than anyone who works for me,'' she says.
``I'll say, `It's an eighth of an inch off,' and I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Time to put her claims to the test. I go to try on the gowns Ms.
Watnick has preselected for me, but before I can start, Sarah
Jessica Parker comes in. She needs an evening bag for the Golden
Globe Awards, to match her light blue Donna Karan gown. She has not
brought the dress, only a photo, and is wearing workout clothes, a
tank top and clingy pants. She is so taut and tiny she looks as if
she's been constructed from bobby pins. Just standing next to her I
feel like I've expanded to three times my size and should be
manning a steam table, dishing out beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez Louise,'' Ms. Parker says daintily when confronted by a
stunning array of choices. There is an Austrian crystal handbag
with a sterling silver chain, a hand-beaded bag made of pearls and
embroidered with tiny flowers, a white reptile Judith Leiber bag
flashing rhinestones. She holds each one next to the picture while
everyone offers an opinion _ Ms. Watnick, her assistants and Ms.
Parker's publicity agent _ but she still can't decide. Ms. Watnick
allows her to take the Leiber and crystal bags home to try with the
dress, so she can send back the one she doesn't use. She leaves
happy (and eventually chooses the crystal).
</P>
<P>
   I, however, am still feeling bloated from the encounter, and
when I go into the dressing room with one of Ms. Watnick's
assistants to try the first gown, I am amazed there's room for both
of us. The dress, a navy brocade priced at $4,800, is by Michael
Novarese. It is a sleeveless column with a deep V-neck that has an
elaborate overskirt with way too much material for me. I look
upholstered.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we try a strapless white beaded Dior for $5,800. This
time, I won't even leave the dressing room. It is tourniquet tight
and from the back, way too Jennifer Lopez for my taste. Sitting
would be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watnick then suggests an Adrian multicolored chiffon. It is
a museum piece, she says, and sells for $4,200, which could be
considered a bargain. As Ms. Dubin of Sotheby's explains, ``An
Adrian dress with the label in perfect condition is irreplaceable,
a part of Hollywood history.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, let history show that I can get it on, but it looks just
awful. I am not tall enough and the Play-Doh colors make my face
and arms look pasty. It occurs to me that this is the opposite of
playing dress-up as a kid, where you put on your mother's old
clothes and they are all too big. With these, I've already outgrown
them.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly disheartened, I try a black satin strapless Nicholas
Ungar column. Way too tight across the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watnick seems annoyed. ``Look,'' she says, ``I'm your
friend, but you have a tiny bit of a negative self-image. It's not
that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not, but for $1,125, I'm looking for better than
``not that bad.'' My shopping high gone, I have turned back into a
pumpkin. Or more to the point, my stomach has turned into a
pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   I leave humbled and exhausted after three and a half hours of
being girled to death _ poked and prodded and found wanting, in
style, confidence and measurements, not to mention age. When you're
20, you look good in anything.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrive at lunch, though, I have an epiphany: I am
not now nor will I ever be a movie star. So what? I can still
gather myself together, rise up and live a full and happy life _
thanks to whoever invented the elastic waistband.
</P>
<P>
   I study the menu, and when the waiter appears, I muster a smile
and utter the one word I see there even more beguiling than
Balmain: ``lasagna.''

7 SENATORS PROTEST EMBRYONIC CELL RESEARCH  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Kan . , Okl., Ariz., N.H., N.C., Wyo., Mo.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven Republican senators have written to Donna Shalala,
secretary of Health and Human Services, to protest a ruling that
permits federal financing of research into human embryonic stem
cells, the primordial cells from which all the body's tissues are
derived.
</P>
<P>
   The senators' letter, announced on Wednesday, is separate from
the letter on the same subject organized by the House Pro-Life
Caucus and signed by 70 members of the House of Representatives,
including most of the House leadership. The House letter included
eight Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The two letters refer to three-year-old law that forbids federal
money to be used for any research in which an embryo is destroyed.
Last year, researchers using private financing managed to culture
human embyronic stem cells from frozen embryos created in fertility
clinics and from aborted fetuses. Scientists believe the cells have
the potential to treat degenerative diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala's department ruled last month that federal grants could
be awarded for research on the cells already obtained, though not
for obtaining additional cells. A profusion of cells can be grown
from the existing cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Sens. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who
organized it, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Robert
Smith of New Hampshire, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Michael Enzi
of Wyoming and John Ashcroft of Missouri. Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., who is chairman of the subcommittee that sets biomedical
research financing, said that plans to award federal money for stem
cell research should continue while the House letter to Shalala was
under consideration.

CLEMENS MAY BE GREEDY, BUT THIS WASN'T ABOUT $$$
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For maybe the only time in his adult life, Tom Hicks' blood was
not flowing burnt orange this week. More like fiery red, actually.
</P>
<P>
   His University of Texas connection had failed him. His UT link
with fellow former Longhorn Roger Clemens, a link that had seemed
so Eyes-of-Texas like, suddenly was blinded by Broadway lights.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks lost one _ a big one _ he thought he was going to win when
Clemens stepped right around the Rangers on his way to accepting
this week's trade to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When there's a UT tie-in, Hicks is not going to lose often.
Officially a member of the school's board of regents, in reality
he's the secret athletic director. The current upswing in the Texas
athletic department is to Hicks' credit, with DeLoss Dodds serving
only as a Howdy Doody front man.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Rangers' owner, Hicks worked tirelessly this
off-season to arrange a Clemens arrival in Arlington for early
April. He had UT pipelines to Roger, he had mutual UT friends with
Roger. More than anything he truly believed all the Clemens
propaganda _ that Roger wanted to pitch in Texas Our Texas, and
wanted to stay in the American League to finish his Hall of Fame
career. To Hicks, that said Arlington more than Six Flags said
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks playfully chided a certain media member _ it was me _ over
a December column that the Rangers were out of the Clemens chase.
That column was based on Doug Melvin not having as much to give
Toronto, player-wise, as say the Houston Astros. (The Yankees I
never really had in the final mix).
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you check where Roger's wife is from and where her
family lives?'' he asked. Yeah, Tom, where? ``Arlington.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was right and ripe for this deal, so thought Hicks.
And sure enough, Melvin did have a trade cut with Toronto this
week. It was a deal without one frontline player or rotation
pitcher being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Two obstacles jumped in the Rangers' way, the least being that
George Steinbrenner, against the wishes of his baseball people, put
pitcher David Wells in the New York trade package to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays leaped on George's offer, and rightfully so. But
Clemens, if he had wanted to pitch for an American League team in
the greatest state God ever created, had the contractual right to
tell the Blue Jays ``no.'' If he had desired for Arlington to be
his new home, so close to his Katy roots and his Austin roots and
his wife's roots, Clemens could have made it happen Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, however, immediately flung himself into George's
waiting arms.
</P>
<P>
   It's not sour grapes for Hicks to be angry or for Melvin to be
angry. They felt misled by Clemens, and they are right.
</P>
<P>
   But just because Clemens is a greedy, self-serving,
double-dealing super-star, that also doesn't make him bad people.
At least not bad people by baseball, or pro sports, standards.
</P>
<P>
   As a free agent three winters ago, Clemens preached the
``I-want-to-be-in-Texas'' sermon, then signed with Toronto. He went
where the most money was being offered, meaning 8 million in U.S.
dollars per season. If Hicks had owned the Rangers then, Clemens
would have been here. At the time, however, the Rangers didn't play
big-league hardball when it came to luring free agents, even a
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it wasn't about dollars. Hicks could and would match
Steinbrenner in any type of contract. This time Clemens went where
he thought he had the best chance to win a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame Clemens at all. But by now, he's made everyone
tired, and made himself look cheap, with his ``pitch in Texas''
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But for a true slice of today's sordid life in the big leagues,
please examine the other major figure involved in this week's large
trade. That would be David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone do more for an owner and a team than Wells did
for the Yankees in '98? Great season, great postseason, but it also
goes beyond Wells' stellar work on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   This is a half-crazy, fun-loving, biker-bar loving, good guy,
who was a perfect fit in New York, and also loved everything about
pitching in New York. Not many can say that. Wells could. And if
Clemens is a financial bargain at $8 million a season, consider
that Wells' contract is for half that. He's a better bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But when Steinbrenner was overcome with concern over how good
the Rangers could be if Clemens was in their rotation, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   George ordered Wells gone in about the same split-second it took
Clemens to OK the trade to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner and Clemens were feeding out of the same plate of
me-myself-and-I. And that's the standard menu in the big leagues of
today. Either eat or be eaten.

INDIAN LEADER'S VISIT TO PAKISTAN SEEN AS HEALING EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ More than half a century since the leaders of
India redrew borders and uprooted millions of lives, Abdul Aziz
Khan still feels as divided as the day he went to sleep in India
and woke up in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Khan was a young railway worker in Dhaka, a city that
became part of Pakistan under a partition agreement that carved up
India to create a Muslim homeland for India's largest minority
group. Khan's family lived in Uttar Pradesh, which remained part of
Hindu-majority India, and although the Khans were Muslim, they _
like tens of millions of others _ chose to stay in India rather
than abandon their property and community.
</P>
<P>
   But places like Dhaka were wracked by communal violence, and
Khan could not return home safely. Millions of Hindus and Muslims
who lived on the wrong side of sensitive border areas fled, and
people like Khan, old enough to remember, recall refugee trains in
both directions arriving at border stations full of corpses, the
victims of barbaric ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   It is well-known that partition claimed as many as one million
lives and inaugurated a deep-seated enmity that has ignited three
wars between two nations that were separated at birth. It is
sometimes forgotten that millions more, like Khan, survived
partition - but as members of families separated by one of the
world's most fortified and volatile borders. For them, partition
and the enduring hostility have brought practical problems:
restricted travel and contact with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The visit Saturday of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
_ the first to Pakistan by an Indian leader in a decade _ is being
hailed as an historic opportunity for peace. Politicians,
businessmen and foreign observers hope the meeting will open trade
and help resolve the dispute over Kashmir, a strategic Himalayan
region that both sides claim.
</P>
<P>
   There are fundamentalists on both sides who oppose
rapproachment, but for most _ and especially for divided
``mohajir'' or migrant families _ the visit to inaugurate an
Indo-Pakistani bus route is as much a chance to mend emotional
fences as diplomatic ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is my homeland _ how can I forget it? Even birds return
to their nest after spending their days somewhere else,'' said
Khan, 73, his voice rising with emotion. ``Pakistan is our state,
but India is my home. Yet when I go to India to visit my family,
everyone asks, `Why do you want to go there?' `Why are you coming
here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many who visit the other side complain of headaches from visa
authorities and security forces, and the need to register with
local police wherever they go. The Khans say they have to save all
year to pay exorbitant bribes demanded by officials on both sides
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Khan's daughter-in-law is a Muslim Indian, a niece who married
his son and emigrated 12 years ago. She cries when asked about
living away from her family. ``My young sister died and I couldn't
attend her funeral,'' said Mujasim Bibi, 33. ``I don't care about
politics, but I hope the prime minister's bus trip will mean we can
all travel more freely.''
</P>
<P>
   0 Khan's wife, Nazuk Begum, 67, says all her family and friends
are in India. ``I cannot live without them,'' she said sadly. ``I
am old now and I want to die there, to be buried in my ancestral
graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   But her sons _ who were born in Pakistan _ will not move. Their
attitudes reflect some of the prejudices that 51 years of distance
and enmity have instilled in the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Haider Zaman, 33, explains that his parents ``feel
the association with India, because they were born there. But we
don't feel any. We feel this is home, this is our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any love for India. I feel proud to be Pakistani
instead of Indian. Hindus deprived us of our property. We can't
live with them,'' he said emphatically. ``Now we visit every year
because of my parents. But the bond will be finished when they
expire.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is echoed by many whose parents emigrated under bitter
circumstances, and raises the question of how warm future ties
could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Vajpayee's visit can help solve the Kashmir
issue, because both sides have been discussing it for years and
have failed to reach any decision. Many young people think the only
way to solve it is by waging war,'' said Salman Aslam, 32, a writer
and English teacher whose father fled from Indian Punjab to the
Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
   His father's family abandoned a lucrative export business, and
of 100 relatives who fled six miles on foot to the border, only 25
survived ambushes by sword-wielding Sikhs, a religious sect that
sided with Hindus at partition. Twenty relatives stayed behind, but
he has not seen them since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came with empty hands. Sikhs seized our valuables, cash,
ornaments. We went from upper-middle class to a hand-to-mouth
existence,'' said Aslan's father, Mohammad Aslam Khan, 70, who
eventually started his own construction business. ``We lost what we
had, but we thanked God that we got a homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Pakistanis echo his view that the pain of partition was
worth the reward of a land where Muslims can run their own
government and economy and not feel like second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legacy of bitterness between the neighbors, Khan
says, ``Common people are pinning hope on this visit. I want peace
and trade with India. And I would feel fortunate to meet my
relatives after all these years.''

NEW GENENTECH CORONARY TREATMENT DISAPPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The largest trial yet of a hot new concept _ using drugs to grow
new blood vessels for hearts with blocked arteries _ has produced
disappointing results, but specialists Friday called the outcome a
setback, not a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   They were reacting to an announcement by the California biotech
company Genentech, which came more than two weeks before scientists
are scheduled to report the study data at a New Orleans heart
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results, the company said, show that injections of a
blood vessel growth factor into the ailing hearts of human
volunteers did not produce the hoped-for improvement in the
patients' ability to exercise on a treadmill without chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the preliminary view of the data,'' Dr.
Susan D. Hellmann, Genentech's chief medical officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers speculated that the company made the unusual
announcement to dispel any suspicion of insider trading during the
next two weeks before the scientific conference, or to cushion any
fall in the company's stock price that might result if expectations
of a positive result are dashed next month.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not disclose any details, and even the lead
researcher in the national trial, Dr. Timothy D. Henry of
Minneapolis, said he had not yet seen the data that prompted
Genentech's announcement. Henry is scheduled to present the results
on March 9 at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot of excitement about this approach,'' Henry
said. ``The field is based on sound concepts and very solid data in
experimental animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry and others said the results may signal that the techniques
used were wrong, but not the concept. In the Genentech trial,
researchers injected a genetically engineered protein called
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, or VEG-F, directly into
patients' coronary arteries. The study enrolled 178 heart patients
divided into three groups, who got either a high dose of VEG-F, a
low dose, or injections of an inert substance called a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The heart injections were followed three, six, and nine days
later by intravenous doses, through a vein in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The first results are based on exercise tests of the study
subjects 60 days after the initial injections, presumably enough
time for new coronary vessels to grow and nourish areas of the
heart muscle that were previously starved for oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's announcement apparently means there was no
significant change in patients' exercise capacity two months after
the VEG-F injections. But several experts, including Henry, said
this does not necessarily mean that it is not possible to grow new
coronary arteries, a concept called coronary angiogenesis. It may
mean, for example, that the VEG-F protein is washed out of the
coronary circulation too rapidly to stimulate or sustain new blood
vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has always been a concern about the protein, which has a
circulating half-life of less than three minutes,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston. ``The
hope had been that enough VEG-F might be soaked up by the tissues
that it would remain there in a biologically active way.''
</P>
<P>
   One interpretation of the study results, Isner said, is that
success will depend on a longer-lasting supply of growth factor.
The approach he and some others favor is gene therapy _ injecting
the gene for blood vessel growth factor directly into heart tissue,
rather than the protein made by the gene.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, whose research is funded largely by Vascular Genetics, a
company he helped found, has used the VEG-F gene therapy approach
in 24 heart patients. One did not have clear evidence of new vessel
growth, and another was recently admitted to the hospital for chest
pain that required artery-clearing angioplasty for a blockage that
Isner said was not related to the gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The other 22 patients, Isner said, have had striking reductions
in their angina pain plus evidence of improved blood flow on
radionuclide scans of the region where the VEG-F genes were
injected.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers remain skeptical of Isner's results, partly
because the St. Elizabeth's group has not compared treated patients
with a control group that received only placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have been intensely critical of that, but I'm not,''
Henry said. ``When you first start using a drug, you have to start
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Simons of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston is scheduled to report in March the results of two early
studies involving 90 patients who received injections or implants
of a different blood protein, fibroblast growth factor, or FGF.
</P>
<P>
   Simons said he was not discouraged by Genentech's announcement,
even though he expects some will interpret it as bad news for the
coronary angiogenesis field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting field to be in, and I think it has a real
potential to change the face of medicine, more than anything we've
seen in the last 30-40 years,'' Simons said.

MODERN NASCAR MULLING TV DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few weeks, NASCAR executives will decide
whether to package the television broadcast rights to the 34
Winston Cup race weekends for sale to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   For racetrack owners, drivers and NASCAR itself, the
evolutionary move would mean hundreds of millions of dollars a year
in extra revenue, plus the added TV exposure needed to cultivate
the sport's mushrooming fan base.
</P>
<P>
   For racing fans, such a deal would mean more and better NASCAR
programming options than are now available.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of NASCAR's development into a modern,
sophisticated marketing operation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, each track operator who is host to a Winston Cup race
sells its TV rights individually for whatever it can to whatever
network is interested. This year, CBS, ABC, NBC, ESPN, TBS and The
Nashville Network offer NASCAR races.
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona 500 sells its rights for an estimated $15 million,
while smaller races sell their rights for something closer to $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Track owners like Speedway Motorsports Inc., operator of Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, believe that rights fees would soar
if the entire Winston Cup series were sold collectively, making
every track owner's total take larger.
</P>
<P>
   At present, NASCAR races generate about $100 million in TV
rights fees each year. That's a long way from 1985, when NASCAR
received just $3 million for the TV rights to 28 races.
</P>
<P>
   But it's even further away from the $400 million annually that
NASCAR might earn if its races were bid collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Said Texas Motor Speedway executive vice president and general
manager Eddie Gossage, ``We don't think we're getting enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're getting now is chump change,'' said John Mansell,
a sports business analyst with Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates, speaking to
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're terribly underpriced,'' added Bruton Smith, chairman and
chief executive officer of SMI.
</P>
<P>
   All the major U.S. professional sports leagues sell their TV
rights collectively, and the NBA and the NFL, especially, have
shown just how lucrative that strategy can be. More than leverage,
a packaged sale to a limited number of networks would make TV a
real partner in growing the NASCAR business, increasing the
marketing value of the sport and, therefore, the value of NASCAR's
broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   The time is right to make a move. Interest in NASCAR is at an
all-time high. NASCAR is the only national sports TV property to
increase its viewer ratings every year since 1990, said Mel Poole,
president of SponsorLogic, a sponsorship consulting management and
events agency in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest sports-marketing property of the decade,''
Poole said, ``and you want to negotiate when demand is highest.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR offers not only a growing fan base, but one that is
wildly supportive of its sponsors. Such advertiser loyalty is well
appreciated by network executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch the bidding \Ramong TV networks\S when they put this
out,'' said Tom Cotter, chairman of the Cotter Group, a Charlotte
motorsports marketing and communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the increased revenue also will help track
operators, who currently keep 65 percent of TV money (drivers get
25 percent and NASCAR 10 percent), hold the line on ticket prices,
ensuring that there are always some lower-cost seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Stock car racing fans will benefit in noneconomic ways, too,
said Bray Cary, vice president of broadcasting for NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   By packaging race rights, NASCAR can probably persuade its
broadcast partners to provide additional programming such as
prerace and postrace coverage, much as Fox, CBS and ESPN do for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is a 24-hour-a-day digital NASCAR channel
that would broadcast live from the track. Fans could go where
they've never been before, sitting in, for example, on the prerace
drivers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Other NASCAR divisions could have their races televised as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we want to give our fans a greater opportunity to
interact with our sport,'' Cary explained. ``This really isn't
about money. It's about how to position the sport so that the
immense popularity of NASCAR can be used to grow the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR, Cary said, will decide unilaterally whether to package
broadcast rights or continue to allow operators to cut their own
deals. Because of existing broadcast contracts, viewers aren't
likely to see any changes for at least two more years.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale of TV rights on an individual track basis, Cotter
said, is ``the one area where NASCAR is back in the 1960s.'' The
sport, he said, ``has gotten too sophisticated for that freelance
approach now.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect that to change.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The rookie noticed when David Wells came into the
room, first thing Thursday morning. Couldn't miss the big guy,
author of New York Yankee perfection, embodiment of a team that did
everything but bat a thousand in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   From across the clubhouse, No. 85 in your spring training
program stole a glance at Wells' familiar and ample figure, and
told himself there would be a moment, soon enough, when he would
take the opportunity to stroll across the blue tweed carpet to
introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Yarnall,'' he would say, extending his left arm, his
pitching arm. Then he would recount to Wells, well-traveled
southpaw in his own right, how he had gone from the Mets'
organization last summer to Florida in the Mike Piazza deal, then
back to a New York state of mind when the Yankees shipped their
third-base prospect, Mike Lowell, to the Marlins early this month.
</P>
<P>
   After his three months in the employ of one of baseball's five
and dimes, Yarnall actually considered saying something that Wells
would have appreciated before he was told to pack up everything but
the memories. It was something about how the business of baseball
can turn one's life into a dizzying blur but turn out all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already sitting over here when he came in,'' Yarnall
said. ``He's, like, right over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall raised his chin in the direction of a dressing stall
that had had its name plate removed, revealing a piece of weathered
tape with a number, 36, and a name, Keel, scrawled in pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' Yarnall said, ``he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, David Cone reported Friday, to Miami for a few rounds of
therapeutic golf. Bent out of shape, according to Cone, like one of
his snappiest breaking balls. Traded to Toronto, again according to
Cone, without so much of a clue, for George Steinbrenner's newest
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of the deal,'' Yarnall said, ``was when
someone down the row here said he heard they'd dealt Wells for
Roger Clemens. I said, `No way that happens.'''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, Ed Yarnall, to a Yankee-style homecoming. Welcome to
your first major league training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked out on the field and there were reporters all over
the place,'' he said. ``It was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Cool? Yes, that's what he said. The high-voltage trade through
the eyes of a babe. Yarnall, 23, was born near Philadelphia, grew
up near Fort Lauderdale, played at Louisiana State University,
signed with the Mets and now, three years later, finds himself
auditioning for a team that wins 125, then trades its ace. Yankee
scouts think of Yarnall as a potential third or fourth starter. He
began last season with the Mets' Class AA team in Binghamton, N.Y.,
and was in Charlotte, N.C., the Florida Marlins' Class AAA
affiliate, by season's end. In Binghamton, he was 7-0, with an
earned run average of 0.39. In Charlotte, the corresponding numbers
were 4-5, 6.20. That's why he said he was thrilled to escape the
Florida disorganization, where anyone with a live arm or quick bat
is a candidate to be rushed along and, as Yarnall put it, have his
``confidence crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has noticed that Wells' sudden departure leaves the
Yankees with one left-handed starter, Andy Pettitte, on their
25-man roster, and two _ Yarnall and his clubhouse neighbor, David
Carroll _ nonroster left-handed starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they could go out and get a left-hander,'' he said.
``I mean, they're the Yankees, George Steinbrenner ...''
</P>
<P>
   He left us to finish the sentence. ``Clemens, well, how can you
argue with that?'' Yarnall said. ``He's going to add a lot to the
team _ if there's anything that can possibly be added.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days, after witnessing the dispatching of Wells as if
he were a stack of last season's newspapers, Yarnall has grasped
the Yankee paradox. This may not be Oz, but it's not Pro Player
Stadium. A perfect game pitcher is not sold off to reduce the
payroll. On jogs the juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yarnall was 11 when Clemens failed to go the distance against
the Mets in Game 6, and took to the Shea Stadium visitors' dugout
his best chance at a World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clemens is scheduled to walk into a clubhouse of
champions, minus David Wells. The rookie looks forward to his next
cool Yankee adventure. He waits for the right time to walk over and
say hello.

THREAT OF KOSOVO AIR STRIKES INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to meet
Friday with the US envoy sent to Belgrade to help resolve the
Kosovo crisis, ensuring that efforts to reach an agreement between
warring factions in the Serbian province will go to the wire
Saturday against the threat of NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton increased pressure on
Milosevic, saying that NATO's threat to use airstrikes against
Serbian military targets should not be extended beyond Saturday's
deadline at noon, Paris time (6 a.m. EST).
</P>
<P>
   Unless one side finds a way to compromise, the airstrikes that
appeared improbable earlier in the week now assume an aura of
inevitability. As one US official put it, ``Someone's got to blink,
and it's not going to be us.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made this clear in Washington Friday during a
joint news conference with French President Jacques Chirac. ``I
have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as part of a NATO
operation, and I will continue to consult very closely with
Congress,'' he said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents made a final plea to Milosevic to agree to a
three-year cooling-off period during which Kosovo's autonomy would
be reestablished, its civic institutions strengthened and a
solution found to stop the unrest in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks, Clinton repeatedly referred to Kosovo's
``autonomy'' which he said was stripped away by Milosevic a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia's leaders now have a choice to make,'' he said. ``They
can join an agreement that meets their legitimate concerns and
gives them a chance to show that an autonomous Kosovo can thrive as
part of their country, or they can stonewall. But if they do that,
they will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he had ``respect for the position of Russia''
but did not comment on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement
in Moscow Thursday that Russia would not allow NATO airstrikes to
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said that he and Clinton are in ``complete agreement''
and made a special plea to Milosevic who, he said, ``holds more or
less the key to the solution'' to ``shoulder all his
responsibilities and to choose the path of wisdom and not the path
of war, which would bear very serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our continent to be in peace,'' Chirac added. ``And we
will not accept that a situation such as the present situation in
Kosovo should continue.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Milosevic appeared defiant in the face of a
looming deadline. In a sign of brinksmanship or inflexibility, he
rebuffed Christopher Hill, the US envoy to Kosovo who traveled
Friday to Belgrade in a last-ditch effort to convince Milosevic to
accept a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic maintains that he will not allow up to 30,000 NATO
ground troops into Serbian territory to police the deal that
diplomats are trying to seal in Rambouillet, 35 miles southwest of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not give away Kosovo, not even at the price of
bombing,'' Milosevic said. Such defiance, which collapsed last
October in the face of NATO airstrikes, appeared more vehement this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had to settle for a meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic. Philip Reeker, a spokesman for Hill, said that
the envoy told Jovanovic, ``There could be no half-deal, no
political settlement without the military implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   As US and NATO officials rattle their sabres publicly, Western
diplomats worry privately that airstrikes will embolden and
strategically assist the ethnic Albanian separatists in the Kosovo
Liberation Army. The KLA poses difficult challenges for negotiators
as well as Milosevic. Many in the KLA ranks refuse to accept
anything short of complete independence from Belgrade and vow never
to relinquish their weapons, as called for in the proposed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House press conference, Chirac said, ``It goes
without saying'' that if the ethnic Albanians prove to be the cause
of a breakdown in negotiations at Rambouillet, sanctions or other
measures would be taken against them.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats also expressed fear that bombing would only
strengthen Milosevic, who traditionally has used Western threats to
rally nationalist fervor.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic does not blink, bombing could begin sometime
Saturday, despite the continued presence of some 1,300
international observers and support staff in Kosovo, led by the US
diplomat William Walker. In the past, the Serbs have threatened to
take the observers hostage if NATO bombs them.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is running the international monitoring mission, was preparing its
people for a fast pullout from the province. Some 2,000 troops are
stationed in neighboring Macedonia to help accomplish that mission
if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of threats and defiance from both sides, US
Secretary of State Madelaine Albright is expected to arrive in
France Saturday to help French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook search for an agreement.
American, French and British officials played down suggestions that
Albright, Vedrine or Cook would make a last-minute dash to Belgrade
Saturday to convince Milosevic to accept an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   French and British diplomats at Rambouillet were gloomy, saying
they did not expect a deal by Saturday's deadline. The main
obstacle to a settlement centers on the text that outlines autonomy
for Kosovo and the deployment of NATO troops to police the
agreement that would end the fighting. Under such a deal, ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million, would be given self-rule: more than Milosevic wants to
give and less that the ethnic Albanians want to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people, most of them ethnic Albanian civilians, have
died in fighting between the KLA and Serbian security forces in the
last year and hundreds of thousands have been made homeless.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiators doggedly worked for a last-minute deal in which
all sides could save face, the specter of a bombing campaign loomed
large.
</P>
<P>
   Some 430 NATO warplanes, including 260 jets, are on standby. Six
American B-52 bombers are expected to land in Britain early
Saturday and presumably would be part of the bombing campaign if it
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats Friday began leaving Belgrade, the Yugoslav
capital. American officials said they were preparing to evacuate
some 130 US diplomats and their families in Yugoslavia to Budapest
Saturday, and to help an estimated 4,000 other US citizens in
Yugoslavia leave before the bombing.

   WASHINGTON _ In his first news conference since the Senate
acquitted him of impeachment charges last week, President Clinton
acknowledged Friday that the Monica S. Lewinsky sex-and-lies
scandal had not been good for the country, but that he expected to
have ``two more good years'' in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he believes his 13-month-long ordeal had
``re-ratified'' the Constitution and left the presidency undamaged.
It had, he said, been instructive for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I have learned a lot of personal lessons, most of
which I have already discussed _ and presidents are people too,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people expect the Congress and me to get
back to work, expect us either not to have any destructive
feelings, or if we do, not to let them get in the way of doing
their business,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   With enormous domestic and international responsibilities to
attend to, he said, the country cannot afford to let the scandal
get in its way.
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton
would run for a Senate seat from New York in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   His first response was, ``I think it's important that you all
understand ... this is nothing that ever crossed her mind until
other people began to mention it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had advised his wife to ``take some time, get
some rest, listen to people on both sides of the argment, try and
decide exactly what you think is right to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say she would do a ``fantastic job'' if she ran
and was elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be strongly supportive of whatever decision she makes
and will do all I can to help on this and any other decision, from
now on, just as she has helped me for the last 20-plus years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also added a word of caution, pointing out the
Senate election will not occur until November 2000. ``She has just
been through a very exhausting year, and there are circumstances
which have to be considered. And I think some time needs to be
taken here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice has been to take some time, get some rest, listen to
people on both sides of the argument, try and decide exactly what
you think is right to do, and whatever she decides, I'll be for,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments came a few hours after Mrs. Clinton had
a private meeting at the White House with Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat who announced in November that he
would not seek a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan afterward told The Associated Press that the numbers in
New York ``look very good for her,'' and that he would support her
if she ran, but that voting patterns and demographics in the state
were very ``complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials are pushing for Mrs. Clinton, whose
popularity has soared in the past year, to seek the nomination in
New York. But because candidates are expected to raise between $10
million and $20 million to run successfully, they are urging her to
announce soon _ something she has said she is not inclined to do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said she was giving a run ``serious
consideration.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Accepting the American Film Institute's 27th Life
Achievement Award Thursday night, Dustin Hoffman humbly but
amusingly noted that it was ``overwhelming to hear these things
said, to have my reputation turned to positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was not, of course, referring to his worthiness as a
recipient of the prestigious award, which since 1973 has been
bestowed on such Hollywood legends as John Ford, Orson Welles,
Bette Davis, Alfred Hitchcock, James Stewart, Fred Astaire, Jack
Nicholson, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of two best actor Oscars (for ``Kramer vs. Kramer''
and ``Rain Man'') and star of such historic films as ``The
Graduate,'' ``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``All the President's Men,''
``Tootsie'' and ``Wag the Dog,'' the 61-year-old Hoffman is
inarguably one of the great stars of his generation. He is also
perhaps the most influential, since he almost single-handedly
expanded Hollywood's concept of a leading man from narrow notions
of masculine perfection to include more average-looking,
emotionally troubled individuals.
</P>
<P>
   That aspect of Hoffman's legacy was duly noted by many of the
younger, character-focused actors who paid tribute to their mentor
at the black-tie event, which was held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel
and will be broadcast as an hourlong ABC special in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton, currently an Academy Award nominee for his role
in ``American History X,'' referred to the Pasadena-bred Hoffman as
``the saint of off-Broadway actors,'' acknowledging the many years
he spent perfecting his craft on the New York stage before hitting
it big with ``The Graduate'' in 1967. Comedian Jon Lovitz, noting
his physical resemblance to Hoffman, joked that the star always
promises to put him in his next movie (but never does). Liev
Schreiber, who appeared in Hoffman's most recent feature film
``Sphere,'' admitted that ``for the last five or 10 years, I've
basically been ripping him off as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Left barely mentioned throughout the nearly three-hour
presentation, however, was the trait Hoffman acknowledged in his
opening remarks: his reputation as a prickly perfectionist. Indeed,
past collaborators such as Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Geena Davis
and Jon Voight mostly characterized Hoffman's obsessive dedication
to the art of acting as an inspiration that improved their own
work.
</P>
<P>
   None of which means that the evening suffered from
overpoliteness. It was indeed a sometimes raucous, often hilarious
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's friend and two-time co-star Warren Beatty (``Ishtar,''
``Dick Tracy'') set the tone with his introductory speech, a
deceptively befuddled self-parody of his notorious egocentrism. A
high point soon followed when Anne Bancroft, who played the
cradle-robbing Mrs. Robinson to Hoffman's callow Graduate, gave the
actor a big passionate kiss, then, echoing a famous scene from the
movie, handed him a hotel room key and said, `It's been a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Faye Dunaway told an off-color story about irrepressible
prankster Hoffman adding extra, unexpected oomph to their legendary
bathtub scene in ``Litle Big Man.'' Reba McEntire, who serenaded
Hoffman with ``Midnight Cowboy's'' theme song ``Everybody's
Talkin','' couldn't get the reluctant thesp to croak out more than
one line with her, but he did gallantly waltz her around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hoffman's five children, in a charmingly rambunctious
videotaped segment, eagerly exposed blush-inducing personal data
about their father, such as his tendency to bark back at dogs and
their perception of their parents' sex life as darn healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's king cutup, hands down, was Hoffman's
contemporary and iconic equal Jack Nicholson. Appearing on stage
twice, first to archly recite (and uproariously comment upon) a
congratulatory letter from their mutual leading lady Meryl Streep,
then to actually present the award to Hoffman, Nicholson had the
crowd of 1,100 roaring at his every inflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is range,'' Nicholson said of Hoffman as he finally got
down to business, then ticked off a litany of superlative
adjectives (``uncompromisimg, probing, simple, complex...'') that
he capped with, ``and gorgeous. You do tremendous hair work.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own subdued acceptance speech, read with sometimes
choking emotion from a few handwritten pages, Hoffman thanked
collaborators, family, friends and the AFI _ which he noted was
formed in the same year, 1967, as his own movie breakthrough _ for
taking care of both himself and of the nation's film heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a glorious, magnificent orgy to be a part of, this
20th-century American film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, exhibiting the kind of self-honesty that has always been a
crucial element of his great performances, Hoffman seriously
addressed the issue his avid admirers had tiptoed around all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that I've hurt the few people that I have,'' he
said. ``I did it only in the search for authenticity in my
work.''!end! &QL;

WARNING ON CHILDREN, PESTICIDES SPURS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study on pesticide residue may cause American parents to
think twice before telling their children, ``Eat your spinach.''
But health officials say the public should not overreact to these
warnings about produce.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh spinach and seven other types of produce were identified
as containing high levels of toxic pesticides that may be
particulary harmful to young children, in a study released by
Consumers Union, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group that
publishes Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The other seven were peaches, winter squash, grapes, apples,
green beans, pears, and celery.
</P>
<P>
   The study results also challenged a common perception that
American-grown produce is generally safer than imported fruits and
vegetables. Researchers found many instances in which domestic
produce, such as peaches, fared far worse than foreign-grown fruits
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The study's author said that he is not encouraging parents to
avoid the produce aisles of grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking about fear of food, but informed choices,''
said Edward Groth, a biologist with Consumers Union based in
Yonkers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Groth's study was based on data from the US Department of
Agriculture from 1994 to 1997. It found some produce had
consistently low levels of pesticide, such as broccoli, canned
corn, bananas, and frozen peas. The study focused on 27 foods,
primarily produce, but also milk and juices.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union study comes as public health and
environmental officials are grappling with how to ensure that the
amount of pesticide used on produce is safe. Some scientists say
these chemicals damage the still-developing neurological and other
systems of young children.
</P>
<P>
   While previous studies have found high pesticide levels on
produce such as peaches, grapes, and apples, the Consumers Union
study is the first to incorporate the most recent federal
inspection data, along with the updated Environmental Protection
Agency guidelines on acceptable pesticide levels for children.
</P>
<P>
   This study seems likely to fuel the debate on the effect of
pesticides on children. Hard scientific data on the issue is
scarce, and scientists differ on whether there is cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, reports from advocates on both sides of the issue
will be released during the 10th anniversary of the Alar apple
crisis. That crisis began with the Feb. 26, 1989, airing of a ``60
Minutes'' episode in which some scientists linked the
color-enhancing chemical to cancer risks for children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician who formerly directed the EPA's
pesticide program, is convinced that the federal government hasn't
gone far enough to protect American children from pesticide risks.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said she was delighted that Consumers Union had focused
on the issue. She said she hopes the new study will accelerate
government efforts to curb pesticide use by farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But she also cautioned parents against overreacting to the
information by withholding produce or excessive scrubbing or
peeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern about pesticides relates to long-term exposure, as
opposed to the meal you eat tomorrow morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said she feeds her 2-year-old daughter apples. Peeling,
while reducing some pesticide exposure, can unnecessarily eliminate
the vitamin-rich skin, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union study analyzed 27,000 samples of domestic
and imported produce, including 27 foods. The researchers analyzed
the level of pesticides found on the foods, as well as how toxic
the chemicals were. Fresh American-grown peaches from 1995 got the
highest toxicity score, 5,376, due largely to the presence of the
chemical methyl parathion. That pesticide was identified by the EPA
late last year as posing an ``unacceptable risk'' as currently
used.
</P>
<P>
   In one chart prepared for the study, researchers showed the
likelihood that a serving of a particular fruit or vegetable would
expose a typical 5-year-old child, weighing 44 pounds, to an unsafe
daily amount of a pesticide, based on the new EPA guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study estimated that 77 percent of children of
that age and weight who ate US-grown winter squash from 1997 would
get more than the safe limit of pesticide as set by the new EPA
standards. The study estimated that 41 percent of such children
would ingest an unsafe amount of pesticide if they ate US peaches
from 1996, under the EPA standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest surprises'' of the study was the finding
that American-grown produce has as much, if not more, pesticide
residue than imported produce, Groth said.
</P>
<P>
   American-grown peaches, for example, had consistently high
levels of pesticides, including methyl parathion. The peaches from
Chile also had almost 10 times less, although the level was still
considered high.
</P>
<P>
   Groth urged consumers to wash produce carefully and consider
buying organically grown produce if possible. He noted that an
individual's risk of pesticide depends on age, susceptibility to
the effects of a compound, and how much is eaten relative to a
person's body size.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while spinach may not be on the top of his
list of recommendations, he thinks parents might consider telling
their children, ``Eat your broccoli.''

   The president was asked about whether Hillary Rodham Clinton

<P>
   ``I will be strongly supportive of whatever decision she makes
and will do all I can to help on this and any other decision, from
now on, just as she has helped me for the last 20-plus years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also added a word of caution, pointing out the
Senate election will not occur until November 2000. ``She has just
been through a very exhausting year, and there are circumstances
which have to be considered. And I think some time needs to be
taken here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice has been to take some time, get some rest, listen to
people on both sides of the argument, try and decide exactly what
you think is right to do, and whatever she decides, I'll be for,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments came a few hours after Mrs. Clinton had
a private meeting at the White House with Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat who announced in November that he
would not seek a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan afterward told The Associated Press that the numbers in
New York ``look very good for her,'' and that he would support her
if she ran, but that voting patterns and demographics in the state
were very ``complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials are pushing for Mrs. Clinton, whose
popularity has soared in the past year, to seek the nomination in
New York. But because candidates are expected to raise between $10
million and $20 million to run successfully, they are urging her to
announce soon _ something she has said she is not inclined to do.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton said she was giving a run ``serious
consideration.''

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS COURT HOLLYWOOD POWER BROKERS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Mass., N.J., Texas, Neb.) (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is putting together a
presidential campaign, dropped in on Hollywood this week for lunch
with Barry Diller and dinner with Michael Eisner. At the same time,
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is considering a White House bid,
mulled over the situation with Norman Lear.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore, who is definitely in the
presidential race, has been chatting over the phone and meeting the
trio of Democratic moguls running the entertainment company
Dreamworks: Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time again in Hollywood, when that mostly Democratic
community focuses on the potential presidential candidates who
troop in almost every week to gather support from the rich and
super-rich.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two of the super-rich, Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney
Co., and Diller, chairman of USA Networks, are teaming up for a
high-profile event on Thursday at the Coldwater Canyon home of
Diller. The two have invited leaders of the entertainment industry
and other businesses to meet former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
_ but not to contribute to his presidential campaign. The two
moguls are longtime friends of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the event is an early kick-off to Hollywood's
presidential sweepstakes, a sometimes serious, sometimes farcical
drama in which movie stars and candidates are often mirror images
of each other in terms of ego, vanity and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole relationship between Hollywood and Washington is as
natural as a marriage,'' said Lear, the television producer who
created such shows as ``All in the Family,'' and who is a longtime
advocate of liberal causes. ``We're basically in the same business.
We're coveting the audience's attention. We're all really looking
for affection and approval. And Washington's a company town and
we're a company town.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a town, of course, with deep pockets. In the 1996
presidential campaign, for example, three of the top Democratic
fund-raisers _ Geffen, Lou Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA
Inc., and Ron Burkle, the wealthy businessman _ and others raised
more than $8 million from the entertainment industry for President
Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But a more downbeat view about the Hollywood-Washington axis was
voiced by Steve Tisch, a producer of such movies as ``Forrest
Gump,'' and a big contributor to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being asked,'' said Tisch. ``All these charities
and political fund-raisers _ I have a list of solicitations on my
desk. If I responded to everyone, I'd be personally in Chapter 11.
It's enough! When I'm ready to write a check, I'll write a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner emphasized that, for Bradley, the event on Thursday would
not be a fund-raiser but a stage from which the former senator
could meet the town's power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is I'm not supporting anybody,'' said
Eisner, whose company, Disney, is the parent of ABC, ``because of
ABC News _ it would be inappropriate. We're going to try and
assemble people for all the reasonable candidates so our community
can be well informed _ we want to stimulate discussion on
meaningful subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner acknowledged that he was a good friend of Bradley's _ the
two met when Eisner went to Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and
Bradley attended nearby Princeton University. Eisner said he and
Diller, who has also known Bradley for years, had decided to
``reintroduce'' the presidential candidate to the show business
community _ or at least its leaders _ because Hollywood was
starting to focus on the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have Al Gore as well as Bill Bradley as well as
Bush and John McCain here,'' said Eisner, referring to Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas. ``Maybe they still only want to see us because of
the potential ability to raise funds, but that's not what Barry and
I are offering.''
</P>
<P>
   The event _ and others like it in Hollywood _ have definite
pitfalls for the candidates. An evening Diller arranged years ago
for Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., for example, misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lackluster speech with no energy _ the air went out
of the balloon,'' said a prominent producer who attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Diller said he was opening up his home to enliven
the presidential dialogue in Hollywood, especially among Democrats.
Without endorsing Bradley, Diller made it clear that, at this
stage, he believed it was ``unhealthy'' to assume that there was
only one Democratic candidate, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-horse race is unhealthy to me,'' said Diller, who is a
Democrat. ``I would like to see much more dialogue at this stage
than money positioning. The process is just much healthier if it's
not a process of acclamation but one where people can see
candidates and get enthusiastic or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller, like others in Hollywood, said he was weary of the
constant flow of political fund-raisers here for local, state and
national candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just get plucked like chickens,'' he said. ``It's our own
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Diller added, ``is simply a reaction to
the emptiness of the current retail political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bradley, a former basketball star for the New
York Knicks, has also been close to several other prominent
entertainment industry figures. They include one of the founders of
the powerful Creative Artists Agency and the former Disney
president, Michael Ovitz, and the director Sydney Pollack (``The
Way We Were,'' ``Out of Africa''), who friends said had advised the
candidate on loosening up his solemn speaking style and television
persona.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, Gore seems, by far, the front-runner in
Hollywood, as well as the entire state of California. As vice
president, Gore has visited California, with its 54 electoral
votes, and built up a substantial organization. California has
moved up its primary to join New York and eight other states on
March 7, 2000, just a few weeks after the Iowa caucuses and the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Hollywood constituency includes, among others, Geffen,
Spielberg and Katzenberg, who have met with him frequently, as well
as John Cooke, executive vice president of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood it's definitely Al Gore's to lose,'' said Marge
Tabankin, who formerly headed the Hollywood Women's Political
Committee, which has now disbanded. ``Gore has carefully built up
relationships over the last six years with many people in the
entertainment industry and people like him and respect him and
support him.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Republican side, which is not especially
strong in Hollywood, has been slow off the mark, largely because
donors and supporters seem to be waiting to hear whether Bush will
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's middle of the road and he can win,'' said Tom Strickler,
a partner at the Endeavor talent agency who is active in Republican
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans here _ and it is not clear whom they support _
include the actors Kevin Costner and Arnold Schwarzennegger.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the presidential race, people active in politics here
have become motivated to defeat House Republican floor leaders and
other lawmakers who sought Clinton's impeachment and removal from
office. Lear's organization, People for the American Way, has begun
a group, Recall 2000, that will, in his words, ``work on a
grass-roots level to defeat, among others, the 13 House managers''
in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, a prominent Democratic political consultant in Los
Angeles, said the campaign to wrest control of the House from
Republicans and defeat impeachment leaders only increased the need
for more money from Hollywood. . ``The entertainment industry has
generally focused on presidential candidates and Senate candidates,
big names like Teddy Kennedy, Dianne Feinstein, Bill Bradley,''
Carrick said. ``The House has always been given short shrift. It
doesn't have as many stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment aftermath, Carrick said, has ``riveted this
community and they want to get the Democrats back in the House
majority.'' The result, he added, was that there was now intense
competition for Hollywood money not only among presidential and
Senate candidates, but also among House candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole new player on the block,'' Carrick said.

MICROSOFT TRIES TO SHOW THAT IT DIDN'T BULLY COMPAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Burned by a searing cross-examination of a senior
Compaq Computer Corp. executive, Microsoft Corp. and Compaq tried
Friday to regain ground in federal court, though they may have
helped the government as much as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the Microsoft trial on Thursday, David Boies, the
government's lead trial lawyer, used documents from Compaq's files
to portray Compaq, the world's largest maker of personal computers,
as a fearful vassal of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In one case emphasized by Boies, an internal document showed
that Compaq executives had worried in 1996 about retaliation from
Microsoft for their decision to use another company's operating
system for hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, wrote
Compaq a letter congratulating the company for instead choosing
Microsoft's product, later known as Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, when Rick Pepperman, a Microsoft lawyer, got a chance to
question the witness, John T. Rose, a Compaq senior vice president,
he displayed a memo that had circulated within Compaq after the
Gates letter had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It reassured employees that Compaq still had the right to use
another company's software if Microsoft was unable to deliver its
product, ``while keeping our relationship with Microsoft intact.''
(In the end, Compaq never produced the hand-held computer.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft held high hopes for Rose's testimony. He is the only
witness Microsoft recruited from a computer company, and last
November, Gates wrote to ``thank Rose for all his trips to Seattle
and his willingness to distract a lot of time for the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Rose's mission was to counter testimony by executives of
Apple Computer and IBM Corp. who, in testimony for the prosecution
last year, portrayed Microsoft as a monopolist and an industry
bully.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was, at best, only partly successful in his mission. Boies
showed Thursday that numerous employees who reported to Rose at
Compaq both feared and hated Microsoft. But on the stand Friday,
Rose insisted: ``They have a view on some points that doesn't
represent the corporate strategy. As a director of the company, I
have that strategy. I know what it is.'' Compaq's relationship with
Microsoft has been ``bumpy,'' he said, ``but always focused on
benefiting customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Friday's questions dealt with the central assertion
of Rose's written testimony: that Microsoft's threat in 1996 to
stop selling the Windows operating system to Compaq _ an act that
could have been a fatal blow to the company _ was a result of ``a
communications breakdown'' within Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that the threat was made because Compaq
was featuring products from Netscape Communications Corp. on its
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose said that the real problem was that while one part of
his company had removed icons for Internet Explorer and the
Microsoft Network from computer screens to meet the terms of a
contract with America Online &UR; , &LR;  another part was working out an
agreement with Microsoft not to tamper with the icons.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperman, the Microsoft lawyer, presented documents showing
that America Online was in fact trying to enforce a contract
requiring Compaq to remove the icons. And he also offered evidence
intended to show that Compaq executives did not believe that their
agreement with Microsoft prevented them from installing Netscape on
their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies displayed a deposition taken from Celeste Dunn, who
was in charge of buying software for Compaq. She said senior
Microsoft officials had been informed of the decision to remove the
icons in advance and did not object or indicate that it violated
any agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said he did not doubt the accuracy of her testimony,
leaving the contradiction unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Compaq did stop installing Netscape on its
computers, at least for a while. Rose said that ``there were
compatibility problems that eventually Netscape cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boies, when he got another turn with Rose, presented
excerpts from a 1997 deposition in which a Compaq executive stated
that the company had stopped installing Netscape because Microsoft
had begun including a browser in the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mention anything about compatibility problems,
does it?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Rose said, though he also noted that Compaq
does install Netscape in its computers today.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also released the direct written testimony of Eric
Engstrom, a general manager in the Web Essentials division of the
Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, he tries to refute the testimony of an
Apple Computer executive and others who contended that Microsoft
tried to sabotage Apple's QuickTime multimedia software. Engstrom
will take the stand sometime next week.

UCLA HIRES FOOTBALL ASSISTANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has hired John Pearce as an assistant coach
in charge of defensive ends. He replaces defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti, who Friday accepted a similar post with Oregon after one
tumultuous year at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti's young defense struggled throughout the season,
yielding 28 points per game, and he was publicly criticized by
Bruins coach Bob Toledo after the Oregon State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The criticism) obviously had an effect,'' said Aliotti, who
is close friends with Ducks coach Mike Bellotti. ``I'd be lying if
I said it didn't. You need to go to work every day and feel good
about yourself and the people you're around. That situation was not
there. I just didn't feel I had the support.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has not named a defensive coordinator. A source said
linebackers coach Marc Dove and secondary coach Bob Field are the
leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce was an assistant coach at Texas A&AMP;M during Toledo's
tenure (1989-93) as offensive coordinator.

MIKE JUDGE DRAWS FROM OBSERVATION OF PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(For use Sunday, Feb. 21 or thereafter) 
 
  
By MARLA MATZER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR; _  &LR; Mike Judge can't wait to go home. The creator of
TV's animated ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head'' and ``King of the Hill'' has
flown in from his home in Austin, Texas, for a half-day of
interviews at the 20th Century Fox lot in Los Angeles. He's here to
promote ``Office Space,'' his first live-action feature film. But
fidgeting in a publicist's office, with his packed-and-ready duffel
bag sitting a couple of feet away, it's clear that he'd rather be
almost anywhere than Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for us, Judge hasn't lost touch with the real world.
``Office Space,'' an office satire-cum-industrial espionage story,
is full of the kind of small observations of humanity that have
earned Judge an admiring audience for his animated work over the
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Judge was even able to persuade Fox to let him shoot the movie
in Austin, which, he figured, could easily double for just about
anywhere else. ``I noticed that office parks, wherever they were
situated, all have the same look to them,'' Judge says, ``And
that's what I was going for: an `Anytown, USA.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Judge's attention to detail, the whole production
has a ring of authenticity. He insisted that the fictional
Initech's beige cubicles not look like an overdone Hollywood set.
Judge admits he likes to do things his way, that collaboration
isn't his strong suit. The upside of that for his fans is a sense
of cohesion to his work: those who enjoy ``Beavis'' and ``King''
will see those same sensibilities at work in ``Office Space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a lot of me in everything I do,'' says
Judge, who voices _ and slightly resembles _ a number of his
animated characters, including ``King of the Hill's'' Hank Hill.
``There's also a lot of people I've met (incorporated into the
characters). A lot of your inspiration, you don't even realize at
the time where it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   For the man who brought you the moronic mayhem of ``Beavis &AMP;
Butt-head,'' Judge is more thoughtful and low-key than you might
expect. He takes time with his answers, often cocking his head to
one side and speaking in a slow baritone. Wearing jeans, tennis
shoes and an untucked sports shirt, the 36-year-old Judge looks
like any dad at a Saturday soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space,'' which hit theaters Friday, originated as an
animated short. The crudely drawn cartoon had only two characters,
the put-upon Milton and his oily, mealy-mouthed boss, Bill
Lumbergh. The basic plot is: Lumbergh tells Milton they'll need to
store boxes in his office/ask him to go home early to save the
company money/or some other indignity, while Milton makes
under-his-breath complaints and threats. If ``Dilbert'' is a shared
giggle about workplace foibles, ``Office Space'' is a primal
scream.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the shorts were eventually made, being shown at
animation festivals and on TV's ``Saturday Night Live'' and Comedy
Central. Judge says he realized only after creating two of the
shorts where the character of Milton originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was riding the bus all the time in college, there used
to be this guy from the VA hospital, who had the whole bus schedule
memorized,'' Judge recalls with a laugh. ``He'd complain about the
bus being two minutes late. He was always complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of California, San Diego _
and spending a brief stint as a cubicle dweller, working for an
aerospace company _ Judge decided to become a musician, stressing
this was a real job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have often made it sound like I was playing in garage
bands,'' he says, ``but I'm actually a pretty practical person. For
me, playing music was a way to make money without working in a
cubicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing stand-up bass with such artists as Texas blues guitarist
Anson Funderbergh, Judge started subconsciously harking back to the
malcontent at the bus stop to relieve the stress of touring. ``We'd
get someplace, and they hadn't given us what they were supposed to
give us. And I'd start muttering about burning the place down,''
Judge says.
</P>
<P>
   Judge even considered playing Milton himself, though he opted
instead for a cameo role as a dumb restaurant manager who
constantly berates Joanna, played by ``Friends'' star Jennifer
Aniston. You won't recognize Judge _ he's in full disguise _ and
you won't see his name on the credits. The actor is credited as
William King.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Milton was more grounded in reality is one reason
Judge says he was able to imagine ``Office Space'' as a live-action
movie. It was a different story when there was early talk of making
``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head'' with real actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people first started talking about doing a live-action
`Beavis &AMP; Butt-head' movie, it was only a week or so after the show
first aired, I wasn't going to close the door on anything back
then, because I thought the show was going to be over in a few
weeks,'' Judge says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the more I thought about it,'' he continues, ``the more I
was imagining the reality of getting a couple of 14-year-olds in
there ... It just didn't seem to make sense. Also, `Beavis &AMP;
Butt-head' is also a little more over the top, and its voices are a
little further from reality than `Office Space.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reports that a sequel to the hit animated movie
``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head Do America'' is imminent, Judge says the
project is ``a long ways away.'' For now, Judge is concentrating on
``King'' and on developing other potential projects under an
overall deal with Fox. He says though there's been ``a little''
talk of a ``King of the Hill'' movie, there are as yet no definite
plans. ```King of the Hill' (the TV show) worked out so well, I'm
really enjoying it,'' Judge says. ``It just feels now like one of
those shows where you just want to check in with the characters
every week or two, and see how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As to movies vs. TV, Judge says he has little preference, though
the grass always seems to be greener on the other side when he's
hard at work. ``I guess when I'm doing TV, I want to do movies, and
when I'm doing movies, I want to do TV,'' Judge says with a
smile. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

U.S. PLAYED KEY ROLE IN CAPTURE OF KURD REBEL, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By TIM WEINER    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States worked for four months to help
Turkey arrest Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, U.S.
officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomatic pressure backed by intelligence gathering helped
to put Ocalan in flight from a safe haven in Syria, to persuade
nation after nation to refuse him sanctuary and to drive him into
an increasingly desperate search for a city of refuge, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a government tried to figure out where he was, where he
was going and how we might bring him to justice,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Turkey, the U.S. government, whose involvement in Ocalan's
capture was reported on Friday by The Los Angeles Times, considers
Ocalan a terrorist. He leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has
waged a violent campaign against Turkey for 15 years, seeking
autonomy for the Kurdish people. Some 37,000 people have died in
that fight.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has an increasingly close military and
intelligence relationship with Turkey, a NATO ally that lets U.S.
pilots fly missions against Iraq from a NATO base in Incirlik. That
military post also serves as an electronic-eavesdropping station
for U.S. intelligence to spy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's arrest on Monday led to angry protests by Kurdish
demonstrators, who attacked Greek consulates and embassies across
Europe and tried to storm the Israeli Consulate in Berlin on the
strength of rumors that Greece and Israel had been involved in his
capture. So far, the United States has not been a target of their
anger, although the State Department urged Americans traveling
overseas to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Ocalan had been on the run _ from Syria to Italy
to Russia to Greece. He finally landed in the Greek Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya, on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It was a poor choice of hideouts. More than 100 U.S.
intelligence officers and law-enforcement agents, along with Kenyan
security officials, are in Nairobi investigating the terrorist
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, which took 213 lives in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Members of that team quickly discovered that Ocalan had arrived
in Nairobi, U.S. officials said. They placed the Greek Embassy
under surveillance and monitored Ocalan's cell phone conversations,
while he placed calls to political contacts, seeking sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite American insistence in the last few days that the United
States had no ``direct involvement'' in the Ocalan case, the
surveillance information gave Turkish commandos the chance to
capture Ocalan with the help of Kenyan security officers, the
officials said. The Turkish prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, said
Friday that a Turkish commando team flew to Nairobi after receiving
a tip from another country, which he would not identify. The
commandos captured Ocalan after he agreed to be driven to the
Nairobi airport by a Kenyan security officer working with the
Turkish squad.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a long journey, one that U.S. diplomatic and
intelligence officers monitored closely. From October onward, as
Ocalan sought shelter in Russia, across Europe and in Africa, U.S.
diplomats and intelligence officers sought to cut off his escape
routes, according to officials here.
</P>
<P>
   They warned their European and Russian counterparts of the
consequences of sheltering Ocalan, saying, ``If you've got him,
what are you going to do with him?'' according to the senior U.S.
official, who demanded anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan had spent much of the last 15 years in Damascus, Syria.
In October, Turkey stepped up pressure on the Syrian government to
expel him, threatening military action. The United States issued a
parallel but private demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9, Syria put Ocalan on a plane to Moscow. Israeli
intelligence monitored his departure from Damascus, officials said.
But the Israeli role in the Ocalan case did not involve trapping
him in Nairobi, according to U.S. officials, who would be unlikely
to reveal such a role if it existed. Israel has taken pains to deny
playing any part in his capture, including a rare statement from
its foreign intelligence service, the Mossad.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, after a month seeking a political base in Europe,
Ocalan flew from Moscow to Rome and into the hands of the Italian
authorities, who held him on a German warrant charging him with
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a good deal of time working with Italy and Germany
and Turkey to find a creative way to bring him to justice,'' the
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But none was found. Germany dropped the charge, fearing the
kinds of protests and riots that have erupted since his arrest.
Italy was loath to turn Ocalan over to Turkey, where he could face
a death sentence for treason.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan left Italy secretly on Jan. 16, flying to St. Petersburg,
Russia, then seeking a way back into another European country,
officials said. He found one on Jan. 30, when he flew to Athens,
Greece, in a private plane obtained by Andonis Naxakis, a retired
military officer who, like many of his countrymen, sympathizes with
the Kurdish cause, according to Greek officials.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Feb. 1, Greek officials, uneasy with the
fugitive on their hands, told him to try flying to the Netherlands,
where he believed he could seek a hearing at the International
Court of Justice. The Dutch authorities barred his plane, so Ocalan
returned to Greece. The next day, he flew with a Greek official and
four aides to Nairobi, where the Greek government had agreed to
shelter him temporarily at its embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The American and Kenyan intelligence and law-enforcement team in
Nairobi quickly detected Ocalan's presence and reported it to
Turkey, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After two tense weeks in the Greek Embassy, Ocalan was told he
could fly to Amsterdam, Netherlands. He got into a jeep driven by a
Kenyan security officer, supposedly bound for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got into the car on his own, he looked worried,'' his
interpreter, Nucan Derya, told Reuters, the news agency, on Friday.
``I think he understood that there was something dangerous going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   His instincts were good: the Kenyan driver delivered him into
the arms of the Turkish commando team. He is now being held for
interrogation and trial on a Turkish island in the Sea of Marmara.

WHITAKER TO FACE DEFLATED TRINIDAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pernell Whitaker doesn't want to see much of Felix
Trinidad Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Fortunately for
him, he won't have to.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad staggered into Friday's weigh-in for Saturday night's
IBF welterweight title fight a half hour late looking gaunt and
worried. For weeks rumors had swirled that the IBF champion was
battling to get down to the 147-pound limit, something that had
been giving him trouble even before a 10-month layoff that will
finally come to an end against the elusive Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are as much a part of boxing as right hands however and
most of the time they are lies or pipedreams, so it was easy enough
to discount them until Trinidad showed up at a Wednesday press
conference in Manhatta looking like a guy fighting for the super
welterweight (154 pound) title rather than someone ready to defend
the welterweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was that Trinidad was still in the mid-150s three
days before the biggest fight of his life and the fact that he was
reportedly holding closed-door, three- to four-hour workouts last
week when most fighters wind down their schedule only fueled this
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show up a half-hour late for the weigh-in, it ain't a
psych job,'' said long-time New York boxing manager and booking
agent Johnny Bos Friday. ``You show up a half hour late it's 'cause
you didn't make it (on time).''
</P>
<P>
   A clearly dried out Trinidad finally did hit 147, as promoter
Don King promised he would, but by the time that happened whispers
had begun to grow among guys who wear the wide-brimmed hats and
smoke big cigars that the 35-year-old Whitaker was no longer a
sacrificial 4-1 underlamb but now a live underdog in his first
fight in nearly 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker had never doubted that, even before the 26-year-old
champion began to fight the battle of the bulge. He never doubted
it even after he twice tested positive for drugs, tests that
resulted in his being suspended for a year and left without a fight
since defeating Andre Pestriaev on Oct. 17, 1997 at Foxwoods, the
same night he failed the first of those tests.
</P>
<P>
   To Whitaker, the fighting has always been the easy part of his
job, dating back to his winning of an Olympic gold medal in 1984.
His defensive mastery has led him to a 42-2-1 record in which both
losses and the draw were widely (and rightly) disputed and it has
prevented him not only from ever taking a beating but has saved him
from something even more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Pete has ever been hit by a combination,'' said
his Olympic teammate and long-time friend, Evander Holyfield,
shaking his head in amazement. ``He's been blessed with remarkable
skills. It's a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a gift some say he has abused recently after long-ago
winning titles as a lightweight, junior welterweight, welterweight
and super welterweight during an often brilliant 14-year career.
Even Whitaker seemed to acknowledge that recently in his own way,
while still vehemently denying that he ever had a drug problem
despite the failed tests and a 30-day stint in rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who beats Pernell Whitaker is Pernell
Whitaker,'' Whitaker said while relaxing in his hotel suite, ``but
I'm not a drug user. I'm not a drug addict. I never took drugs
before a fight. I don't have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've done is down on paper. I'm happy with my 13 years in
boxing so if the tools aren't there on Feb. 20, I won't do this
again. If it's not there, I know it won't be there the next time
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Whitaker believes it will be there at Madison Square Garden
as it always has been. The speed, the elusiveness, the annoying
ability to break an opponent down without hitting him, the gifts
Holyfield spoke of. They will all be there, he believes, whether
Felix Trinidad is fit or fat.
</P>
<P>
   And if they are, he points out, the rest is already set in
stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hoping to do what everybody else has been trying to do
for so long and that's put me on the canvas,'' Whitaker said. ``But
he didn't want to come to me. He didn't want to fight Pernell
Whitaker. He had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed a fight like this but he didn't want to get in with
me because every fight I've competed in I was the winner. People
know there's no way that kid (Oscar) De La Hoya beat me (in a close
decision that cost Whitaker his WBC welterweight title nearly two
years ago but which many at ringside disputed). He hung in there
but I was in control the whole fight. I put my hands on him many
times. I knocked him down. It was my title and I lost it like that?
No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Trinidad watched that fight and thinks he can knock me out,
somebody needs to tap him on the shoulder and wake him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad (33-0, 29 KOs) is hoping someone will have to wake up
the aging Whitaker instead, as they have had to do to so many of
his other opponents yet he also knows he has his own Achilles heel
and it is not at his waistline. if Whitaker has a self-inflicted
nose problem he is denying after testing positive for cocaine,
Trinidad has a documented chin problem that has resulted in his
being knocked down six times, coincidentally always in Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker has only 17 knockouts and is anything but a power
puncher so a knockout of even a weakened Trinidad seems unlikely,
but he doesn't need punching power to win. Whitaker needs only
still be Sweet Pea for one more night to do that because if he is
he's still deadly to any welterweight, fat or thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My defense is my offense,'' Whitaker explained. ``Ain't nobody
can do what I do. After 12 rounds, you don't ever want to see
Pernell Whitaker again. I mess them up mentally more than
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to break them down mentally. They can't hit me. They get
frustrated. They make mistakes. They get hit. They still can't hit
me. It don't make any difference how long it takes. I get to them.
I'll get to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare his record (of opponents) to mine. This kid has been
hit and down FLAT ON HIS FACE! This boy don't want to see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night he will have no choice. He will see Pernell
Whitaker and have to chase him with a body already weakened from
chasing off nearly 20 pounds of fat in two months. He will chase
him intent on knocking him out. If he does, Felix Trinidad will
move to the top of the ranks of welterweights, even eclipsing De La
Hoya's stirring victory over Ike Quartey just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Pernell Whitaker believes Felix Trinidad will only get to do
half that job. He'll only get to chase him...chase him until he
drops.

   CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM
</P>
<P>
   TO: ART MIMIC, PRESIDENT, WORLDWIDE PICTURES
</P>
<P>
   FROM: JOHN D. RIVATIVE, VICE PRESIDENT, DEVELOPMENT
</P>
<P>
   RE: TV-BASED MOVIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've given some thought to our conversation yesterday. Yes, the
number of available TV series we can turn into movie franchises is
dwindling. The fact that ``My Favorite Martian'' is playing in
theaters right now is proof of that. But there are still some good
titles out there. Look at the play Warner Bros. is getting for
``The Wild, Wild West.'' The way it's being hyped, you'd think
they'd discovered gold or something. But any studio could have had
it! We could have had it!
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, Art, there's still more gold in them thar hills.
Just look at the list of titles we have in development, waiting for
the green light. Let's do lunch soon and discuss!!!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hogan's Heroes: &LR;  OK, I know the PC police have come down hard
on this one what with its wacky Nazis and stuff. But what if we
totally reimagine the show a la ``The Brady Bunch Movie''? See if
you follow this: Private Ryan (Matt Damon) gets captured and sent
to Stalag 13. And he doesn't appreciate the cavalier attitude that
Hogan (Mel Gibson?) and the other prisoners have toward the
Germans. Tensions explode when Ryan refuses to give Sgt. Schultz a
bite of his strudel. Eventually, Ryan follows his conscience and
escapes, leaving behind Hogan and his archaic ways. Bonus: Patrick
Stewart has already signed on to play Col. Klink!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C &LR; .: I know, I know, another war movie. But,
hey, they're hot. Look at ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Thin Red
Line.'' Here we take two guys who just can't get along _ bumbling,
naive Pyle and his gruff nemesis, Sgt. Carter _ and put them in the
middle of some kind of Gulf War conflict. Faster than you can say
``semper fi'' these guys develop a grudging, mutual respect for
each other as they battle an evil Arab dictator and his cadre of
terrorists. Nicolas Cage wants to play Gomer, and if we get him, I
think Nick Nolte will come on board as Sgt. Carter. Sha-zam!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I Dream of Jeannie: &LR;  One of several (hundred) teen-oriented
projects in development. When high school senior Tony Nelson
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) opens a mysterious bottle he finds buried on
campus, he unleashes a sexy, spunky genie (Sarah Michelle Gellar)
eager to grant his every wish. Needless to say, this doesn't go
over to well with Tony's jealous girlfriend (Rose McGowan), who
conspires to put Jeannie in her place _ and back in her bottle!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The $25,000 Pyramid Scheme &LR; : Dick Clark has been pushing this
project about a slimy Amway salesman (Alan Rickman) who leads his
unsuspecting followers into a shady deal involving defective
Chinese satellites. A plucky federal agent (we're angling for Demi
Moore) arrives just in time to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Green Acres &LR; : When the president of the United States (Michael
Douglas) is voted out of office, he decides to get back to nature
and buys a farm outside of a town intriguingly named Hooterville.
His wife (Joan Allen) has a hard time adjusting to the rural
lifestyle, though, and eventually leaves him to run for a Senate
opening in New York. The president soon follows, after coming to
the sad realization that Hooterville's female denizens aren't quite
as bodacious as he thought they would be.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WKRP in Cincinnati &LR; : Howard Stern plays a shock jock who sets
up shop at a conservative midwest radio station full of quirky
characters. Among them: a right-wing newsman, Les Nessman (Joe
Pesci), who repeatedly clashes with Howard's in-your-face style,
and a couple of lesbians _ secretary Jennifer (Pamela Anderson Lee)
and assistant Bailey Quarters (Jennifer Love Hewitt) _ who always
seem to be disrobing for no apparent reason. With Billy Bob
Thornton as Dr. Johnny Fever.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Andy Griffith Show &LR;   &UR; Movie &LR; : Sheriff Andy Taylor presides
over the small town of Mayberry with a gentle hand and a loving
heart. That changes when a drug cartel takes over Floyd's barber
shop and starts selling crack out of the back room. And to top it
all, they use Andy's son, sweet little Opie (code name: Opium ...
Jonathan Lipnicki), as an unsuspecting drug runner. When Andy finds
out what's going on, he rolls up his sleeves and proceeds to kick
some serious butt. With Jackie Chan playing Andy and Chris Tucker
as his smart aleck sidekick, Barney Fife. Andy Griffith may make a
cameo appearance as Otis, the town drunk who now must confront
demons more powerful than Jim Beam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Waltons &LR; : James Cameron directs this futuristic tale of a
close-knit family that operates a space station orbiting Saturn.
When John Boy (James Van Der Beek) intercepts a message from
marauding aliens hell-bent on destroying the galaxy, the family
kicks into action, enlisting the help of a sympathetic Saturnite
couple (Jenna Elfman, David Arquette) along the way. Budgeted just
shy of $750 million, most of the movie will be filmed in actual
outer space, as per stipulations in Cameron's contract.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ _ Friday morning, as U.S. monitors of
Kosovo's fragile cease-fire prepared to pull out of Yugoslavia
before the Saturday deadline for a peace settlement, a Yugoslav
MiG-21 flew a low barrel-roll over the Americans' headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The MiG was no more than 500 feet above the roof of the Hotel
Herzegovina in Kosovo Polje, just outside Pristina. ``It's just a
`Hi, how are ya? We know you're there,' from Milosevic,'' a U.S.
diplomat said, once the noise faded.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, pondered the
West's threat of air strikes and rebuffed a visit from a U.S.
envoy, Christopher Hill, U.S. and Western diplomatic and aid
workers began to leave Yugoslavia in preparation for potential NATO
bombing in the event the Kosovo peace effort fails.
</P>
<P>
   In an anxious Belgrade, citizens went about their normal
business. But a senior Western official said the situation was
becoming dicey, ``and the prospect for bombing is taking on a kind
of momentum, especially from the Americans.'' He said Milosevic
``appeared to be unsure of what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing is not expected immediately after the deadline expires,
another senior diplomat said, but could follow within a day or two,
and he did not rule out a visit here on Saturday morning from the
British and French foreign ministers, Robin Cook and Hubert
Vedrine, possibly joined by a reluctant U.S. secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Western diplomatic staff prepared to leave Belgrade
on Saturday in a coordinated departure intended to underscore the
seriousness of the threat _ and to avoid possible retaliation or
hostage-taking from angry mobs or the police if bombing does occur.
</P>
<P>
   In what the U.S. Embassy called an ``authorized departure,''
meaning the paid travel out of Yugoslavia for most dependents and
nonessential embassy workers, about 65 percent of the staff were
ready to leave on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive equipment and files have already been moved out or
packed, and the top U.S. diplomat in Belgrade, Richard Miles, on
Friday visited Yugoslav officials to remind them of their
obligations to protect foreign diplomats and embassy buildings
under the Vienna conventions.
</P>
<P>
   All official U.S. personnel in Kosovo, including the six or so
diplomatic personnel still attached to the American Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, left, mostly for the short drive to
Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by large numbers of aid workers from
international agencies like the International Rescue Committee and
Catholic Relief Services, easily recognizable in the big white
four-wheel drive vehicles that normally crowd Kosovo's narrow
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The aid agencies were leaving skeleton staffs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Information Service office in Pristina was empty except
for security guards, and its office in Montenegro was also closed.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. diplomats had said it would send ``the wrong signal''
to leave before the Saturday deadline passed, they were ordered to
do so anyway.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday night, the monitors of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe held an evacuation exercise, packing
their bags and leaving the dreary, Soviet-style Grand Hotel in
Pristina, then returning less than an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,200 or so monitors had worked normally Friday across
Kosovo, and officials of the OSCE said they were still hopeful that
a deal would be struck between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians
in the peace talks. The foreign monitors are reluctant to leave,
believing that they provide a measure of protection to the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo from Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Serbian forces were more in evidence in Kosovo, in an
apparent show of force, similar to the MiG barrel roll.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Canadian diplomatic families packed into cars and
headed for Budapest, the Hungarian capital. The Canadians were
leaving their visa office open, however. Staff in the Dutch Embassy
left, as did the nonessential British staff and the families of
British diplomats. Ordinary Western citizens were advised by their
embassies to leave Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar drawdown in October, when NATO also
threatened to bomb Serbia. That threat was defused by an agreement
between Milosevic and Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy. But
Serbian violations of that agreement, including killings of ethnic
Albanian civilians, have brought this latest crisis to a more
decisive moment, with Kosovo's future hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians on the streets of Pristina on Friday expressed
concern about Serbian retaliation against them in the event of NATO
strikes, especially if no Western observers are in place to at
least witness what happens.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, there was more fatigue with Milosevic's endless
diplomatic games and crisis manipulation. ``Most people think the
West is serious and Milosevic will deal,'' said Lubisha Ivanovic,
who had just returned from a week in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be okay so long as Kosovo doesn't secede,'' he
said. ``As we say, Serbs will do anything for Kosovo except live
there.'' He suggested that the Serbian reaction, if there is
bombing, might be vocal but not so widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know that NATO doesn't want to bomb ordinary Serbs,''
he said. ``But a lot of people also feel that this is our internal
problem and foreigners have no business here. That's the string
Milosevic is playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, on state television, Milosevic did play that
string, telling a visiting Cypriot delegation: ``Threats of
bombarding our country if it does not allow foreign occupation of
its territory should be a warning for the whole world. This should
be a warning for everyone who cares about peace and freedom.''

   With no sales to speak of, a long string of losses and a tiny
market capitalization of $70.3 million, Imaginon Inc. is not the

   On the Internet, however, Imaginon is something of a celebrity.

   In December and January, Imaginon postings on the Yahoo Finance
board went from a few dozen a week to a few dozen a day to a few
dozen an hour, with daily trading volume climbing from near zero to
its current average of 1.84 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   As stock message boards grow in popularity _ well over 30,000
messages are posted on the four largest boards on a typical day _
pressure is mounting on several fronts to rid the boards of people
who use them to illegally tout stocks and spread false information.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has defined such touting
as lying about companies, lying about one's independence from a
company or failing to adequately disclose the nature, source and
amount of compensation one receives from a company.
</P>
<P>
   As talk about Imaginon grew on the message boards, fueled by a
reverse acquisition the company completed on Jan. 20, its stock
price shot up, from 41 cents a share in October to a high of $15.25
in intraday trading on Jan. 26; the stock closed at $5.75 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the Jerry Springer show _ it's gotten out of
hand,'' said David M. Schwartz, chief executive of Imaginon, who
attributes the volatility to the message-board chatter.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Schwartz posts his own messages on Yahoo's
board. Using the name IMON---2nd and identifying himself as the
chief executive, he says he tries to dispel the many rumors about
the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of January, only days after Schwartz had dismissed a
rumor that the company had inked a deal with America Online,
someone using the name G---Gekko---1999 logged on, inquiring
whether anyone had heard that Barron's, the financial weekly, was
predicting that the stock would hit $225 a share. (Barron's
wasn't.)
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said he worried that the rumors and volatility were
scaring away long-term investors. ``Our stock has been all over the
map, and that doesn't do us any good in the long run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in such concerns. To track down flagrant abusers
of the message boards, the SEC is increasing the number of
subpoenas it issues to board operators, allowing it to try to tie a
posting to an E-mail address. Though the commission declined to say
how many subpoenas it was issuing, board operators say that they
have become much more frequent and that the SEC is requiring a
quicker response.
</P>
<P>
   Companies fearing possible stock manipulation have raised their
own complaints with securities regulators and board operators. But
executives at the four largest boards _ Yahoo Finance, Silicon
Investor, the Motley Fool and the Raging Bull _ worry that in the
frenzy to eliminate abuse, legitimate investors will face
restrictions on what they can say on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who looks at the boards knows that there's some
manipulation involved,'' said Ethan Caldwell, the general counsel
for Go2net Inc., the Seattle-based parent of Silicon Investor,
whose boards average 15,000 postings a day. ``It's a double-edged
sword, because the boards are a unique medium where the average
investor can find out information. The flip side is that the stocks
are subject to manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But distinguishing between manipulation and the innocuous
musings of an enthusiastic investor can be difficult. Though rules
vary from board to board, few messages are ever removed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the four largest board providers, only the Motley
Fool even monitors its boards, never mind screen them for accuracy,
which all four regard as impossible. Instead, the board providers
rely heavily on self-policing, with participants complaining to the
board operator and the SEC when they think someone is trying to
manipulate a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to censor to deal with a few kooks,''
said John Scheibel, the director of government relations for Yahoo,
who likens its role to that of a post office, where information is
simply distributed.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the 8,445 message boards of Yahoo Finance _
each devoted to a particular stock _ receive tens of thousands of
messages. William C. Martin, a founder of Raging Bull, added, ``We
don't want to be fact-checkers.'' Since starting in June, the
service has seen the number of messages triple, to 6,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem lies in the anonymity provided by the
message boards. With little effort, people can create several
identities on the boards and keep changing their names, often
bouncing from board to board. If someone is suspected of
manipulating a stock on a board, the SEC can issue subpoenas, but
even if it can obtain a user's real e-mail address, investigators
must still match the user's postings to sales activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get a cheap stock, they have to manipulate it, and
the best way to manipulate it is to quickly spread false
information,'' said Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement at
the commission, describing its Internet surveillance as ``one of
the highest priorities.'' During a single day in October, in its
first sweep in this area, the commission filed 23 enforcement
actions against 44 individuals accused of touting stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the SEC said the commission would also
investigate message-board users who spread negative rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement actions can include formal charges, fines and bans
on future trading. The SEC can sue in federal court or bring an
administrative proceeding; in either case, the accused can mount a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the October action, complaints to the SEC about
message-board activity rose from about 120 a day to as many as 400,
then receded to about 200 to 300. About 120 investigators actively
surf the Internet, looking for abuse on the message boards, Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and most companies tend to ignore so-called chat rooms _
which can also be filled with rumors _ because the real-time talk
on such sites is quickly erased. ``We consider the worst threat the
posting on the bulletin boards, because it stays up there virtually
forever,'' said Michael D. Allison, chief executive of
International Business Research in Princeton, N.J., a corporate
investigations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are at a loss as to how to respond. But last
October, Medinah Energy Inc., a tiny mining company based in Lake
Elsinore, Calif., took the unusual step of suing people who posted
disparaging messages about the company. The suit contended that
they had made ``false and defamatory statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit listed the on-line pseudonyms of the authors, since
actual names or other identifying characteristics were unknown,
according to Michael Morrison, Medinah's lawyer. As a result, he
said, he is not sure where the suit will go next. But filing it
stemmed the flow of message-board chatter.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies try to press their cases with the SEC John Stark,
director of Internet enforcement for the commission, said the
number of calls from corporate investor-relations officials about
message boards has gone from several a month to several a day. Some
companies appeal directly to the message boards, though they are
rarely successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a ton of requests from corporate officers and even
corporate counsel to remove messages,'' said Caldwell of Go2Net.
``And we tell them in as nice a way as we can that we have no way
of knowing if the information is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said his own postings have not kept rumors off the
board. A few days after asking whether the stock would jump,
G---Gekko---1999 was back on, asking whether the company was really
teaming up with a major Internet service provider _ another false
rumor.``I'm going to continue to post, but I haven't seen any real
effect,'' Schwartz said.

 &HT;    DeKalb budget revives libraries, pool
 &HT;    By Ben Smith III
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeKalb County commissioners have reached a budget deal that
could reopen closed libraries and prevent a swimming pool and a
recreation center from closing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the now-closed Embry Hills and Hairston
Crossing neighborhood libraries would be reopened and Sunday
service for three other libraries will be restored. Meanwhile, the
Murphey Candler Pool in north DeKalb would open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two staff positions have been restored to the Hamilton
Recreation Center in Scottdale, and county officials have pledged
to find funds to repair the gym floor so that the center will stay
open.
</P>
<P>
   The DeKalb commission is scheduled to vote on the 1999 budget on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about it,'' said Commissioner Gale
Walldorff. ``We did work with the administration (of Chief
Executive Officer Liane Levetan), and everybody had to give a
little bit to come up with the bottom line at the end of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission and Levetan had been fighting over $12 million in
sales tax funding slated for road improvement projects that the CEO
wanted to use to balance the 1999 budget. Most commissioners had
argued that sales tax money and the interest collected from it
should only be used for public improvement projects, not county
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, sales tax funding will be kept out of the
budget. But commissioners relented on using interest on sales tax
funds, estimated to reach $5.5 million by the end of year.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with a half percent across-the-board cut for county
departments, the cutting of many unfilled positions and a lower
estimate of what it will cost the county to fund a 100 percent
homestead exemption on property taxes that will be financed with
sales tax money, helped make up for most of the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cut the sales tax revenue from the general
budget ``was probably the right thing to do because the budget is
going to be tight next year,'' said Commissioner Ken Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who chairs the budget committee added: ``Cutting $10
million to $12 million now, will make it easier next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But county parks officials say it may not be easier for them. By
offering to spend $100,000 on a new liner for the decaying but
popular Murphey Candler Pool, the county is delaying a decision on
a permanent solution.
</P>
<P>
   There will still not be enough money to open Brook Run, the
former state home for mentally retarded adults, as a county park.
Also, the baby pool at Tobie Grant recreation center and tennis
courts at Lynwood, Briarwood and Chapel Hill recreation centers
will remain closed because of needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   But DeKalb library director Darro Willey said full library
service will be restored once the 10 unfrozen positions are filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly do feel better,'' said Levetan. ``Libraries are
quality of life issues. ... A community without libraries is
nothing.''

 &HT;    Co-defendant in Lyons case admits lying
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ Far from denying she spent money on a lavish
lifestyle, embattled Baptist leader Henry Lyons' co-defendant
testified Friday that she ``was like a little kid in a candy
store'' after receiving huge checks from corporations that hoped
Lyons could help them open new business opportunities among
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought these things because I worked hard to earn the money
and it was my chance to buy things I had always wanted,'' Bernice
Edwards told the all-white jury, referring to expensive jewelry,
homes and a car. ``I wanted to provide a better life for my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Lyons face racketeering and grand theft charges
stemming from deals they made with companies that wanted to sell
funeral services, insurance and credit cards to members of the
National Baptist Convention USA, one of the nation's largest black
denominations. Lyons is the group's president and Edwards was its
public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic testimony came as the month-old trial is drawing to
a close. Because Lyons chose not to testify, Edwards' appearance is
likely to be a linchpin of the defense's case.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from an untarnished performance.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards made what appeared to be several damaging admissions,
including her use of multiple Social Security numbers to open bank
accounts to handle the money and her failure to report the money to
her probation officer. Edwards was on probation for embezzlement
when Lyons hired her, and was required to report all her income to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   She said she used as many as five different Social Security
numbers because she simply forgot her real number. Edwards sparred
repeatedly with prosecutor Bill Loughery. Loughery hammered at
Edwards' alleged romantic affair with Lyons, a key to the
prosecution's claims that the pair conspired in a racketeering
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards adamantly denied an affair, even as she admitted she and
Lyons jointly purchased a luxury $700,000 waterfront home in St.
Petersburg, Fla., a time-share condo in Lake Tahoe, Nev., and took
trips to Hawaii and Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   The house, the time-share and the trips were strictly for
Baptist business, Edwards insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know Deborah Lyons, Rev. Lyons' wife,'' Loughery
asked. ``What did you tell her about the house you bought
together?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a business agreement with Dr. Lyons,'' Edwards
replied. ``Dr. Lyons did not share the house with me. I was not
aware of what Dr. Lyons told his wife about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards admitted she turned away a couple one night when they
visited her at the luxury Don Cesar Hotel in St. Petersburg, coming
to the door in her pajamas and saying Dr. Lyons was in the room
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she lied about having Lyons in the room with her
because she wanted to get rid of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also admitted lying about her educational background,
telling one executive from one of the companies she had a degree
from Columbia University, and another that she had done graduate
work at Cornell, despite having no college degree.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted telling that lie often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself often in a situation where people felt you've
got to have a degree to have a job,'' she said. ``It was to
establish who I was and what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also tried to turn the tables on the company executives
who claim she and Lyons agreed to sell them a list of the
convention's supposed 8.5 million members though they knew no such
list existed. The executives also knew there was no list, but
continued providing money to help Edwards and Lyons compile it, she
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no complaint and it was my understanding they were
very pleased,'' she said, referring to Globe Insurance Co., which
paid the pair $1 million for the names.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also said executives from Loewen, a Canadian funeral
services company, hoped she might help them get an unfavorable
civil court ruling in Mississippi reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The company lost a huge judgment to black funeral homes, who
claimed it was buying up their businesses unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards went to Mississippi at Loewen's request, where she met
an attorney who gave her names and addresses of the jurors and
asked her to get them to say they were bribed to rule against
Loewen, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (a Loewen executive) I was not going to tamper with
that jury in Mississippi,'' Edwards testified.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, Edwards took a $1 million payment from the
company and continued doing public relations work to try to repair
its image, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to go to the jury sometime next week.

A MEANINGLESS TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Know what Roger Clemens being traded to the Yankees means?
Absolutely nothing. The Yankees won the AL East by 22 games last
year. So what if they win by 23 games this year? All this trade
means for the Yankee is that they added $3 million to their payroll
to buy insurance for a pennant. For the Blue Jays, it means they're
off the hook for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Let me get this straight. Toronto trades Clemens to the Yankees,
and the Boston media kick the Red Sox and Dan Duquette all over the
place. What did the Red Sox have to do with the Toronto-New York
trade?
</P>
<P>
   Think Blue Jays fans are as busted up over Clemens leaving town,
even after he won back-to-back Cy Young Awards? For an answer,
consider what Clemens, in all his greatness, did to get Toronto
closer to a pennant. Absolutely nothing. The Blue Jays finished
farther behind in the East _ and lost more money _ than before his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   And as a bonus, Clemens stuck the Jays with Tim ``Rambo''
Johnson, his personal choice for manager when he was calling the
shots for the organization. Johnson, who invented for himself a
phony career as a Vietnam war hero, remains in Toronto even after
his sponsor, the Texas Con Man, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the Clemens deal is yet to come. We'll see his
real act about halfway through the season, when he doesn't want to
stay in the same hotel with his teammates or ride on the same bus,
or wants permission to go home to Houston for a weekend so he can
be with his kids. We'll see how Mr. Me fits in with a Yankee team
that reportedly is close and played like it a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   More baseball:
</P>
<P>
   --Funniest line of the week came from an Associated Press story
out of Arizona: ``I wanted to come by and say hello to the
fellas,'' said Mo Money, showing up early at the Angels training
camp, ``and let them know work starts now.'' Wow. What a
revelation. I'm sure this greeting by Mo Vaughn fired up his new
teammates. They probably didn't realize what a physical
fitness/weight conscious/nutrition devotee he is. Why, he might
even weigh in this year, something he wouldn't do with the Red Sox
even though the Sox claim they had a weight clause in his contract
that Mo Money chose to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   --This Andres Galarraga development could be bad news for the
Red Sox. They have been talking with the Chicago White Sox about a
trade for slugging first baseman Frank Thomas. The White Sox have
told interested teams that they might deal Thomas after spring
training, when they can look at the prospects of the interested
teams. Colorado and Seattle are already in the hunt along with
Boston. But, just like the Yankees, when the Braves need a player
they usually buy one with Ted Turner's money or make a trade for
one. With Galarraga gone for at least a year because of a cancerous
tumor in his back, Atlanta will be looking for someone to play
first base.
</P>
<P>
   --Last fall, after Mo Money left town, I spoke with Carl
Yastrzemski and he made a statement that every Red Sox fan should
read carefully: ``The Red Sox are a good four or five solid players
away from the Yankees. One guy is not going to make the difference.
The Yankees just have far more talent than the Sox do right now.''
Mo Money, Pedro Martinez, Nomar Garciappara, and some other Boston
players had fantastic seasons last year, and the Red Sox still
finished 22 games behind.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line. Until the Red Sox can get a new ballpark to
generate the same revenue as the Yankees, Baltimore, and Cleveland,
they will not be able to compete with those clubs. For now, the Sox
are in the same boat as about 25 other major league teams, all of
whom have no chance of winning the World Series because they can't
compete, in spending, like the top revenue-generating teams.

   The New York Giants are opposed to the Patriots moving to
Hartford and will vote against it when the time comes. The Giants
consider Hartford to be their market and feel the Patriots' move
would violate some of the critical elements of the NFL's guidelines
on team relocation. While Giants Stadium was being built in the
mid-1970s, the Giants played their home games at Yale Bowl in New
Haven, which is essentially the same market at Hartford. If the NFL
considered that part of Connecticut was a Patriots market, there is
no way the league would have allowed the Giants to play
regular-season home games there. In fact, in 1974 the Patriots
played a regular-season game in Yale Bowl vs. the Giants, as the
VISITING team.

   Bruins boss Harry Sinden is not happy with the team's fade over
the last 17 games (3-11-3). ``I'm shocked and totally surprised,''
he said. ``I never thought something like this could happen to our
club. Before the year, we thought we had the most promising young
team in the league. We had 93 points last year. We thought our
biggest problem could be Joe Thornton. We wondered if he could come
along and be the center we thought he could be. Thorton has done
that. He's become a heck of a center, playing better every game.
Our goalies and our defense have played well. It's the forwards who
have fallen apart. We're not scoring. We've got nothing out of a
power play that a year ago was pretty good and we thought would be
better. We've got to get things turned around here before the
playoffs. I think we can do it. And if we start playing the way we
can coming down the stretch, then we could got into the playoffs
playing well and do some damage. This team is too good to play the
way it is playing right now.''

   Ben Lipson, an insurance expert who often writes for this
newspaper, is right on the money when he says, ``The Robert Edwards
case should make every agent and every player aware of how
important insurance can be. The agents should see to it that every
player with a substantial future is covered not only for his
present contract but for whatever his insurable interest is for the
future. To do something like this to protect athletes away from the
playing field against disabling injury does not cost a lot of money
and would be money well spent.'' Edwards, who probably lost his
career to a disabling knee injury at a rookie beach flag football
game in Hawaii during Pro Bowl festivities, is covered by an
insurance policy for the remaining four years of his contract.
However, if he had stayed healthy he would have almost assuredly
been able to have a 10-year career in the NFL. That is six years
more of coverage he could have had but didn't.

   Boston College is trying to work out a five-year extension of

   Question for the Patriots: A week ago you had short money under
the salary cap (less than $200,000) to sign center Dave Wohlabaugh,
your best offensive lineman and one of the most important players
on your team. Wohlabaugh signs with Cleveland as a free agent. This
week you restructure the contracts of Chris Slade and Vincent
Brisby to give you more money to spend, money that could have been
used to sign Wohlabaugh. Why didn't you restructure a week ago? Or
do you need the money to strike a new deal with Ty Law or Lawyer
Milloy? The new Slade and Brisby deals have created more than $2.1
million for the Patriots . . . The Saints reportedly offered to
trade running back Lamar Smith to the Patriots for draft choices,
but the Patriots didn't want any part of the deal . . . Some of the
top businessmen in the city attended a get-together hosted by Chad
Gifford, top gun at BankBoston, to tell Red Sox CEO John Harrington
that they wanted to help the Sox build a new ballpark, and to tell
the Sox to reach out for their help when necessary. The Red Sox
still have not completed the financial part of the deal, which is
why they have not come forward with their plans for a new Fenway
Park.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Libya has asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
clarify assurances that he has given to try to persuade Libya to
turn over two suspects in the bombing of a Pan American flight over
Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United Nations, Fred Eckhard, would not
comment on the nature of Libya's apparent unhappiness with the
assurances given to its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, nor would he
say what clarifications or assurances Gadhafi was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said only that Libya had made ``preliminary
observations'' about the letter sent this week to Tripoli via the
Libyan mission to the United Nations. He added that the
secretary-general was studying the Libyan response, which was made
``orally and informally.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, along with U.S. and British diplomats, have said
little about the contents of Annan's letter, which offered
assurances made on behalf of the United States and Britain, which
for years have been struggling to arrange a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats have said the secretary-general had assured
Gadhafi that the economic sanctions imposed in 1992 would be
removed if the two suspects were turned over to a Scottish court
for trial in the Netherlands and that they would be fairly and
properly treated at the trial and in jail, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is also said to have assured Tripoli that the trial will
involve ``no attempt to undermine'' the Libyan government, the
diplomats added.
</P>
<P>
   That last assurance has led some relatives of the 270 people
killed in the bombing over Lockerbie to contend that the Clinton
administration is making concessions that would avoid implicating
top Libyan officials in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A group of families led by Susan Cohen of Cape May, N.J., issued
a statement that criticized the assurances and said that the
administration appeared to have made a further commitment that
would delay justice. ``The limitations that will be placed on the
prosecutors,'' the group said, ``will make the conviction of the
two suspects much more difficult and, perhaps, impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``defense,'' the families added, ``could insist that many
lines of inquiry would undermine the Libyan regime and must be
excluded from the trial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel Cohen, father of a 20-year-old killed in the blast, said
officials had told him that if convicted the suspects would be kept
in the Netherlands until the appeals process had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   If the men are convicted, exhaust their appeals and eventually
reach Scotland, Cohen said, ``they will be housed in their own
special jail wing, which will in a variety of ways essentially be
under the supervision of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that those steps would set a dangerous precedent.
``Will all future terrorist prisoners be able to call for
comfortable conditions and U.N. supervisions?'' Cohen asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the victims' relatives agreed. Some said they were not
unhappy with the assurances if they can persuade Gadhafi to let the
suspects be tried. Others said they would wait and see what
assurances Annan has made on behalf of the British and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is to begin reviewing the economic sanctions
against Libya next Friday. The Clinton administration has warned
that unless Gadhafi has turned over the suspects by then, it will
press to expand the sanctions.

HOLLANDSWORTH WILL BIDE HIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ On the first day of official workouts,
Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth rescinded his offseason
request to be traded. Sort of. Well, at least until the outfield
situation plays itself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a dead issue because there's nothing to do
except go out and play,'' Hollandsworth said Friday. ``We get a
month into the season, two months into the season, we'll see where
we're at. That's the only way I can look at it right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the offseason, if you could change the situation then, it's
a good time to change it because nothing is going on. But here we
are now, I have a job that I have to focus on and get it done, so
that's what I focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Hollandsworth's agent, Jeff Moorad, said
his client wanted to be traded because Hollandsworth didn't want
the tag of being a fourth outfielder at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, the National League Rookie of the Year in `96,
wants to be an everyday outfielder but for now is content _ or
somewhat so _ to remain with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It could be difficult for Hollandsworth to break into the
starting outfield, which consists of Devon White, Raul Mondesi and
Gary Sheffield. But he could get more playing time than the average
extra outfielder since, during the last five years, White has
averaged 113 games and Sheffield has averaged 115 games while
battling injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job right now is to make (manager) Davey Johnson's job very
difficult and that's what I intend to do,'' said Hollandsworth, who
batted .269 last season but missed the final 103 games with a
cartilage tear in his left shoulder. Hollandsworth, a career .269
hitter with 24 homers and 123 RBI in 351 games, said he'll wait a
few months, see how often he plays and how he performs, before
bringing up the trade situation again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play, that's the bottom line,'' Hollandsworth said.
``I love the Dodgers. I've been in the Dodgers organization for a
long time. I know this clubhouse, I know L.A.'s clubhouse. I know
the L.A. area. I like it and nothing is wrong with any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Late arrivals: The most notable pitcher not in camp was
right-handed closer Jeff Shaw. He was granted permission by the
club to remain home in Washington Court House, Ohio, with his wife,
Julie, who is expected to give birth to the couple's third child
any day. Also, right-handed pitching prospect Luke Prokopec, the
Dodgers' Minor League Player of the Year last season, had visa
problems in his native Australia and wasn't expected in until late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Looking ahead: If nothing else, Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone certainly knows how to give a sound byte that is sure to get
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the Yankees acquisition of Roger Clemens, Malone
said, ``It'll be nice to see Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens match up
in October. That's my goal, anyway. You have to have vision.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Camp talk: While the workout was mostly set for pitchers and
catchers, seven other players who are rehabbing injuries were in
attendance. They were outfielders Hiram Bocachica, Hollandsworth
and Kevin Gibbs and infielders Eric Young, Jose Vizcaino, Adam
Riggs and Tripp Cromer.

 &HT;    Keeping to a medication schedule is crucial for HIV patients _
but hard. A new program aims to make it easier.
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 21.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Louganis knows the value of sticking to a routine. He
didn't collect five Olympic medals _ four gold, one silver _ and
earn acclaim as the world's greatest diver without vigilant
self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it came to taking daily HIV medicine, Louganis could be
just as lax as the next person.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on a three-a-day dosing schedule, it was usually
the `nooner' I'd forget,'' the 39-year-old diving legend admitted
during a recent interview. ``The one dose everyone misses is the
one in the middle of the day, and I've been guilty of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Louganis is promoting a new program, ``Gaining Optimal Adherence
for Life,'' or GOAL, aimed at improving compliance with HIV drug
regimens. The program was developed by Hoffmann-La Roche, the
manufacturer of two HIV drugs, Fortovase and ddC, and is free to
patients taking Fortovase.
</P>
<P>
   With any other disease, skipping a few drug doses wouldn't
matter so much. With HIV medications, however, missed doses can
quickly result in drug resistance _ a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some evidence to suggest that even small amounts of
missed doses can affect the effects of the drugs,'' said Dr. Cal
Cohen, research director at CRI New England, a community-based
research group near Boston. ``People who miss even 5 percent of
their doses have less success.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey found that 43 percent of patients admitted not
properly taking their HIV medicine. The same survey reported that
HIV specialists estimated that 54 percent of their patients weren't
adhering to their regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for poor adherence vary. In many cases, patients simply
forget a dose. Some take ``drug holidays,'' during which they stop
HIV drugs because of debilitating side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Young children with HIV pose special difficulties, said Dr.
Steven Nesheim, medical director of pediatrics in the infectious
diseases program at Grady Memorial Hospital's Ponce de Leon Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person giving the medicine is a third party, as opposed to
an adult who can take it himself,'' Nesheim said. ``You have to
rely on the mother, who also is probably the mother of more than
one child.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that infants and young children will reject
medicine if they dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids vomit it back up if it tastes really bad,'' Nesheim said
wryly. ``It's hard to keep forcing medicines on them.''
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of Nesheim's young patients are no longer
responding fully to their HIV drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while a limited number of drug options are available for
adults, even fewer can be used in children. Not all HIV drugs are
available in liquid formulation; capsules and pills are harder for
young children to take, especially since several must be taken at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Louganis learned about the importance of adherence the hard way,
when he developed resistance and had to switch drugs. He had
experienced harsh side effects from his previous drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In developing a new regimen, he was careful to consult with his
doctor about a regimen that he could tolerate and that would suit
his lifestyle. Together, they decided on a combination of drugs
that required only two daily doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find a regimen you can live with,'' said Louganis,
who lives in Malibu, Calif., but travels often. ``So you have to be
honest with yourself, you have to be honest with your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Louganis, who has been HIV-positive for more than a decade, said
he's feeling ``great'' and exercising daily, although he appeared
somewhat drawn and tired during a recent interview in Chicago.
``Everything's pretty stable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the GOAL program receive five mailings over 21
weeks, which include a pillbox, a diary for tracking daily doses
and a videotape featuring Louganis talking about adherence.
</P>
<P>
   The pillbox is a nifty contraption made of 21 interlocking boxes
that separate a week's worth of drugs into individual doses. The
whole thing disassembles, allowing people to carry individual
doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If health care providers sit down and take the time to explain
the dosing and why it's important, and offer tips on how to achieve
this, patients tend to have better adherence,'' said Dan Dunable, a
treatment resource specialist at the AIDS Survival Project in
Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Both pillboxes and diaries are considered invaluable tools,
Dunable said. Many people also need daily reminders to take their
drugs. Dunable suggests people leave notes to themselves or enlist
friends or family members to remind them.
</P>
<P>
   He himself depends on a wristwatch alarm to stay on schedule.
Dunable takes a total of 22 pills a day, of which only 10 actually
are anti-HIV drugs. The rest are antibiotics and other drugs
prescribed to ward off the infections that take advantage of
HIV-weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his medicines, Dunable takes supplements such as
vitamins and anti-oxidants, which he believes are helpful.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to five different doses per day. Two should be
taken with meals, three must be taken on an empty stomach _ no food
for two hours before or one hour after the dose.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most restrictive drug regimen Dunable has had in his 10
years of HIV therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten used to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five times a day the watch beeps. He wakes to the 7 a.m. alarm
and takes his morning dose. At noon the watch beeps to warn Dunable
he has one hour left to eat lunch, before his second dose. It next
goes off at 3 p.m. for the third set of pills, then again at 8 p.m.
to remind Dunable he has one hour left to eat dinner before taking
the fourth dose. The last alarm sounds at 11 p.m. for his bedtime
pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this watch ever goes bad, I'll have to go out and find
another one,'' Dunable said.
</P>
<P>
   Louganis will be in Atlanta Wednesday to sign copies of his new
book, ``For the Life of Your Dog,'' a guide for dog owners. The
book signing will be at 7 p.m. at the Chapter 11 bookstore in
Atlanta. For details call 404-872-7986.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in the GOAL program should consult their
physician or pharmacist for confidential enrollment forms, or call
1-800-910-4687. For other information on adherence, contact the
AIDS Survival Project at 404-874-7926.

 &HT;    Tastemakers go with flow as styles shift, trends evolve
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pity the fool who's a self-described ``fashion
know-it-all.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's any lesson to take away from the Fashion Week
experience, it's that everyone here knows something about looking
good, but no one knows everything.
</P>
<P>
   Vogue editor Anna Wintour doesn't always wear her infamous
sunglasses at the most appropriate times. And sometimes, the
get-ups groupies wear in hopes of gaining back-door entry into a
show don't look so ridiculous after all.
</P>
<P>
   The more times one attends Fashion Week in one of the world's
fashion capitals, the greater one's realization of how much more
there is to learn from the jet-setters who (supposedly) know the
most about style.
</P>
<P>
   Read on if you're interested in a few style pointers gleaned
from a week spent hobnobbing with the people whose tastes determine
what will be available for you to wear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Change is good: Styles evolve. Paths alter. Get used to it.
Everything that's fashionable is in flux right now: from the
advertising campaigns designers can dare risk, to the colors and
styles they think they can compel people to wear, to the corporate
conglomerates controlling the clothing industry. The best response
to all that change, say Anne Klein design chiefs Ken Kaufman and
Isaac Franco, is to relax and do what comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Here comes the bride, all dressed in . . . Tahari:
</P>
<P>
   That's how Atlanta native Rory Green, 26, should be serenaded
when she weds forward-thinking designer Elie Tahari sometime this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tahari, 46, said he's in the process of designing the gown his
bride _ daughter of Barbara Portman and advertising executive Keith
Green _ will wear on their wedding day. And at lunch Friday in the
Tahari showroom, Green said there'll be little room for any other
designer label in her closets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, when I walked in and saw his collection for fall for
the first time, tears came to my eyes,'' she said. ``I'm so proud
of him. He really blew me away. And I'm so happy I'm his fiancee
because I get to have every single piece of it!''
</P>
<P>
   What Tahari sends to stores for fall will represent his most
modernistic men's and womens wear to date. It centers on stretch
fabrics with jackets that wear as easy as shirts, and pants and
skirts with silhouettes as clean and fluid as filtered water.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how living with Green has influenced his design approach,
Tahari responded (half jokingly): ``Every day she tells me
something like, `That doesn't fit right,' or `What were you
thinking when you designed this?' It's mostly complaints. On the
other hand, she used to wear clothes for old ladies. And now I've
got her wearing (the bridge line) Theory, and she looks younger and
looks better.''

 &HT;    Talking about Tommy: Hilfiger's mixed bag
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In order to have live musical accompaniment for his
fall/winter show at the Roseland Ballroom on Thursday night,
Hilfiger had to turn to the ``it'' band, Sugar Ray.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity. Sugar Ray's current hit, ``Every Morning,'' is
unquestionably catchy, but it didn't suit Hilfiger's show as well
as the The Rolling Stones', ``It's Only Rock and Roll (But I Like
It),'' might have.
</P>
<P>
   In a round-about way, Hilfiger hinted after the show, for both
men's and women's styles, that he was less intent on unveiling what
would make it to major department stores this fall than on showing
buyers, editors and groupies something worth talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I only showed our jeans and our sportswear, you'd all be
bored,'' Hilfiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. Hilfiger bit into the trend toward zippered hems,
cuffs and closures wholeheartedly, and it's intriguing the way his
zip-legged, studded jeans offer wearers the choice of straight or
flared legs to suit their footwear. (In keeping with the show's
rock-and-roll theme, most models in the show wore rowdy-looking
biker boots.)
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger refered to the clothes he showed as, ``a mixed bag
consisting of our jeans, sportswear and Collection (with a capital
``C'').'' The jeans and sportswear will actually make it onto
mainstream stores' sales floors, while most of the collection will
go only to the toniest of retailers, and Hilfiger's imposing
flagship store on Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to distinguish the upscale goods (i.e. French-cuffed
shirts and pin-tucked leather dresses) from the clothes meant for
the masses (T-shirts and track pants) because of the way Hilfiger
combined them. Cashmere jackets were worn over nylon ski pants.
Nylon ``parachute'' skirts were paired with cashmere tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I constantly have to ask myself, 'What makes us different?',''
Hilfiger said. ``And the answer is that we're mixing high and low
as we have always done. A cashmere sweater from Collection with a
pair of nylon pants from the Tommy Jeans line. That is what I
consider modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan: In her attempt to define a look for the millenial
woman, Donna Karan's gone back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Karan returned to the opaque black stocking that was her
hallmark when her best designing days were ahead of her, and used
it as the basis of a skirt-heavy fall/winter collection. These
weren't just any skirts: they were more like blankets made of the
finest cashmere, and wrapped sculpturally around the waist for
freedom of movement and dramatic visuals. The swaying of the skirts
was tempered by the slim-shouldered jackets and second-skin
sweaters Karan designed in keeping with the trendy A-line
silhouette. Her color scheme consisted of black, dark brown, greys,
off-whites and pale camels. Fabrics ranged from multi-ply cashmeres
to leathers to silks (for her slim, creased pants) and nylons that
glistened like glass.

 &HT;    The flared leg flattering for men
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thighs have it. Menswear designers are trying to
usher in a new silhouette for casual pants in which there's a
gradual flare out from the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Style-conscious men might view this look as skeptically as they
did the slim, flat-front slacks of recent seasons. But as designer
John Bartlett demonstrated with the outfit (a skintight black
leather blazer, cashmere turtleneck and flared moleskin jeans) he
wore to the Saks Fifth Avenue party, the flared-leg look is
flattering on men with muscular thighs, a slim waist and broad
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   As Bartlett cruised the party, the cartoon character Popeye kept
coming to mind.

 &HT;    Digging into gardening

OSHA PROPOSES TO REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO ADOPT `ERGONOMIC PROGRAMS'
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration promised relief on
Friday to hundreds of thousands of workers with aching backs,
crippled fingers, sore wrists and other physical problems caused or
aggravated by their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department took the first formal step to require
employers to redesign jobs and alter work stations to accommodate
workers suffering injuries to the neck, back, arms and hands and to
help prevent such injuries. It issued a draft of proposed rules and
said that a final plan, with the force of law, would be issued late
next year after an extended period of public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is intended to alleviate one of the biggest
problems in American factories and offices: an epidemic of
occupational injuries known as musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions include carpal tunnel syndrome, low back pain,
muscle strains, sciatica and tendinitis. They account for one-third
of all serious workplace injuries and afflict more than 640,000
workers each year, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and some Republican members of Congress have
strenuously opposed such regulation, but administration officials,
labor unions and occupational health experts said the standards
were overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders has been slow in
coming,'' said Charles Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor
in charge of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
``For many years, it was just considered a cost of doing business.
If you did certain jobs, you would end up with hands crippled at
the end of your career. That's not acceptable in this country
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress said the proposed safeguards would increase the
productivity and morale of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not yet done a detailed estimate of the costs
to employers, as it must before issuing the final rules. Peter
Eide, a lawyer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he did not
have a cost estimate either, saying the proposal was ``hopelessly
vague.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffress said he believed the compliance costs would be less
than the costs employers now incur because of workdays lost to
injury and illness. The Labor Department said musculoskeletal
disorders cost employers $15 billion to $20 billion a year in
workers' compensation costs to say nothing of the cost of reduced
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would affect at least 25 million workers in
production jobs and ``manual handling operations'' that involve
pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting or lowering objects or people.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would, for example, apply to assembly-line
workers, machine operators, bakers, meatpackers, office cleaning
crews and warehousemen, as well as nurses and physical therapists,
grocery checkout clerks and people who make deliveries for the
Postal Service, United Parcel Service and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the standards would apply to hundreds of thousands
of employers in other industries if they had even one employee with
a musculoskeletal disorder. Thus, the standards would protect
millions of people who work at computer terminals, entering
financial data for banks and insurance companies, writing and
editing articles for newspapers and magazines, and taking telephone
orders for all sorts of services and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would not apply to the construction work,
agriculture or the maritime industry.
</P>
<P>
   Employers covered by the rule would be required to adopt
``ergonomic programs'' to identify hazards and respond to worker
complaints. They would, for example, have to provide employees with
prompt access to health-care professionals who could treat
work-related medical problems, at no cost to the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors could recommend work restrictions or reassignments for
employees, and the employer would normally have to follow these
recommendations. An employer would also have to ``maintain the
employee's total normal earnings, seniority, rights and benefits
when work restrictions are prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule tests the government's ability to keep up with
a fast-changing economy in which technology is continually altering
the nature of work and the tasks performed. Federal officials said
they wanted to be sure to protect ``intensive computer users,'' for
example, but had found no easy way to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Orr, an ergonomic engineer at the Labor Department, said:
``It's clear that computer users are developing musculoskeletal
disorders, but the risk appears to depend on many factors: How many
key strokes do workers perform? How often do they click the mouse?
How much rest do they have? How much control do they have over the
pace of work? Are the computer keyboard and monitor in a good
position?''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule, like most OSHA standards, would apply to
employers of all sizes. Sarah Shortall, a Labor Department lawyer,
said, ``OSHA has never totally exempted small employers from any
safety or health standard, but companies with fewer than 10
employees are sometimes exempted from record-keeping
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency may impose a civil penalty up to $70,000 for a
willful violation of its standards. If the same type of violation
occurs at three different work sites operated by the same company,
the penalty could be $210,000. But the penalties are usually lower
than that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas Sullivan, a lawyer at the National Federation of
Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses,
said: ``We believe this rule-making initiative is premature. The
government should wait for the results of a comprehensive study
being done by the National Academy of Sciences. The cost per worker
will be at least 50 percent higher for small businesses than for
big business. Small businesses don't have industrial hygienists on
staff to deal with rules like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said several employers had already
demonstrated the value of ergonomic programs. For example, it said,
Fieldcrest Cannon sharply reduced injuries at its textile factories
by lessening the need for workers to bend and reach. Perdue Farms
reduced injuries at its poultry plants by improving work
conditions. And a California newspaper, The Fresno Bee, had a
decline in medical and disability costs after it redesigned work
stations and encouraged employees take rest breaks at regular
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomic program recommended by the Labor Department has
six steps. A company would have to establish clear procedures for
employees to report musculoskeletal problems. It would also have to
inform employees of any hazards; pinpoint the causes and take steps
to control them; train employees; provide medical care, and
evaluate the effectiveness of its program, by analyzing injury
rates or other data.

TREASURY WORKER CHARGED IN ALLEGED THEFT   SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Lottery-Theft)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE AND MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A supervisor in the Massachusetts treasurer's office
was charged Friday with conspiring with a New Hampshire ``heir
hunter'' to steal $6.5 million in unclaimed state checks. The
scheme, which authorities hinted may be part of a much larger
conspiracy, was carried out in a department plagued by lax controls
and poor supervision, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly and new
Treasurer Shannon O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   John Trischitta, 47, of Stoneham, surrendered Friday and pleaded
not guilty at Boston Municipal Court to charges that he accepted
$50,000 in bribes to forward $6.5 million in state checks to a bank
account set up by Martin Robbins, 51, of Lincoln, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who tracks owners of unclaimed money for a percentage
of the funds, was arrested Thursday night at his home. Skeptical
administrators at BankBoston, where Robbins allegedly deposited the
money, blew the whistle when he attempted to withdraw the money on
Feb. 10, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said Friday it is unknown whether other money has been
fraudulently funneled from the state's unclaimed fund account. But
he characterized the alleged scheme as a startlingly easy maneuver
in a department found to have had ``no real checks, no real
balances and no controls to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not Mr. Robbins' money,'' Reilly said at a news
conference. to ``This was the people's money. This was nothing
other but a ripoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, a 20-year employee of the treasurer's office, was
elevated about eight years ago during former Treasurer Joseph
Malone's administration from a teller's job in the State House to
be a supervisor in the unclaimed check department. In that
position, the attorney general's office said, he had sole
responsibility over the unclaimed check fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Trischitta authorized the transfer on Nov. 6,
1998, of two checks _ for $5.3 million and $1.2 million -- from the
state fund to an escrow account established by Robbins. State
government sources said that procedures to verify claims on
unclaimed monies had been relaxed in July, when Malone still
controlled the office.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien ordered an indefinite freeze on transactions involving
unclaimed checks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reilly and O'Brien, the alleged scheme worked this
way: Robbins was tipped off that $6.5 million in state funds for
the Economic Development Investment Corp., an organization run by
the Boston Redevelopment Authority, had been unclaimed since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins then mailed five letters to Trischitta to press his
claims on the money, primarily on behalf of the Cambridge Economic
Development Corp., a now-defunct agency. He produced fraudulent
documents granting him power of attorney for the claimant, Reilly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the unclaimed check for the EDIC did not match the name
of the purported Cambridge claimant, O'Brien said the similar
initials may have provided cover for Trischitta to approve Robbins'
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Trischitta was basically Mr. Inside, and Mr. Robbins was
Mr. Outside. They almost got away with it,'' Reilly said. ``It was
pretty simple, and it was pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The men have known each other for about 20 years, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and O'Brien, both of whom took office last month, said
they were appalled when they discovered the quality of management
in the treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have to be proper controls in place and that just was
not the case (under Malone),'' O'Brien said. ``But this is a really
sad day for me. I'm not gloating.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, reached at home, defended his oversight of the office.
Management techniques were routinely audited by outside firms, and
deficiencies were corrected promptly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also said he believed that the payment of any check over
$500 from the fund needed approval from two officials before it
could be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these allegations are true,'' Malone said, ``this employee
had to be out of his mind to think he could get away with it. He
would have had a better chance of robbing his fellow employees at
gunpoint than getting away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he has never met Trischitta, was not responsible for
his promotion, and has not been contacted by the attorney general's
office or the State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the scandal broke, O'Brien pleaded for funds for a
``top-to-bottom'' audit of the treasurer and Lottery offices.
</P>
<P>
   In her first, failed campaign for treasurer in 1994, when
O'Brien was running against Malone, she sharply criticized the
incumbent for his lax management style. Malone, however, won
reelection with over 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters Friday about why it took a call from the
bank before such a large theft was discovered, O'Brien noted that
the problems occurred under the Malone administration. Unclaimed
checks are supposed to be held in the fund supervised by Trischitta
for no more than one year, officials said, instead of the four
years the $6.5 million had languished there.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two checks were for such large amounts of money,
city officials believe the money may have represented part of the
state's payment to the city for land taken for the Central Artery
project.
</P>
<P>
   But those officials said EDIC is not missing that much money. So
it is likely that either the alleged conspirators were able to cash
a duplicate check, or the city was never informed it was due more
funds for the Central Artery land takings.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, whose home was searched Thursday night by State
Police, was granted $10,000 cash bail Friday during his
arraignment. One of his lawyers, James A. Brescia, described
Trischitta as a ``wonderful, gentle, soft-hearted, soft-spoken
man.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said that because Trischitta was well-regarded in the
agency, the decision was made to retain him when she took office.
Trischitta was suspended with pay.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, charged with larceny and forgery, waived extradition
Friday and was held on $1 million bail.

   Even with yields on United States Treasury bonds rising lately,
times can be tough for those investors who want to live on income
from investments.
</P>
<P>
   They can expect a miserly 5.38 percent yield from a long-term
Treasury. And a typical one-year bank certificate of deposit earns
just 4.34 percent. As for stocks, the companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index offer a puny average yield of 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who wander from government bonds and CDs must cope
with risk to their principal, but if they are seeking income, they
may have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Sazdanoff, a money manager for individuals and
small-business retirement plans at Sovereign Asset Management in
Lexington, Ohio, said he has sworn off Treasuries and is moving
into other investments until the yield on the 30-year bond climbs
higher. ``It's just not out there on the bond market side,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious income-producing alternative, the real estate
investment trust, entails a significant measure of additional risk.
But with shares down more than 25 percent, on average, in the past
year, fans of REITs say these investments have never been so cheap
relative to stocks and bonds; Eric Hemel, a Merrill Lynch analyst,
said that current REIT prices ``defy logic.'' And REIT yields are,
on average, one and a half times the yield on 10-year Treasury
notes, the largest premium in more than 20 years, according to
Robert H. Steers, co-manager of the Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Shares
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors should remember that no matter how cheap REITs
are, prices can go lower if the economy sags. ``If we do go into a
meaningful recession, that's negative for every industry, and
obviously real estate is not an exception,'' Steers said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk-averse investor should look for REITs that might better
withstand an economic slowdown, particularly well-run trusts that
specialize in office and health care properties. Steers said one of
his favorites is Highwoods Properties Inc., based in Raleigh, N.C.,
which owns office buildings and other properties and yields 9.2
percent. It trades at 7.3 times 1998 funds from operations,
essentially income with noncash charges for depreciation and
amortization added.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than the ratio for many comparable REITs. Steers
also likes Nationwide Health Properties Inc. of Newport Beach,
Calif., which owns nursing homes and assisted-living centers. It
trades at 8.8 times 1998 funds from operations and yields 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another beaten-down sector is electric utilities. The 15 that
make up the Dow Jones utilities average yield 3.7 percent, but
that's not the whole story. Many utilities are stable, slow-growth
companies with much higher yields, according to Mark Luftig of W.H.
Reaves &AMP; Co., a money manager based in Jersey City and specializing
in utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities are probably a safer bet than REITs now, as evidenced
by their lower yields. Deregulation of the industry is not the
concern it once was, Luftig said, as some legislative efforts have
lost steam. And many utilities now have years of heavy capital
spending behind them, he said, and can use free cash flow to pay
off debt, buy back stock and perhaps increase dividends.
</P>
<P>
   One of Luftig's higher-yielding choices is the Ameren Corp.,
which serves Illinois and Missouri and offers a 6.8 percent yield
with an estimated 1999 price-to-earnings multiple of 13. He also
likes Wisconsin Energy, which serves Wisconsin and part of Michigan
and yields 6.1 percent with an estimated 1999 p/e of 12.6.
</P>
<P>
   Junk and municipal bonds, meanwhile, still offer unusually fat
yields relative to the risk-free bonds of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Top-rated munis, which pay tax-free dividends, now offer 92
percent of the yield of 30-year Treasuries, according to Delphis
Hanover, a bond research firm. And the KDP Investment Advisors
index of high-yield bonds yields 4.54 percentage points more than
10-year Treasury notes, down from 6.25 points at the height of the
hedge-fund and emerging-markets scare last October but still well
above the average spread of 3.54 points since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts recommend that for convenience and diversification,
investors buy junk and municipal bonds through mutual funds. But
the best deals now may be closed-end funds, whose shares trade like
those of ordinary companies and so can be priced above or below
their underlying net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, many closed-end bond funds have seen their discounts
grow, some to as wide as 10 percent or more. This means that you
can buy $1 of securities for 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   For munis, Thomas J. Herzfeld, a closed-end fund adviser in
Miami who manages about $100 million, likes Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Municipal Premium Income, yielding about 5.6 percent. Though
analysts panned it last year when it cut its dividend, Herzfeld
said that it offers a good yield and that its discount to net asset
value, at 11.2 percent as of last Thursday, is far wider than it
usually is.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds are riskier. A recession would spell trouble for
them, as it would for REITs. But for investors willing to stomach
the extra risk, Sazdanoff, the Ohio money manager, suggests bond
funds with maturities of no more than seven years, like Putnam
Master Intermediate Income Trust, which offers an 8.5 percent yield
and traded at a one percent discount on Feb. 12. Not strictly a
high-yield fund, it has assets spread among junk bonds, foreign
bonds and United States government debt.

CLINTON INCREASES PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC AS DEADLINE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-TALKS, KOSOVO-MOOD)

 By ELIZABETH BECKER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia on Friday not to ``stonewall'' a peace
settlement in Kosovo and threatened to bomb Serbia if Milosevic
misses the Saturday deadline for an end to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on increasing the pressure on Milosevic, Clinton said it
would be a mistake to extend the noon deadline (6 a.m. ET) and
praised the ``courage'' of the negotiators representing the
Albanian Kosovars at the talks in Rambouillet, France. But the
president set no clear timetable for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic refused on Friday even to meet with the American
ambassador, Christopher Hill. Clinton said that allowing a peace
agreement and permitting NATO peacekeepers into Serbia was the best
way to guarantee that Kosovo remains part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   With President Jacques Chirac of France at his side during a
White House news conference, Clinton emphasized that an agreement
in France, which has been endorsed in broad outline by the Albanian
Kosovar delegates, would compel the Albanian Kosovars to give up
their demands for independence for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the U.S. and France ``stand united in our
determination to use force, if Serbia fails to meet its previous
commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo and if it fails to accept
the peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an option'' other than NATO airstrikes,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has remained in Belgrade during the negotiations
in France, repeated Friday that he would not accept an
international peacekeeping force inside the Serbian province of
Kosovo. He refused to meet with Hill, declaring, instead, that he
would not surrender Kosovo ``even at the price of bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and the two leaders agreed that Milosevic ``should be under
no illusion about our resolve should he prevent a deal'' on Kosovo,
according to a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Friday, Clinton underlined that the NATO
allies would not allow Milosevic to talk his way out of a real
troop withdrawal, as he did last October.
</P>
<P>
   Then, NATO also threatened the Serbian leader with airstrikes if
he did not pull back his forces following their bloody summer
offensive that led to the massacre of well over 1,000 Kosovo
civilians, the destruction of 200 villages and the driving from
their homes of some 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But after nine straight days of negotiations in Belgrade between
the American envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and Milosevic, NATO ended up
settling for an unarmed monitoring mission rather than a full
withdrawal down to the agreed- upon level of 15,000 Serbian troops
and police.
</P>
<P>
   Both the French and British withdrew their nonessential embassy
staff from Belgrade on Friday. The United States authorized the
departure of family members and nonemergency employees at its
embassy but withheld ordering a nearly full departure. That could
very well come Saturday if Milosevic does not meet the noon
deadline, according to a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and Britain also issued advisories Friday
against travel to Yugoslavia, with the British citing ``the
increasingly volatile situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Kosovo Verification Mission, established by
last October's negotiations, are also expected to be withdrawn by
NATO troops in neighboring Macedonia, according to allied
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a mistake to extend the deadline,''
Clinton said Friday at the joint press conference, the first since
his acquittal on impeachment charges one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as part of a
NATO operation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no agreement and NATO decides to strike, it could
take 48 to 72 hours before the bombing begins, according to Clinton
administration officials. In late January, NATO gave its
authorization for strikes against Serbian military targets in
Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Pentagon ordered more B-52s to join NATO
forces in Europe to prepare for a possible bombing mission against
Serbia. In addition, the United States this week sent F-117 Stealth
fighters and refueling aircraft.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The planning for a bombing campaign has been drawn around two
phases, according to Pentagon officials. The first would be an
attack by Cruise missiles launched from battleships on the Adriatic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic continues to resist accepting a settlement, this
attack would be followed by concerted allied air attacks on the
Serbian air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the administration's Kosovo policy say NATO
seems to be serious about striking Serbia this time, although it
has threatened strikes before only to extend deadlines to persuade
Milosevic to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now NATO's credibility is truly on the line,'' said Ivo
Daalder, a Balkan specialist formerly at the National Security
Council. ``Not to follow through on a serious threat tied to a
serious deadline would fundamentally undermine the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomats and administration officials say Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the French foreign minister, Hubert
Vedrine, and the British foreign minister, Robin Cook, may go to
Belgrade over the weekend if it appears that such a high-level
delegation could convince Milosevic to accept the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While allied leaders were threatening Milosevic, their military
forces were moving closer to Kosovo to take part in a peacekeeping
mission should an agreement be reached. Last weekend the United
States joined the British and French in making formal troop
commitments for the initial force that could arrive in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 Marines are sailing toward the Greek port of
Thessaloniki on the Aegean Sea, where British ships are also
expected to land and unload heavy equipment for their troops.
British soldiers will be flown into the airport in Macedonia and
then driven into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will also provide the NATO headquarters in
Pristina with command &AMP; control, telecommunication and intelligence
experts, according to Pentagon officials, for the initial phase of
the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for war and we are preparing for peace,''
said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon news conference, Clinton was also asked what he
had learned from the past year of investigation and impeachment.
Adopting a thoughtful expression, he said he came away with an
enhanced respect for the Constitution and its framers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution has been, in effect, re-ratified,''
Clinton said. ``And I hope the presidency has not been harmed. I
don't believe it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I can't say that I think this has been good
for the country. But we will see.''

INSPECTION OF ABORTION CLINIC PROMPTS A CLAIM OF HARASSMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louisiana's latest skirmish over abortion began with an
investigative report on television and has moved into the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, the day after WAFB, the CBS affiliate in Baton Rouge,
broadcast a report on unsanitary conditions at a local abortion
clinic, Gov. Mike Foster declared a health emergency and issued an
executive order telling public health officers to inspect the
clinic and ``all other medical and health-related facilities in the
state of Louisiana which are not being regularly inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures they showed were pretty grotesque,'' Trey
Williams, the governor's deputy press secretary, said of the
report. ``There were instruments that had rust on them. There were
drops of blood on the floor, on the tables. It was appalling. The
governor is pro-life, that's no secret, but that's not what this is
about. Abortion is legal in the United States, it's legal here in
Louisiana, and we want to make sure that the women who receive
these procedures have them in a sanitary, safe medical way.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates, however, saw the governor's move as
an effort to harass abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it, this latest attack on abortion by
the State of Louisiana is not about protecting women's health, but
is intended to shut down abortion clinics,'' Robin Rothrock, the
administrator of a Shreveport clinic, said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ms. Rothrock and others filed a lawsuit in U.S.
District Court, challenging the order as a politically motivated
and unconstitutional attempt to put obstacles in the way of women
seeking abortions. The complaint charges that the governor unfairly
singled out abortion clinics, subjected them to unlawful search and
seizure and violated women's rights by providing no protection for
their privacy or the confidentiality of their records.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, the day of the executive order, public health
officials inspected the clinic shown in the televised report, Delta
Women's Health Clinic, but found no cause for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started out saying they'd inspect all kinds of medical
offices, but when doctors objected, they said it would only be
tattoo parlors, body-piercing places and abortion clinics,'' said
Margie Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a New York advocacy group that is among those filing the
complaint. ``There's no health reason to single out abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't know about the veracity of the film, I do know
they had inspected this very clinic four months earlier and found
everything in order,'' Ms. Kelly said. ``And the day the order was
issued, they did another surprise inspection and found nothing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said only the Delta Women's Clinic has been inspected,
and no further surprise inspections were likely unless there are
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive order is broad, intentionally, to allow us to go
in and inspect any facility where we need to protect health, which
would include tattooing parlors, ear-piercing places or medical
offices,'' Williams said. ``But we're not going to go around
busting down doors to get into places where we haven't had any
complaints. This was an emergency situation, but we basically want
to leave the issue to be dealt with by the legislators in their
upcoming session, if they think there's a need.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing enforcement of the
executive order, and awarding damages to the Delta Women's Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the clinic could not be reached.

OLIVETTI TO CONSIDER BID FOR TELECOM ITALIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ROME _ Olivetti SpA, the No. 2 Italian telephone company, said
Friday that its board would meet Sunday to discuss a $60 billion
bid to acquire its domestic rival, Telecom Italia &UR; ,  &LR; which is seven
times Olivetti's size.
</P>
<P>
   The bid, if carried out, would be the biggest financial
transaction ever in the European telecommunications industry, and
the first hostile takeover attempt against any of Europe's big
formerly government-owned telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Olivetti board meets, a letter will be sent to Telecom
Italia outlining the bid. Whatever form the offer takes, though, it
is sure to be complicated. People close to the company said it
would be a tender offer for all shares.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be contingent upon Olivetti selling its interests
in two properties _ Infostrada, a new fixed-line operation, and
Omnitel Pronto Italia, a mobile phone provider _ for about $10
billion to Mannesmann AG of Germany, said people close to the
companies. Mannesmann shareholders would have to approve those
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is also expected to be financed in part by
issuing additional shares and through debt. Olivetti has secured
financing from several investment banks, some of which are advising
it on the takeover as well. These include Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, Lehman Brothers, Italy's Mediobanca and Chase Manhattan
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Olivetti's board would discuss a
``significant strategic financial operation'' on Sunday sent
Olivetti shares surging 8.4 percent on the Milan stock exchange, as
speculation rose that it was set to initiate the bid for its far
larger rival. The reports pushed Olivetti's share price up 26 cents
of a euro, to 3.25 euros. Telecom Italia shares were also up, by
2.4 percent, to 9.09 euros.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the first move of a complex strategy, Olivetti
announced earlier Friday that it had pocketed $375 million from
Mannesmann in exchange for a 12.4 percent stake in Oliman NV, the
Netherlands-based holding company that controls Omnitel and
Infostrada. The deal raised Mannesmann's stake in Oliman to 49.9
percent, with the remainder held by Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Should a deal be approved, the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported Friday, Olivetti might also raise additional cash by
selling Telecom Italia assets.
</P>
<P>
   According to the reports here, Olivetti's chief executive,
Roberto Colaninno, has assembled a consortium of Italian and
international investors to bid for Telecom. The board of Olivetti,
which is based in the northern Italian city of Ivrea, is expected
to approve the plans in its meeting Sunday. The company said the
decision regarding Telecom Italia was the only thing on the board's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the companies said representatives of Olivetti
had recently contacted Italian government officials and several
Telecom Italia board members seeking support for the takeover.
Telecom Italia's board members are believed to be willing to
consider an offer, but no commitments have been made, these people
said. Government officials have not publicly given Olivetti their
blessing, but they, too, are said to be keeping open minds.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover attempt, if approved by the board, is not
guaranteed success. It is likely to run into resistance from Franco
Bernabe, the tough former head of the big Italian oil company Eni,
who took the reins at Telecom late last year as part of a
management shakeup _ the third in 18 months. Bernabe has not been
involved in merger discussions with executives at Olivetti, people
close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is far from over,'' said one person close to Telecom
Italia. ``It has just begun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal could also encounter bitter resistance from Telecom
Italia's current major shareholders, who include the powerful
Agnelli family of Fiat. Nor is it known whether other bidders might
join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government, which retains a crucial 3.4 percent
stake in Telecom Italia, the national phone company before its
privatization, would have to approve any such deal. And government
approval would probably help any investor group overcome eventual
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the concerns of government officials, said a person close
the companies, was that Telecom Italia remain an Italian concern. A
handful of foreign companies have had informal discussions with
Telecom Italia, including Vodafone Group PLC, which recently agreed
to acquire Airtouch Communications, the largest wireless company in
the United States. Telecom Italia was interested in Vodafone, but
those talks went nowhere, said the person.
</P>
<P>
   Massimo D'Alema, the Italian prime minister, told reporters
Friday evening that Olivetti executives ``may be biting off more
than they can chew.'' But he said the government would evaluate the
bid, and he added: ``I'd like to express my appreciation of their
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has said repeatedly that the government would divest
itself of its remaining ``golden share'' sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Telecom Italia would not confirm the reports.
Olivetti, in a statement, said only that any question regarding
Telecom Italia ``is a matter exclusively for the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti generates more than two-thirds of its $3.95 billion in
annual revenues from its phone businesses, which it controls
together with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   For the Italian government, the takeover could be a welcome way
of leading the company, the world's sixth-largest phone company, to
a more stable management path. Colaninno is expected to refocus
Telecom, increase efficiency and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal would also help redesign the landscape of the
European telephone business by affording Mannesmann a gateway to
the southern European phone market. Mannesmann, once noted for
steel pipes and heavy machinery, has emerged in recent years as a
powerful telecommunications group and the main challenger to
Europe's largest phone company, Deutsche Telekom AG.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, rumors of an impending deal had
swirled around Olivetti, despite the company's insistence that
reports of a takeover of Telecom Italia were ``unfounded and
impracticable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian stock market regulator, Consob, said Friday that it
was examining that denial in the light of the day's developments.
It added that it had opened an inquiry into possible insider
trading of Telecom Italia shares because of especially heavy
trading on Thursday, when roughly two percent of Olivetti's total
capitalization, or about $1 billion, changed hands.

CLINTON HOPES `PRESIDENCY HAS NOT BEEN HARMED' BY SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Appearing weary and pensive, President Clinton said
Friday the Constitution was ``in effect re-ratified'' by the
impeachment process that finally acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, joined by French President Jacques Chirac, held his
first news conference since the Senate last week rejected charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice made by House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president also renewed his endorsement of his wife, first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, should she decide to run for the
Senate from New York, saying she would ``do a fabulous job.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked if he had learned any lessons following
the ordeal of his 13-month scandal involving his affair with a
former White House intern and his attempts to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've learned a lot of personal lessons, most of
which I have already discussed. And presidents are people, too. I
have learned, again, an enormous amount of respect for our
Constitution, our framers and for the American people,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution has been, in effect, re-ratified. And
I hope that the presidency has not been harmed. I don't believe it
has been,'' Clinton said. ``I can't say that I think this has been
good for the country. But we will see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate failed to muster a majority vote for the two
impeachment charges. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to
remove a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Andrew Johnson are the only two presidents to be
impeached and tried by the Senate. Both were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he expected to ``have two good years'' left at the
White House and again called on Congress to join with him in
getting back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people expect the Congress and me to get
back to work, expect us either not to have any destructive
feelings, or, if we do, not to let them get in the way of our doing
their business,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac remained silent as Clinton answered the personal
questions but earlier this week voiced support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared tired and somber as he spent the day in
meetings with Chirac. Clinton and other European leaders have
threatened to use force against Yugoslavia for blocking a peace
agreement with its province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cautioned against pressing his wife to make a quick
decision about whether to run for the Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has just been through a very exhausting year,'' Clinton
said. ``I think some time needs to be taken here.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the first lady's political ambitions have hit
a fever pitch as she acknowledged publicly for the first time this
week that she is considering entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   She met with retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan on Friday and
plans to travel to Long Island on Saturday. Moynihan provided the
first lady with demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I would support her if she did (run),'' said
Moynihan, who has been an occasional critic of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he, too, would back the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be strongly supportive of whatever decision she makes
and will do all I can to help, on this and any other decision, from
now on, just as she's helped me for the last 20-plus years,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his advice to his wife has been ``to take some
time, get some rest, listen to people on both sides of the
argument, and decide exactly what you think is right to do. And
then whatever she decides, I'll be for.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, considered a Republican
prospect for the Senate, said he has ``great respect'' for the
president and first lady but added that she should be given time to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN, Giuliani said, ``I don't know her philosophy,
but I think should we run against each other there would be some
very, very big differences in terms of issues and positions.''

 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Let's get one thing clear: Merton H. Miller was not a
partner in Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   That was Robert C. Merton, another Nobel laureate in economics,
who helped found the giant hedge fund with Miller's former student
Myron S. Scholes, also a Nobel laureate.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have confused the two Mertons; even The
Financial Times has slipped up. ``I was speaking to a Chinese
official and he said, `How could you invest in Long-Term?' ''
Merton Miller said the other day in his office at the University of
Chicago, where he is professor emeritus at the graduate school of
business. ``I said I didn't invest in Long-Term Capital. I make my
money writing about the market, not participating in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing about it or talking about it, Miller has made his mark
as both a scholar and a curmudgeon. He almost seems to specialize
in defending economic gadflies and espousing unorthodox views.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Miller, 75, plans to tell Congress that there are no
new lessons to be learned from Long-Term Capital's near-collapse
last August. After all, everybody knows that there are risks in the
marketplace and that bigger bets lead to bigger risks. In his view,
Long-Term Capital demonstrated nothing more than that there are
winners and losers _ and that the losers can even own a Nobel
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge of economics is no guarantee of financial success,''
he said. ``They are two separate skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the same point last month in a speech honoring Scholes,
noting that other great economists, including John Maynard Keynes,
had to be bailed out of personal financial debacles.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter regulation of derivatives, Miller says, would probably
do more harm than good, particularly if it came from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. ``In any rational universe, they would
have blown that agency up many years ago,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   That's vintage Miller. With his mane of white hair, piercing
blue eyes, frayed eyebrows and tart tongue, he is a formidable
presence in the classroom. Yet he also has his whimsical side. He
lists on his resume that he is a season ticket holder for the
Chicago Bears. And he has a taste for striped suspenders, European
beer and sumo wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   In his office, a sumo-wrestling calendar is tacked onto a board
that is also crammed with graphs, charts, formulas and Nobel
prize-winning thoughts scrawled in sentences that are
incomprehensible to the untrained eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sumo wrestling is wonderful; there's a lot of subtlety to
it,'' he said. ``I've read a book on it, too. Just like a
professor: Whenever we like something we read a book.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, who married one of his students 29 years ago,
certainly doesn't cloister himself in an ivory tower. Indeed, he
sometimes seems to court controversy. Next month, he will be one of
five Nobel winners taking part in a discussion of the global
economy; the session will be moderated by Michael R. Milken, the
junk-bond king of the 1980s who spent 22 months in prison for
securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Milken, he said, is a ``good man,'' a ``victim of prosecutorial
excess'' and the government's penchant for sticking its fingers
into an efficient market system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't convicted of insider trading; he was convicted of
parking stock,'' Miller grumbled. ``Someone asked me if parking was
serious. Well, it's a little more serious than double parking.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller knows a little something about the law, being the son of
a Boston lawyer. His mother was a ``career woman,'' he said, and he
was her career, an only son who admired Clarence Darrow but who
studied economics at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Economics really didn't come to life for him until the summer he
spent at the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York in
1943. ``I had the great fortune of sitting in my office one day and
this big hulking fellow said, `Anyone interested in having
lunch?''' The big hulking fellow was George Stigler, later a
professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the
business school's first Nobel laureate. The two became fast
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's second mentor was Fritz Machlup, a prominent economist,
who lured him to Johns Hopkins, where he received his PhD. Later,
at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie-Mellon), he worked with Franco
Modigliani, who would win a Nobel in 1985, on a problem in
corporate finance. They were co-authors of a study in 1958 (the
``M&AMP;M Propositions'' on valuing corporations), which eventually led
to Miller's Nobel, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Miller later turned his attention to derivatives. And when the
stock market crashed in 1987 and some experts blamed derivatives
trading in Chicago, he took part in a study that absolved
derivatives of blame.
</P>
<P>
   His own disciples can feel the sting of his disapproval if they
stray from his free-market convictions. Two former students, whose
analysis of the NASDAQ market led to a class-action lawsuit that
accused Wall Street firms of price fixing and ultimately to a $1
billion settlement last year, found that out.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed their findings with his own study and called their
study ``bad science,'' arguing that the NASDAQ market wasn't
corrupt, but that it simply operated on different principles than
the New York Stock Exchange did.
</P>
<P>
   One of the authors, Professor William L. Christie at Vanderbilt
University, said that was just like Miller. ``To some extent, he's
out of step,'' Christie said. ``I'm not saying he's dishonest, but
things can be twisted to make the free-market view seem right.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller scoffs at the notion that he twists things, saying it's
the science, not the theory, that's compelling. ``I've seen the
government firsthand,'' he said. ``And most of what passes for
regulation is just protectionism.'' He added: ``Look, we are not
anarchists; we stop at red lights. But when I do the calculation,
the costs of regulation often far exceed the benefits.''

   Is There a Lonely Heart For Every Deal on Wall St.? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, an article in the Money &AMP; Business section
described the work of Janis Spindel, a matchmaker who charges busy
Wall Street executives $10,000 to be set up on a dozen dates over
the course of a year. (That's the fee for men; women, who seem to
need less help, pay half.)
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, the author of the article was
besieged with 40 phone calls from romance-hungry readers or their
anxious kin. The supplicants ranged from a 29-year-old tax lawyer
in Chicago who thought he might try his luck, despite the distance,
to an investment banker at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette with an
exceedingly quiet social life _ ``but I got a big bonus last
year,'' he said with enthusiasm. Then there was the 74-year-old
woman who wondered if ``any of these nice boys had grandfathers.''
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing pattern emerged: Women tended to ramble on about
their love lives and explain why they were seeking Ms. Spindel's
services, while men left curt messages giving only their names,
phone numbers and exhortations to return their calls promptly.
</P>
<P>
   One woman _ with a single daughter at Morgan Stanley _ called
from Boca Raton, Fla. ``But please, please don't use my name,'' she
said. ``My daughter would be so mad at me. She's successful,
good-looking and having a hard time finding a quality person out
there. So I thought I would do a little detective work. Call me
your typical Jewish mother.'' And who would pay the fee? ``Oh I
would,'' she said. ``And don't you tell.''
</P>

   A Friendship Gone Flat  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a small world after all. After a lawsuit by a Maryland
distributor against Coca-Cola Enterprises _ accusing it of unfair
pricing moves, fraud and other offenses _ was publicized last
month, the bottler enlisted John H. Downs Jr., a 12-year veteran of
its public affairs office, to answer questions from the news media.
As it turns out, Downs and the plaintiff, the B.K. Miller Co., go
back a way.
</P>
<P>
   Downs' father was a county official from Anne Arundel County,
Md., where B.K. Miller is based, and David Miller, B.K. Miller's
president, said his family and the Downses had known each other for
years.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother, Thomas V. Miller, the company's lawyer and
the president of the Maryland Senate, had been especially friendly
with Downs. Before filing his lawsuit, he added, he called Downs to
see if things could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Downs told him that he ``didn't have much to do with sales,''
Miller said. ``So when he re-emerges as their spokesman, this
public relations expert who dogs me in the press, that was
disconcerting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs shrugged off the connection, calling the Millers
``acquaintances.'' Coca-Cola Enterprises says the lawsuit, filed in
1997, is without merit.
</P>
<P>

   Practicing What He Preaches? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If all gamblers were like Gary Loveman, the chief financial
officer of Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the casino empire, Loveman
wouldn't have much to oversee. The most he ever won at the betting
table was $180 in blackjack at Caesars Palace. And the most he
lost? ``Probably $100, never more. I'm a pretty lame customer.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he was taking money away from the competition; Caesars
is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. But the real
value that Loveman, 38, brings to the job he took last March is his
commitment to fostering customer loyalty _ ``the service-profit
chain,'' as he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem casinos face, in his view, is the fickleness
of gamblers. When they are on a losing streak _ and most usually
are _ they tend to head for the exits to try their luck elsewhere.
``If you ask a customer, `How are you doing tonight?' most will
say, `I'm losing,' because they are,'' he said. ``We've never
taught the employee how to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He would like to stem the exodus by giving even low-level
employees the authority to dole out coupons for free drinks, chips
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Loveman has already made a mark at Harrah's, helping to
orchestrate its purchase last month of the Rio Hotel and Casino in
Las Vegas, Nev., for $890 million and playing a role in the
company's investment last July in a new airline to ferry visitors
to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, he was a consultant and a professor at the
Harvard Business School with little hands-on experience. ``I had
spent a great deal of time dispensing advice,'' he said in a phone
interview from somewhere in the sky on Harrah's private Hawker
800-XP jet. ``There comes a time to see if you can actually do what
you tell others to do.''

 &HT;    Murder-suicide stuns Texas community
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell
 &HT;   c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Justice of the Peace Jimmy Bitz knew Joe
Ross Duncum from the Kiwanis Club, where they attended breakfast
meetings together and co-chaired the club's annual Special Olympics
event.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, Bitz drove to Duncum's house for an
unimaginable task _ to verify the death of Duncum, who shot and
killed his 16-month-old son before turning the shotgun on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy who'd do anything in the world for
you,'' Bitz said. ``I'm just sitting here like everyone else is,
trying to figure out why. We might never know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncum, a prominent Georgetown banker, had fired two blasts from
a 12-gauge shotgun shortly after sheriff's officers had entered his
home in the Serenada neighborhood west of Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who were responding to a report of family
violence, kicked open the locked door to the master bedroom.
Inside, they found the infant, Hunter, dead on the bed. Duncum, 44,
was lying several steps away, also dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after 4 a.m. Several hours later, stunned
business and civic leaders began breaking the distressing news of
the murder-suicide. Duncum was vice president of lending for
Walburg State Bank and treasurer of the Georgetown Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody we talk to is just utterly devastated,'' said Gordon
Baker, chairman-elect of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate reaction was, `I just talked to him the day
before,' or `I just talked to him the week before,' and then
literally there's just complete shock,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an act seems entirely out of character for a well-liked and
respected man known to all by his middle name, Ross, said Molly
Alexander, president of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the shock is so great because I never remember a time
when Ross didn't think he could get anything accomplished,'' she
said. ``When it comes from Ross, it usually came passionately.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and co-workers described Duncum as warm, compassionate
and competitive in a good-natured way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said we all have our demons,'' Alexander said with
tears in her eyes. ``We think we know people, but we obviously
didn't know him as well as we thought we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncum and his wife, Carmen Monique Duncum, were raising three
children in the home _ two teen-agers from Carmen Duncum's previous
marriage and Hunter, the only child they had together. Ross Duncum
has two children from a previous marriage, but they did not live
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Events began early Friday when Carmen Duncum, 38, arrived at the
Williamson County sheriff's office in Georgetown with a black eye,
bruises and a cut to her face, said Capt. Linda Bunte.
</P>
<P>
   After reporting her husband for assault, Carmen Duncum was taken
to Georgetown Hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries,
Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Duncum came to the door but wouldn't open it,'' Bunte
said. ``He kept talking to them through the door, but they couldn't
hear what he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers entered the home through an unlocked garage door,
and Duncum ran to the master bedroom. Officers were escorting
Carmen Duncum's two teen-agers out of the house when the first
gunshot sounded, Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers pounded on the door but received no response. A deputy
went outside to look through a bedroom window and, through a small
crack in the curtain, saw blood in the room, Bunte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, they kicked the door open and went in,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the room, investigators found Duncum lying across the
entrance to the master bathroom, where he had placed the gun to his
forehead and pulled the trigger, Bitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncum had a prior arrest in November 1997 for assaulting his
wife, Bunte said. Duncum completed anger-management counseling, and
his misdemeanor case was dismissed at the request of the county
attorney's office, Bitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty common in these assault issues. We try to fix
things instead of assess a penalty,'' Bitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncum worked in the downtown Georgetown branch of Walburg State
Bank, where he was hired in October 1997, said bank President Gene
Lawhon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked side by side for a year and a half. He'll definitely
be missed,'' said Lawhon. ``It's really a family matter. They have
our deepest sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncum was appointed to the chamber board on Jan. 1 and served
last year on the Urban Design Working Group, which produced
guidelines to help preserve Georgetown's small-town character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just devastated,'' said Jon Pfau, chamber of commerce
chairman. ``We've lost somebody who means a lot to us. We're all
praying for his family.''

 &HT;    Jasper jury `good, hardworking folks' set before tough task
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Every day, they slip silently into swivel chairs
in a stained-glass courtroom to hear more chapters in the bloody
tale that shook America's soul last summer.
</P>
<P>
   These are the 12 Jasper County residents who must decide whether
the white man across the room dragged a black man behind a truck
until his head was sheared off.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors in the trial of John William ``Bill'' King keep
solemn faces, save for an occasional scowl or yawn. They did not
give much away during the first week of testimony, which ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all of them already have divulged to the court their
horror and hurt over the gruesome death last year of James Byrd Jr.
The 12 jurors shared their thoughts with court officials in
face-to-face and written interviews before being chosen to judge
the man accused of instigating what is believed to be one of
America's most brutal race killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saddened because no one deserves to die in that
manner,'' one juror told the court. ``It made me mad, sad and
ashamed,'' said another. ``I thought it was awful,'' said a third.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors reacted much like the rest of the nation. And, in
many other respects, the mostly middle-aged jurors appear to
represent mainstream Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are good, normal, hardworking folks,'' said Guy James
Gray, Jasper County district attorney. ``The system has worked for
them. They all have had good jobs and a permanent residence.''
</P>
<P>
   They are paper mill workers, office workers, teachers,
homemakers. One is a state government employee. Another is a
corrections officer. One is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Most belong to the Baptist church; most are married with
children; most have hobbies like hunting, fishing or gardening that
get them out of the house; and most believe honesty and respect are
the most important values to teach a child.
</P>
<P>
   Their pop culture choices are as wide-ranging as the marketplace
of ideas. The last movie they saw ranged from ``Parent Trap'' to
``Die Hard'' to ``Shakespeare in Love.'' The juror who saw that
movie offered a quick review: ``great.'' Their favorite TV shows
vary from ``MASH'' to ``Law and Order'' to ``Jerry Springer,'' but
most seem to prefer the nonfiction aspect of the Discovery Channel,
news magazines and cooking shows.
</P>
<P>
   All keep their cars clean of bumper stickers and say the people
they respect the most are the people closest to their hearts _
their spouse, parents, pastor or friends. One juror listed himself
as one of the three people he most respects.
</P>
<P>
   Most support the death penalty. ``Do the crime, do the time,''
one juror said. ``The death penalty is here for a reason if you
take a life give a life.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few have mixed emotions and are unsure if they can send a
criminal to the death chamber. ``I possibly could accept it, under
undeniable circumstances, if that is what law dictates,'' one told
the court. ``However, I have to be able to judge myself and my
decision in an irrevocable way for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all said they wanted to serve on the jury that will
decide whether King, 24, an alleged white supremacist, killed Byrd
as a hate crime. If convicted, King could be sentenced to death by
letal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is composed of six white men, five white women and one
black man. State District Judge Joe Bob Golden has ordered the
names and photographs of the jurors be protected from public
disclosure during the trial. Testimony is scheduled to resume
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the strong emotional reaction that nine jurors had
after learning of Byrd's murder does not present a
conflict-of-interest for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in the world would have the same kind of
reaction to this type of crime,'' he said. ``It's not a legal
disqualification to have a feeling like that. If so, you could
never get a jury in a bad murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a shocking, emotional response to a crime does not mean
that you've formed an opinion on a defendant being tried,'' Gray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all 12 jurors told the court they believe a defendant is
innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But one legal expert said the jurors' initial reaction to the
crime will not be left at home when they begin to deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People end up carrying their first reaction into the jury
room,'' said David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who
specializes in the death penalty and constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be surprised if the jury doesn't convict him,'' Dow
said, because of ``the fact that they are anxious to serve, and No.
2, the fact they admitted to having a strong reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow said it is common for potential jurors to say they can lay
aside their emotions and judge the defendant on the facts. But, in
reality, jurors have trouble doing that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the surveys also indicate is that most people believe
that when somebody is arrested, he probably did what he was
arrested for,'' Dow said. ``So, I think juries pay a lot of lip
service to the presumption of innocence, but it is not necessarily
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   And, because statistics show few white defendants are sentenced
to death for killing a black person, Dow said he believes King may
receive a life sentence from this jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, you can count the number of white death row inmates
who were sent there for killing a black on one hand,'' he said. ``I
must say if there is actually a death sentence in this case, I will
be surprised based on there being 11 whites on the jury.''

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He grunts, he's accident prone, and he's always
got a witty _ and inappropriate _ remark stashed in his tool belt.
</P>
<P>
   She obsesses, she complains, and she's sometimes the only voice
of sanity in a family whose antics all too often mimic real life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Home Improvement'' has kept viewers laughing for eight
seasons, but Tuesday night they also want to make viewers think.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-part episode (8 p.m. Tuesday and March 2), Jill and Tim
Taylor are headed to the hospital again, only this time it's not to
patch up another one of Tim's boo-boos.
</P>
<P>
   Jill's the one on the examination table, hearing the same words
more than a quarter of all American women already have faced by
their 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jill has to have a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a devastating discovery. And the woman who plays Jill
knows from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have a partial hysterectomy about two to three years
into doing the show,'' said Patricia Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do any research, I knew all about it,''
Richardson said. ``My mother had to have a total hysterectomy when
I was growing up, and I remember very clearly _ I was in high
school _ being alarmed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing development of alternative methods to treat the
problems that lead to a hysterectomy, surgical removal of the
uterus remains one of the most frequently performed major surgeries
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason to perform a hysterectomy (about 30
percent) is to remove uterine fibroids, the same reason Jill
Taylor's doctor prescribes a hysterectomy on the show. While
scientists are still mystified by the cause of fibroids, most often
the abnormal growths composed of muscular and fibrous tissues are
benign. In fact, researchers have suggested that between 40 percent
and 75 percent of women may develop fibroids sometime over a
lifetime _ and the majority of them may never know or be affected
by it.
</P>
<P>
   But in some women, untreated fibroids may continue to grow, or
cause excessive menstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort or pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very symptoms were Jill Taylor's first warning signs that
something was wrong. By the time the two-part episode ends, doctors
will have discovered additional growths _ dermoid cysts _ on her
ovaries. And a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) as well
as an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is performed, sending
42-year-old Jill into early menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleaned me out. He gutted me like a fish,'' Jill moans when
she finds out after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have been through Jill's experience say the show's
writers were on target: The emotional toll of a hysterectomy can be
as drastic as the physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women feel a hysterectomy is taking a vital part of their
body away from them and subtracting their femininity or their
womanhood,'' said Joan Kenley, a psychologist who co-authored
``Whose Body Is It Anyway?'' after having a partial hysterectomy
when she was in her 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women get depressed afterward, even if they choose
hormone replacement therapy. Some women can't have orgasms ... and
some people have a mystical connection to their womb and feel a
huge sense of loss,'' Kenley said. ``On the other hand, there are
women who still feel the energy, still feel feminine, functional
and are even more orgasmic after a hysterectomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Say doctors, the best bet often is to keep organs intact if at
all possible. Medical research has come up with a multitude of
options for most women with fibroids, and, if detected early
enough, they can be treated without the major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't these options 10 years ago. It was a
hysterectomy or nothing,'' said Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, patients are less and less inclined to have
hysterectomies,'' DeCherney said. ``So alternatives are found. And
if it means less surgery, if you can have something that's less
invasive, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Endometrial ablation, or removing the lining inside the uterus,
is one of the more common methods to stop excessive bleeding, said
Dr. Donna Shoupe, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the USC
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The lining may be destroyed by cauterization. Or, in Shoupe's
clinical trial on a new outpatient procedure, the lining is
destroyed by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   In cases with significant fibroids, a myomectomy _ the removal
of the fibroid, but not the surrounding organs _ is often the first
stop before leaping to a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   And in some instances, medications can help temporarily shrink
larger fibroids to increase the options for treatment, said
DeCherney.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors, however, caution that the show's portrayal of
Jill's case is somewhat unrealistic. While a two-year lapse in
gynecological visits could be enough time to allow a fibroid to
grow large enough to require surgery, it is highly unusual for
doctors to discover dermoid cysts on a woman's ovaries amid surgery
_ and then have them so entangled that the ovary must be removed,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're diagnosed when they're a teen-ager,''
DeCherney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have fibroids !ital!and!off! dermoid cysts? That's a lot of
disease to have,'' Shoupe said. ``But I'm glad they did it
(oophorectomy) with some explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's television. And we are in the middle of a sweeps period,
when every network's pulling out all the stops to boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, both doctors say ``Home Improvement's''
exploration of this common female experience should be a loud
reminder to get checkups at least annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Taylor laments on the show that she'd been too busy raising
a family and earning a master's degree to see her doctor in almost
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women know they have fibroids. It's very reasonable
to follow them, to keep track of their growth from year to year,''
Shoupe said. ``Sometimes they're even placed on medication, like
birth control pills, that prevent them from growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different solutions and many different options
now,'' she said.

NEC ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING, 11,600 JOBS TO BE ELIMINATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ NEC Corp., one of the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturers and an emblem of Japan's business success, announced
a broad restructuring Friday that will include one of the most
sweeping labor reductions ever undertaken by a major Japanese
company.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring, which will cause the elimination of 11,600
jobs, including 9,000 in Japan, could lead to sharp changes in
NEC's strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   NEC also greatly increased its estimate of losses it expects for
the current fiscal year, which ends March 31. It forecast a group
net loss of 150 billion yen, or $1.3 billion, well above its
previous forecast of a deficit of 35 billion yen. The company
expects sales to decline 4 percent, to 4.7 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Friday's announcements, NEC announced a management
overhaul, which had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of the 9,000 jobs in Japan, to be achieved
through attrition and early retirement over the next three years,
will be one of the biggest single employment cutbacks announced
here, even during a year in which many companies have cut workers.
</P>
<P>
   The reverberations will no doubt be closely watched by the rest
of corporate Japan, which has been struggling to overhaul itself
under the constraints of a tradition of lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the job cuts will come largely from NEC's
operations in Asia and Ireland. NEC had earlier cut 3,000 jobs at
its Packard Bell NEC subsidiary and 400 jobs at NEC Electronics, a
subsidiary in California.
</P>
<P>
   NEC has been slower than its competitors to address its
structural problems, in part because it was the last of the major
high-technology companies here to feel the pain of excess capacity,
falling semiconductor and personal computer prices and over
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Toshiba and Hitachi have embarked on overhauls that are
significant by Japanese standards, and Fujitsu revamped its
operations some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's announcement left no doubt that NEC plans to move
quickly to correct its problems.
</P>
<P>
   The one lingering area of concern is likely to be the company's
personal computer business, which has been losing market share in
Japan and has stumbled badly in the United States at Packard Bell
NEC.
</P>
<P>
   NEC said it would write off 189 billion yen, or about $1.6
billion, of its more than $1.8 billion investment in Packard Bell
and pay $450 million to buy 80 percent of Packard Bell's European
operations, which effectively amounts to yet another cash infusion
for the troubled unit.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell's European operations, which are profitable and
growing, will be brought directly under NEC's control. Bull SA,
NEC's partner in Packard Bell, will take a 20 percent stake in the
European business.
</P>
<P>
   NEC said Packard Bell had already benefited from restructuring
measures taken in the last year, including the layoffs and a
sharper focus on selling products with higher profit margins. It
estimated that the subsidiary would lose $80 million in the current
fiscal year, compared with a $500 million loss in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   NEC also unveiled a potentially significant change in its
boardroom. Hajime Sasaki, the senior executive vice president in
charge of its semiconductor business and a favorite among foreign
analysts and investors, will become the company's new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And Kouji Nishigaki, the executive vice president who heads up
its systems integration business, will become president, replacing
Hisashi Kaneko, whose job has been in question since NEC became
embroiled in a major military-procurement scandal last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The choice of Nishigaki as president suggests that NEC plans to
increase its emphasis on value-added services like those offered by
Fujitsu, IBM, Cisco Systems and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has worked hard to build its systems integration
business _ the integration of computers and communications
capabilities _ but it has always been known more as a maker of
computers, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment _
products that are rapidly becoming commodities with razor-thin
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   NEC said it would continue to develop the nuts-and-bolts
businesses that support systems integration, but warned that some
of those operations have ``insufficiently clear long-term profit
potential.'' Those businesses, the company said, would be
reorganized, sold or spun off.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki, who, having run NEC's U.S. operations, has a good
understanding of the standards by which Western companies are
judged may push the company toward adopting some of those same
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Thursday that it hoped to bring its
debt-to-equity ratio down to 1.5 to 1, from the current 1.87 to 1,
and to raise its return on equity to 15 percent, a target almost
never mentioned by Japanese companies.

 &HT;    Military officer's name finally cleared after posthumous pardon
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the last half of his life, Lt. Henry O.
Flipper traveled to Washington almost every year to urge Congress
to overturn his dishonorable discharge from the Army in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper, who was born into slavery in Thomasville, Ga., in 1856
and died in Atlanta in 1940 at the age of 84, never lived to see
his quest realized.
</P>
<P>
   But his 117-year search for justice finally ended Friday when
President Clinton pardoned Flipper posthumously, erasing the stigma
on an extraordinary military and professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper was the first black graduate of West Point and the
Army's first black commissioned officer before his dishonorable
discharge on trumped-up charges.
</P>
<P>
   Four generations of Flipper's descendents from six states
gathered in the White House as Clinton inked his name to the
presidential pardon, the first posthumous pardon ever given by a
U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ceremony is about a moment in 1882 when our government
did not do all it could to protect an individual American's
freedom,'' Clinton said. ``This good man has now completely
recovered his good name.''
</P>
<P>
   William King, a doctor whose mother in Valdosta began her own
campaign to clear Flipper's name in 1975, told Clinton the family's
struggle had been ``a long journey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can find a lot of anger in any members of
the family,'' King said. ``We learned from Lt. Flipper that anger
will not get you anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The blot on Flipper's military record stemmed from a charge that
he embezzled commissary funds while stationed at Fort Davis, Texas.
Flipper was acquitted of the embezzlement charge but convicted of
conduct unbecoming an officer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, thanks to the efforts of King's mother, Irsle King, and
Ray MacColl, a white teacher from southwest Georgia, the military
reversed the dishonorable discharge that resulted from the
conviction. But the Army Board for Correction of Military Records
had no authority to expunge the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, lawyers at a large Washington law office got involved
and began the legal case to win Flipper a presidential pardon,
filing a formal petition of pardon in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Smith, a partner at Arnold &AMP; Porter and a West Point
graduate, said he wanted to win the pardon in part to show military
men and women that past wrongs can be righted.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 16 descendants who attended Friday's ceremony ever
knew their trail-blazing relative. But most grew up with the
stories of his perseverance and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper graduated from West Point against seemingly
insurmountable odds. He was shunned by his fellow cadets and
endured a largely solitary life on the banks of the Hudson River.
Flipper wrote an autobiography of his experience at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, Flipper pursued a prolific career as an
engineer and land surveyor in the western United States and in
Mexico, later serving as a special agent with the Justice
Department's Court of Private Land Claims. He spoke French and
Spanish and wrote two more books.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper's story inspired William Davis, a great-grandnephew, to
attend the Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the burdens that he carried and what he did and
then I stop complaining,'' said Davis, now a Delta pilot from
Dallas. ``He had the character to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Flipper, another great-grandnephew, said he and his family
were told that Flipper never held any bitterness toward the Army,
even as he worked so many years to have his name cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure today he is smiling down on us and at last feeling
the reward and recognition for his service,'' said Carl Flipper.
``Justice has been denied Henry for too many years. But justice has
been done now.''

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He grunts, he's accident prone, and he's always
got a witty _ and inappropriate _ remark stashed in his tool belt.
</P>
<P>
   She obsesses, she complains, and she's sometimes the only voice
of sanity in a family whose antics all too often mimic real life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Home Improvement'' has kept viewers laughing for eight
seasons, but Tuesday night they also want to make viewers think.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-part episode (8 p.m. Tuesday and March 2), Jill and Tim
Taylor are headed to the hospital again, only this time it's not to
patch up another one of Tim's boo-boos.
</P>
<P>
   Jill's the one on the examination table, hearing the same words
more than a quarter of all American women already have faced by
their 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jill has to have a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a devastating discovery. And the woman who plays Jill
knows from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have a partial hysterectomy about two to three years
into doing the show,'' said Patricia Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do any research, I knew all about it,''
Richardson said. ``My mother had to have a total hysterectomy when
I was growing up, and I remember very clearly _ I was in high
school _ being alarmed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing development of alternative methods to treat the
problems that lead to a hysterectomy, surgical removal of the
uterus remains one of the most frequently performed major surgeries
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason to perform a hysterectomy (about 30
percent) is to remove uterine fibroids, the same reason Jill
Taylor's doctor prescribes a hysterectomy on the show. While
scientists are still mystified by the cause of fibroids, most often
the abnormal growths composed of muscular and fibrous tissues are
benign. In fact, researchers have suggested that between 40 percent
and 75 percent of women may develop fibroids sometime over a
lifetime _ and the majority of them may never know or be affected
by it.
</P>
<P>
   But in some women, untreated fibroids may continue to grow, or
cause excessive menstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort or pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very symptoms were Jill Taylor's first warning signs that
something was wrong. By the time the two-part episode ends, doctors
will have discovered additional growths _ dermoid cysts _ on her
ovaries. And a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) as well
as an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is performed, sending
42-year-old Jill into early menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleaned me out. He gutted me like a fish,'' Jill moans when
she finds out after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have been through Jill's experience say the show's
writers were on target: The emotional toll of a hysterectomy can be
as drastic as the physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women feel a hysterectomy is taking a vital part of their
body away from them and subtracting their femininity or their
womanhood,'' said Joan Kenley, a psychologist who co-authored
``Whose Body Is It Anyway?'' after having a partial hysterectomy
when she was in her 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women get depressed afterward, even if they choose
hormone replacement therapy. Some women can't have orgasms ... and
some people have a mystical connection to their womb and feel a
huge sense of loss,'' Kenley said. ``On the other hand, there are
women who still feel the energy, still feel feminine, functional
and are even more orgasmic after a hysterectomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Say doctors, the best bet often is to keep organs intact if at
all possible. Medical research has come up with a multitude of
options for most women with fibroids, and, if detected early
enough, they can be treated without the major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't these options 10 years ago. It was a
hysterectomy or nothing,'' said Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, patients are less and less inclined to have
hysterectomies,'' DeCherney said. ``So alternatives are found. And
if it means less surgery, if you can have something that's less
invasive, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Endometrial ablation, or removing the lining inside the uterus,
is one of the more common methods to stop excessive bleeding, said
Dr. Donna Shoupe, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the USC
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The lining may be destroyed by cauterization. Or, in Shoupe's
clinical trial on a new outpatient procedure, the lining is
destroyed by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   In cases with significant fibroids, a myomectomy _ the removal
of the fibroid, but not the surrounding organs _ is often the first
stop before leaping to a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   And in some instances, medications can help temporarily shrink
larger fibroids to increase the options for treatment, said
DeCherney.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors, however, caution that the show's portrayal of
Jill's case is somewhat unrealistic. While a two-year lapse in
gynecological visits could be enough time to allow a fibroid to
grow large enough to require surgery, it is highly unusual for
doctors to discover dermoid cysts on a woman's ovaries amid surgery
_ and then have them so entangled that the ovary must be removed,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're diagnosed when they're a teen-ager,''
DeCherney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have fibroids !ital!and!off! dermoid cysts? That's a lot of
disease to have,'' Shoupe said. ``But I'm glad they did it
(oophorectomy) with some explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's television. And we are in the middle of a sweeps period,
when every network's pulling out all the stops to boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, both doctors say ``Home Improvement's''
exploration of this common female experience should be a loud
reminder to get checkups at least annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Taylor laments on the show that she'd been too busy raising
a family and earning a master's degree to see her doctor in almost
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women know they have fibroids. It's very reasonable
to follow them, to keep track of their growth from year to year,''
Shoupe said. ``Sometimes they're even placed on medication, like
birth control pills, that prevent them from growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different solutions and many different options
now,'' she said.

SUSPECT MAY HAVE SHARED CIGARETTE WITH VICTIM OF DRAGGING DEATH,
EXPERT SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A white supremacist may have shared a cigarette
with James Byrd Jr. just before the black man was chained to a
pickup and dragged to his death, a DNA expert testified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Baechtel, a forensics examiner with the FBI in Washington,
also told jurors in John William ``Bill'' King's capital murder
trial that Byrd's blood was found on shoes and clothing from King's
apartment, linking King and co-defendants Shawn Allen Berry, 24,
and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, to Byrd's killing June 7.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, could face death by injection if convicted. Berry and
Brewer will be tried separately later.
</P>
<P>
   Baechtel testified that a cigarette butt found at the crime
scene in a wooded area east of town contained King's genetic
blueprint, as well as someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``King was the primary smoker, and someone else took a drag off
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baechtel could not positively identify Byrd as the second
smoker, but he could not rule him out as he did Berry and Brewer.
He said it is easier to exclude an individual than it is to
positively identify someone when dealing with a small amount of
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The witness also testified that ``less than one drop'' of Byrd's
blood was found on the strap of King's sandal, and that the
victim's blood also was recovered from Berry's shirt, jeans and
boot, and from Brewer's tennis shoe.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Baechtel said it was possible, but not
likely, that the tiny speck of blood on the sandal could have been
spilled as investigators collected samples at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And he conceded that King and an unknown person could have
shared a cigarette earlier in the evening, and left it in the
ashtray of Berry's pickup. It later could have fallen to the ground
at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, 25-year-old Louis Berry, the brother of
co-defendant Shawn Berry, identified a cigarette lighter engraved
with King's prison nickname, ``Possum,'' and a triangular symbol of
the Ku Klux Klan, that was found at the crime scene. Louis Berry
said King had handed him the lighter at his apartment on the
afternoon before Byrd's killing, and he used it to light a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was the second witness this week to testify that the
lighter, which King has said he lost the week before, was at his
apartment June 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighter was lost a week or so before,'' Louis Berry
explained, ``but it was returned to him by Lawrence Brewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Berry also brought his own sandals to the courtroom to
distinguish them from King's, and he testified that a tennis shoe
with the initials ``L.B.'' written on the tongue was not his, but
Brewer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be way too small for me,'' Louis Berry said of the
shoe, which was found at King's apartment, where Louis Berry and
the three suspects were all staying the weekend Byrd was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Berry also testified that he had argued with King the
night of Byrd's killing because King didn't like the fact that
Berry's rock band includes a black bass player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand that,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone suggested you had anything to do with James Byrd's
murder ...'' asked federal prosecutor Johnny Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be wrong,'' Louis Berry answered. ``I don't agree
with it. I don't think that should happen to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see getting into a fight with somebody, or beating
someone up, but I don't agree with it. And the people I associate
with, friends and family, they don't agree with it either.''
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly white jury was sent home early Friday
afternoon and will return to court Monday. Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray estimates he will wrap up his part of the
case by noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he was pleased with the first week of testimony but
added, ``We've still got to prove Mr. Byrd was alive when they
chained him to the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said the condition of Byrd's remains indicate
he was alive and fighting to keep his head off the pavement as he
was dragged down Huff Creek Road. If jurors believe that, they
could decide King kidnapped and killed Byrd. Both crimes must be
proved for a capital murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   King's attorneys refused to attend the regularly scheduled
afternoon news conference Friday, but Byrd's sister, Clara Taylor
of Houston, and his 28-year-old daughter, Renee Mullins of Hawaii,
approached the microphone to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we think the prosecutors have done an excellent job,''
Taylor said, ``but we know they have to prove kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said King should get the death penalty, but said she
would accept the jury's punishment decision, as long as King is
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said her mother, Stella Byrd, ``is very distraught and
upset'' but that the family's strong religious beliefs will see
them through the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that God can undo any harm in his own time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins said she hopes her father's death will not be used to
further divide the races, and she hopes he will be remembered as a
happy people person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never hurt anyone,'' she said of Byrd. ``He would talk to
you all day if you had the time. He was an entertainer. He played
dominoes. He loved to live.''

</P>
<P>
   And in some instances, medications can help temporarily shrink
larger fibroids to increase the options for treatment, said
DeCherney.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors, however, caution that the show's portrayal of
Jill's case is somewhat unrealistic. While a two-year lapse in
gynecological visits could be enough time to allow a fibroid to
grow large enough to require surgery, it is highly unusual for
doctors to discover dermoid cysts on a woman's ovaries amid surgery
_ and then have them so entangled that the ovary must be removed,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they're diagnosed when they're a teen-ager,''
DeCherney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have fibroids !ital!and!off! dermoid cysts? That's a lot of
disease to have,'' Shoupe said. ``But I'm glad they did it
(oophorectomy) with some explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's television. And we are in the middle of a sweeps period,
when every network's pulling out all the stops to boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, both doctors say ``Home Improvement's''
exploration of this common female experience should be a loud
reminder to get checkups at least annually.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Taylor laments on the show that she'd been too busy raising
a family and earning a master's degree to see her doctor in almost
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women know they have fibroids. It's very reasonable
to follow them, to keep track of their growth from year to year,''
Shoupe said. ``Sometimes they're even placed on medication, like
birth control pills, that prevent them from growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different solutions and many different options
now,'' she said.

`HOME IMPROVEMENT' DEALS WITH ISSUE, FEAR OF HYSTERECTOMY

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ He grunts, he's accident prone, and he's always
got a witty _ and inappropriate _ remark stashed in his tool belt.
</P>
<P>
   She obsesses, she complains, and she's sometimes the only voice
of sanity in a family whose antics all too often mimic real life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Home Improvement'' has kept viewers laughing for eight
seasons, but Tuesday night they also want to make viewers think.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-part episode (8 p.m. Tuesday and March 2), Jill and Tim
Taylor are headed to the hospital again, only this time it's not to
patch up another one of Tim's boo-boos.
</P>
<P>
   Jill's the one on the examination table, hearing the same words
more than a quarter of all American women already have faced by
their 60th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Jill has to have a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a devastating discovery. And the woman who plays Jill
knows from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have a partial hysterectomy about two to three years
into doing the show,'' said Patricia Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do any research, I knew all about it,''
Richardson said. ``My mother had to have a total hysterectomy when
I was growing up, and I remember very clearly _ I was in high
school _ being alarmed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite ongoing development of alternative methods to treat the
problems that lead to a hysterectomy, surgical removal of the
uterus remains one of the most frequently performed major surgeries
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason to perform a hysterectomy (about 30
percent) is to remove uterine fibroids, the same reason Jill
Taylor's doctor prescribes a hysterectomy on the show. While
scientists are still mystified by the cause of fibroids, most often
the abnormal growths composed of muscular and fibrous tissues are
benign. In fact, researchers have suggested that between 40 percent
and 75 percent of women may develop fibroids sometime over a
lifetime _ and the majority of them may never know or be affected
by it.
</P>
<P>
   But in some women, untreated fibroids may continue to grow, or
cause excessive menstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort or pain.
</P>
<P>
   Those very symptoms were Jill Taylor's first warning signs that
something was wrong. By the time the two-part episode ends, doctors
will have discovered additional growths _ dermoid cysts _ on her
ovaries. And a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) as well
as an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is performed, sending
42-year-old Jill into early menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleaned me out. He gutted me like a fish,'' Jill moans when
she finds out after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have been through Jill's experience say the show's
writers were on target: The emotional toll of a hysterectomy can be
as drastic as the physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women feel a hysterectomy is taking a vital part of their
body away from them and subtracting their femininity or their
womanhood,'' said Joan Kenley, a psychologist who co-authored
``Whose Body Is It Anyway?'' after having a partial hysterectomy
when she was in her 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women get depressed afterward, even if they choose
hormone replacement therapy. Some women can't have orgasms ... and
some people have a mystical connection to their womb and feel a
huge sense of loss,'' Kenley said. ``On the other hand, there are
women who still feel the energy, still feel feminine, functional
and are even more orgasmic after a hysterectomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Say doctors, the best bet often is to keep organs intact if at
all possible. Medical research has come up with a multitude of
options for most women with fibroids, and, if detected early
enough, they can be treated without the major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't these options 10 years ago. It was a
hysterectomy or nothing,'' said Dr. Alan DeCherney, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, patients are less and less inclined to have
hysterectomies,'' DeCherney said. ``So alternatives are found. And
if it means less surgery, if you can have something that's less
invasive, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Endometrial ablation, or removing the lining inside the uterus,
is one of the more common methods to stop excessive bleeding, said
Dr. Donna Shoupe, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the USC
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The lining may be destroyed by cauterization. Or, in Shoupe's
clinical trial on a new outpatient procedure, the lining is
destroyed by freezing.
</P>
<P>
   In cases with significant fibroids, a myomectomy _ the removal
of the fibroid, but not the surrounding organs _ is often the first
stop before leaping to a hysterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   And in some instances, medications can help temporarily shrink
larger fibroids to increase the options for treatment, said
DeCherney.
</P>
<P>
   Both doctors, however, caution that the show's portrayal of
Jill's case is somewhat unrealistic. While a two-year lapse in
gynecological visits could be enough time to allow a fibroid to
grow large enough to require surgery, it is highly unusual for

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty-nine years after his death, the first black
West Point graduate received a presidential pardon on Friday for a
crime that most who have studied the case say he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton granted the pardon to Henry O. Flipper, who
graduated from West Point in 1877 despite being ostracized by his
white classmates. He was court-martialed in 1881 on thievery
charges that appear to have been trumped up, then was drummed out
of the service the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome you all to an event that is 117 years overdue,''
Clinton said at a White House ceremony attended by several dozen
people, including military officers and Flipper's descendants.
Among those watching was Gen. Colin Powell, retired chairman of the
Joint Chief of Staffs, who has said that he kept a picture of
Flipper on his desk for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the Army had formally exonerated Flipper in
1976, changing his discharge to honorable and reburying him with
full honors in Thomasville, Ga., where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ceremony was largely symbolic, and Clinton embraced it
as ``a moment in 1999 when we correct the error and resolve to do
even better in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing remained to be done, and now it will be,'' the
president continued, holding a pen over the pardon document. ``This
good man now has completely recovered his good name.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Flipper's descendants applauded. ``Like the rest of
the family, I'm relieved that this has come full circle,'' said Dr.
William King, a great-nephew of Flipper. King's mother, Irsle
Flipper King, had been pushing for a pardon for some 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As a young second lieutenant, Flipper was accused of embezzling
some $2,500 in commissary money while he was stationed in Texas. He
was acquitted of that charge but found guilty of conduct unbecoming
an officer for lying to investigators and was given a dishonorable
discharge in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   Born a slave in 1856, Henry Ossian Flipper entered West Point
when he was 17. Most of his classmates were hostile to him, and he
lived in social isolation. When he graduated 50th in a class of 76
in 1877, he became the first black man commissioned as an officer
in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Flipper joined the 10th Cavalry, one of two all-black Army
units, at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma Territory. He soon perfected a
system for draining off the mosquito-infested stagnant water that
had caused malaria outbreaks at the fort for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After being transferred to Fort Davis, Texas, he ran afoul of
his commanding officer, who brought the charges that led to
court-martial. After reviewing the trial record, the judge advocate
general of the Army concluded that Flipper had been persecuted
because of his race, that the charges were dubious at best and that
leniency was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But under military procedures at the time, there was no judicial
process to set aside the conviction. The authority to affirm or
overturn the conviction rested with President Chester A. Arthur,
who chose to affirm it.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Army, Flipper became a civil and mining
engineer, working in the New Mexico and Arizona Territories. U.S.
Attorney Matthew Reynolds named him a special agent for the
Department of Justice, a post he held for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Reynolds wrote of Flipper's ``fidelity, integrity
and magnificent ability.'' Declaring that he did not believe
Flipper was guilty of the court-martial charges, Reynolds said he
had compiled a record ``of which any man might well be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Flipper became a special assistant to the secretary of the
interior, planning railroads in the Alaska Territory and was
employed by several large corporations as a mining engineer and an
expert on Mexican and South American mineral laws. He died in 1940
at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   Though it never became an international sensation, the Flipper
case was similar in broad ways to the Dreyfus affair in France.
Capt. Alfred Dreyfus, a French army officer, was court-martialed on
espionage charges in 1894. He was eventually exonerated, and most
historians believe the charges arose because he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Flipper's name is honored at the U.S. Military Academy,
where he endured so much. An annual award is given in his name to
an outstanding cadet, and a portion of the West Point library
honors him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With great pleasure and humility, I now offer a full pardon,''
Clinton said on Friday. Then he handed the pen to King, who held it
high in triumph as relatives crowded around the president.

KENYA'S FINANCE MINISTER VOWS TO KEEP REFORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The new finance minister of Kenya sought Friday
to reassure investors and donors of foreign aid that he would
continue on the path of fiscal reform a day after his
corruption-fighting predecessor quit in a major Cabinet shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   The statements from the new minister, Yekoyada F.O. Masakhalia,
seemed primarily aimed at the International Monetary Fund.
Officials from the fund are scheduled to visit Kenya this month to
decide whether to reinstate an important $205 million package of
financial aid that was frozen in 1997 largely because of corruption
and mismanagement of public money.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts here said they believed that the package would be
restored as a result of improved fiscal policies put into effect by
the departing finance minister, Simeon Nyachae. On Friday,
Masakhalia, 61, an economist with a master's degree from Harvard
University, said that he would seek few substantive changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize there will be no change to the
ongoing policy thrust,'' he said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Nyachae resigned Thursday in a surprise move. He is a leading
politician, often mentioned as a potential successor to President
Daniel arap Moi, who had, since he was appointed in January 1998,
cut government spending and brought down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He also waged a highly public battle against corruption, even
issuing the names of prominent Kenyans who had not repaid national
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   He quit the post rather than accept Moi's decision for him to
swap jobs with Masakhalia, who had been industrial development
minister. Moi shifted six other ministers and dismissed a few
others, notably Immigration Minister Frank Kwinga, whose department
controls arrivals like that of a Kurdish leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
Ocalan was smuggled into Kenya on Feb. 2 and sent to Turkey.

 S.F. Brewery Yanks Beer Ads in Harlem  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
A San Francisco brewery agreed this week to remove promotional
posters from liquor stores in Harlem after civil rights advocates
complained the ads were offensive and targeted poor, black people.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, promoting Steel Reserve High Gravity Lager, show
rhinoceroses and giant turtles fornicating next to the tag line
``Research Says Sex Sells Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   The beermaker, Steel Brewing Co., said it asked its New York
distributor to remove posters from liquor stores there. But the ads
remain posted in other liquor outlets around the country, including
in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Steel Brewing is owned by San Francisco's McKenzie River Co.,
which was fined in 1992 for violating federal alcohol-advertising
laws with ads for St. Ides malt liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Steel spokeswoman Gee Roman said the company has no regrets
about the campaign, which was developed in-house. ``We didn't
design the campaign to offend anyone. We're sorry if it offended
any person or any group.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman said High Gravity Lager is a ``general market beer,'' not
a malt liquor. But the alcohol content, 8.1 percent, is at the high
end for malt liquors. Beer averages 4.5 percent alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four-ounce containers of the Steel lager are sold at Bay
Area liquor stores for 99 cents, which is also a typical price and
size for malt liquors.
</P>
<P>
   Roman said Steel is not targeting any particular demographic
with its posters. But as a practical matter, malt liquor is
consumed primarily by young, low-income African Americans living in
urban areas, said Laurie Lieber, director of the Center on Alcohol
Advertising in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to go after inner-city youth because they're
very concentrated,'' said Lieber. ``Using point-of-sale materials
is a fraction of what it costs to go on the broadcast media and
reach middle-class people in their living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The beer and posters were distributed in September, drawing the
ire of community leaders such as the Rev. Calvin Butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see this in store windows on Park Avenue or in the
community of Scarsdale,'' Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to a head when representatives from Steel met
with New York City Councilman Bill Perkins recently and promised to
take the posters down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Perkins said the Steel executives dismissed the ads as
satire. ``They have no regard for the values and sensitivity for
our community,'' said Perkins. ``It's not funny _ especially when
it's posted across the street from an elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   If all posters are not removed, Perkins said he would call for a
boycott of Steel and any uncooperative liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle of Target Market News, a Chicago market research firm
specializing in black consumers, said the beer company is hurting
itself with the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of humor will never play well in the African
American community, particularly when there's a chance that
children will be exposed to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturer needs to really stop and look at how a
campaign like this will jeopardize a significant portion of their
business and create ill will with consumers.''

 EBay Halts Sales Of Guns, Ammo Over Internet  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Online auctioneer eBay said yesterday it will no longer allow the
sale of guns or ammunition, saying ``the Internet is not an
appropriate venue for this kind of merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose company said firearms sales had been an area of
``growing concern'' because online sellers cannot readily guarantee
that buyers meet all the qualifications and comply with the laws
governing firearms sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, the firearms categories were targeted
primarily to serious collectors,'' said Steve Westly, vice
president of marketing and business development at eBay. ``Now
we're starting to see standard-issue firearms that are not
collectible and are not appropriate for sale online.''
</P>
<P>
   Westly said he and other executives felt there was too little
control over the sale process to allow trading of these types of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some types of guns and ammunition are illegal to sell in some
states, for example. In addition, federal laws govern many aspects
of firearms purchases, including how certain weapons can be shipped
and who may purchase them.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, the leading online auction house, has been criticized
several times in recent months as law enforcement officials in at
least four states investigated the use of the service by con
artists.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has hosted some 49 million auctions since
1995, will still run auctions for gun-related goods such as
holsters, scopes, books and clothing. But beginning March 5, no
more gun or ammunition auctions will be allowed. EBay will stop
taking listings for those items on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   EBay has tried to address the problem of firearms sales before.
Last year, it moved the auctions to the ``adults only'' category
and began requiring credit card verification before allowing users
to buy or sell in that section.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent clampdown disappointed some eBay users, who were
vocal with their criticism on eBay message boards yesterday.

   ``It has been fun using eBay, and I have dealt with many nice
people, but I will no longer allow a company with a policy like
this to profit from my activities,'' said Will Middelaer, an eBay
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay has decided that firearms and other self-defense products
are unwelcome on their site. I have decided that eBay is not
welcome in my home,'' said user Harold Cook. ``There are other
auction sites that will provide the service, take eBay's place and
grow. So long, eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are users that are upset about this, but we
think it's the right thing to do,'' Westly responded.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EBAY20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Many of the largest online auction sites do not carry firearms,
or carry only limited listings. Yahoo Auctions and AuctionUniverse
carry collectible guns. Many sites, such as Excite Auctions and
AuctionAddict, have no gun category but may allow some firearms
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filter for firearms, ammunitions and guns, so when those
ads do come up, our staff can take a look at it and determine
whether it's appropriate,'' said an Excite spokeswoman. Like most
sites that allow firearms sales, Excite requires that sellers be
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded eBay's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just responsible retailing,'' said Jae Kim, who
follows Internet businesses for Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel.
``If eBay cannot guarantee with 100 percent assurance that the
people who are purchasing firearms should be allowed to possess
them, they shouldn't provide a forum for them to be marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you continue with firearms sales, it's not a question of if
something bad will happen, but when,'' said Mark Dodd, who runs
AuctionWatch, an online auction information service. ``As any
corporation gets big, it wants to cut out the fringe elements.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, eBay has instituted a number of policies aimed
at curbing fraud on its site. It's also providing insurance to
users through Lloyd's of London.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of guns and ammunition represent a tiny fraction of eBay's
overall business. Of nearly 1.6 million auctions yesterday, fewer
than 3,000 were for guns or ammunition.

 &HT;    Perez discloses Galarraga sounds 'real, real down'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ The emotions were still raw Friday
morning as Braves pitchers and catchers reported to the clubhouse
for workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was still very much shock that their first baseman
and resident ``Big Cat,'' Andres Galarraga, is fighting a form of
cancer named non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shook me,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``It felt like
it was me that was the one who got cancer. For one second, I felt
like I was in his position. ... We're all going to do the best we
can to try to win, so we can dedicate the season in the name of
Galarraga.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they are optimistic that Galarraga will recover
fully after a six-month course of chemotherapy and radiation
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another slap of reality,'' Tom Glavine said. ``Over the
last few years, as I've gotten older and become a parent, baseball
has taken on a different perspective. This is another example of
how there are bigger things in life than baseball. It's devastating
when you hear it. It puts baseball in its proper perspective. It's
hard to believe a guy in as good a shape as Cat is and as happy as
he is _ that's not a guy you'd think ends up getting sick like
this. But it goes to show nobody is immune from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux said, ``It's just sickening. It's brutal. You just
hope for the best for him and his family. You just hope he can
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   The news is especially hard on Latin players in the Braves
clubhouse, because of the guiding influence that Galarraga, a
native Venezuelan, had on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people look at the way he plays,'' said catcher Eddie
Perez, one of Galarraga's closest friends on the team. ``The way he
treats people. He's a great guy to have around. I'm really going to
miss him.... We have to play harder for him, make him feel proud of
us, happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez talked to Galarraga on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sound so good,'' Perez said. ``His wife was crying.
... I told him, `We'll be waiting for you here next year. You just
have to forget about baseball and think about your wife and kids.'
He sounds real, real down. He wanted me to say `hi' to everybody.
He said, `Have a good season for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Braves hitting coach Don Baylor, the man who helped revive
Galarraga's career as his manager in Colorado, already had
Galarraga's No. 14 written in white ink of the side of his cap
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special person,'' Baylor said. ``His zest for the game
has always been something I enjoyed. He gives you that energy day
in and day out. I was looking forward to being here, seeing him
play, seeing him produce again. Now he has his own battle.''
</P>
<P>
   With five weeks of spring training ahead, the Braves have their
own work to do to counter this loss on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people considered us to be the front-runner in the National
League, we just came back to the pack,'' Chipper Jones said.

 Schwab Expands Network of Branches as It Strives to Protect  Online
Lead   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Stephen Seewer is the kind of investor who has propelled Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co.'s business to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Like more and more of Schwab's clients, Seewer trades on the
Internet, buying and selling shares of technology, drug and
financial services companies about six times a month.
</P>
<P>
   But once or twice a week, usually when he's walking Dakota, his
golden retriever, the 31-year-old Parkside resident stops by
Schwab's branch in San Francisco's West Portal neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the online service, but the branch is pretty
close to my home,'' Seewer said. ``It's a convenient way to go in
and check my positions or do any sort of maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the nation's largest discount broker, believes its mix
of online investing, telephone service and branches helps it stand
out from the burgeoning ranks of electronic brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, San Francisco's Schwab operated the
old-fashioned way, with live brokers taking most orders by
telephone. Clients who wanted to trade by computer had to install
Schwab's special software and dial into the firm's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Schwab has reinvented itself by shifting most of its
business to the Internet. In less than three years, the firm has
gone from zero to an average of more than 150,000 Web-based trades
a day. That's nearly two out of every three transactions Schwab
carries out.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab turned to the Internet because it's a cheaper and more
efficient medium for processing orders and delivering information
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as it has jumped into the Web, Schwab has pumped up
its branch network. The company now has 293 retail offices
throughout the United States and plans to open as many as 200 more
over the next few years. That's well ahead of Waterhouse
Securities, a broker with a similar strategy, which operates about
150 branches and plans to grow to 200 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that online investing has captured the public mind, why
would Schwab shell out the bucks needed to keep up its branches?
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials stress that giving customers the choice of
going to a nearby office or calling a live broker on the phone is
one of the key things that differentiates the firm from the pack of
all-electronic competitors nipping at its heels, such as E-Trade,
Ameritrade and Datek.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big advantages we have is our other channels
through which customers can reach us,'' said Daniel Leemon,
Schwab's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has to provide branches and telephone service to stick
out, since its Internet trading fees are higher and its offerings
of research, news and investment tools not much different from what
other online brokers serve up.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SCHWAB20 (25451 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The firm's $29.95 Internet commission is as much as six times
higher than what the lowest-price competitors charge. And while a
survey shows the quality of Schwab's Internet service is improving,
it still rated only fifth best, according to Gomez Advisors, a
Massachusetts consulting firm that tracks Web-based brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to differentiate itself on the Internet, Schwab is losing
online ground to some electronic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter that ended in December, Schwab carried out 27.6
percent of the average 337,000 online trades carried out each day
in the United States, according to Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis
brokerage firm. That was more than double Waterhouse, its nearest
competitor, but down from Schwab's share of more than 30 percent a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab officials are touchy about data showing the firm's
shrinking online lead. They point out that Schwab targets long-term
investors rather than the hyperactive day traders who pump up the
trading figures of some competitors.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that the amount of money clients invest with the
firm is more important than the highly volatile trading volume
figures. ``The most fundamental measure we look at is net new
assets,'' said Chief Financial Officer Steven Scheid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those assets have skyrocketed lately. In the year ended
January 31, the holdings of Schwab's customers leaped 43 percent to
$521 billion. In January alone, those holdings rose 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Schwab's market share is slipping, the overall market,
propelled in part by Internet stock mania, is booming. And that
translates into a huge increase in trading volume for Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   With electronic trades leading the way, the firm's average daily
securities and mutual fund transactions doubled in a year and
surged an eye-popping 48 percent in January alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing by leaps and bounds, by every sort of
measure,'' said Bruce Brewington, a San Francisco analyst with the
firm Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton. ``Even though
Schwab's market share is smaller, the pie is so much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Schwab earned $348.5 million, up 29 percent from
1997, on $2.74 billion in revenue. After stagnating for more than a
year, the company's stock took off at the end of October. Since
then, it has almost tripled, closing yesterday at $69.06.
</P>
<P>
   While Schwab is slugging it out online, its branches give it an
edge rivals can't match.
</P>
<P>
   In January, under the strain of record trading demand, Schwab
and other online brokers were plagued by Internet service
breakdowns. At West Portal, frustrated clients flooded in to place
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very heavy walk-in traffic,'' manager Martin Briesach
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   While the branches can handle orders, they are designed as sales
centers. Some 70 percent of the new customer money coming into
Schwab enters through the branches.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Schwab has big plans for its new Signature premium
service program for its best customers. Many of those services,
such as special investment planning help, are being offered through
the branches.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SCHWAB20 (25451 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The West Portal branch opened two years ago, based on a standard
model for Schwab's newer offices.
</P>
<P>
   It is small and well lighted. With few interior walls, it has an
open feel. Near the entrance, there's a computer linked to the
Internet, part of Schwab's plan to make customers comfortable with
online investing.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers work at curved desks so clients feel they are sitting
next to them, not across a table. In keeping with Schwab's business
model, brokers offer clients investment-selection tools, but don't
recommend particular stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Steven Choy, a 32-year-old San Francisco
accountant, came into the West Portal branch to open an account for
his parents. Choy, who already trades with Schwab, says he goes
online every day to check his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a veteran Internet trader, Choy said he
appreciates having a branch near his home. ``You can speak to a
real person,'' he explained. ``I like the personal touch.``

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The World Health Organization is trying to get
two epidemiologists into an extremely remote part of Afghanistan to
diagnose a mysterious disease, U.N. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Afghan representative to the world health
group in Geneva, Switzerland, urgently appealed for help in
diagnosing the illness, which they said had infected 2,000 people
and killed at least 150, and possibly as many as 700.
</P>
<P>
   WHO officials would not speculate on which disease might have
erupted in the villages, including Darwaz, a hamlet situated in
narrow valleys between mountains that is said to be a 10-day donkey
ride from Faizabad, the largest town in northeastern Afghanistan.
But symptoms are said to include fever, cough, vomiting and
diarrhea, with elderly people and children the most severely
affected.
</P>
<P>
   One official said the health organization was looking into
whether the disease might be cholera or plague, which have been
endemic in the region and have similar symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters quoted a representative of an Afghan group in Islamabad,
Pakistan, that has been fighting the ruling Taliban for control of
Afghanistan as saying the disease had never before been seen in
that region. ``It is not cholera, not typhoid,'' the agency quoted
the representative as saying. ``It is a very odd disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The epidemiologists from the health group's division of
communicable and other emerging diseases are trying to reach Darwaz
from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, which has been asked to provide
emergency visas. From there the scientists are expected to travel
by U.N. peacekeeping helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the health organization
in Afghanistan had first received reports of the outbreak about a
week ago from authorities in Darwaz.
</P>
<P>
   One official noted that the illnesses were occurring in an area
hit by a severe earthquake last year. He implied that the resulting
severe disruption of the region's economy and services may have
been a factor in fostering the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration is alert to the possibility that
such outbreaks could have other than natural causes. It is trying
to improve the medical community's ability to distinguish rapidly
between the natural outbreak of an infectious lethal disease and an
outbreak caused by an attack using germs. After the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan in 1979, several thousand deaths were
attributed to a man-made ``yellow rain,'' a vaporized form of
Trichothecene mycotoxins.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked for increased funding for the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among
other things, to improve international health surveillance for more
rapid detection of suspicious diseases. The ability to make the
distinction is a key part of the administration's strategy to
defend the United States against biological terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The health organization has a relatively limited ability to make
such distinctions and sometimes calls on the Atlanta center and
U.N. member states to diagnose mysterious outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a health organization spokesman said, the group
receives through its various channels about five reports a week of
suspicious outbreaks, two or three of which are substantiated
through Geneva or field offices. To diagnose particularly worrisome
outbreaks, it sends out an average of five missions a year.

 Kaiser HMO in Red Again  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Reporting its second loss in as many years, the Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan yesterday hinted at more premium rate increases over
the next 12 months as the giant HMO struggles to get back in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland health giant, which all but nixed layoffs to staunch
the red ink, reported an operating loss of $434 million on revenues
of $15.5 billion in 1998. That loss, which equalled 2.8 percent of
revenues, was narrower than Kaiser's 1997 shortfall of $447 million
on revenues of $14.2 billion. The 1997 loss was the first in
Kaiser's 54-year history.
</P>
<P>
   This year's losses occurred even though Kaiser saw its
membership grow 5 percent last year to 8.6 million because premiums
from new members didn't offset their costs. In California, for
instance, Kaiser's operating losses actually widened from $212
million in 1997 to $354 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Dale Crandall said although Kaiser
instituted rate hikes averaging 10 percent in California for 1999,
the increases came too late to offset the rising costs of drugs and
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong press call, he finessed questions about future
rate hikes, saying only ``we're playing a little bit of catchup''
relative to other HMOs that raised premiums earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But he virtually ruled out large-scale cuts in Kaiser's
90,000-person workforce to stem the losses, saying membership
growth actually forced Kaiser to hire nurses and other staff.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Greg Crawford, who follows health care for the Fox-Pitt,
Kelton investment bank in New York, said ``Kaiser needs to increase
rates aggressively for the next few years.'' He estimated the HMO
would try to get hikes close to the 10 percent it averaged this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Wanda Jones, with the New Century Health Care
Institute in San Francisco, said competition from other HMOs _
which have been seeking increases in the 5-to-7-percent range _
would influence what Kaiser can get.
</P>
<P>
   CFO Crandall said Kaiser expects to make a small profit in 1999,
owing largely to two factors. First, the rate hikes negotiated in
current health plans will begin to bring premiums into line with
rising health care costs. Kaiser also will slash capital spending
to $900 million this year, down 30 percent from the $1.3 billion it
spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall acknowledged Kaiser can't defer capital spending for
long, given its membership growth and the fact that it needs to
spend $1.5 billion in the coming years to meet state mandates for
earthquake retrofits on some of its hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall addressed some of the ironies of Kaiser's current
predicament. The company says one reason for its losses is due to a
surge in membership in Southern California that has forced it to
divert some members to non-Kaiser hospitals that cost more than
Kaiser facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly enough in Oakland, Kaiser says it is seeking favorable
long-term deals by shutting down its 271-bed facility and sending
some patients to Oakland's Summit Medical Center and Berkeley's
Alta Bates hospital.

 Girls' Software Pioneer Purple Moon Closes Down  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Purple Moon, a firm that pioneered software for young girls, closed
its doors this week, throwing 40 people out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The company cited the challenge of competing in a market
dominated by increasingly large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Purple Moon's employees worked out of the company's
Mountain View headquarters, and the other half worked in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to comment yesterday, sticking
instead to a terse two-sentence press release.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors started flying last week, when the Industry Standard, a
trade magazine, reported on its Web site that Purple Moon was about
to shut its CD-ROM operations.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Gould, a company spokeswoman, said at the time that four
staffers were laid off and the company was possibly putting itself
up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The company was spun out of a Silicon Valley think tank backed
by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1996. Founder Brenda Laurel
had pioneered research showing that the high-tech industry was
overlooking girls' interests.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company had estimated sales of $4.7 million,
according to market researcher PC Data of Reston, Va. That only
gave Purple Moon 5.7 percent of the girls' software market, putting
it in a distant fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the top 10 titles in girls' software were related to
Barbie, the iconic doll made by Mattel Corp., according to Roger
Lanctot, director of research at PC Data. The other four related to
Madeline, a popular figure from children's books, who stars in
software made by the Learning Co. of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mattel _ which commands 64.5 percent of the revenue
in the girls' software market, Lanctot said _ agreed to buy the
Learning Co., which racked up 21.6 percent of the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While Purple Moon lamented such consolidation, Lanctot said size
wasn't what killed the company. Instead it was a lack of brand name
products like Barbie and Madeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just swamped by product that was much more
recognizable to consumers,'' Lanctot said.

HEALTHY HINES BACK INTO GAME

   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA reserve guard Rico Hines has recovered from a
broken right foot and will rejoin to the rotation a few minutes at
a time, perhaps beginning Sunday against Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Hines has not played since the Oregon road trip in early
January. At the time, he was averaging 3.3 points and 16 minutes
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us another experienced guy coming off the bench and
we need that out there,'' said guard Baron Davis, Hines' roommate.
``Rico gives us consistently solid play and we've missed that.
We've missed his defense. He does the intangibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines, a sophomore, turned 21 on Wednesday and is one of UCLA's
most vocal leaders, both on the court and in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys kid Rico that he fought in the Korean War,'' coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Moiso update: Freshman forward Jerome Moiso will play Sunday
but for limited minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been two weeks since I've felt this good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso has missed two games and played poorly in two others
because of tendinitis in his right foot. He is UCLA's third-leading
scorer, averaging 12.2 points per game, but was 1 of 12 in his last
game, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Dan Gadzuric, hobbled by tendinitis in his
knees, will play. Gadzuric has scored 16 points in his last three
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Dan and Jerome, it's moment-to-moment as to whether they
can go,'' Lavin said. ``We knew coming in that there would be some
growing pains. Our whole approach is that it will take two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we expected, it's been up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mr. Opposite: Freshman forward JaRon Rush stands 6-foot-5,
weighs 210 pounds and sometimes loses his balance at the first hint
of contact. But he's UCLA's best rebounder and one of the best in
the Pac-10, averaging 7.6 per game in conference play. He has four
double-figure rebound games this season.
</P>
<P>
   His secret: go where the shooter isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to go to the opposite side of where the shooter is,'' he
said. ``The majority of rebounds go long, so I try to use my
quickness to get there and then outhustle people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The roulette continues: Lavin expects to start Rush,
Gadzuric, Earl Watson, Baron Davis and Sean Farnham against
Syracuse. It will be UCLA's 19th different starting lineup of the
season.

AS DEADLINE LOOMS, NO AGREEMENT EXPECTED IN KOSOVO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As the Kosovo peace talks neared a fever pitch Friday,
the Clinton administration seemed resigned to not having a peace
settlement by the deadline of noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assessment is that there is no reason to think we will get
an agreement tomorrow,'' a senior administration official said
Friday, adding that there was ``no evidence the Serbs have moved on
the main points.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials are hopeful that the ethnic Albanian delegation
will sign a peace settlement, the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, remained publicly defiant, sending no signals that he
was willing to bend.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in a display of brinkmanship Milosevic refused to see
the chief U.S. negotiator, Christopher Hill, who flew to Belgrade
Friday to speak with him. Instead Hill was relegated to meeting
with the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also increased his propaganda against NATO deployment
of peacekeepers in Kosovo, saying in a statement that Serbs would
never give up Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, even if
meant being bombed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its European allies have insisted that if
Milosevic refuses to sign a peace agreement by noon Saturday _
which would bring NATO-led peacekeeping troops to Kosovo _ NATO
would commence air-strikes against Serbian military targets.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how the Clinton administration and its allies
would respond if the deadline passed without a settlement.
President Clinton has said the deadline would not be extended, but
the option exists to simply allow it to lapse informally.
</P>
<P>
   Even as negotiators and delegates toiled over revisions in the
political text of the settlement in an all-night session at
Rambouillet, diplomats said that Saturday's decisions remained
unclear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to go to
Rambouillet Saturday to meet with the two sides where, if all had
gone according to plan, there would have been a settlement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was reasonably optimistic, an official said Friday
afternoon, that the ethnic Albanians would be prepared to sign an
agreement on the political arrangements for self-governing in
Kosovo and acceptance of 28,000 NATO troops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators have been trying to assure the signature of the
ethnic Albanians by Saturday because that would dramatically
increase the pressure on Milosevic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday evening, the ethnic Albanians appeared to be
increasingly unhappy with new insertions in the political text of
the agreement that they said tilted too far in favor of the Serbs.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the ethnic Albanians were upset with more
references to the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
in the text of the proposed constitution. For them self-government,
rather than Serbian direct rule, is the key to the new political
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of the Contact Group, the group of six
nations which have organized the talks, are likely to meet in
Rambouillet after the noon deadline has passed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 16 ambassadors of NATO countries are to
meet in Brussels, Belgium. The secretary general of NATO, Javier
Solana, was empowered two weeks ago by the NATO members to order
airstrikes if Milosevic did not agree to a peace settlement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But before making any decision on bombing, Solana planned to
consult the members and probably consider the assessment of the
Contact Group, NATO officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The talks, of which Albright has been a driving force, appeared
to put her in a potentially awkward situation as they reach the
final stages.
</P>
<P>
   She did not want to be seen going to Belgrade begging Milosevic
to agree to the peace accord _ and in particular, the presence of
NATO troops in Kosovo _ but nor did she want European ministers to
complete the deal, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, they said, that she might end Saturday by going
to Brussels to meet with Solana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials have said that Milosevic would be pleased to
see the Clinton administration's special envoy, Richard Holbrooke,
a diplomat that Milosevic has negotiated with on many occasions.
Holbrooke has been involved in the Clinton administration's major
discussions on Kosovo this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a Clinton administration official said that it had been
decided Holbrooke was not the man for negotiating with Milosevic at
this time. Holbrooke has is facing upcoming confirmation hearings
to become ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rebuff by Milosevic, less than 24 hours before NATO is to
decide whether to go ahead with airstrikes, is not unusual behavior
for him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who after endless visits by politicians kept the West
at bay through four years of war in Bosnia, is recognized as a
master of getting the most out of a difficult diplomatic situation.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic will require more visible attention and courting,''
a Western diplomat involved in the negotiations said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If several foreign ministers from the Contact Group went to
Belgrade, there were no plans for Albright to join them,
particularly since it was unclear that such a journey would produce
an agreement, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albright doesn't want to do this unless there is a deal,'' an
administration official said of a trip to Belgrade.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost certainly a price Milosevic will ask for in signing a
Kosovo agreement is the removal of economic and diplomatic
sanctions against his country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that Washington
would not object to investment bans, travel bans and other
sanctions placed on Serbia last summer being lifted if Milosevic
pledged to implement a peace agreement with NATO troops in Kosovo.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the more severe set of sanctions, which are of the greatest
interest to Milosevic's cash strapped regime, involve bans on loans
from international financial institutions. So far, the Clinton
administration has said it would not budge on these sanctions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has supported the ethnic
Albanian cause in Kosovo, criticized the negotiators Friday night,
saying they had gone too far in accepting suggestions from
Milosevic.

GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE, AND NEW YORK IS BOASTING ABOUT IT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va. , Mass.)   By RICHARD E. MOONEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Washington mused on ``the roar of cannon and
the loud acclamations of the people'' as he was rowed across the
Hudson River for his inauguration in the new nation's first
capital, New York City. In his diary that day he said his mind was
``filled with sensations as painful . . . as they are pleasing.''
He had been to the city several times as a soldier, before and
during the Revolution, again as a stepfather putting his wife's son
in college, and now on April 23, 1789, as president-elect. He would
stay for 17 months, until the capital was moved south.
</P>
<P>
   Washington first slept here in 1756, when he visited for a week
as a 23-year-old colonel and took a tumble for the beautiful and
rich Polly Philipse. Twenty years later as General Washington, he
came three times, most famously in 1776 when his troops were
thrashed by the English on the Brooklyn Heights. As president he
faced new hordes. No fewer than 18 members of the prominent
Livingston family petitioned him for jobs (ancestors of Rep. Robert
L. Livingston, who was, for a brief moment, speaker-designate of
the House).
</P>
<P>
   Martha Washington wasn't at all happy about coming to New York.
After a few months she wrote to an in-law back home in Mount Vernon
(the spellings are hers): ``I live a very dull life hear. . . . I
never goe to the publick place _ indeed I think I am more like a
state prisoner than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole span of Washington's life and times in New York is on
display in a new exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York,
including a piece of the rump of George III's horse from the statue
on lower Broadway that was toppled in celebration of the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may have had thoughts of marrying Polly Philipse, but
things took a different turn. She married his friend and former
comrade in arms, Roger Morris, who was loyal to the crown. Their
mansion in upper Manhattan _ the Morris-Jumel mansion, open now to
the public _ was taken over by Continental forces and was
Washington's headquarters after the defeat in Brooklyn in August
1776.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, in the midst of the battle for Manhattan, he
wrote a remarkably revealing letter from that house to his cousin
Lund Washington, laying out his dual concerns for self and home.
``In confidence I tell you,'' he said, speaking of his mood, ``that
I never was in such an unhappy, divided state since I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on, despairing over the conduct of the Revolution, but
then jumps to matter-of-fact instructions about building ``the new
room'' at Mount Vernon, where to place the chimney and other such
details. In another letter from the house, this one to Polly
Philipse Morris' aunt, he added a poignant postscript: ``I beg the
favor of having my compliments presented to Mrs. Morris.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came as president, Washington and his wife first lived
in a three-story house on a section of Cherry Street buried under
the Brooklyn Bridge that the French ambassador called squalid. In
February 1790 they moved to a four-story house at 39 Broadway, with
large rooms for receptions and a river view from its rear balcony.
When Washington was bedridden with life-threatening pneumonia in
May, his wife had straw spread out front to muffle the sound of
passing carriages.
</P>
<P>
   After the pneumonia, his doctor told him to exercise more and
work less, which helps explain the following terse entry in his
diary: ``Exercised on Horseback; &AMP; called on the vice president. In
the afternoon walked an hour.'' It is Vice President John Adams'
saucy wife, Abigail, who gives fuller descriptions of the
president's courtly habits. In one of her chatty letters to her
sister, she says he never went out in his carriage without a team
of six horses, four servants and two gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Washingtons declined invitations to dinner but entertained
frequently. At one meal a senator noted that the president drummed
on the table with his silverware between courses and that there was
almost no talk until everyone had eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Longer entries in Washington's diary show constant thoughts of
home, in this case, the plantings: ``I set off about 9 Oclock in my
Barge to visit Prince's fruit Gardens &AMP; shrubberies at Flushing on
Long Island.'' He was disappointed by the flora, but noted the
fanfare: ``The inhabitants of this place shewed us what respect
they could, by making the best use of one Cannon to salute.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington left no memoirs but a memorable explanation of why he
didn't: In a letter to a friend he said, ``I had rather glide
gently down the stream of life, leaving it to posterity to think
and say what they please of me, than by any act of mine to have
vanity or ostentation imputed to me.''

PRESIDENT SAYS FIRST LADY NEED NOT RUSH TO DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton tried Friday to let a little air
out of the speculative bubble over Hillary Rodham Clinton's
political future.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question at a brief news conference with
President Jacques Chirac of France, Clinton said Friday afternoon
that the election for a U.S. Senate seat in New York was still 21
months away and that he had advised Mrs. Clinton not to rush a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats and supporters around the country have urged
Mrs. Clinton to seek the seat being vacated by Sen &UR; . &LR;  Daniel
Patrick Moynihan next year. The first lady has said she is
seriously considering entering the race, but has been cagey about
the timing of her decision. On Tuesday, she said she would reach a
decision ``later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he would strongly support whatever
choice his wife made and that he would do all he could to aid her
campaign if she decided to run _ ``just as she's helped me for the
last 20-plus years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president cautioned: ``It's important to remember this
is an election which occurs in November of 2000, and she has just
been through a very exhausting year. And there are circumstances
which have to be considered, and I think some time needs to be
taken here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was alluding obliquely to a year of scandal and an
impeachment trial prompted by his extramarital affair with Monica
Lewinsky. He did not specify the ``circumstances'' he cited, but
associates say they include not only the usual political and
fund-raising challenges, but also the continuing strains in the
Clinton family.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has won and lost a few political campaigns
himself, showed an insider's knowledge of the tools of electoral
politics and stand-up comedy. Timing and suspense are everything,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a presidential race,'' Clinton said, ``it's hard to
keep a kettle of water boiling for almost two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who appeared a bit amused and bewildered by the sudden
flurry of interest in his wife's political prospects, said the talk
about the New York Senate race was premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see her take _ and my advice has been _ to
take some time, get some rest, listen to people on both sides of
the argument and decide exactly what you think is right to do,''
the president said. ``And then whatever she decides, I'll be for.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first lady continued her methodical research in preparation
for her decision, receiving a 90-minute tutorial Friday from
Moynihan on the intricacies of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he did not advise her one way or the other, but
said that if she ran, ``of course I'd support her.''
</P>
<P>
   President and Mrs. Clinton have not had particularly close
relations with Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton expressed irritation about Moynihan to associates
early in the president's first term, saying she believed that
Moynihan had contributed to the demise of her complex health care
plan in 1993 and 1994 by not vocally supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, the first lady's press secretary, said Friday's
meeting was an opportunity to exchange ideas about the race. ``She
certainly respects him,'' Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that Mrs. Clinton's intelligence-gathering
operation would continue for some time, and that a decision could
be months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be like watching grass grow,'' she said.

ELS FIGHTING MEMORIES OF TOURNAMENTS PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until Bob Estes wrested the lead from Ernie Els
and three others late Friday afternoon at the Nissan Open, Els was
prepared to tiptoe to the first tee today. How else was he going to
avoid awakening the ghosts of his Riviera past?
</P>
<P>
   The last time Els, 29, led an event here, it ended
nightmarishly. At the 1995 PGA Championship, he shot a final-round
72 (after establishing a 54-hole tournament record with three
sub-70s) to drop to third. He finished two strokes behind Steve
Elkington, who overcame a six-shot deficit to beat Colin
Montgomerie with a birdie on the first playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to think about that too much,'' Els said Friday
after adding a 66 to his opening 68. ``It's not a very good memory.
It was kind of hard to swallow. If I had shot anything under 70, I
would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Els captured the attention of the American public with all the
subtlety of a gunshot in 1994 when he won the U.S. Open four months
before his 24th birthday (he added a second U.S open crown in 1987
to become the first foreigner in 84 years to win a Grand Slam title
twice).
</P>
<P>
   He has long been a headliner in his homeland of South Africa,
making a name for himself as a top junior tennis player before
unleashing his athleticism on the golf course. His breezy demeanor
has earned him the nickname ``Big Easy,'' though to be as big as he
is in South Africa is, in fact, hard.
</P>
<P>
   If Els goes more than a few weeks without winning, the sharks in
the press, smelling blood, start circling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's big-time pressure,'' he said amiably. ``What Tiger
(Woods) is in this country, I'm the equivalent (in South Africa). I
get my fair share of comments. They're probably more vocal over
there than the people are here with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Els has played this week, he hasn't given the folks back
home much flak fodder. He is 3-under par on the three par-5s and
needed only 24 putts Friday, six fewer than in his first round. He
has missed 11 greens in regulation and eight fairways, but who's
quibbling?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Els, who said, ``So far I've been playing quite
consistent. It's been perfect. Right now I'm 8-under. I'll take
another 8-under (the last two rounds).''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't? Sixteen-under-par is lower than all but three of
the winning scores in the 36 previous regular PGA events that
Riviera Country Club has hosted.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Els to get too far ahead of himself. After
surrendering the lead on the third-to-last hole here at the PGA
Championship four years ago, he knows how long those final 36 holes
can stretch.

AMERICAN WILL PAY WORKERS WHO SHOWED UP DURING SICKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ American Airlines said Friday that it will
pay the pilots and flight attendants who reported for work during
the 10-day pilot sickout, even if their flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also said that it will give $50 gift certificates to
airport and reservations agents who helped customers rearrange
their travel, and to operations employees who dealt with the
scheduling chaos caused by 6,700 canceled flights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were no talks Friday between management and the
Allied Pilots Association. The talks are expected to continue next
week, after union negotiators brief members of the union's board.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots staged a sickout Feb. 6 through Monday to protest
American's plans for integrating 300 pilots from Reno Air into
American's 9,300-member pilot corps. The dispute centers on timing.
The airline has said it would take 12 to 18 months to complete the
integration, and it wants to roll out raises as pilots are trained
for their new duties.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said it wants the raises for Reno's pilots and any
American pilots who would be promoted because of the merger to be
retroactive to Dec. 23, when American took financial control of the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this whole matter,'' American spokesman John
Hotard said, ``was that if you were a pilot who showed up for work,
and the other pilot didn't, you got sent home without pay, while
the fellow who called in sick got sick pay, assuming he had sick
days available.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the same thing was true for flight attendants, who showed
up prepared to work but got sent home because we couldn't get a
complete cockpit crew to fly the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the airline decided to pay the pilots and attendants
rather than allow them to be unintended financial victims of the
sickout. Hotard would not say how much the additional pay will cost
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Ewell, American's vice president of flight and chief
pilot, told American's pilots of the decision Friday in a message
on his telephone hot line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well aware the turmoil of the last couple of weeks has
caused some of you to experience some financial hardship through
circumstances that were beyond your control,'' Ewell said on the
hot line.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company will not require those pilots to make up the
lost time. But he asked pilots to volunteer to fly currently
unassigned trips this month.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its normal pilot scheduling, American leaves a
percentage of its flights unassigned and depends on pilots who want
to earn extra money to volunteer for those assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try to salvage the back half of the month,''
Ewell said, referring to the airline's efforts to regain consumers'
trust and loyalty in the wake of the sickout, which inconvenienced
about 670,000 travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Hotard said a number of operations staff members, particularly
those who work in the crew scheduling department, put in long hours
under trying circumstances during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the reservations agents, who handled calls
from travelers, and the airport agents, who had to deal
face-to-face with displaced passengers, deserved appreciation in
addition to any overtime pay they earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people at the airports and on the reservations lines had
to face a lot of upset and angry travelers,'' Hotard said, ``and
they represented the company well in the midst of a bad
situation.''

COMMENTARY: AN INCURABLE STATUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Kenneth Starr conducted his relentless
investigation of President Clinton, many Americans were troubled.
``What can we do about it?'' they asked in frustration. But they
could do nothing, because Starr was not accountable to our
political process.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia foresaw the problem when he dissented
from the Supreme Court's 1988 decision upholding the
constitutionality of the Independent Counsel Act. If an ordinary
federal prosecutor focuses huge resources on someone in a way
unjustified by the gravity of the alleged offenses, he said, ``the
unfairness will come to roost'' where political responsibility
lies: on the prosecutor's boss, the president. But with an
independent counsel, he said, there is no accountability.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Starr who has proved Scalia right. Other
independent counsels have used enormous resources in obsessive,
vindictive investigations of their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smaltz spent four years and $17 million investigating
Mike Espy, the former secretary of agriculture. He had Espy
indicted on 30 counts for accepting football tickets and other
``gratuities.'' A jury acquitted him on all counts. But that did
not stop Smaltz. He said: ``The actual indictment of a public
official may in fact be as great a deterrent as a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Espy's chief of staff, Ron Blackley, was less lucky _
pathetically so. He failed to put down on his financial disclosure
form $21,000 he made from his former business in Mississippi. The
Justice Department declined to prosecute, but Smaltz did and won a
conviction. Blackley was eligible for probation under the federal
sentencing guidelines, but Judge Royce Lamberth gave him a sentence
of 27 months in prison, upheld on appeal. Before the appeal, Smaltz
tried to keep Blackley from going to Mississippi for his son's high
school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Many who were not convicted, or indicted, by independent
counsels have been punished by impoverishment. Dozens of innocent
people have been financially broken by being called as witnesses.
Betty Currie, for example, the president's secretary, has
reportedly had lawyers' bills of about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court majority said the act was constitutional
because it made an independent counsel removable by the attorney
general for wrongdoing. But despite abuses, none have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is now considering several instances of
possible wrongdoing by Starr. But he argues that any investigation
should be conducted by another independent counsel. He suggested
former Attorney General Griffin Bell, who with him defended tobacco
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association used to be a strong supporter of
the Independent Counsel Act. The other day its House of Delegates
voted overwhelmingly to oppose the law. The danger, it said, is
that independent counsels lose perspective and force their targets
to ``mortgage their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The act expires on June 30. Various proposals have been made to
amend this provision or that. But abuse is inherent in the concept
of an unaccountable prosecutor with unlimited resources.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Dash, who was Starr's ethics adviser, wrote in The New
York Times that the provision calling on a counsel to refer
possible impeachment grounds to the House had been wrongly
interpreted ``as giving the independent counsel the role of
initiating the impeachment process _ a role Congress never intended
because it would be unconstitutional.'' Where was Dash when Starr
sent his one-sided, prosecutorial referral to the House? He had
helped to write it!
</P>
<P>
   Without the Independent Counsel Act, Dash wrote, ``there is no
way to investigate possible crimes by the president.'' But
Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski carried out the Watergate inquiry
as ad hoc special prosecutors, with no statutory basis.
</P>
<P>
   The statute invites us to take political matters to the criminal
law: a terrible mistake. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor
general, made the point wisely in a recent talk. ``The independent
counsel system does not work and the impeachment process does,'' he
said, ``because the latter is run by people who are politically
accountable. Politics, for all its faults, is the only way you can
run a free country.''

   TRADE DEFICIT SOARED 53 PERCENT, TO $168.8 BILLION, IN 1998
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit soared 53 percent last year, to a record
$168.8 billion, as the global financial crisis forced the first
decline in American exports in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in the deficit came from remarkably strong
consumer spending for foreign-made goods. But the deficit for
December narrowed unexpectedly, to $13.8 billion, a 10 percent
decline from November.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO WARNING DAMPENS MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   The stock market ended higher but pulled back from earlier gains
after President Clinton warned that Serbian leaders would be ``held
accountable'' if peace talks on Kosovo collapsed. The Dow
industrials closed at 9,339.95, up 41.32 points after a 97-point
gain dwindled in the closing minutes. The Nasdaq composite index,
which rose 15 percent in January but lost most of those gains in a
steep sell-off this month, rose 23.05, to 2,283.60.
</P>
<P>
   INFLATION MILD DESPITE GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Although a strong economy and rising wages should be pushing up
the inflation rate, the Consumer Price Index inched up only
one-tenth of 1 percent in January, continuing a pattern of
surprisingly mild inflation that has lasted for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY AT MORGAN STANLEY
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's top executives got big raises this
year, but the firm's profits grew even faster. The compensation of
the company's chairman and president rose 7.6 percent and 8.2
percent, respectively. But Morgan's profit rose by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT SET TO REDUCE INJURIES
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has taken the first formal steps to require
employers to redesign jobs and alter work stations in order to
reduce the risk of workers' suffering injuries to the neck, back,
arms and hands.
</P>
<P>
   FRICTION AMONG FINANCE MINISTERS
</P>
<P>
   Discord is likely at a meeting of finance ministers from the
Group of Seven, including Germany's Oskar Lafontaine, in Bonn,
Germany, Saturday. The United States is bracing for disagreements
with Germany and France over measures to control exchange rates and
reduce financial turbulence. But European countries disagree about
those issues, and the new European Central Bank is dead set against
the French and German proposals.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN SAIPAN
</P>
<P>
   Chinese workers have propelled the successful garment industry
in Saipan, the capital of the U.S. commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands. The industry was hit with a legal bombshell in
January when lawyers filed a class-action suit accusing garment
makers and major retailers of systematically underpaying and
mistreating workers in Saipan. But interviews with dozens of
Chinese workers in Saipan tell a story that is far less stark.
</P>
<P>
   A FOCUS ON UNION MEMBERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   During his three years as president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney
has repeatedly given a grim message to its 70 unions: Organize or
die. With union membership plunging, the federation's chief has
warned, labor's influence will continue to decline. Many unions
have begun taking Sweeney's warnings to heart, and as a result, the
discussion at the AFL-CIO's executive council meeting in Miami this
week often focused on how to woo more workers to unions.
</P>
<P>
   ACQUISITION TALK LIFTS AMERICA WEST
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America West Holdings rose 13 percent amid speculation
that it would attract competing takeover bids from Continental
Airlines and UAL, the parent of United Airlines. It was reported
that UAL had offered to buy America West Holdings earlier this
week. Continental, which already owns 8 percent of the airline, has
said it may seek a controlling stake.

VICTIM'S BLOOD FOUND ON CLOTHING OF DEFENDANTS IN DRAGGING DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Tiny flecks of James Byrd Jr.'s blood were found
on the boots, sandals and running shoes of three white men accused
in the black man's gruesome dragging death, an expert on DNA
analysis testified on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI forensic analyst Frank S. Baechtel also said that
individually unique genetic material from the three defendants was
discovered on three cigarette butts at the crime scene where Byrd
was chained behind a pickup on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   One cigarette contained DNA trace material that suggested that
Byrd might have shared a puff with defendant John William King, 24,
the first of the trio to stand trial on a capital murder charge,
said Baechtel, a 16-year veteran of the FBI's main forensic
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA sample recovered was insufficient to prove conclusively
that it was Byrd's, but it could not have been from any of the
three white men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, District Attorney Guy James Gray said the
test result could mean that Byrd was offered a ceremonial last
smoke that a condemned man was traditionally given before
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he described the DNA testimony as some of the strongest
evidence of the trial, which finished its fourth day of testimony
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it proves what those guys are charged with,'' said
Gray, who is prosecuting his first capital murder case.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs,
pointed out the difficulty of his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff you can't get around,'' he conceded during
a break after Baechtel testified. ``Hell, how can you get around
this?''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has contended that King had planned to kidnap
and murder a black man before launching a hate group on July 4,
1998, in this East Texas community of 7,100. Handwritten documents
carrying his signature said the group was to be called the Texas
Rebel Soldiers Division of the Confederate Knights of America.
</P>
<P>
   King has maintained his innocence, insisting before the trial
that another of the defendants, Shawn Berry, killed Byrd over a
steroid drug deal. King insisted that Berry had dropped him and the
third defendant, Lawrence Russell Brewer, at the apartment shared
by the three ex-convicts.
</P>
<P>
   But the finding of Byrd's blood on King's Outback-brand sandal
contradicts that account, attorneys argued. And a Bud Lite longneck
found at the crime scene contained a trace amount of Brewer's DNA,
Baechtel said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense's case appeared to be further weakened as the day
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Berry, 25, brother of Shawn Berry, testified that King
briefly lent him his Zippo-style lighter just hours before Byrd was
slain. That conflicted with King's statement, in a November letter
to a newspaper, that he had lost the lighter a week before Byrd's
death.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter, inscribed with King's prison nickname, ``Possum,''
and carrying a Ku Klux Klan symbol, was found at the crime scene by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination of witnesses, defense attorneys have
suggested that Louis Berry might have participated in Byrd's
slaying and that a pair of white Nike running shoes with the
initials ``LB'' might be his.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Louis Berry identified three bloodstained pairs
of shoes as belonging to the three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who wears size 11 shoes, said he couldn't fit his foot in
the Nikes, which are size 7. He said they belonged to Lawrence
Brewer. Earlier, the FBI's Baechtel said a spot of Byrd's blood was
found on the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also said that a pair of Ralph Lauren Polo boots were his
brother's and that the sandals, a size smaller than identical ones
his brother owned, belonged to King.
</P>
<P>
   He said that on the night of June 6, hours before Byrd was
killed, King and Brewer stopped by a barbecue in nearby Burkeville.
But they refused to leave their vehicle when they heard of the
presence of a black guest, a guitar-playing jamming partner of
Louis Berry's.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he was angered and left the party to confront King
and Brewer back in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude upset me,'' said Berry, who had recently worked
with King and Brewer cutting trees. ``They wouldn't come in because
a black guy was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said King's term in prison for burglary of a video store
had changed him. After his release, King ``would put down black
people,'' said Berry, who has known King for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes King would display his tattoos, including one of a
lynched African-American, Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier witness, 16-year-old Heather Hough, testified that
King once had shown her the same tattoo and used a racial slur to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   King said before the trial that he was unaware of the tiny
marking, which he described as filler that a prison tattoo artist
worked into a complicated, ``full sleeve'' design on an arm.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has contended that the tattoos, which include
Klan, Nazi and satanic symbols, reflect King's racist views.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has maintained that the skin art, popular among many
inmates, was done to help King, who is 5-foot-7, look tough enough
to protect himself in an overwhelmingly black cell block.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case against King on
Monday.

 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pernell Whitaker believes he has turned back the
clock some 14 years. He believes that when Felix Trinidad steps
into the ring against him Saturday night at Madison Square Garden,
Trinidad will not be facing a 35-year-old boxer who has not fought
in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's 1984 and I'm going for the gold again,'' said
Whitaker, a gold medalist in the 1984 Olympic Games. ``I've feel
like I've got everything back on keel. I got my legs back. I got my
eyesight. I've got my skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But Trinidad and his father-manager-trainer, Felix Sr., have a
different view of Whitaker. They believe that Whitaker is a past
champion with a tremendous amount of pride, but that his skills
have greatly diminished. They believe that his hard-partying life
away from the ring has caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a good boxer, but the drugs and the alcohol have
taken their tolls,'' Felix Sr. said. ``But he still has his
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker's 16-month absence from the ring included two
suspensions from boxing for failed drug tests and a drunken-driving
arrest; that charge is pending. He tested positive for cocaine
following his Oct. 17, 1997, bout against Andrei Pestriaev at
Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. He was suspended for six
months and ordered to undergo periodic testing. Before a proposed
bout against Ike Quartey last April, he again tested positive for
cocaine and was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker said he did not have a drug or alcohol problem, and he
refused to talk about his suspensions or what he gained from his
stint in a drug rehabilitation center. Whitaker prefers to look
ahead because he says there is nothing to be gained from looking in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   For his return to the ring, however, Whitaker reached into the
past and brought back the trainer Tommy Brooks, who with George
Benton trained Whitaker right after he turned professional 15 years
ago. Brooks replaces Ronnie Shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy is like a drill sergeant; he says do this or do that,''
Whitaker said. ``It's like he's a teacher and I'm a student. Ronnie
is a good trainer, but with Ronnie I found that I would do a lot of
ad-libbing in the ring during fights. I didn't do any of the things
that we had worked on in training. With Tommy it's been like
school. He's been teaching and I've been learning, focusing in on
what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said there was ``a lot of evidence'' that Whitaker had
turned the clock back. ``We had a kid named Juan Lescano in camp,
who is a good fighter,'' Brooks said. ``But if he had a handful of
rice, he still couldn't hit Pernell.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said there was no evidence that Whitaker's skills had
been diminished by drugs or alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen,'' Brooks said. ``But I've seen a lot of
alcoholics and drug addicts come back. You give up on yourself,
nothing is going to come of it. But if you have pride in what you
do, you'd be amazed what you can do. I'm not a doctor or a
psychologist or a therapist, but from what I see in the gym it
hasn't had an effect on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker has been noted throughout his career as a defensive
specialist who took more joy in making an opponent miss than in
knocking him out. But Brooks said they had been working on some
offensive strategies that would surprise Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pernell has never had a lot of faith in his punching power,
but that didn't mean that he didn't have it,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is a considerable underdog against the
26-year-old Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation
welterweight champion, Whitaker said he felt so good physically and
mentally, he felt invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I feel like this, at my best, it's tough to beat me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Trinidad, who has been off for
10 months and has fought only eight rounds in the past two years,
has had trouble making weight for this bout. His workouts have been
closed. But he made the prescribed weight of 147 pounds at the
weigh-in Friday. Whitaker also weighed in at 147.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad expects to be able to walk through Whitaker, who is one
of the shiftier left-handers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a problem,'' Trinidad said. ``I've
fought left-handers before. I wouldn't be surprised if he comes
after me. If he comes after me, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   PUNCH LINES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PERNELL WHITAKER-FELIX TRINIDAD &UR;  &LR; bout will be broadcast on
HBO as part of a welterweight doubleheader. The first bout, which
will begin at 9:30 p.m., will be a rebroadcast of last week's
welterweight showdown between OSCAR DE LA HOYA and IKE QUARTEY. . .
. There were still tickets available at Madison Square Garden for
the Whitaker-Trinidad bout. As of Friday more than 11,000 tickets
had been sold. Tickets range in price from $400 for ringside to
$50.  &QL;

UNCOVERED SHORT SALES SLIP 0.8 PERCENT ON NEW YORK EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open positions on the New York Stock
Exchange &UR;  &LR; decreased eight-tenths of 1 percent last month, to 3.63
billion shares, the exchange said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the American Stock Exchange, recently acquired by the
National Association of Securities Dealers' &UR;  &LR; Nasdaq market,
uncovered short sales increased 7.9 percent, to 173 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, represent
shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet covered by
repurchases. If the price of a share sold short falls, an investor
can profit by buying a share at a lower price to replace the
borrowed ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, the short-interest figure for the month ended
Feb. 12 was equal to 1.5 percent of the total shares listed on the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The total for the month was well below the record of 4.21
billion shares set in the month ended Sept. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, North America's largest communications
equipment manufacturer, had the lrgest increase in short interest
in the month. Short sales of Lucent, which had a 2-for-1 stock
split on Feb. 12, more than doubled, to 34.79 million shares from
13.49 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest decrease in short interest was for Cardinal Health,
a drug wholesaler. It fell 66 percent, to 5.89 million from 17.5
million.

AMWEST (Tempe, Ariz.) _ An buyout offer by United Airlines is most

RAID - Acting on a tip from an informant, immigration officials
raided a motel north of downtown Chandler on Friday and apprehended
77 suspected illegal aliens who had spent the night in four tiny
rooms. In July 1997, the Border Patrol and Chandler police
apprehended 432 illegal immigrants during a five-day period. That
operation resulted in charges of civil-rights violations from
U.S.-born Hispanics and legal immigrants and a $35 million federal
lawsuit which recently has been settled. By JANIE MAGRUDER. Story

LORIN TRYON, CLASSIC CAR CONNOISSEUR, DIES AT 71  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorin H. Tryon Jr., whose lifelong love of cars made him a
leading connoisseur of classic automobiles, died on Feb. 12 at the
San Ramon Valley Medical Center in San Ramon, Calif. He was 71 and
lived in Danville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said a representative of the
Blackhawk Automotive Museum, of which Tryon was president.
</P>
<P>
   He was best known for his 27-year involvement with the Pebble
Beach Concours d'Elegance, an annual car show that is regarded as
the leading event of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman of the judged competition, along with Jules
Heumann, Tryon oversaw its growth from a small regional event on
the Monterey Peninsula to one that attracts classic car aficionados
and entries from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon, a third-generation Californian, was born in San Francisco
in 1927 and served in the Army in World War II before graduating
from the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   His paternal grandfather was one of California's first
automobile dealers; at the age of 7, his friends say, Lorin Tryon
was running his own 10-cent car wash at his family's home, picking
up and delivering his customers' cars, driving them himself when he
was barely tall enough to peer over the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon's involvement with Pebble Beach happened by chance.
Heumann said that while he and Tryon were at another car show in
1971, they discussed various ways they would improve the Pebble
Beach competition if they were in charge. One organizer of the
event overhead them and challenged them to make good on their
words.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, when they took over the Concours, Heumann and Tryon
instituted a change in vehicle judging that was regarded then as
revolutionary, asking experts from each class of automobiles
presented to do the judging. Previously, generalists rather than
specialists had judged each class since the Pebble Beach
competition started in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Tryon and Heumann continued to upgrade both the
quality of the cars in the competition and the manner in which they
were judged; eventually, the phrase ``restored to Pebble Beach
standards'' entered the car collector's lexicon as a synonym for
the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Jerry Seinfeld entered examples of the first and last
generations of the Porsche 911. The 1990 best-of-show winner was a
1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, owned by Ralph Lauren. Jay Leno
also has entered cars in the competition, which is held every
August on the 18th fairway at the Lodge at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon was president of the Blackhawk Automotive Museum, which
displays cars manufactured from 1925 to 1948 in Danville, site of
the 1997 conference of the Fifth World Forum for Motor Museums and
the first International Automotive Design Forum at Blackhawk, to be
held next Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Tryon and Heumann were co-recipients of the Meguiar's
Award, given annually to car collectors for outstanding
contributions to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon is survived by his wife, Dolores; a daughter, Catherine; a
son, Bill, and stepchildren and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon himself had owned a large number of classic cars, among
them a 1930 Duesenberg Murphy Town Car, a 1931 Cadillac V16
Fleetwood Landaulet and a 1932 Packard 12 Dietrich Runabout.
Heumann recalled that the Cadillac ``had an unusual high-speed rear
end, and Lorin loved to drive it at 100 miles per hour.''

 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ David Wells paced around his spacious home in Palm
Harbor, Fla., for hours on Thursday, feeling dejected and rejected.
Over and over, Wells talked to David Cone about his baseball life
being startlingly uprooted and about how his ultimate dream of
playing for the Yankees vanished after one fateful visit into Joe
Torre's office.
</P>
<P>
   For four memorable hours, Cone said, he had ``a wild and
rambling conversation'' with a player who considered himself a
rebel in a Yankee uniform. Wells was depressed and devastated,
unable to understand why the Yankees, his beloved Yankees, had
dealt him, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush to the Toronto Blue Jays for
Roger Clemens late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a state of shock,'' Cone said. ``Literally in a
state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was so hyper, Cone said, that he hopped on a plane to
Miami on Thursday night to go on a golfing vacation. Given an extra
weekend of freedom because the Jays do not hold their first workout
for pitchers and catchers until Monday, Wells bolted to find some
solitude. After witnessing Wells' behavior, Cone predicted it would
be a long time before Wells found peace with his trade. If he ever
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been Roger Clemens, it could have been Satchel
Paige,'' Cone said. ``He feels rejected right now. He equates this
to being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cone sat and Wells paced, the telephone rang continually with
friends of the 35-year-old left-hander asking him what had
happened. When two reporters showed up on Wells' doorstep, he went
ballistic and called the sheriff on them. Cone laughed as he
recalled Wells' yelling at the two reporters and then complimenting
one for being so intrepid. But, other than that outburst, Cone
described Wells as morose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I've ever seen him down like that,'' Cone said.
``He's always so upbeat. To see him so clearly and visibly upset
was a tough thing. He didn't take it well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said Wells received a call from Gord Ash, Toronto's general
manager, but they spoke ``very briefly'' and that puzzled the
pitcher. So Cone theorized that maybe the Blue Jays were
contemplating trading Wells to another team, like Cleveland, and
the notion of playing for the more powerful Indians gave Wells some
solace. But not for long. He loved being a Yankee and, besides, Ash
was adamant about keeping Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is zero chance that we're going to move him,'' Ash told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Yankees said they tried to call Wells, Cone was
the only player who trekked the 15 minutes to visit him. Cone
initially reasoned that he was the only player who had the address.
After some prodding, Cone conceded, ``They could have found him.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter said, ``I left him a message, but I haven't heard
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After Darryl Strawberry underwent his first chemotherapy
treatment for colon cancer in Florida Friday, he visited Legends
Field for the first time and smiled when he talked about Wells.
Like him or dislike him, Wells was entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You love to have a pitcher like him,'' Strawberry said.
``We'll probably never have another guy like him. He was one of a
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball players are notorious for gazing to the future
after their teammates are traded, and Andy Pettitte did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hates to see him go,'' Pettitte said. ``But I think
everybody is like: `OK We'll see you later. You got traded. We'll
see you when we play Toronto.' ''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner was still talking about Wells like a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that David understands how I feel about him,'' said
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner. ``This is baseball. It
happens every day. It happened when Boston traded Babe Ruth to the
Yankees. I hate to keep reminding them about that, but it's true.''

EDITORIAL: TOWARD CLEANER SUV'S  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Required by law to impose tougher rules on automobile air
pollution by 2004, Carol Browner, the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, is going about it in the right
way. The new regulations she has sent to the White House for its
approval will require not only cleaner engines but cleaner fuels as
well.
</P>
<P>
   This means that not one but two powerful industries _ the
automobile manufacturers and the oil companies _ will be lobbying
to relax those rules. Ms. Browner is almost certain to get
President Clinton's support. Less certain is the outlook in
Congress, where some Republicans have repeatedly tried to undermine
her administrative authority.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial rule would drastically reduce pollution
from so-called light trucks _ a category that includes the wildly
popular sport utility vehicles (SUV's), mini-vans and pickup trucks
that have done so much to bring the good times back to Detroit.
Until now, vehicles in this category have been allowed to produce
up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard cars,
because regulators have regarded light trucks as work vehicles. The
proposed rules would cut the allowable pollution from standard cars
in half by 2004, and require most SUV's, mini-vans and pickups to
meet the same standard by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-vans, SUV's and pickups account for nearly half of new
purchases, and their popularity could soon obliterate recent gains
in air quality. With that in mind, California announced in November
that these vehicles would have to meet the state's emissions
standards for autos by 2006, a slightly stricter timetable than Ms.
Browner's.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile companies may lobby for an even more relaxed
schedule. But they have been mollified to some extent by Ms.
Browner's concurrent decision to order up cleaner fuels, which will
make it easier for the car makers to meet their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries will be required to cut the nationwide average of
sulfur in gasoline by about 90 percent, beginning in 2004. This is
vital because sulfur clogs up a vehicle's catalytic converter, the
device that cleans car exhaust of nitrogen oxide and other
pollutants that cause smog and acid rain. Cleaner gasoline alone
could achieve the same result as taking 54 million cars off the
road _ a prospect that delights states like New York that are
constantly struggling to bring their air into compliance with
Federal health standards.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will pay more under these new rules, although it is
not clear how much. The new emissions standards could add several
hundred dollars to the cost of SUV's and other vehicles in the
light truck category, and the sulfur rules could add several cents
to the price of a gallon of gasoline as the oil companies retool
their refineries to meet the new standard. Oil industry spokesmen
say the adjustments could cost $5 billion to $6 billion altogether.
</P>
<P>
   However, ever since the original Clean Air Act was written into
law in 1970, industry in general has routinely overestimated the
costs of environmental rules while greatly underestimating the
ability of its own engineers to respond to timely regulation and
commercial realities. Ms. Browner is betting that improved
technology can deliver cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels at an
affordable price. Historically, that has been a safe bet.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 21)  
 (af)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From a public relations standpoint, the decision by Victoria's
Secret to put its annual Manhattan fashion show on its new Internet
site early this month was an unqualified master stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after a high-profile Super Bowl commercial invited
the world to tune in, the lingerie retailer offered up its parade
of semiclothed seductresses, live on the Web. A record 750,000
users viewed the event the evening it occurred and millions more
heard about it through media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The perspective from cyberspace, however, was a good deal less
beguiling. Like many other Internet aficionados, Jakob Nielsen, a
site design expert and publisher in Atherton, Calif., considered
the event a disappointment, a missed opportunity to exploit an
expansive new medium.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it took forever to get access to the pictures,
which were grainy enough to have been beamed back from an Apollo
space mission. The real shame, Nielsen said, was the retailer's
failure to use its models in a fashion show that was interactive _
``where visitors asked questions and learned about fabrics and
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They blew a chance to get millions of people to feel welcome
at their site,'' Nielsen added.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hanging back, brick-and-mortar retailers, as
sellers with real stores are now having to call themselves, are
arriving on the Internet in droves. In its year-end 1998 survey of
125 traditional retailers, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst
&AMP; Young found that 76 percent of the respondents were selling on
the Web or would be soon, up from 36 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite this influx, the list of the 50 most popular Web
shopping sites, as rated by Media Metrix, an Internet audience
measurement firm, contains few familiar names. Making the cut were
Barnes &AMP; Noble; Macy's, a unit of Federated Department Stores, and
Wal-Mart. Not on the list were Gap; Sears, Roebuck, and
Bloomingdale's, another Federated unit.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this early date, some investors question whether
traditional retailers will ever catch up in the electronic bazaar.
The issue is not just academic. Wall Street is betting that the
Internet-only retailers who got there first, and got it right _ the
bookseller Amazon.com, for example, or the toy, game and software
retailer Etoys Inc. _ are in a position to dominate online sales
long into the future, taking an increasing share of sales from
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research has predicted that the Web, which accounted
for less than 1 percent of retail sales last year, will account for
6 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Lenk, chief executive of Etoys, crows that in convenience
and overall appeal, traditional retailers will never catch up.
``Customers are now looking to buy at Web pure plays because they
know we are doing a better job,'' he said. ``Being a land-based
brand is becoming a handicap.'' By December, Etoys, of Santa
Monica, Calif., was the fifth-most-visited Internet retail site,
according to Media Metrix. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most terrestrial merchants no longer insist, as they once did,
that they can do without an Internet presence. But many say they
cannot simply ape the electronic merchants, especially when it
comes to selling goods, like clothing, that are more high touch
than high technology.
</P>
<P>
   The old-line retailers bring some formidable advantages to
electronic commerce: recognized names, established images and
nationwide networks of distribution and service centers (also known
as stores).
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Wal-Mart and Gap, seem best poised to make the most
of these advantages in the long term. Others, like Toys ``R'' Us
and the Tower Records unit of MTS Inc., have been slow starters.
</P>
<P>
   But most, like Victoria's Secret, owned by Intimate Brands, are
in between. The company defends its Webcast, which may not have
wowed the Webocracy but which it says has yielded advantages all
the same. While 90 percent of its store customers are women, 60
percent of its Internet buyers in the last holiday season were men.
</P>
<P>
   So the site is attracting a new base of shoppers, who wouldn't
think of pawing through racks of lacy chemises in public.
</P>
<P>
   Because few traditional retailers report Internet sales
separately, outsiders have little by which to gauge performance,
besides technical virtuosity and site traffic. Store chains,
however, complain that site-visitor counts, or ``hits,'' are not a
complete measure of success. How can anyone account for a customer
who sees what he wants on a Web site, but then buys it in a store?
</P>
<P>
   Based on the little wisdom accumulated so far, Web consultants
and the retailing chains themselves are cobbling together a whole
new set of rules and standards for success _ among them are speedy
site navigation, generous return policies and companywide
coordination. But the guidelines are still in flux, and subject to
change at the click of a mouse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom among many Web merchants is that first
is best. As Bruce Judson, co-author of ``Hyperwars'' (Scribner,
1999), said in a recent interview, ``There is a huge advantage in
first-to-market.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pointing to companies like Amazon.com, Etoys and CD Now, which
Media Metrix lists as among the 10 top E-stores by number of
visitors, he chided their competitors _ Barnes &AMP; Noble, Toys ``R''
Us and Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   Any and all of the come-latelies, of course, may yet gain a
strong Web presence. The online traffic at Barnesandnoble.com is
growing rapidly, but it's only about half that of Amazon.com.
Still, if any of them had jumped in early _ the debut of
Barnesandnoble followed Amazon's by nearly two years _ ``they could
have prevented what will be intense competition from now on,''
Judson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some traditional retailers say they have good reason to proceed
with caution: They have a lot to lose. A poorly conceived Web site
could cannibalize their stores' customer base, undermine their
brand names and cost them a fortune in site development and
support.
</P>
<P>
   One common strategy is to use the Web as a billboard, to
advertise and affirm a company image. Among the land-bound powers
that have sites where visitors can look, but not order, are Target,
a unit of Dayton Hudson; Neiman Marcus, part of Harcourt General,
and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie's nostalgic black-and-white site deftly offers free
e-mail accounts, a pinball game and electronic postcards of beach
soccer matches _ all fitting the romanticized frat-boy life style
that its stores are merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers in this group have no apologies about missing the
first wave. Carolyn Brookter, a Target spokeswoman, said: ``As a
company, we are cautious about moving into unknown territory. We
are still asking, `Is this where we want to be?'''
</P>
<P>
   NM Direct, Neiman's catalog arm, plans to have the retailer's
Web site allow purchases by this fall. But Sharen Turney, an NM
Direct executive working on the Internet effort, sees no rush.
``There is no such thing as being too late,'' she said. ``Everyone
is learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research, says that going slowly, however, comes at a
cost. She said she was sure that those ``in the toe-dipping realm
have had complaints, as in, `Why do we have to schlep to your
stores?'''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, she said, that every day such retailers aren't selling
on line, they are losing that market share to competitors _ and,
perhaps more importantly, giving them a head start on working out
the kinks of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Ms. Delhagen said, sooner is better than later, and a
retailers' lack of online selling will be acceptable only for
another 12 to 18 months. ``The window of customer acceptance of not
selling is closing fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to peddling wares, E-tailers have the advantage of
a narrow focus. As Lenk of Etoys said, ``We live and die by this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   They have done better as a group in part because they
concentrate exclusively on the needs of Web customers, from
insuring that their sites are easy to navigate to getting the goods
out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   During the Christmas season, Amazon.com dispatched its
executives to its warehouse, where they helped pack boxes to make
sure that gifts arrived on time. It is hard to imagine an elegant
chief executive like Leslie H. Wexner of the Limited Inc. up to his
knees in cardboard and sweating out delivery schedules.
</P>
<P>
   David Cowan, a partner with Bessemer Venture Partners, an
investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that is financing more than
a dozen Internet start-ups, says traditional retailers must be
willing to cannibalize their own stores. ``The Silicon Valley
perspective is that retailers who use their Web sites to drive
traffic to their stores are not going to be competitive,'' he said.
``They have to be willing to write off existing channels and dive
in neck deep.''
</P>
<P>
   For chains with hundreds of stores, of course, disregarding
current operations isn't a realistic option. Nor is it wise. While
E-retailers, lacking name recognition, must spend huge amounts to
build their brands and images, standard retailers, like political
incumbents, have the advantage of well-known names. They also have
stores that can educate visitors about their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether they are committed to leveraging
their good names.
</P>
<P>
   The steps necessary to selling on the Web often throw a company
into a civil war, analysts say. Letting customers return their Web
purchases to the stores can give standard retailers a huge edge
over their electronic competitors. But at many chains, analysts
say, store managers resent taking returns of Internet purchases
because their sales figures will be depressed. Mall operators would
complain because their rents are tied to store sales.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of state sales tax; merchandise from
stores can be subject to it, but on the Internet it is not
mandatory. That means if retailers add the tax to online purchases,
they could lose the competitive pricing edge; but if they don't,
store returns can be difficult negotiations. This has resulted in
policies all over the board.
</P>
<P>
   Customers shouldn't bother trying to return the pink Valentine's
Day teddy they bought from the Victoria's Secret Web site to the
chain's stores, for example; it won't be accepted there. But at a
Macy's or a J.C. Penney store, Web-purchase returns are no problem.
Most consultants say old-line retailers must get everyone in the
company to back the Web campaign by promoting and supporting it
through the stores.
</P>
<P>
   First prize in this category goes to Gap. Every Gap ad, store
and shopping bag proclaims the Web address. Returns of online goods
are accepted through every Gap channel. At its flagship stores, Gap
has set up stations for ordering from the Web. Teen-aged mall rats
are entertained, while the computer-queasy are gently initiated.

 UNDATED: gently initiated.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gap has even experimented with using its network of 1,450 United
States stores as tiny distribution centers for same-day delivery,
an effort with obvious implications for Web purchases. According to
analysts, a Manhattan test with bike messengers last summer did not
go too smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The company disagreed, but would not say when it would try
again. If the effort ever takes off, it could set a standard for
other traditional merchants that would clearly be challenging to
E-tailers. ``It is visionary,'' said Julianna Nelson, an apparel
retail analyst with the International Data Corp., a research firm
in Framingham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bedrock principle of Web-page design is that viewers value
speed over visual virtuosity. Proof is seen in the popularity of
Yahoo, which is devoid of eye candy. In guiding consumers to the
products they want, successful Web retailers like Amazon.com
observe the ``three-click rule,'' meaning that a shopper can get to
the product he wants within three clicks of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   They also keep downloading time to a minimum, at least until
shoppers reach the products they want to see up close and buy. In
other words, no luxuriously detailed photos or graphics up front.
</P>
<P>
   Such gulag-style design standards are anathema to retailers who
have spent years cultivating upscale images. Some department stores
would sooner empty their display windows than have their
introductory Web home pages dispense with sensuous shots of
cashmere and simpering models. But Nielsen, the Web designer,
called these images ``the equivalent of hiring well-dressed clerks
who are too snooty to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Crawford, who manages Ernst &AMP; Young's retail consulting
practice, calls for a compromise between appearances and
convenience. ``The look and feel and image of a site should be
consistent with brand image,'' he said. But until technology
improves, he acknowledged, the Web will remain more friendly to
retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco that emphasize low pricing, no
frills and wide selections.
</P>
<P>
   Established retailers and upstarts also usually differ in how
much they rely on technology to shape their approach. Web-based
merchants tend to swear by software that analyzes a customer's
buying patterns, predicts likely purchases and offers them up.
</P>
<P>
   At the CD Now site, for example, clicking on ``Wide Open
Spaces'' by the Dixie Chicks produces a link to albums like Bonnie
Raitt's ``Fundamental'' that have attracted other Dixie Chicks
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers with years of merchandising experience, however, are
skeptical of software that acts as if it's smarter than their
customers, or them. Assuming too much about a customer based on
previous purchases could eliminate an impulse purchase, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We analyze to a certain extent, but we don't want to
categorize our customers in a group where they might not belong,''
said Kim Miller, vice president for Internet strategies at
Macys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough, said Judson, the ``Hyperwars'' author, but no
reason that Macy's can't offer a matching blouse every time a buyer
clicks on a pair of slacks. ``Remember,'' he said, ``you've got to
go with the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to go with the medium is with interactivity _
something the most successful pioneers used early and often. Etoys,
for example, allows visitors to plug in birthdays that they want to
be reminded of. And Mothernature.com, a natural-products site,
allows shoppers to customize their entire product selection:
diabetics, for instance, can ask not to be shown any item with more
than 5 milligrams of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike lavishly decorated stores, Web sites are supple enough to
be renovated at little cost. Retailers might get it wrong, but they
can always change course. The best will probably learn as they go,
erring on the side of boldness and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Black, president of Interactive Bureau, a Web-design firm
in New York, says that no amount of sitting around in a conference
room, analyzing options, will let any company get a Web site
perfect from the start. His advice: ``Build it first and quickly,
and then rebuild it until you get it right.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't that Chick and Adele Lebow do not enjoy each other's
company; the Royersford, Pa., couple have been married almost 55
years. But Mrs. Lebow is an avid golfer, with a passion for playing
the courses around their Philadelphia-area home, while Lebow's
passion for skiing keeps him away at least a month almost every
year. Even at 75, he has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave here, I'm heading for a week at Mammoth Mountain,
Calif., then to Taos, N.M.,'' Lebow said in a recent telephone
interview after coming off the slopes in Zermatt, Switzerland. The
week before he had skied at another Swiss resort, St. Moritz, and
shortly before that at Lake Tahoe, Nev., Salt Lake City and in
British Columbia. ``It's a lot of traveling,'' he acknowledged,
``but it's what helps keep me young _ or at least keeps me feeling
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebow, a semiretired furniture store owner, is emblematic of the
growing number of ``mature travelers,'' as the nonprofit Travel
Industry Association terms those over 55, who have not let age curb
their desire to travel. In fact, the 70-Plus Ski Club in
Schenectady, N.Y., to which he belongs, has 14,800 members.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees always have been big travelers. What is new is their
penchant for high-adventure travel more typical of those half their
age. These days, many older people, even octogenarians, can be
found riding elephants in India, horseback riding in Costa Rica and
bungee-jumping in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure-travel industry is rushing to accommodate them.
While many tour operators still offer typical retiree fare _
lengthy bus tours of Europe and the United States _ they now also
have offerings like river rafting, hiking and mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Globus &AMP; Cosmos of Littleton, Colo., the world's biggest
escorted-travel operator, has added eight tours this year, offering
more excursions and optional tours as well as river rafting in the
Rockies and diving at Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It also has
tours of two weeks or less to accommodate the work schedules of the
growing group of travelers who are not yet retired or semiretired.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Nisbet, executive director for marketing at the tour
company, said this accommodation would become more important with
each year because many baby boomers were expected to continue
working full- or part-time well beyond their normal retirement
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of adventure travel for seniors didn't exist
10 years ago,'' said Tom Otwell, a spokesman for the American
Association of Retired People.
</P>
<P>
   But now at least a dozen adventure travel companies either
market primarily to over-50 travelers or have discovered that they
do not need to single out mature travelers because they are signing
up for adventure trips without special prompting.
</P>
<P>
   Clement G. Motten is one of the many older citizens who have
retained their lifelong love of travel. ``I don't know how much
longer I'm going to be able to continue traveling,'' said the
82-year-old professor emeritus of Latin American history at Temple
University. He recently returned from his umpteenth trip to
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where he revisited Mayan ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Although his vision has deteriorated, Motten said: ``Even if it
degenerates more, I don't think I'd give up traveling altogether.
With so many places left to visit, I'm not ready yet to settle
down.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   A study for the AARP found that travelers 50 and older spent
more than $30 billion on vacation travel in 1994. Since then, by
all accounts, their numbers, expenditures and travel options have
increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Although estimates vary widely as to the financial impact of
adventure travel, Campbell said the industry consensus is that it
is about $8 billion a year. ``But it is the fastest-growing segment
of the travel industry,'' he added, ``growing at 8 to 10 percent a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many older Americans are too ill or too poor to
travel. But many mature Americans, including many of the 35 million
who are 65 or older, have paid off their mortgages and their
children's tuition bills. ``They have more money to spend on travel
than any large group of adults before or since,'' said Joe
Gallagher, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   David Oakley Sr., 61, an auto dealer in Bartlesville, Okla.,
whose two children are long out of college, acquired his love of
travel when he sailed to Chile and Taiwan in the Navy. In the last
30 years, he and his wife, Carolyn, have made about 25 trips to
Europe. ``Travel is my sin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley is a mere stripling next to Otto Lang of Seattle, who
during a long career with 20th Century Fox produced movies
including ``Call Northside 777.'' Now 91, Lang plans his annual ski
trip to either Sun Valley, Idaho, or Vail, Colo., later this month.
If he does not spend as much time on the ski slopes this year as in
the past, he said, it will be because ``the knees have started to
become a maintenance problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 88, Louise Wollan of Springfield, Ill., knows that
feeling; sore knees and assorted other aches and pains make getting
out of bed quite a challenge some mornings, she said. But she likes
challenges, especially when they are combined with travel. Four
years ago, for example, on a tour with her grandson, Dennis, and
two weeks short of her 84th birthday, she bungee-jumped from a
bridge over a gorge in Queenstown, New Zealand, plunging 150 feet
and, as she described it, ``bobbing like a yo-yo.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't she scared? ``Not really,'' she said, adding that she had
also flown in hot air balloons over France, traveled in Vietnam a
year ago with a son who served there as an Army engineer, and had
visited all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived a fairly dignified life, as my five children would
probably agree,'' she said, ``but I bungee-jumped on impulse, and I
found it exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Globus &AMP; Cosmos put together a ``travel think tank'' made up of
a geography professor, a mountain climber, a European tour guide,
travel agents and tour operators from six countries. The group drew
up some 300 possible tours, which will be trimmed to about 40, then
will be made available next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mapintour, another large tour operator, started in 1951 to cater
to what its founder, Steve Kang, described as ``a small, elite
group who could afford to take long escorted tours.'' Its current
150 tours in 50 countries and 35 states include eight first-time
``soft adventure'' tours designed primarily for travelers 45 to 60
but available to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Five tours include horseback riding, others hot air balloon
trips, river and white-water rafting, hiking and canoeing. ``But
they aren't Spartan,'' Kang said. ``After you've been out all day,
you still come back to a comfortable hotel and get to have a nice
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gunnar, 70, a retired engineer and semiretired free-lance
photographer in Langley, Wash., said he and his wife, Antje, had
nothing against comfort, but not at the expense of a good
adventure. The Gunnars have been to the Antarctic and the North
Pole, and in September they hiked the Inca Trail through Peru,
crossing mountain passes up to 13,000 feet, and camping at 11,000-
to 12,000-foot elevations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember when I was young the many old people in
rocking chairs waiting to die,'' Gunnar said. ``Now a lot of older
people have enough money and good enough health to travel. And when
they do die, they hope it's while traveling.''

EDITORIAL: TURKS, KURDS AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's arrest this week of the Kurdish guerrilla leader
Abdullah Ocalan set off violent protests in Europe and sent
diplomatic tremors rippling through Washington and the Middle East.
These far-reaching consequences highlight the degree to which
Turkey's struggle against Kurdish separatism, and the resulting
Kurdish diaspora, have influenced and distorted relations between
Ankara and its neighbors and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Washington actively helped Turkey track down Ocalan and bring
him to justice. The United States, like Turkey, views the Kurdish
rebel as a terrorist. But for other countries, the Ocalan issue is
complicated by demographic or strategic considerations. Some
850,000 Kurds and nearly 3 million Turks now live in the European
Union. Germany alone has 500,000 Kurds and 2 million Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of violent demonstrations like those that erupted against
Greek, Kenyan and Israeli diplomatic posts this week led Germany
and other European countries to shut their doors to Ocalan in
recent months. They did not care to play host to him as a political
refugee or extradite him to Turkey to face charges of mass murder
and treason.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, which itself fought for independence from Turkish
rule in the early 19th century, Kurdish separatism attracts special
sympathy. Four Greek Cabinet members were dismissed this week for
letting Ocalan fall into Turkish hands in Kenya after taking him
under Greek diplomatic protection.
</P>
<P>
   The national aspirations of some 20 million Kurds living in the
Middle East have long roiled that region. Iran, Iraq and Turkey
have substantial Kurdish populations. Agitation by the Kurds for
creation of a homeland of their own has been brutally suppressed by
these countries. Syria, which also includes a large number of
Kurds, until recently supported Ocalan's guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   That calculus changed after Turkey began military cooperation
with Israel, Syria's southern neighbor. The arrangement
strengthened both partners, militarily and diplomatically. Last
year Turkey began to mobilize its army on the Syrian border,
persuading Damascus to distance itself from the Kurdish fighters.
While Israel has been grateful to gain Turkey as a strong new ally
in the Middle East, it paid a painful price this week when Kurdish
protesters stormed its consulate in Berlin. Israeli security guards
killed three Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kurds of northern Iraq have repeatedly let
Turkish troops sweep through their territory in pursuit of Ocalan's
guerrillas. While not happy about helping Turkish soldiers hunt
down fellow Kurds, the Iraqi Kurds need Ankara's good will. The
American planes that protect them from Baghdad fly out of an air
base in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   America's close military partnership with Turkey has muted
Washington's criticism of Turkey's treatment of its Kurdish
minority. Kurds are denied education in their own language, and
even their nonviolent political parties face legal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's reluctance to speak out is shortsighted. Turkey can
become an even more valuable ally by showing greater respect for
minority rights. Ankara should use Ocalan's arrest to open a
political dialogue with Kurdish leaders.  &QL;

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES UTILIZE MYSTIQUE OF THEIR FAMOUS KIN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ As they barnstorm for votes, Panama's
leading presidential candidates are milking the mystique of their
famous families.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the May 2 election is Martin Torrijos, 35.
He is the son of Gen. Omar Torrijos, the cigar-chomping military
ruler who became a national hero by negotiating the Panama Canal
treaties that will give this country full control of the waterway
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Running second, according to polls, is Mireya Moscoso, 53. She
is the widow of Arnulfo Arias, a firebrand populist, three-time
president and Panama's most famous civilian politician.
</P>
<P>
   Banker Alberto Vallarino, a political newcomer, is in third
place.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos, a graduate of Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station,
has little government experience, and Moscoso has none.
</P>
<P>
   However, their ties to influential rulers of the past apparently
are more important to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos' campaign headquarters is plastered with posters of his
father. Moscoso heads the Arnulfista Party, which is named after
her late husband.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts shave said that the nostalgia stems from Panamanians'
disappointment with recent governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we remember the past? Because our present leaders have
given us nothing,'' said Francisco Alvarez, a volunteer in the
Moscoso campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Torrijos, who came to power in a 1968 coup that overthrew
Arias, is blamed by critics for ushering in 21 years of military
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos took under his wing a young National Guard lieutenant
named Manuel Antonio Noriega, who later became dictator and was
ousted in the U.S. intervention in the Panama crisis of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Torrijos also brought minorities into government for the
first time. He built schools and public housing. He negotiated the
canal treaties with then-President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   A restless leader who loved the countryside, Torrijos waded
across rivers to visit Indian villages and landed his helicopter in
fields for impromptu town meetings. He was killed in a plane crash
in 1981, but there are reminders of him throughout Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama City are a Torrijos museum and a neighborhood called
Torrijos-Carter. After several visits to Panama in the 1970s,
British writer Graham Greene wrote a complimentary book about
Torrijos called ``Getting to Know the General.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar Torrijos achieved the national goal in the 1970s of
recuperating the Canal Zone. Back then, the objective was clear,''
said Juan Jovane, an economist at the University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that that's happened, what is the national project? All
three candidates are looking for the key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people yearn for is the simplicity of that
government, its accessibility and its willingness to listen,''
wrote Nils Castro, a columnist for the Panama City daily La Prensa.
</P>
<P>
   Current President Ernesto Perez Balladares is widely viewed as
aloof. Although he heads the Revolutionary Democratic Party, or PRD
_ a leftist party founded by Omar Torrijos _ many have said that he
has turned a blind eye to Panama's social problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel cheated,'' said one PRD member, explaining that he had
expected a more populist government. ``He spends all his time with
bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez Balladares has modernized the economy and privatized
inefficient state companies. Panama has enjoyed robust economic
growth throughout much of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic measures have hurt industries and farmers.
Unemployment is about 14 percent and the gap between rich and poor
is growing. There are concerns about Panama's ability to run the
canal and to develop Canal Zone properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, voters soundly defeated a referendum to change the
Constitution and allow Perez Balladares to run for a second
consecutive five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The result left the PRD scrambling for a candidate to shore up
the party's working-class base. In the primary, Martin Torrijos
defeated his half-brother, Omar Torrijos Jr., and his cousin, Hugo
Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Marco Gandasegui questioned whether Martin
Torrijos is prepared for the rough and tumble of a political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the charisma of his father,'' Gandasegui said.
``He's a nice guy, but he's not a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Torrijos joined a brigade of Panamanian
volunteers who fought in the 1979 Sandinista uprising against
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he graduated from Texas A&AMP;M with degrees in economics and
political science. He was a manager for McDonald's in Chicago, then
returned to Panama to serve as vice minister of government and
justice under President Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos has pledged a kinder, gentler brand of government,
although he has acknowledged that Panama lacks the resources to
resurrect the populist programs for which his father's government
was known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is founded on the ideology of `Torrijismo,' but we
understand that there is a new reality, that this isn't the
1970s,'' Torrijos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a globalized world that requires excellence and
efficiency,'' he said. ``But what is valid is the method that Gen.
Torrijos used of consultation and participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso also has the common touch. During a recent campaign
swing through a poor Panama City neighborhood, she wore jeans and a
red sweatshirt. She was followed by a three-man band playing an
accordion, maracas and drums.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, her late husband, Arnulfo Arias, often was seen as
bombastic and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   He threatened to rescind the citizenship of Panamanian blacks
and to dissolve the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   He also experienced the wrath of the United States during World
War II by refusing to allow the installation of military bases
outside the Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Arias also extended the right to vote to women, established
a social security system and pushed through land reform and a
progressive income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Arias became a kind of martyr for civilian government because
all three of his presidential terms were cut short by coups. He is
believed to have won the fraud-tainted 1984 presidential election
in which Noriega's hand-picked candidate was declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnulfo Arias was involved in politics for 75 years. He left
behind a doctrine which was to work for the poorest people in this
country,'' said Moscoso, as she shook hands with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is our guide. It's like a religion,'' said Alvarez, the
campaign volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso met Arias in 1964 when he was in his 60s and she was a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The two were married in 1969 in the United States, where they
lived in exile for a decade. Arias died in 1988. &UR;

   Remember Medicare? With all the attention these days focused on
President Clinton's proposal to salvage Social Security, it is easy
to forget that Medicare _ the program that provides about 39
million elderly and disabled Americans with basic health insurance
_ is riddled with far deeper, more imminently threatening financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's trust fund will run out of money as early as 2008
(compared with 2032 for Social Security's). And because the elderly
are living longer and medical costs are rising faster than most
other prices, Medicare costs are going up more quickly than
spending by Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the 17 members of the federal commission created by
Congress in 1997 to fix Medicare will meet to decide what, if any,
proposals they will submit to Congress by their March 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And what many of the members have in mind is the most radical
surgery on the program since it was created over 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A faction of 10 democratic and Republican appointees wants to
scrap the existing Medicare system in favor of creating a market of
competing public and private plans. A faction of liberal democratic
appointees is fighting to preserve the existing government-run
fee-for-service plan, which reimburses doctors for nearly any bill
they submit.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules require 11 votes to forward a proposal to
Congress. That puts make-or-break power in the hands of two
economics professors appointed by the White House _ Stuart Altman
of Brandeis University and Laura D'Andrea Tyson of the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the commission is whether competition in health
care can be instituted without threatening the safety of vulnerable
families. As economists, the two swing voters agree that
competition is needed to modernize a sclerotic Medicare system. As
liberals, they say the price of their votes is the guarantee of a
specific set of benefits, including coverage for prescription
drugs, which Medicare does not provide now. Drugs could add $20
billion to $40 billion a year to the $215 billion program.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the chairman of the commission, John Breaux, a
democratic senator from Louisiana, agreed to add drug coverage. But
he gave no indication how complete the coverage would be. If he
concedes too much to Altman and Ms. Tyson, he risks losing support
of some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas says he would be ``reluctant to sign
onto a brand-new benefit when we have not dealt with the financial
predicament of Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   So what began as a high-minded debate over competition could
quickly become an old-fashioned spat over money that may well
stretch past the March 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission can come up with an affordable way to add an
adequate drug benefit while avoiding a tax increase and creating
enough genuine competition to help curb costs, it will present a
package to Congress that Democrats and Republicans will have a
difficult time opposing. And even if such a plan ran into
roadblocks on Capitol Hill, it would still be likely to set a
framework for whatever is ultimately done to rescue Medicare from
its perils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has two components. Part A covers hospital bills, paid
from a trust fund that receives revenues from payroll taxes on
workers and employers. Part B covers doctor bills, home health
services and other outpatient costs. About 25 percent of these
outpatient costs are covered by a monthly premium on retirees, now
set at $45.50 but scheduled to double by 2007. The balance of the
outpatient bills is paid from general tax revenues. The government
spends about $5,700 a year per person.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of participants choose the government's
fee-for-service coverage. It provides patients the widest possible
choice of doctors but also compels them, or employers on their
behalf, to spend an average of about $1,500 each a year on
co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs, including those for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the elderly buy Medigap policies,
supplemental insurance that pays for some of the bills that
Medicare does not. About 15 percent enroll in private managed-care
plans. But government price controls and other regulations have
choked off wider availability.
</P>
<P>
   The system is under threat from two directions. The first is
financial. government actuaries estimate that the cost of Medicare,
relative to the size of the federal budget, is likely to double
over the next 20 years, from 12 percent to about 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is inadequacy. Medicare omits key features of
most employer-provided health insurance plans. It has no cap on
out-of-pocket costs, so patients are vulnerable to large costs from
catastrophic illness. It excludes coverage of prescription drugs.
And as Alain Enthoven, a professor at the Stanford Business School,
points out, it ``offers few of the innovative techniques that the
best private plans have adopted to improve patient care, like
elaborate data-scanning systems that flag potentially dangerous
combinations of drugs that a patient's physicians have unknowingly
prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   For both reasons, Medicare cries out for overhaul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, as chairman of the commission, has provided an outline
of a solution _ the only outline the commission is actively
considering. It rests on the notion of managed competition, the
idea behind the Clinton health care proposal of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan shipwrecked over the complexity of extending
coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans. But that
problem does not apply to Medicare because the elderly are already
guaranteed coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux plan embodies ideas that have been embraced by
liberals like Henry Aaron and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings
Institution, conservatives including Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, and many in between. The goal, proponents say, is to
harness competition to drive down costs, encourage innovation and
improve quality.
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's plan, Medicare participants could stick to the
government-run fee-for-service program. But they would also have a
choice of private managed-care plans offering all of the benefits
in the government plan, plus, possibly, others.
</P>
<P>
   An oversight board would solicit bids from private plans, asking
them how much they would charge to cover participants. The premium
for the government plan, meanwhile, would be set at its average
cost per person.
</P>
<P>
   The government would contribute, say, 88 percent of the premium
charged by each plan, up to a limit. Medicare participants would
pay the balance, typically 12 percent of the premium.
</P>
<P>
   As an added incentive for people to choose low-cost plans,
Breaux's proposal would pick up more than 88 percent of their cost,
perhaps leaving individuals nothing to pay on their own. And he
would set higher charges for high-income families and provide
low-income subsidies so ``everyone could afford an average-priced
plan that provides essential benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   A family that chose a more expensive plan than the average for
all the plans in the market _ perhaps lured by a wide roster of
specialists or low deductibles _ would pay all the additional cost
($300 a year over the cost of the government plan, or 17 percent of
the premium, in one example provided by the commission).
</P>
<P>
   A family that chose the low-cost plan in the example, which
might restrict enrollees to a small network of doctors, would pay
$132 less than the cost of the government plan, or 11 percent of
the premium.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs, Breaux's plan would gradually raise the age of
eligibility to 67 over a period of 25 years, mirroring changes that
are scheduled for Social Security. And he would allow the agency
that runs the government's fee-for-service plan to acquire powers
like those wielded by private purchasing cooperatives to win big
discounts, including the right to do business with selected doctors
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, a commission member who used to run Medicare for
the Clinton administration, thinks the new tools could make the
government plan itself a formidable competitor in the Medicare
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of competition, Altman said, is ``to breathe
innovation into the otherwise bureaucratically stiff system that is
too often controlled by a politically motivated Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Medicare once introduced new approaches, like the
system for paying hospitals according to diagnosis rather than
length of stay. ``But in recent years,'' he said, ``Medicare has
fallen far behind the private sector in figuring out new ways to
treat patients.'' Competing private plans could be the stimulus, he
said, to improving care and driving spending lower.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck disagreed, saying that the ``notion that competition in
health care for the elderly will cut costs and improve quality is a
fantasy.'' He predicted that the Breaux plan would ``segment the
market,'' steering the poor into low-cost, poor-quality HMOs while
``the rich will flock to fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   And he worries about cherry-picking _ the practice in which
plans pick out the healthiest enrollees, leaving the chronically
ill for fee-for-service coverage. That could eventually make the
fee-for-service plan a high-cost outlier, affordable only to the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., worries that the Breaux plan leaves
families vulnerable if Congress allows the value of the government
contribution to shrink over time. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., adds
that he remains ``darkly suspicious'' of the assumption that
managed-care plans ``will provide high-quality care.''
</P>
<P>
   But other commission members are quick to defend the Breaux
plan. How could it ``drive poor people into bad plans,'' asked
Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, ``if, as the chairman
proposes, every plan is required to offer a complete set of
benefits and government hands over enough money so that anyone can
afford the average-cost plan?'' And, she said, if the Breaux plan
does not protect future retirees from congressional cutbacks,
neither does the current system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To answer the fears of cherry-picking, Breaux said the
government would ``risk-adjust'' plans, transferring money from
those that enrolled few chronically ill patients to those that
treated a disproportionate number of very sick people. But Vladeck
challenges government's ability to determine the necessary
transfers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many other technical problems in pushing Medicare
toward competitive markets, but none are expected to drive Altman
or Ms. Tyson away from handing Breaux the 11th vote he needs to
approach Congress. That brings the commission back to the one issue
that could prove fatal to consensus: prescription drugs. Everyone
deems them essential, but their huge costs come atop a program that
is already in financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   The problem gets tricky because private insurers already pay a
lot for drugs. About 65 percent of the elderly receive drug
benefits, almost half of them through their former employers and
the others through Medigap plans, Medicaid or other means.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies oppose adding drug coverage to the
government-run plan because they fear it will lead to price
controls. The Republican members of the commission, ever mindful of
adding expensive benefits and thereby cornering Congress into
raising taxes, want to avoid a sweeping drug benefit that wipes out
this private money, preferring to focus on those who do not yet
have drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of employers providing drug coverage is falling
rapidly, and over time fewer of the elderly will be able to afford
to buy Medigap policies that cover drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There are no easily affordable answers. Indeed, heading into
next week's meeting, commission members have yet to see cost
estimates for different types of drug coverage. Making matters
worse are some poisonous feelings among the commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Democratic appointees say in private that they
suspect the Republicans are only pretending to want a drug benefit.
Some Democrats suspect that the Republicans want to line up the
commission behind the notion of competition, so as to advance the
GOP's campaign to privatize parts of the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican members say in private that they suspect the
Democrats will only pretend to back competition in order to win the
drug benefit. Once drugs are covered, they fear, the commitment to
competition will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to overcome the money problem by proposing in his
budget to pump $700 billion into Medicare over the next 15 years.
That is enough, his budget officials estimate, to plug the
program's existing financial shortfall. But, if the commission
wants to add new benefits, like drugs, it must find savings in the
rest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money would come from competition. Based on studies
that show medical costs are lower in markets where managed care
thrives, the staff has come up with estimates that suggest
competition would shave the growth rate of Medicare costs by at
least half a percentage point a year.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true _ and now all commissioners are convinced _ the
savings could add up to hundreds of billions of dollars over time.
That, along with other potential savings, should leave room to add
some drug benefit. The question remains, how much? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the academics will provide the pivotal votes, it is
worth listening carefully to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what the right level of Medicare spending is or
how much competition will really save,'' Ms. Tyson said. ``The
important task for this commission, and Congress, is to create a
modern system that builds in powerful incentives for health
providers to reduce costs and for plans to find innovative ways to
care for patients. Breaux's plan moves in that direction _ if it
builds in adequate protection for low-income families, including an
adequate drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Breaux, the politician, appears content to approve broad
principles of agreement and let Congress and regulators fill in the
dots, the other academic, Altman, believes generalities are nearly
meaningless. What does it mean to guarantee adequate Medicare
insurance if the commission does not spell out what is in the basic
benefits package? What does it mean to say that competitive bidding
will drive down prices if the commission does not spell out what
type of bidding it has in mind?
</P>
<P>
   After all, economists point out that the bidding system used by
the federal employees plan, upon which Breaux modeled his own plan,
is clearly deficient. Will Medicare do any better?
</P>
<P>
   So Breaux has a tough task ahead. He can try to provide enough
drug benefits, low-income support and details to lure Altman or Ms.
Tyson. But costly benefits and regulatory overkill could drive away
his Republican support.

 &HT;    Rain delays Rockingham qualifying
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Qualifying for Sunday's Dura-Lube/Big Kmart
400 at North Carolina Speedway was postponed Friday because of
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup qualifying was rescheduled for 10:45 a.m. today,
with the Alltel 200 Busch race slated to start at 1 p.m. An hour of
Cup qualifying will follow the Busch race, time permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts called for snow flurries in the Rockingham area this
morning. If Winston Cup qualifying is canceled, the 43-car field
will consist of the top 30 cars based on last year's owner
standings points, the six remaining drivers with the earliest
postmarks on their entry forms and seven provisional spots.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers were welcoming the cold weather, minus the
precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the track a little better,'' Dale Jarrett said.
``Obviously, this track is worn quite a bit, so the cooler it is,
the better it'll be in that respect. It shouldn't wear the tires
quite as bad, so it should be better racing. You'll have to work
with the setup a little bit because it should be a tighter race
track.''
</P>
<P>
   NO BAD BLOOD
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett says he holds no hard feelings against Yates Racing
teammate Kenny Irwin, who knocked him out of last week's Daytona
500. On the 135th lap, Irwin tapped the left rear of Jarrett's No.
88 Ford, sending Jarrett sideways and causing a 13-car pileup
between turns 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, a two-time winner in the 500, finished 37th; Irwin,
last year's Winston Cup rookie of the year, was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing about the whole situation is Kenny is not
getting to enjoy his best run as a Cup driver,'' Jarrett said. ``He
did a tremendous job and put himself in a position to win the
Daytona 500, and people aren't letting him enjoy that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did touch. Yes, that did happen, but it was racing, and
it's as much my fault as anybody's. I put myself in a position for
something like that to happen, so everything is fine between Kenny
and I.''
</P>
<P>
   NO SECOND THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, who led more than half the Daytona 500 before
losing the lead and race to Jeff Gordon, says he has no regrets
about letting Gordon back in line with only 10 laps remaining. If
Wallace hadn't moved over, Gordon probably would have crashed into
the rear of Ricky Rudd's slow-moving No. 10 Ford on the apron in
the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing I could have done, in my mind,'' Wallace
said. ``I mean, it was a Catch-22. ... It would have been the
biggest fire in the world, and we wouldn't have needed that. A
couple of people could have died on that one, so there's nothing I
could do, really. I still stand by what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH LINEUP
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s fortunes at ``The Rock'' changed Friday
when he drew the pole for today's Alltel 200 after qualifying was
canceled. Earnhardt Jr., the defending Busch champion, finished
16th and 14th in last year's events here.
</P>
<P>
   The top 33 drivers in last year's standings points made the
field, along with Johnny Benson, the '95 Busch champion, who got a
provisional. The other nine drivers were determined by the date of
the postmark on their entry forms.
</P>
<P>
   Among those missing the field were Jeff Green, who finished
second in last week's Busch race at Daytona, Adam Petty and Cup
regulars Bobby Labonte, Mike Skinner and Dick Trickle.

 &HT;    Garner reprimanded for recruiting violation
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia defensive line coach and recruiting
coordinator Rodney Garner was reprimanded by athletics director
Vince Dooley and restricted to on-campus recruiting for a week
after committing a secondary NCAA violation, according to documents
obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, who was credited for much of the Bulldogs' recruiting
success this winter, contacted a recruit from South Carolina at the
Shrine Bowl high school all-star football game in North Carolina in
December, a period when recruiting is restricted. After realizing
he'd made improper contact, Garner reported the violation to
Georgia's compliance office, which reported it to the SEC and the
NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Garner was forced to forgo the final three of seven personal
contacts allowed with the prospect (defensive back Brian Mance of
Manning, S.C.), received a letter of reprimand from Dooley and had
to stay on campus for seven days in early January. Mance eventually
signed with Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was a secondary violation and Georgia self-reported
it, no other action was taken by the SEC or NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia reported another secondary violation in January in which
two student managers donated the Bulldogs' discarded practice pants
to their respective high schools without the knowledge of UGA
administrators. As a result, the football staff was directed to
reduce by two the possible recruiting visits to Irwin County High
in Ocilla and Palmetto High in Williamston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia just completed the second year of a two-year probation
for recruiting violations that occurred under former head coach Ray
Goff. But Dooley emphatically denied that the Bulldogs have a
compliance problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are secondary violations, we reported them, we took
action and (the NCAA) approved of what we did,'' Dooley said. ``We
tried to nip it in the bud, and that's what self-policing is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has these secondary violations. It may look like
you're doing all these things wrong. But there are so many rules in
the (NCAA manual), you're bound to inadvertently break one.

 &HT;    Dooley lends support to Jirsa
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley made two
things clear Friday: One, he's not satisfied with the job coach Ron
Jirsa is doing with the basketball program and, two, he's not going
to fire Jirsa anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' was Dooley's flat answer when asked if there was a
chance Jirsa could lose his job before next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stance is I'm disappointed, just as coach Jirsa is, just as
the team is,'' Dooley said. ``But we hired him, and we've got a
commitment to him, and we're going to do everything we can to help
him succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley offered no mandate like the one he gave former football
coach Ray Goff in 1994, in which he said the team needed to make
``significant improvement'' the following season for Goff to be
retained. But he did say that if the Bulldogs' fortunes don't
improve next season, he might ``have to make some decisions about
(Jirsa's) contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, basketball coach Hugh Durham was critical of
Dooley's handling of his contract situation. Dooley chose not to
extend Durham's deal after the 1993 and 1994 seasons, and Durham
claimed that it put him at a disadvantage in recruiting. Durham was
fired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa is in the second year of a five-year contract, so he will
have three years remaining after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to go into (recruiting) with one year
left,'' Dooley said. ``We've got a commitment to him. He's got
(three) years left and I think that's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa said he appreciated Dooley's vote of confidence and is
unconcerned about his contract status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the opportunity Coach Dooley gave us here,''
Jirsa said. ``He gives all our sports an opportunity to succeed.
The basketball program needs to take advantage of that and make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who returned four seniors and SEC
player-of-the-year candidate Jumaine Jones from last year's NIT
semi-finalists, have fallen short of expectations. They enter
Saturday's home game against LSU with a 14-11 overall record _ 5-8
in the SEC _ and they're 0-6 against ranked teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Jirsa has been the object of increased criticism by
newspaper columnists, on radio talk shows and in Internet
chatrooms. On his syndicated radio call-in show Thursday night,
Dooley found himself defending Jirsa for much of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Georgia Tech had fired Bobby Dodd after two years, that
program would have never done what it did,'' he told one
particularly irate caller. ``And coach Dodd's career got off to a
rugged start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa said he is aware of all the criticism but insists that he
uses it as motivation rather than let it get him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human,'' he said. ``It hurts sometimes. But I know which
direction this program's going in. I've been an athlete and a
coach, and I believe in myself and the people in our program, from
our coaches and staff to our players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' low point of the year came Wednesday when they
were blown out by Kentucky, a team it extended to overtime before
losing in Athens on Jan. 26. Although Jones, the SEC's leading
scorer and Georgia's leading rebounder, was injured and played only
16 minutes in the game, his absence was not enough to justify
Kentucky's 25-3 rebounding advantage in the first half and 49-24
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding is considered a hustle statistic and accusations
quickly arose that the Georgia players have quit on Jirsa. Dooley
discounted such a notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think Jumaine got hurt,'' Dooley said. ``Kentucky will
blow out a lot of teams in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ray Harrison, a three-year starter who was benched three
games ago in favor of hot-shooting freshman D.A. Layne, said the
players remain committed and have no problems with Jirsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Jirsa has been there for us, and we're going to be there
for him,'' Harrison said. ``He takes a lot of criticism that should
probably be directed at us players. Coach Jirsa's a great person
and a great coach. We haven't quit believing in him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia is to achieve its stated goal of reaching the NCAA
Tournament this season, it needs to win its last three
regular-season games and two or three more in the SEC Tournament.
And that still might not be enough to land an at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the final outcome is, Dooley said it won't
influence his decision. But his comments make it clear that next
season will be an important year for Jirsa. Considering that the
Bulldogs lose four seniors to graduation and possibly Jones to the
NBA draft, that might not be good news.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Jirsa's still thinking about this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are disappointed in the season to this point,'' he
said. ``But the season's not over.

 &HT;    Trade talk heats up at combine
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Over the past few years, while the number of
prospects who participate in the on-field drills has dramatically
decreased, the annual NFL scouting combine has become as much about
rhetoric as running.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude tests and individual interviews with players have
replaced the 40-yard dash as priorities for most teams, who know
the top-rated performers will work out later in the spring. But
this year's combine, which began Friday, might produce even more
talk than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time free agency started before the combine
was held, so you'll have a lot of agents here trying to do
business,'' Tennessee general manager Floyd Reese said Friday.
``There might not be a lot of action as far as (completing) deals,
but there will be plenty of talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who probably can afford one high-profile signing
and perhaps the addition of a few role players, will be involved in
some of that discussion. Denver agent Peter Schaffer will meet
today with Falcons general manager Harold Richardson about several
of his clients, notably cornerback Ronnie Bradford, former Denver
safety Steve Atwater and former New York Giants wide receiver Chris
Calloway. Club officials have indicated interest in all three.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer huddled Friday with Bengals owner Mike Brown, who is
interested in Bradford. The six-year veteran, who started 24 games
in two years with the Falcons, will visit Kansas City next Tuesday.
Atwater, released earlier this week by the Broncos, already has
attracted strong interest from the Chiefs and New York Jets.
Calloway is a good fit for the Falcons because he won't command a
high price and the team could use another veteran wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   THE ZEIER WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens personnel director Ozzie Newsome all but
confirmed Friday that the team is shopping backup quarterback Eric
Zeier. Asked if he had discussed a deal with the Falcons, Newsome
said: ``No, not yet. But as soon as I see (Richardson), I plan to
get things going.'' One major hurdle is that the Ravens are seeking
a second-round pick for Zeier. The Falcons don't have a
second-rounder, having sent it to San Diego in the trade for wide
receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-END TACKLES
</P>
<P>
   Georgia offensive tackles Matt Stinchcomb and Chris Terry took
their physical exams Friday and will work out today in the RCA
Dome. Scouts seem split over which of the two will go higher in the
draft. The prevailing opinion is that Stinchcomb is the more
polished, while Terry is a better athlete and could become a better
player in the long-term. ``It's a pretty good year for tackles, but
both those guys are in the top group on everyone's list,'' said Bob
Palcic, Cleveland Browns offensive line coach. ``You probably can't
go wrong with either one, although the consensus seems to be that
Matt is more ready to play immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   BAILEY WON'T RUN
</P>
<P>
   Scouts will be disappointed that Georgia cornerback Champ
Bailey, who arrives today, won't run the 40-yard dash when
defensive backs work out Monday. Bailey suffered a hamstring injury
running track and probably needs about 10 days to fully recover.
He'll work out for scouts in Athens on March 17 and 24. ``From
everything that I've seen on film, he's the real deal,'' Minnesota
defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said. ``He's one of those `eraser'
cornerbacks. Put him on a receiver and the guy disappears.'' Bailey
is a consensus top 5 pick, and the only players most teams rate
ahead of him are Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch and Texas tailback
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ETC. ...
</P>
<P>
   Couch is not expected to throw when quarterbacks work out
Sunday. ... Georgia Tech punter Rodney Williams had a solid
workout. ... Angelo Wright, the agent for Falcons free agent
defensive end Antonio Edwards, met with Carolina officials here
Friday. ... Giants officials confirmed they've agreed to terms with
quarterback Kerry Collins.

 &HT;    Bid inquiry: Come clean? We are clean, Atlanta says
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stung by the Olympic bribery scandal in Salt Lake
City, U.S. Olympic officials are urging Atlanta to come clean on
any improprieties connected with its bid for the Centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta bid leaders have told the U.S. Olympic Committee their
process was free of abuses and that they have ``nothing to report''
about corruption.
</P>
<P>
   However, widely publicized reports of excessive gifts for the
International Olympic Committee and multiple visits to Atlanta by
IOC members and their families have prompted USOC officials to seek
more information about the Atlanta bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to make as accurate a report as possible,'' USOC
Executive Director Dick Schultz said Friday in a telephone
interview. ``The people we have looking into it will get to the
bottom of whatever is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The USOC delayed a formal response to an IOC inquiry into the
Atlanta bid last week, noting it was preoccupied with other
investigations into the Salt Lake City scandal. But at that time,
the USOC said Atlanta Olympic officials provided no information
about improper actions by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta bid committee, still
contended Friday that the bid effort was free of bribery and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Payne acknowledged that some gifts cost more than the $200
guideline set by the IOC, and that some members came to Atlanta
more than the one-visit limit. But he characterized the gifts and
extra trips as gestures of good will toward friends from Atlanta
officials, and not demands by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said we were not perfect. We used our judgment of what
was right and fair and we did that effectively,'' Payne said. ``We
did not bribe anyone. We were not extorted by IOC members. We did
not make cash payments. We did not give outrageous gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Atlantans were proud of their effort to find
personal and creative gifts, regardless of the cost, for individual
members.
</P>
<P>
   They gave the late IOC member from Cuba a live bulldog after he
expressed admiration for a ceramic bulldog in Payne's office.
</P>
<P>
   For the Romanian member interested in European history between
World Wars I and II, they found three books on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   To the horse lover from Germany, they gave a lithograph of
Citation.
</P>
<P>
   Several members received a golf club _ a driver _ following
outings at Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Before a formal dinner in Savannah, bid official Charlie Battle
purchased a sports coat for a guest accompanying the IOC member
from Swaziland who had brought no coat or tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what any of that was worth,'' said Battle, weary
on Friday after being besieged with inquiries following a
front-page Washington Post story on Atlanta's bid. ``We didn't do
anything wrong. We were not trying to abuse the process. We didn't
give any $10,000 guns. We gave what we felt like were appropriate
gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gift-giving was a preoccupation for the small bid team. Presents
were handed out every time a member came to town and were offered
en masse at every official gathering. Atlanta bid members packed
their suitcases for out-of-town meetings with logo-embossed ties,
scarves and watches.
</P>
<P>
   They tried home-style mementoes, such as glass sculptures and
hand-carved wooden bowls from a North Georgia artist. There were
slippers, embroidered pillow cases, alarm clocks and portable CD
players with an Atlanta Symphony Orchestra disc for every IOC
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not remotely akin to what we have been reading about,
such as giving cash inducements or scholarships for the purpose of
influencing votes,'' said Payne.
</P>
<P>
   A Salt Lake City ethics committee disclosed last week that its
bidders made improper cash payments and gifts _ including expensive
guns _ totaling more than $1.2 million to some 24 IOC members,
roughly one-fifth of the committee. Nine IOC members have resigned
or been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the IOC said it had received more than 20
responses from the 28 letters it sent in late January to national
Olympic committees and former bidding committees, seeking evidence
of further wrongdoing in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal.
The USOC, which is responding on behalf of Atlanta, requested an
extension until March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he expects USOC lawyers to re-interview Atllanta
bid officials so the committee can send its response to the IOC
early next week. ``I don't know what that response is yet,'' he
said, adding ``obviously it will have to'' detail any wrongdoing on
the part of the bid committee or IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC specifically asked bid committees to report whether its
members or their
</P>
<P>
   relatives accepted money, gifts, medical services scholarships,
employment or excessive hospitality. It wants to know if any IOC
members accepted multiple visits or brought more than one guest.
</P>
<P>
   Several Atlanta bid team leaders acknowledge that some IOC
members visited more than once, and five of them have been
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal: Jean-Claude Ganga from the
Republic of Congo, Phil Coles of Australia, Willi Kaltschmitt of
Guatemala, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some members brought several relatives with them, typically a
spouse and child. Visits are supposed to be limited to a member and
one guest.
</P>
<P>
   Payne does not view those visits as violations of the IOC's
bidding rules. The extra guests came at the invitation of Atlantans
and were not demanded by IOC members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not extorted. They were nice people. They were our
friends,'' Payne said. ``There was nothing wrong with it. It didn't
violate the integrity of the process. It was being responsive to
friendships that were developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bidders treated their friends like royalty here.
They flew first-class, stayed in luxury hotels and were provided a
car, driver and hostess. They were feted in private homes. The
wives went shopping at Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square while the
husbands took tours of venues.
</P>
<P>
   They attended Braves baseball and University of Georgia football
games. They took in concerts at Chastain and the Fox Theatre. One
member was treated to the Georgia-Florida football game in
Jacksonville after a visit to Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Every visiting member was offered a one-day trip to Disney
World, though only a few took advantage of the opportunity, Payne
said. Disney World was one of Atlanta's selling points during the
bid. All 10,000 athletes were promised a Disney visit during the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to do two shuttles every day from the Olympic
Village. We sold that big-time,'' Payne recalled. ``We ended up not
doing it because we ran out of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the athletes may not have boarded planes for a special
trip, IOC members hopped on corporate jets _ donated by the likes
of Cox Enterprises and Coca-Cola _ to Augusta, where Payne proposed
staging Olympic golf, and Savannah, where yachting would take
place.
</P>
<P>
   While there, they were toasted in high style. In Augusta, they
played at the exclusive course where the famed Masters tournament
is held, typically as guests of a club member such as Atlantan
Charlie Yates.
</P>
<P>
   From Savannah, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes
captained a half-dozen IOC members on a cruise aboard his father
Malcolm's fabulously appointed yacht. Fireworks and champagne
enhanced the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and other Atlanta bid team members are incensed that
anyone would suggest such visits and entertainment were out of
line.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to cooperate with any further inquiries by the USOC
but does not believe he has anything more to report.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Atlanta's rivals for the 1996 Olympics have submitted
reports, which contain little new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written the IOC a three-page letter that says,
essentially, nothing to report,'' said Bob Scott, the head of
Manchester's unsuccessful bids for the 1996 and 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Henderson, who headed the Toronto bid, said the report from
his committee contains essentially the same information it
submitted eight years ago during a review of the bidding campaign
for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they would be reluctant to identify violators because
they fear the legal repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm a private citizen,'' Henderson said. ``What's to
stop some IOC member from filing a libel lawsuit against me if I
make some accusation against them that I can't actually document?''

DEFYING THE USUAL WISDOM,   INFLATION HOLDS NEAR ZERO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although a strong economy and rising wages should be pushing up
the inflation rate, the Consumer Price Index inched up only
one-tenth of 1 percent in January, the Labor Department reported
Friday _ continuing a pattern of surprisingly mild inflation that
has lasted for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices for petroleum and imported goods are playing a
big role in holding down the CPI, the best-known measure of what
Americans pay for food, fuel, merchandise and services. The index
rose by just 1.7 percent for the 12 months through January.
</P>
<P>
   But even if import and energy prices had not fallen as a result
of the Asian crisis, consumer inflation would have been mild,
rising by only 3 percent this last year, according to Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI, an economic forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is well within what Americans have come to accept as a
comfortable inflation rate,'' said David Wyss, the chief economist
at DRI.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to a lower inflation rate in the late 1990s has
changed the Federal Reserve. The Fed had viewed strong economic
growth, low unemployment and rising wages as signals that the CPI
would soon rise as businesses jacked up prices in response to the
strong demand and rising labor costs. So even before there was
actual evidence of higher inflation, the Fed raised interest rates
to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   That was the strategy in place in March 1997, the last time the
Fed increased rates. The nation had just begun to experience the
economic boom that has continued to this day. But the inflation
rate never rose, and it confounded so many forecasts of imminent
increases that the Fed's policy makers were persuaded to switch
tactics. Rather than anticipate a rising inflation rate, the policy
makers now prefer to wait for concrete evidence before acting. The
Asian crisis has also inhibited them. A rate increase could deepen
it.
</P>
<P>
   This new caution is likely to be reflected in the testimony of
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, when he appears before the
Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday to report on the state of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinct lack of upward pressure on prices,'' said
Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPI division of the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI has risen at an
annual rate of 2 percent for two years and at less than 3 percent
for most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But how has American business managed to hold down prices and
sustain profits despite rising costs? Economists offer several
explanations. Productivity has improved in the last two years.
Employees are producing more goods and services for each hour of
work, in part because they are using more efficient machinery and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the premiums that companies pay for workers'
compensation and unemployment insurance are sharply lower in many
states. With interest rates relatively low, the cost of corporate
debt has declined. And employers now raise pay for highly skilled
workers in short supply without raising wage scales for all their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of temporary workers helps in this process. So
does the growing use of one-time bonuses in lieu of raises. The
spreading use of corporate subsidies from state and local
governments, often in the form of tax credits and tax abatements,
has made possible significant new savings for many companies,
according to a study by two University of Iowa professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows how extensive these savings are,'' said Alan
Peters, an urban planner at the university. ``The intricacies of
the deals are often not part of the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the various savings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
reports that its index of nonlabor costs for each unit of
production rose ever more slowly in the mid-1990s and fell by 1.4
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The mild one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the CPI in January,
which matched December's increase, resulted mostly from a jump in
the prices of fruit, dairy products, vegetables and tobacco. A
citrus-damaging California freeze caused the increase in food
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But while food and beverage prices jumped four-tenths of a
percent, energy prices fell. So did housing, apparel and
transportation prices. The housing drop was the first since
February 1986, and the 1.1 percent slide in apparel prices was the
sharpest in a decade. Medical care, education and business services
all rose, but modestly in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Without food and energy, the CPI also rose one-tenth of 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Labor Department allowed for
substitutions in calculating the CPI. Instead of counting, say, a
10 percent rise in the price of cotton shirts as a price increase,
officials now take into account consumer shifts to cheaper shirts.
</P>
<P>
   If enough buy cheaper products, the price increase would be
diluted. This substitution brought no change in January. Over 12
months, however, the CPI is likely to be lower by two-tenths of a
percentage point because of the substitution.

 &HT;    Galarraga cancer has spread slightly
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doctors have determined that Braves first baseman
Andres Galarraga has stage II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which the
cancer has spread locally but still has a favorable prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Henderson, Galarraga's oncologist, said Friday that
the cancer has affected the third lumbar vertebra of the spine and
part of the fourth lumbar vertebra, which are located in the lower
back, as well as two small adjacent lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson reiterated his optimism that Galarraga's treatment,
which will begin next week after he returns to his home in West
Palm Beach, Fla., will be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has an excellent chance of being cured, not just
recovering, but of being cured,'' Henderson said. ``He's one of the
most healthy-looking people I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has four stages, with stage I being the
earliest. In stage II, cancer is found in more than one lymph node
area on one side of the diaphragm, the breathing muscle that
roughly divides the top and bottom halves of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphoma of the spine often carries the risk of damaging the
spinal cord. Galarraga's cancer was diagnosed after he complained
of recurrent back pain, but it does not threaten the spinal cord,
Henderson said. ``This is nowhere near that point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga will undergo five months of chemotherapy to kill the
cancerous cells, followed by one month of radiation. Doctors said
that as of now they do not anticipate extending treatment.

NEW YORK WORKFARE RULES TO BE APPLIED TO THOSE SEEKING SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   NINA BERNSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Backed by state regulations, the Giuliani
administration is preparing to make workfare and other requirements
a condition of shelter for the 4,600 families and 7,000 single
adults in New York City's homeless shelter system, said city
officials with knowledge of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   The change would also make the city's homeless shelters use the
same system of rules, work requirements and sanctions that its
welfare offices have used to move more than 400,000 people off
public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, shelter has been considered a form of aid separate
from cash relief, and for two decades the legal right to be
sheltered somewhere by the city has been almost unconditional for
the truly homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But under the state regulations, which were passed in 1995 but
not used in the city because of legal challenges, shelter is simply
another part of public assistance, and to keep a bed, shelter
residents must meet welfare eligibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city says the rules will push people to become
self-reliant, advocates for the homeless contend that the changes
threaten to send hundreds of homeless children and adults onto the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   No other city in the nation offers shelter as a right, or has as
comprehensive a publicly funded shelter system as New York's.
Elsewhere in the state, where the regulations have taken effect,
some shelters have been forced to close because the regulations
made their shelter budgets plummet with the welfare rolls, pushing
many people onto the street.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has not set a firm date to start following the
state rules, but three of four court decisions on the matter have
gone against advocates for the homeless, and the city has been
quietly making preparations for systemwide change.
</P>
<P>
   The rules require nonprofit agencies operating shelters under
contract to the city to expel any homeless adult or family cut from
public assistance, and if children are in jeopardy, to make a
referral to child protective services for possible foster care
placement.
</P>
<P>
   Though about half the single adults and most of the families in
the city's homeless shelters are already on public assistance, all
would be newly vulnerable to expulsion under the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Under workfare, those who get aid are required to work at city
jobs, including cleaning parks and performing clerical tasks, in
exchange for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the city began requiring all men who apply for
emergency shelter at the central intake center on East 30th Street
in Manhattan to undergo ``finger-imaging'' by the state computer
system used in welfare offices for identification, said Jack
Madden, a spokesman for the state Office of Temporary and
Disability Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the city's welfare agency has been inspecting all
shelters under contract to the city, including programs for the
mentally ill, and asking how many residents are capable of work and
which programs could be equivalent to a 35-hour work week, said
providers whose shelters were inspected recently.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to create a job center especially for the homeless, where
shelter residents could be required to report in order to keep
their beds, has been under discussion for months, said Debra
Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's welfare agency, the Human
Resources Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the location under discussion is a vacant welfare
center at East 131st Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive to be
renamed ``Riverview,'' but she declined to provide other details.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires only half the welfare caseload to be
employed at any one time. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has vowed to
have every recipient of aid doing 20 hours of work, plus 15 hours
of work-related activities like education or drug treatment, by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under current welfare rules, single adults who miss a single
hour of work can see their entire case closed. Last year, 69
percent of these home relief clients in the work program were
removed from the rolls, for several months at least, city records
show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week, the state Court of Appeals dismissed a motion by
advocates seeking permission for a further appeal of the rules as
applied to homeless families. A court hearing is to be held on
March 11 on whether applying the regulations to homeless adults
violates a 1981 court decree in which the city guaranteed a
mattress, clean sheets and soap to every homeless man, a legal
right to shelter later expanded to women and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe these regulations will help families move toward
independent living,'' Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's
Department of Homeless Services, said Friday. ``We're working out
how to implement the regulations best.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, a variety of mechanisms have made entry into
the shelter system harder and discharge easier, but making shelter
depend on eligibility for welfare would dwarf past changes,
providers said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the preparations this week, Jason Turner, the city's
welfare commissioner, would say through a spokeswoman only that
there had not been a shift in homeless policy. But at conferences
and in meetings with shelter providers, Turner has expressed
concern that some who were cut from welfare have been able to go to
shelters and food pantries without restriction, sidestepping
sanctions intended to push them to self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wiviott said the city has agreed to give Steven Banks,
director of the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Rights Project, a
five-day warning before applying the state regulations to homeless
families.
</P>
<P>
   Banks has vowed to mount a new legal challenge on the basis of a
1985 court ruling that children cannot be placed in foster care for
lack of housing.

TEXAS IN THE RUNNING TO LAND WINNING SITE FOR A NEW SPACE PORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: VentureStar is cq) 
(Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A state-backed effort being formulated will pit Texas
against heavily favored Florida and 14 other states for a
potentially lucrative prize: a commercial space port for the coming
generation of unmanned reusable rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, Lockheed Martin Corp. plans to select
a site in one of the states to serve as a launching and landing
site for VentureStar, a radically new spacecraft. Lockheed Martin
plans to develop VentureStar operations by 2005, marketing the new
rocket globally as a low-cost launcher for a burgeoning number of
new communications satellites. It also would be a low-cost
alternative to NASA's space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   State officials estimate a Lockheed Martin space port in Texas
could mean as many as 15,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we compete with those states?'' pondered Tom Moser, the
former space agency executive recruited to serve as executive
director of the Texas Aerospace Commission. ``It will be tough, but
the answer is yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is spearheading the state's bid to lure Lockheed
Martin as well as at least two smaller companies to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry among states is straight out of Jules Verne's
19th-century, fiction classic, ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   In that book, Verne writes of a politically charged rivalry
between Texans and Floridians over which state will serve as the
launching site for a mythical manned moon rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Floridians prevail, just as their real life
counterparts did a century later. Today, Florida's Cape Canaveral
hosts sprawling federally-financed launch complexes for NASA's
shuttle and the expendable rockets that hurtle easterly into
equatorial orbits with commercial, scientific and military
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Less frequently, California's Vandenberg Air Force Base
dispatches similar payloads launched by rockets on a southerly
course into polar orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Three sites in Texas under Lockheed Martin's consideration would
support launches on either equatorial or polar trajectories,
according to Moser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the financial stakes soaring, competition for the new space
ports is fierce.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Telecommunications Union, global
communications has approached a $1 trillion a year industry, with
satellites playing a growing role in the expansion. The state
commission's own research estimates 1,700 satellite launches, many
of them to meet communications needs, over the coming decade. Last
year, U.S. companies conducted 42 percent of all rocket launches,
the most of any nation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, and with little public fanfare, Moser has
marshalled a coalition of local economic development agencies from
across Texas to pursue VentureStar operations. With consultants
from the Aerospace Corp., a California-based Air Force think tank,
the commission assessed 14 potential sites in Texas, whittling the
total to three with the best qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   They include stretches of coastal plain south and west of
Freeport in Brazoria County near Houston and south and east of
Kingsville in Kenedy County in South Texas. The third site sprawls
across rural West Texas scrub land in Pecos County east of Fort
Stockton and just south of Interstate 10. Launch operations from
any of the three sites would pose no more than a one in 30 million
risk of casualty, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state legislature is awaiting the introduction of
a bill this session that if enacted would create the incentives
Moser said Texas will need to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets down to dollars,'' he said. ``We can compete if we put
together the right public-private partnership. Texas has to be
willing to be a partner, but we want Texas to be a small partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospective sponsors of the legislation would not discuss
provisions this week. But they will likely provide for the creation
of a local space port authority, tax abatements and potential
funding mechanisms to provide roadways, utilities and other
facilities intended to serve as inducements.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency envisions VentureStar as a potential
replacement for the shuttle, cutting its cost of carrying cargos to
and from the U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's concept is a lightweight, wedge-shaped
spacecraft that, unlike the manned space shuttle, would lift off
vertically and soar to orbit without dropping off auxiliary
propulsion stages. After its mission, the VentureStar would glide
to an automated landing at its launch site along a 12,000 foot
runway.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the new rocket would be rugged enough to be
refurbished and launched again within days, a strategy it forecasts
could cut the cost of delivering cargo to orbit from the current
$10,000 a pound to $1,000 a pound. If successful, the strategy
could help to open new space markets, including tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of site selection, right now that looks like sometime
in the year 2000,'' said Ron Lindeke, a Lockheed spokesman at the
company's Skunk Works division in Palmdale, Calif. ``We were
looking at early November. Now we are probably looking at late 2000
for the selection.''
</P>
<P>
   To hedge its competitive efforts, the Texas Aerospace Commission
is also pursuing space port opportunities with Washington-based
Kistler Aerospace Corp. and California-based Space Access.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ Outside in the balmy tropical
air, residents with deep tans and hefty girths like to relax
beneath the palm trees that shade the long white beaches on this
tiny Pacific island.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a garment factory, rows of workers from China perform
robotic motions under dull fluorescent lights all day long, sewing,
ironing and packing. In fast-paced, mind-numbing sequence, they
yield box after box of shirts and skirts, all to be sold by
American retailers like the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and Sears, Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese workers have propelled the remarkable success of the
garment industry here, pushing sales to nearly $1 billion in 1998.
But the industry was hit with a legal bombshell in January when
lawyers filed a class-action suit here and in California, accusing
garment makers and major U.S. retailers of systematically
underpaying and mistreating workers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that in dozens of factories in Saipan, the capital
of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth where most
federal laws apply, workers are forced to work inhuman hours and to
live in overcrowded and vermin-infested conditions. It even
suggests that the workers are enduring a form of slavery, trapped
in Saipan with impossible debts and with little freedom to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with dozens of Chinese workers here tell a story
that is not so stark. Chatting easily as they stroll freely in the
warm evening air after work, they describe orderly factories and
clean dormitories, a view borne out in visits. They say they come
to Saipan voluntarily to earn about five times what they made in
China, typically heading home after two years with $6,000 to
$10,000 saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to make money, not to travel,'' said Li Jingshan,
23, who recently arrived and chafes at having to rest two days each
weekend. ``I want overtime. I want to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Saipan is a curious halfway point between the United States and
China, most clearly reflected in the disparity between the
ambitions of Chinese workers and the objections of American
lawyers. Where lawyers and some federal officials see a flagrant
violation of law, many Chinese see an opportunity to make money.
Where lawyers and federal officials see a careless indifference to
policing the garment industry, local officials say they lack the
manpower or ability.
</P>
<P>
   Work conditions and pay scales are clearly better than in China,
but they fall short of U.S. standards. The contracts that workers
sign before they leave China include promises _ not to strike, not
to discuss problems with outsiders, not to become pregnant _ that
are acceptable to Chinese workers, even though they shock American
investigators. Such contracts are illegal in the United States but
are signed in China. Their status here is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a culture that stresses obedience and respect for
authority, where there is little freedom to speak openly in the
workplace, many Chinese workers here seem perplexed that a lawsuit
has been filed on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they be doing it for us?'' Wen Xiaoli, 29, said as
she shopped for apples and bananas at an outdoor market one
evening. ``They must be doing it for their own reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the Saipan suit, which seeks more than $1
billion in damages, say their intention is to compensate victims
cheated by abusive employers. The lawyers themselves, led by the
firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &AMP; Lerach, which recently
helped win a major settlement for Holocaust victims from Swiss
banks, could earn substantial fees for handling a successful suit.
</P>
<P>
   For garment manufacturers, the beauty of Saipan is that it is
exempt from quota or duty restrictions that apply to garments made
elsewhere in Asia and shipped to the United States. Just a few
hours' flight from China, an endless pool of cheap labor, Saipan
also enjoys special exemptions from U.S. immigration and labor
laws, allowing manufacturers to bring in thousands of Chinese
garment workers and pay them Saipan's minimum wage of $3.05 an
hour, well below the prevailing $5.15 an hour in America.
</P>
<P>
   Like other garment workers here, Ms. Li works 40 to 60 hours a
week, depending on demand, and after her first 40 hours at $3.05 an
hour she is paid $4.50 an hour for overtime. She says she is saving
about $400 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Saipan's garment industry has vaulted from sales of $5.4 million
in 1985 to $124 million in 1988 to nearly $1 billion in 1998. There
are 15,000 Chinese workers now employed in 36 garment factories
here, making clothes that carried the label ``Made in the USA.''
until federal government objections forced a switch to the tag
``Made in the Northern Mariana Islands, USA.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has prospered from Saipan's garment business more than
Willie Tan, an ethnic Chinese businessman who runs three factories
here that sold $100 million of garments last year. His family-owned
Tan Holdings, with interests in shipping, real estate and
publishing, took in $240 million worldwide in 1998, and he denies
all charges in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Saipan, and we will stay here as long as we can
survive,'' Tan said in a telephone interview from Cambodia, where
he is planning another factory because the labor is even cheaper
there. ``We love our employees. We never run from our
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overstating it. Like their counterparts around the
world, many garment factories in Saipan, including Tan's, rely on
unskilled laborers who have been exploited in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 court decision in California fined Tan Holdings $9
million for systematically underpaying workers, the largest award
ever made in a suit brought by the Labor Department. The court
ordered Tan Holdings to install a salary-monitoring system overseen
by the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   The factory floor at TransAsia, one of three Tan Holdings
factories that sells garments to Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and
Liz Claiborne, among others, is more spacious and orderly than many
garment factories in New York City that are also staffed by recent
Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As different as Chinese and U.S. expectations are, it is hard to
argue with assertions by federal officials that on U.S. soil,
federal laws should rule. Yet with little local or federal
enforcement, even U.S. laws are useless.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials, when asked about labor abuses, typically offer
a mixture of denial, apology and insistence that things have
improved. But their comments betray a flimsy grasp of the situation
in the industry they are meant to oversee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, there hasn't been much enforcement of federal
laws,'' said Mark D. Zacheres, secretary of labor and immigration,
adding that he lacks the staff and know-how to police the industry
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Though Zacheres and other officials say they would like to pass
responsibility to the federal government, they strongly oppose
broader efforts by Washington to expand control over Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Labor and Interior Departments in Washington
now argue that Saipan's special exemptions from minimum-wage and
immigration laws have become inappropriate. What irritates many
federal officials is that local authorities pleaded for the
exemptions by arguing that a small island of 10,000 residents had
to be protected with especially tough immigration and labor laws
from potential waves of Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But then those very immigration and labor laws were manipulated
to make entry procedures looser rather than tougher, and planeloads
of Asian workers started arriving. By 1998, there were 68,000
people on Saipan, and 40,000 were foreign contract workers, mostly
Chinese garment workers and Filipinos working in hotels that cater
to Japanese tourists.

 SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands: Japanese tourists.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, federal officials express outrage over Saipan's use of
its exemptions to make money, duty free, while taking advantage of
workers by abusing what the officials see as basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the U.S. suffer a continuing financial loss of $200
million a year in tariffs, a fifth of a billion dollars, for the
dubious privilege of explaining to the rest of the world why it
tolerates the CNMI human rights record?'' said Allen Stayman, a
senior official in the Interior Department, who oversees the
Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Worried by the Interior Department's efforts to revoke Saipan's
exemptions from federal law, Saipan's government organized an
extensive lobbying campaign. Dozens of congressmen have been flown
out for golf-and-swimming visits to Saipan, where they are told
that bureaucrats in Washington want to interfere with the island's
fragile economy. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, has
visited Saipan repeatedly and defends its special status.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who was born in the Philippines and is now an American
citizen, argues that since duty-free status is the main reason
garment makers come to Saipan, revoking it would simply force them
to go elsewhere. Standard labor costs in Cambodia are just $50 a
month per worker, Tan pointed out, compared with $110 in China and
$488 in Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   But because they are outside their homeland, Chinese workers are
still vulnerable to abuses. Factory-floor managers wield enormous
power over employees, deciding who gets overtime and sometimes
asking workers for ``loans'' and other favors in exchange for
better hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers from China are never told exactly what deductions
are made from their paychecks, typically $100 a month for housing
in an eight-person-a-room dormitory and another $100 a month for
meals in a cafeteria. In some factories, workers can live outside
the barracks, as the dormitories are called, but are still docked
for room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Factories are also legally required to pay time-and-a-half for
overtime after 40 hours per week. But some workers say that when
they fall short of quotas set by a floor manager, they are forced
to work extra hours ``off the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   As serious as these abuses are, lawyers in the class-action suit
seem to exaggerate conditions here, citing a few worst-case
examples as typical.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Chinese workers are generally required to pay a
``recruiting fee'' of $1,000 to $3,000 to work here, which is
typically borrowed privately in China and then repaid with the
first few months' salary. A smaller number of Chinese women who
come through unofficial channels often pay as much as $7,000 to
$10,000 and end up working as prostitutes in one of the dozens of
bars and massage parlors that dot the island. Yet lawyers describe
a $7,000 fee as the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the Saipan suit say that 23 anonymous workers
are willing to testify about abusive conditions and systematic
underpaying. Two workers, both women, agreed to an interview in a
lawyer's office here, on condition that their names not be made
public because they fear recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The women told compelling tales of unfair working conditions,
but the accusations were not as serious as the allegations in the
suit. Nor did these women seem representative of the larger Chinese
population here. They appeared to be spirited individuals unsuited
to monotonous factory work.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Courts here and
in Los Angeles, seeks damages from 22 garment makers in Saipan for
systematically mistreating and underpaying 50,000 Chinese workers
over a period of 10 years. A third related suit was also filed in
state court in San Francisco by the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, known as UNITE, and human rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel legal tactic, the lawyers also invoked racketeering
charges against 18 leading U.S. retailers _ including the Gap,
Tommy Hilfiger and Sears _ arguing that garment makers and buyers
actively conspired to deprive garment workers of proper pay and
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several defendants have denied the charges and
affirmed their commitment to strict fair-labor policies.
</P>
<P>
   As economists point to the growing irrelevance of national
boundaries in global trade and as consumers everywhere increasingly
value quality and price over country of origin, Saipan may
eventually lose its cachet as an ideal place to make garments. The
American quota system, a protectionist relic of earlier days, is
already scheduled to be phased out.

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration promised relief on
Friday to millions of workers with aching backs, crippled fingers,
sore wrists and other physical problems caused or aggravated by
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department took the first formal step to require
employers to redesign jobs and alter work stations to accommodate
workers suffering injuries to the neck, back, arms and hands and to
help prevent such injuries. It issued a draft of proposed rules and
said that a final regulation, with the force of law, would be
issued late next year after an extended period of public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is intended to alleviate one of the biggest
problems in American factories and offices: an epidemic of
occupational injuries known as musculoskeletal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions include carpal tunnel syndrome, low back pain,
muscle strains, sciatica and tendinitis. They account for one-third
of all serious workplace injuries and cause more than 640,000
workers a year to miss time on the job, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention related to such disorders has
focused on computer users, the rules proposed Friday would cover
many other workers, from meatpackers to physical therapists.
Administration officials, labor unions and occupational health
experts said the standards were overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders has been slow in
coming,'' said Charles Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor
in charge of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
``For many years, it was just considered a cost of doing business.
If you did certain jobs, you would end up with hands crippled at
the end of your career. That's not acceptable in this country
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But employers and some Republican members of Congress have
strenuously opposed such regulation, and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce urged the occupational safety agency to wait for the
National Academy of Sciences to finish a study on whether there is
a scientific basis for national ergonomic standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hopelessly vague draft is a blank check for OSHA
inspectors,'' Peter J. Eide, a lawyer at the Chamber of Commerce,
said of the government proposal. ``It would require all American
businesses to become full-time experts in ergonomics, a field for
which there is little if any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been much debate about the scientific
evidence surrounding workplace injuries, and lawyers have had a
hard time proving in court that some specific kinds of disorders
resulted from defects in the design of computer keyboards. But a
committee of the National Academy of Sciences said in a preliminary
report last year that some musculoskeletal disorders were caused by
work activities and that ergonomics programs could reduce injuries
and the level of pain and disability resulting from them.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions written into congressional appropriations for the
fiscal years 1996-98 barred the safety agency from final adoption
of any such rules. But the restrictions are absent from current
law, and the administration is hopeful that Congress will be
prepared to accept some degree of regulation. Like most federal
rules, these would also require clearance from the White House
Office of Management and Budget, but that is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not yet done a detailed estimate of the costs
to employers, as it must before issuing the final rules. But
Jeffress said he believed the compliance costs would be less than
the costs employers now incur because of workdays lost to injury
and illness. The Labor Department said musculoskeletal disorders
cost employers $15 billion to $20 billion a year in workers'
compensation costs and tens of billions more in lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would affect at least 25 million workers in
production jobs and ``manual handling operations'' that involve
pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting or lowering objects or people.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would, for example, apply to assembly-line
workers, machine operators, bakers, meatpackers, office cleaning
crews and warehousemen, as well as nurses and physical therapists,
grocery checkout clerks and people who make deliveries for the
Postal Service, United Parcel Service and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the standards would apply to hundreds of thousands
of employers in other industries if they had even one employee with
a musculoskeletal disorder. Thus, the standards would protect
millions of people who work at computer terminals, entering
financial data for banks and insurance companies, writing and
editing articles for newspapers and magazines, and taking telephone
orders for all sorts of services and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The standards would not apply to the construction work,
agriculture or the maritime industry, where, the government says,
it has less expertise in assessing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Employers covered by the rule would be required to adopt
``ergonomic programs'' to identify hazards and respond to worker
complaints. They would, for example, have to provide employees with
prompt access to health-care professionals who could treat
work-related medical problems, at no cost to the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors could recommend work restrictions or reassignments for
employees, and the employer would normally have to follow these
recommendations. An employer would also have to ``maintain the
employee's total normal earnings, seniority, rights and benefits
when work restrictions are prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule tests the government's ability to keep up with
a fast-changing economy in which technology is continually altering
the nature of work and the tasks performed. Federal officials said
they wanted to be sure to protect ``intensive computer users,'' for
example, but had found no easy way to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Orr, an ergonomic engineer at the Labor Department, said:
``It's clear that computer users are developing musculoskeletal
disorders, but the risk appears to depend on many factors: How many
key strokes do workers perform? How often do they click the mouse?
How much rest do they have? How much control do they have over the
pace of work? Are the computer keyboard and monitor in a good
position?''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule, like most OSHA standards, would apply to
employers of all sizes. Sarah Shortall, a Labor Department lawyer,
said, ``OSHA has never totally exempted small employers from any
safety or health standard, but companies with fewer than 10
employees are sometimes exempted from record-keeping
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency may impose a civil penalty up to $70,000 for a
willful violation of its standards. If the same type of violation
occurs at three different work sites operated by the same company,
the penalty could be $210,000. But the penalties are usually lower
than that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thomas Sullivan, a lawyer at the National Federation of
Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses,
said: ``We believe this rule-making initiative is premature. The
government should wait for the results of a comprehensive study
being done by the National Academy of Sciences. The cost per worker
will be at least 50 percent higher for small businesses than for
big business. Small businesses don't have industrial hygienists on
staff to deal with rules like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said several employers had already
demonstrated the value of ergonomic programs. For example, it said,
Fieldcrest Cannon sharply reduced injuries at its textile factories
by lessening the need for workers to bend and reach. Perdue Farms
reduced injuries at its poultry plants by improving work
conditions. And a California newspaper, The Fresno Bee, had a
decline in medical and disability costs after it redesigned work
stations and encouraged employees take rest breaks at regular
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The ergonomic program recommended by the Labor Department has
six steps. A company would have to establish clear procedures for
employees to report musculoskeletal problems. It would also have to
inform employees of any hazards; pinpoint the causes and take steps
to control them; train employees; provide medical care, and
evaluate the effectiveness of its program, by analyzing injury
rates or other data.

HARRY HOLIDAY JR., FORMER CHIEF OF ARMCO, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., Ariz., Wash., Ohio, Pa.)   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Holiday Jr., a former chief executive of the steelmaker
Armco Inc. and a world champion swimmer, died on Tuesday in Boynton
Beach, Fla. He was 75 and lived in Village of Golf, Fla., and
Highlands, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, Terry B. Adamson, his son-in-law,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday, who was known for his optimistic determination, helped
lead the steel industry through the boom of the 1960s and the
troubled times that followed in the 1970s and 80s. He frequently
called on the federal government to insure that steel imports were
legal, and, facing an economic downturn in the 1970s, pushed Armco
to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry was a first-class manager,'' said Nicholas F. Brady, a
former Treasury secretary. ``He ran Armco at an extraordinary time
when the company needed to diversify. Most of the people in the
company believed that steel was their business. But Harry had the
vision to know that some changes had to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The future for Holiday, who was born in Butler, Pa., seemed
almost predestined. His father was the plant manager at Armco's
Ford Steel Wheel Co. in Butler.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the University of Michigan and served as an
officer in the Army ordnance corps.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday joined Armco as an assistant metallurgist in the
company's Middletown, Ohio, plant. In the next 36 years, he worked
his way through the executive ranks, becoming president of Armco in
1974 and chief executive five years later. Holiday retired from the
company in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Holiday's business accomplishments, he was one of
the world's best swimmers in the backstroke. During the 1940s, he
set 7 world records, 18 American records and won 6 National
Collegiate Athletic Association swimming championships.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1944 national amateur championships at the New York
Athletic Club, Holiday, who was 6 foot 5, became the first swimmer
to beat Adolf Kiefer, generally regarded as the best in the
backstroke up to that time. Holiday was named to the 1944 Olympic
team, but the games were canceled because of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The war may have robbed Holiday of an Olympic gold medal and a
place as an American legend. Johnny Weismuller, who won five
Olympic gold medals in the 1920s, and Buster Crabbe, an Olympic
champion in 1932, became household names after their victories.
Holiday was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Kay Watson Holiday; a
brother, Matt, of Tucson, Ariz.; a daughter, Edith E., of
Washington; two sons, Harry III, of King of Prussia, Pa., and
Albert, of Middletown, Ohio, and five grandchildren. &QL;

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. trade deficit soared 53 percent last year,
to a record high of $168.8 billion, the Commerce Department
reported on Friday, as the global financial crisis helped to
produce the first decline in U.S. exports in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Political sensitivities to the fast-rising trade deficit are
increasing _ particularly in hard-hit industries like steel _ even
while consumers benefit from an influx of low-cost gasoline,
computer chips and electronic goods. This year the trade imbalance
is expected to widen even further, especially if Japan remains
mired in its deepest recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase in the deficit, U.S. officials said, came
from remarkably strong consumer spending for foreign-made goods.
But the deficit for December narrowed unexpectedly, to $13.8
billion, a 10 percent decline from November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the biggest increases in the trade deficit
originated from the hardest-hit nations of Asia. The deficit with
Japan rose to $64 billion, up from $56 billion in 1997, bringing it
back to the levels that touched off some of the fiercest trade
tensions with Japan a decade ago. Those have been alleviated
recently by the continuing strength of the U.S. economy, which has
muted the 1980s accusations that Japanese imports were taking
American jobs. The trade deficit with China rose to $56.9 billion,
the highest with any nation other than Japan, a 15 percent increase
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the best face on a deteriorating trade balance, a
senior Commerce Department official said on Friday that there were
signs of a ``spotty recovery'' of U.S. exports to Asia,
particularly to South Korea and Singapore. But both are relatively
small markets, and overall in 1998 the trade deficit with all
Pacific Rim nations totaled $160.3 billion, up from $121.7 billion
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest political challenge for the Clinton
administration arises from the falloff in U.S. exports. For six
years, the administration has cited its drive to increase exports
as a key element of U.S. financial health, boasting that exports
had created vast numbers of high-skill, high-wage jobs. The
financial crisis that has spread from Asia to Latin America and
Russia has robbed the administration of that claim, and the issue
could easily turn on him if the U.S. economy slows and joblessness
begins to rise.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAFS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   ``The deficit tends to reflect the falloff in U.S. exports
rather than any surge of imports,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S.
trade representative, said on Friday. ``And that is explained
entirely by recessionary conditions in 40 percent of the world
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Already administration officials are taking every opportunity to
mention the benefits of low-priced imports, noting that they have
helped contain inflation. And there is no question that the world
financial crisis, and the glut of commodities, including oil and
farm products, has enabled U.S. consumers to save billions of
dollars. U.S. industry has also benefited, because the financial
crisis has lowered the cost of industrial materials _ from steel to
machine tools to computers _ even while it has damped companies'
ability to export.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst may yet be ahead. Ian Sheperdson, the chief U.S.
economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in
Valhalla, N.Y., noted on Friday that `'exports of aircraft have
already fallen sharply this year.'' This decline may continue with
China's recent announcement that it is suspending the delivery of
all new aircraft for two years, while it wrestles with an
unexpectedly severe slowdown. Sheperdson also noted that oil prices
are now stable, meaning that manufacturers and consumers will
probably not get the added economic boost of continued price
declines.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAFS)
</P>
<P>
   The $168.8 billion trade deficit reported on Friday is the
highest in U.S. history. The previous high for trade in goods and
services came in 1987, when the figure reached $153.3 billion. It
declined drastically, to $31 billion, in 1991, but that was a
reflection of the weakness of the U.S. economy in the midst of a
recession. The last trade surplus was posted in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   While goods exports fell in 1998, exports of services were up
modestly, by about $2 billion. Those numbers include business and
financial services, travel and royalties and license fees. But
imports of services rose more than $10 billion. Still, exports
accounted for a surplus of $79.4 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the curious features of the latest report was the light
it cast on the economies of nations that the International Monetary
Fund, with U.S. backing, sought to bail out in late 1997 and 1998.
When their currencies were sharply devalued, many experts projected
that their exports to the United States would surge. It never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. imports from South Korea held steady, hovering around $23
billion. But exports to Korea fell drastically. The same pattern
held for Indonesia. The numbers suggest that in both countries, the
absence of trade financing made it difficult for the nations to
increase their exports to U.S. markets, even though their goods,
once priced in dollars, were significantly less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Trade deficits, depending on one's point of view, can be either
a symbol of national strength or national weakness. If they are
driven by the demands of an economy whose factories are running
nearly full tilt, then they are arguably the sign of economic
health. But over time financing a trade deficit requires borrowing
from abroad and thus can impair the nation's ability to save. &QL;

   LINCOLN, Neb. _ If everything had gone according to schedule,
Randolph Reeves would be dead by now, executed in Nebraska's
electric chair for killing two women nearly 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But very little about Reeves' case has been predictable.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, in an overwhelmingly pro-death-penalty state,
some of those arguing most strenuously that Reeves' life be spared
are his two victims' relatives, who say they will be devastated if
Reeves is put to death.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because Reeves, an Omaha Indian adopted as a
child by a white Quaker couple, was raised in that faith, which
shuns all violence, and because his two victims, one of them a
Quaker, were both strongly opposed to the death penalty. They were
killed in March 1980 in a Quaker meetinghouse in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   National Quaker organizations have recently taken up Reeves'
cause, arguing emphatically that his death would only hurt his
victims more.
</P>
<P>
   But even more striking was the 11th-hour decision on Jan. 12 by
the Nebraska Supreme Court to grant Reeves a stay of execution
after his lawyer appealed under a new amendment to the Nebraska
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which guarantees all Nebraska citizens equal
rights under the law, was approved in November by voters who
apparently did not expect it to be used to try to overturn a death
penalty sentence. (Most proponents of the measure had said they saw
it as a formality, a clause that most other states already had and
would make little practical difference in Nebraska.) But because of
the Reeves case, the new law could have repercussions well beyond
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Reeves filed an appeal asserting that he had been
the victim of a death penalty sentence that discriminates against
minorities. The lawyer said that although Indians and blacks make
up 4 percent of Nebraska's population, six of the 20 death-row
inmates _ 30 percent _ are members of these minority groups, as
were two of the three inmates executed in Nebraska since the state
reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge filed under the Nebraska equal protection law is
one of several lawsuits in recent years that have sought to test
whether state constitutions might be interpreted differently than
the federal Constitution on issues ranging from gay rights to
searches and seizures. The Nebraska rights law was the issue that
the state Supreme Court said it would consider when it halted
Reeves' execution two days before he was to die.
</P>
<P>
   If Reeves is successful in his appeal, it would be the first
time that a death sentence was overturned based on an argument of
racial disparity, and death penalty experts are closely watching to
see how the Nebraska case turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for death-row defendants have long sought to make the
case that the system disproportionately imposes death sentences on
members of minorities or on defendants whose victims were white.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,549 inmates on death row in the United States, 1,499,
or 42 percent, are black, according to the Death Penalty
Information Center, a research group. Blacks make up 13 percent of
the population. Hispanic inmates and those of other minorities make
up 391 of the people on death row. There are 1,659 whites awaiting
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, most experts thought the door was closed on
racial-disparity arguments when the U.S. Supreme Court found, in
the case of a Georgia black man, that it was not enough to show a
statistical pattern of racial disparity on death row without proof
that a jury or judge intentionally discriminated against a
particular defendant, something that is extremely difficult to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, states have begun to examine racial
discrimination arguments. In cases in New Jersey, North Carolina
and Colorado, state courts have suggested that they may be swayed
solely by a statistical pattern of discrimination, even though they
said they had not found a convincing pattern in the cases before
them, said Jennifer Friesen, a professor at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the death penalty law, passed in 1995, explicitly
allows for defendants to appeal by claiming that members of their
racial group are disproportionately sentenced to death. And last
year, Kentucky passed a law that allows defendants in capital cases
to make such claims even before they are put on trial, allowing
them to seek a guarantee that they would not get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nebraska case, Reeves' lawyer, Paula Hutchinson, says she
believes that the discriminatory argument has a chance because the
language in Nebraska's equal protection clause, she says, suggests
that as long as there has been a discriminatory effect, no proof of
intentional discrimination is required.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say they would be stunned if the death sentence is
commuted on grounds of discrimination. Others say the outcome is
impossible to predict. Some point out that it is significant that
the argument is being considered at all by the Nebraska court,
which is viewed as fairly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last minute this new law opens up some possible relief
and we're just watching to see if that happens,'' said Richard
Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
``Clearly, it's going to affect more than the Reeves case. Most
cases could be affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 42, was convicted of using a kitchen knife to stab to
death Janet Mesner, 30, and Victoria Lamm, 28, in the early morning
of March 29, 1980. Ms. Mesner was living in the Quaker meetinghouse
and working as its caretaker, and her friend Ms. Lamm, who was 15
weeks' pregnant, had returned for a visit after moving to Oregon.
Ms. Lamm's 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Audrey, was also in the house,
but does not remember anything about that night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mesner lived long enough to call police and identify Reeves
as the killer. Reeves, a construction worker on temporary jobs who
was known to be a drinker but not a violent man, later confessed to
the killings, but said he remembered little about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Reeves say his actions were a result of heavy beer
drinking combined with the use of peyote, a cactus that causes
hallucinations. To counter that argument, prosecutors said that if
that Reeves had been so drugged he did not know right from wrong,
he would have been too impaired to commit the murders.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 3, Reeves was removed from a troubled family on
the Omaha Indian Reservation and adopted by Donald and Barbara
Reeves, who lived on a farm in Central City. The Reeveses are
distant cousins of the Mesners and attend the same meetinghouse in
Central City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched him grow up,'' said Mildred Mesner, Janet Mesner's
mother. ``I taught him in Sunday school class. He was close with
one of our sons. I know he didn't have any hatred toward Janet.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Reeves' parents have generally stayed in the background
in the case, unwilling to ask for support even though they are
adamantly opposed to the death penalty and Donald Reeves has worked
for national Quaker organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Randolph Reeves' lawyers have appealed on various
grounds, sending the case before the Nebraska Supreme Court four
times and the U.S. Supreme Court twice.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have complained that Nebraska law gave jurors a
choice only of convicting Reeves or acquitting him of first-degree
murder, without making allowance for a lesser crime, something the
jury foreman now says he would have supported. The lawyers have
argued that Reeves' intoxication had not been taken into account at
the trial or in sentencing, and they have cited what they say were
procedural errors in the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have supported the way the original trial was
conducted and declined to order a new sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hutchinson's latest appeal asserts that in addition to
racial discrimination, her client's equal protection rights were
violated in two other ways. One occurred in 1991 after errors were
found in Reeves' original sentence, she says, when a Nebraska
Supreme Court resentenced him to death without sending his case
back to the trial court for another hearing. She also asserts that
electrocution, Nebraska's only means of execution, is a cruel and
unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Janet Mesner's parents have lobbied against the
execution of Reeves, their efforts eventually getting the support
of national Quaker organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nebraska, we're very much a minority,'' Mrs. Mesner said.
``Seventy-five to 80 percent of the people here believe in the
death penalty and so it's been very lonely for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamm's husband, Gus, and her daughter, Audrey, now 21,
joined the protest only recently. The two, like Ms. Lamm, are not
Quakers but oppose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm, a mental health therapist in Portland, Ore., said he had
paid no attention to the case since the conviction. He said that
although he knew Reeves had been sentenced to death, he expected
him to end up serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Lamm said, he received a telephone call from a
Mesner relative, who told him about the impending execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `No, no, no,''' Lamm recalled. In a few short weeks,
the Lamms have become strident advocates for Reeves, shouting at
Gov. Mike Johanns after a meeting of the state Pardons Board and
deluging his office with flowers in a gesture of protest. Audrey
Lamm has decided to leave Oregon and move to Nebraska, where she
plans to work for several months for Reeves' lawyer, Ms.
Hutchinson. The Lamms even visited Reeves in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm said he saw the incident as though ``three lives had been
lost that night,'' the lives of the two women and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Audrey, said, ``I now feel I can approach Randy
not as the daughter of his victim but as someone with whom I can
find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Lamms seem to feel much less enmity toward Ms.
Lamm's killer than they do toward her father, brother and sister,
who support the death penalty for Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want that man out of sight,'' said Alan Zessin, Ms.
Lamm's father, who lives in Republican City. ``It's been 18 years
that my family has had to suffer from Randolph Reeves. I'd been
looking forward to Thursday, Jan. 14, 10 a.m., for a while. I
thought he was finally going to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Johanns and Attorney General Don Stenberg, two of the three
members of the Pardons Board, are also disappointed with the stay
of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Robinson, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said
Stenberg ``felt there was no new evidence in this case that would
contradict any of the rulings by previous courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Johanns, who was elected in
November, said the governor believed ``that to keep putting it off
and putting it off is not what the will of the public is and he's
frustrated by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the governor, a Republican, had not supported the
equal protection clause on the ballot in November, fearing that it
might ``open the door to frivolous legal wrestling that would clog
the court system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hutchinson, the lawyer, is simply grateful for any extra
chance the case can get. She said she had not even been aware that
the equal protection clause was on the ballot until she walked into
the voting booth. Then, she said, she exclaimed loud enough to be
heard by her husband in another booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what I was looking for,'' Ms. Hutchinson said.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 KURT EISSLER, DIRECTOR   OF SIGMUND FREUD ARCHIVES , DIES AT 90 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kurt Robert Eissler, the New York psychoanalyst who
founded, directed and defended the Sigmund Freud Archives and then
handpicked a successor who ended up plunging the archive into a sea
of trouble, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1980s Eissler was little known outside psychoanalytic
circles. As Janet Malcolm described him in 1983 in The New Yorker,
``he was tall, gaunt and unmistakably European,'' he was ``an
extraordinary clinician,'' and he was the author of many ``quirky
papers.'' His work included papers on the treatment of
schizophrenics and delinquents and a paper on the debate about
vaginal orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``The Psychiatrist and the Dying Patient,'' (1955)
``Leonardo da Vinci: Psychoanalytic Notes on the Enigma'' (1961)
and a two-volume work, ``Goethe: A Psychoanalytic Study'' (1963).
He also wrote a number of books on Freudian history, including
``Talent and Genius,'' about Viktor Tausk, Freud's troubled student
(1971). In that book, Ms. Malcolm wrote, he defended Freud against
``the insinuation that Freud was to blame'' for his patient's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eissler's devotion to Freud,'' she added, was ``considered a
kind of lovable nuttiness.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II Eissler and a small group of psychoanalysts,
Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Krus, Bertram Lewin and Herman Nunberg,
decided to preserve Freud's letters and papers in a single archive.
The Library of Congress, Eissler wrote, agreed ``to accept as a
donation all documents collected by the Archives, and to make them
accessible to scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s Eissler, with the help of Anna Freud, had collected
thousands of tapes, letters and papers for that archive. (An
exhibition of parts of the collection was held at the Library of
Congress last year and will be at the Jewish Museum this year.)
</P>
<P>
   But his role in psychoanalytic history took a turn (though he
did not know it then) when he met Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a
Sanskrit scholar and psychoanalyst, at an annual meeting of the
American Psychoanalytic Society.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Masson remembered him when they met in 1974:
Eissler, the Secretary of the Archives, was ``called the pope of
orthodox analysis,'' Masson wrote in his book ``Final Analysis.''
He had ``hundreds of hours of tape recordings of conversations with
many of Freud's patients,'' and he was a confidante of Anna Freud.
Masson continued, ``If anyone represented the link with Freud and
Freud's Vienna, it was the formidable Kurt Eissler.''
</P>
<P>
   Eissler, whose wife, Ruth, died in 1988, was a formal and
secretive man. But he befriended Masson because of their mutually
intense interest in Freud. Eissler let Masson listen to his tapes
of the so-called Wolf Man, Freud's patient, and borrow valuable
Freud documents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1980 Eissler decided that Masson would be his
successor at the archives. He asked Anna Freud to release the
letters between Freud and Wilhelm Fliess that had not yet been
published so that Masson could translate and edit them.
</P>
<P>
   The fatefulness of that decision became clear to Eissler in
1981, when Masson, who was projects director of the archives,
delivered a shocking paper to the Western New England
Psychoanalytic Society, in New Haven. Masson said Freud had
abandoned his ``seduction theory'' _ the idea that adult neurosis
is caused by childhood sexual abuse _ for personal rather than
scientific reasons.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the seduction theory, Masson concluded, ``Freud
began a trend away from the real world that, it seems to me, has
come to a dead halt in the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis
throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout followed quickly. Eissler led the 13-member board of
the Freud Archives into a vote to remove Masson from his position
as projects director of the archives. In explanation of his action,
Eissler said: ``Would you make director of the archives someone who
writes plain nonsense?''
</P>
<P>
   Then the legal tango began. Masson sued the Freud Archives for
$13 million. Eissler sued Masson to get back his audio tapes and
Freud's letters. After Ms. Malcolm wrote an article on the affair,
she too was sued by Masson. One matter at the heart of Malcolm
trial involved a quotation in which Masson describes Eissler
begging him not to tell Anna Freud about the scandal. Eissler
attended that trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was about him,'' Gwen Davis wrote in The Nation, ``the
poignance of old Geppetto, who had carved himself a son, only to
discover, to his profound chagrin, that Pinocchio was a naughty
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   George Gross, a psychoanalyst and friend of Eissler, saw
Eissler's emotions in a slightly different light. Eissler, he said
``was disappointed that he had not found a person who understood
Freud the way he did.'' In that, he was a little like Freud. Gross
said, ``Freud was constantly disappointed.''

IMMIGRATION AGENTS DETAIN 74 SUSPECTED ILLEGAL ALIENS IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANIE MAGRUDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. _ Acting on a tip, federal officials raided a
motel north of downtown Chandler on Friday and apprehended 74
suspected illegal immigrants who had spent the night in four tiny
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The raid came nine days after the city of Chandler, near
Phoenix, settled a $35 million federal lawsuit filed by Hispanics
who alleged their civil rights were violated by police during a
five-day immigration roundup in July 1997 that netted 432 illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The city settled for $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Encinas, head of the Chandler Coalition for Civil and
Human Rights and a frequent critic of the city's 1997 roundup, was
relieved Friday's raid involved only the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration can do their job as long as the Chandler police
aren't there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Chandler police were not at the site, but they had
been notified of the Immigration and Naturalization Service raid,
said Hank Woodrum, the INS' assistant district director for
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen agents from the INS in Phoenix surprised the 65 men,
five women and four children, who were smuggled into the Casa
Blanca Motel at 695 N. Arizona Ave. on Thursday afternoon or
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that they likely crossed the border at Nogales or
Douglas and that most were headed to Florida, Georgia and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrum said he couldn't recall a bigger roundup at one location
in one day in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials are questioning three individuals who they
believed smuggled the illegal immigrants from the southern Mexican
states of Chiapas, Veracruz and Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand they were just stashed here by smugglers who
were going to move them out very soon,'' Woodrum said. ``If we had
waited until later this afternoon or Monday, they may have been
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 74 individuals were kept in three of the 10- by 14-foot
rooms until an INS van and two buses arrived about noon on Friday.
Some were handcuffed together, walking single file to an area where
INS investigators frisked them and confiscated an assortment of
mirrors, cigarettes and plastic combs.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms were littered with emply juice cartons, soda cans and
food wrappers. One woman, who was seated with 10 other people on a
bed, appeared exhausted and distraught.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to leave the hotel, the immigrants, some in
handcuffs, walked single file. Most were somber as they left the
rooms, but a few were smiling and joking and one broke into song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have been caught many times,'' said Tom
Homan, Woodrum's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Their bags, blankets, backpacks and other belongings were
searched for contraband and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour wait, the immigrants were taken to the INS'
district office in downtown Phoenix, where they can ask for a
hearing before an immigration judge or agree to be taken back to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the INS rounded up 15 suspected illegal
immigrants at the same motel, a white-brick structure with aqua
trim and tile roofs which is among Chandler's oldest. They were
staying in three rooms with three to seven men in a room.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Patel, whose wife, Anna, owns the 24-room motel, said
Friday that he wasn't around when the undocumented workers were
dropped off. Patel, who declined to say how much the men paid for
the rooms, said patrons must have picture ID to stay, but
citizenship isn't verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing written on someone's forehead whether they're
legal or illegal,'' he said. ``But we don't keep track of them.
People come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Patel said she and her husband call the police when they
suspect undocumented workers are staying there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like what they are doing, but not all of Mexico is
like that, and we can't ask them for their ID,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, the Border Patrol and Chandler police stopped
Hispanics at various locations throughout the city, mostly
downtown, and asked for identification.
</P>
<P>
   The joint operation also affected many U.S.-born Hispanics and
legal immigrants who said police unlawfully stopped and questioned
them about their citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix policy prohibits officers from stopping people just
to check their citizenship and from arresting people when the only
violation is an infraction of federal immigration law. &QL;

ANDREAS FEININGER, WHO PORTRAYED NEW YORK IN PHOTOS, DIES AT 92  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., France, Germany, Canada)   By ANDY GRUNDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andreas Feininger, a pioneering photographer known
both for his pictures for Life magazine and for his more personal
images, died on Thursday at New York University Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   During his 60-year career Feininger photographed a wide range of
subjects, from individual portraits to pictures of skyscrapers and
seashells. But whatever his subject, he described it with a clarity
and precision that were the characteristics of his style.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the painter Lyonel Feininger, he was born on Dec. 27,
1906 in Paris. He grew up in Germany and in the 1920s attended the
Bauhaus, where his father taught and where young Lyonel worked with
Marcel Breuer and Joseph Albers.
</P>
<P>
   The Weimar-based, innovative school of art and design was one of
the first to accept photography as an equal partner of the other
visual arts, and Andreas Feininger found it so intriguing a medium
that he pursued it on his own while studying cabinetmaking and
architecture. His pictures of the time focused on the products of
the industrial age, especially automobiles, which he portrayed as
epitomes of power and speed.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving school he worked as a cabinetmaker and as an
architect in Germany, but he continued to take photographs. In 1933
he moved to Sweden, and in 1936 he decided to devote himself to
photography. In 1939 he immigrated to the United States and found
work in New York as a freelance photographer with the Black Star
Picture Agency. His clients soon included Life, and he was invited
to join the magazine's staff in 1943. From then to 1962, when he
left the magazine, he completed 346 assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most renowned photographs in Life were his telephoto
views of the New York skyline and mid-Manhattan sidewalks, taken in
the 1940s. The compressed perspective of these views, in which
buildings and pedestrians appear caught in rush-hour gridlock, was
achieved with experimental techniques and equipment that Feininger
devised.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of photographers have reproduced the same effects, but
none with better results. Many of his richly detailed photographs,
like ``Brooklyn Bridge in the Fog'' (1948), ``Sunday at Coney
Island Beach'' (1949) and ``Traffic on Fifth Avenue'' (1950)
appeared in Life spread across two pages.
</P>
<P>
   In the pictures he made for himself, Feininger showed the same
willingness to experiment and to reform reality. He used his
repertory of technical skills to isolate natural objects _
including shells, bones and feathers _ from their surroundings,
focusing the viewer's attention on their forms with specially built
cameras. He believed that all forms in the world, natural and
man-made, partake of the same design principles and that
photography was, in his words, ``the sole language to be understood
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of more than 30 books, publishing the first in
Stockholm in 1936. His books included ``The Face of New York''
(1954), ``Changing America'' (1955) ``The World Through My Eyes''
(1963) and ``Forms of Nature and Life'' (1966). He also wrote an
illustrated autobiography, ``Andreas Feininger: Photographer,''
published in 1986. &UR;  &LR; In addition, he was for several years a
columnist for Modern Photography magazine, and he also contributed
to many other photography journals.
</P>
<P>
   His work was widely exhibited. His ``Anatomy of Nature'' opened
at the Museum of Natural History in New York in 1957 and traveled
to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. He had shows at the
Oakland Museum in California and, in New York, at the Neikrug
Galleries, the New-York Historical Society and the International
Center of Photography. He was also represented in shows at the
Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the
International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in
Rochester. Most recently he helped to assemble 80 of his favorite
black-and-white photographs, taken between 1928 and 1988, for a
retrospective exhibition that has been touring Europe since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Wysse; a son, Tomas, of Quebec; a
brother, Lux, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren, and a
great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Feininger's philosophy of photography was characteristically
brief and straightforward. He wrote in 1982, ``I believe that the
key to good photography is interest on the part of the
photographer, not in photography but in his subject.''

ON BASEBALL: THE RULES OF BECOMING A YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Mass., Canada, Fla.)   (See also BBA-YANKS-PITCHERS)  
(DW) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Joe Torre smartly and shrewdly infiltrated Roger
Clemens' mind during his first telephone call to the newest Yankee
pitcher on Wednesday night by comparing him to Bob Gibson. From the
first moment the manager spoke with the future Hall of Famer about
a first-ballot Hall of Famer, Torre wanted to give Clemens a clear
vision of who he thought and expected the Rocket to be.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an accidental comparison. The picture that Torre
always has painted of Gibson is of an intimidating pitcher who was
also the ultimate team player. Gibson did not need any special
treatment. Simply give him a baseball and let him scare hitters
with fastballs. No nonsense. That is what the Yankees want to see
and hear from Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes after they hung up, Torre called Clemens again
as he continued to work on turning a superstar who has occasionally
been pampered into another pitcher in pinstripes. Torre asked
Clemens to change his arrival date of Sunday night with Toronto to
Saturday for the Yankees, and Clemens quickly obliged. Advantage,
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   In a methodical manner, the Yankees hope to ease Clemens into
their gentlemanly clubhouse without treating him any differently
from the other 24 players. It is an intriguing chore because
Clemens evolved into a deity with the Boston Red Sox and routinely
came late for spring training and followed his own workout regimen.
He also was treated like royalty by the Toronto Blue Jays. The
Yankees are thrilled to have Clemens, but they want to be careful
not to create a throne for him. Those do not exist in Torre's
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that everyone gets preferential treatment,'' Torre
said. ``That's just the way we do things here. There are certain
privileges that a David Cone might get, but the rules are the same
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Torre was cautious in discussing the future treatment of
Clemens before he has even met with the 36-year-old pitcher, George
Steinbrenner was more blunt. As much as Steinbrenner complimented
Clemens, he also made it clear that there is only one king in
Yankeeland, and he signs the paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bigger than life almost, but he has been told that he's
coming to us and that he's going to fit in with this group,''
Steinbrenner said. ``He understands it. He's a Yankee. He'll obey
the Yankee rules. He won't be, for instance, doing some of the
things they may have allowed him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner would not specifically explain what he was
referring to, but Clemens had a separate locker at Skydome for his
four children and was allowed to play baseball with them before
games. The Yankees permit players' sons to visit the clubhouse
after the team wins, but they are not allowed in before games or
after defeats. Torre is a simple manager to play for, merely asking
players to be on time and not to embarrass him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not get special treatment, and he'll accept that,''
Steinbrenner said. ``This is one special young man in a lot of
different ways. He'll pull his share on everything, guest
appearances, helping for charity and helping kids, and he'll help
some of our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Torre's strengths as a manager is his ability to gauge
the temperature of the clubhouse. Torre knows when to pounce and
when to stay silent, and he handled David Wells, a much bigger
distraction than Clemens will probably ever be. That is why Torre's
call to tell Clemens he is another Gibson and a second call to
request that he arrive earlier were astute. Slowly, yet decisively,
Torre is asserting his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to him about what we do, and I'm sure he'll have
some questions,'' Torre said. ``Hopefully, I'll answer them to his
satisfaction...`
</P>
<P>
   Entering his 16th season, Clemens is thirsty for a World Series
ring and already has said that he wants ``to slide in the side
door'' on a team that had 125 victories last season. The Yankees
want him to do that. It makes sense for Clemens to be a superstar
on the mound and a subordinate in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Torre will probably let him know,'' Derek Jeter
said. ``He's got great control over the team. I don't anticipate
Clemens coming in here and thinking he's bigger than the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench coach, who was a coach when
Clemens played for Boston in 1992, said that showing certain
players special treatment can be disruptive to others. But Zimmer
vowed that Clemens would follow the rules Torre dispensed. Because
of Torre and a player-policing clubhouse, Chili Davis said Clemens
had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Yankees,'' Davis said. ``You don't come to the New
York Yankees and think, `OK, now they've got to adjust to me.' It
doesn't work that way. You got to adjust to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, Clemens will find that out.

SUSPECT, 20, IN TEXAS SLAYING MAY HAVE FLED TO ISRAEL 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas man indicted in the stabbing murder of a
Houston shop clerk is believed to have fled to Israel, which
protects its citizens from extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Dror Hiam Goldberg, 20, is believed to be a citizen of Israel
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His case could be similar to one in Maryland involving Samuel
Sheinbein, 18, an Israeli citizen's son who fled to Israel three
days after he and a friend allegedly dismembered another teen and
burned his torso.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, defense attorneys argued before the Israeli
Supreme Court that Sheinbein, though not born in Israel, is
guaranteed full protection from extradition by Israeli law. The
case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's divorced parents _ his father is a
obstetrician/gynecologist and his mother an attorney in Houston _
have declined to comment. Another son, who refused to give his name
and age, said claims that his brother is in Israel are ``rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the family of the (slain) woman is suffering more,
but it's tarnished our name as well,'' said the brother, who added
that the media have hounded his family since the indictment became
public.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is accused of the Nov. 27 slaying of Manuela Silverio,
54, at Wigs by Andre, a Houston shop where she had worked for 23
years. The shop's owners, Roland Ingrando, 67, and wife Roberta,
55, were also stabbed but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said nothing was stolen and there appears to be no
motive for the attack, believed to have been a ``thrill-kill,'' a
murder carried out for the sheer pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal said Goldberg's past
includes behavioral patterns reflecting the profile of a
thrill-killer. He asked the FBI to establish a profile on Goldberg
with available evidence to use in trial.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Goldberg exhibited unusual behavior associated with the
type of murder committed, Rosenthal said, ``Yes, but I can't tell
you what.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Silverio's two daughters, Yvonne Palmer, described
Goldberg ``as a monster, someone who should have never been born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bascially, (he was) a little rich kid that had nothing to do,
except he wanted to go out on a wild spree and kill someone,''
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her sister Yvette Menendez tearfully pleaded Friday for
Goldberg's parents, Dr. Isaac Goldberg and Michele Goldberg, to
supply information that will lead authorities to his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know how the justice system works, we want justice
to be done,'' said Palmer, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said her worst fear came true when she learned Thursday
that Goldberg may be in Israel. She said she suspected that his
parents could afford to buy their son's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (authorities) assured us that he was under surveillance
and would not flee, because one of our biggest concerns was that he
would flee, and he's gone,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most devastating news was finding out my mother was
murdered and then this was the next devastating news.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has distributed 1,000 leaflets in the Houston suburb
of Bellaire, where Goldberg's parents reside, asking them: ``Where
is your son? Why is your son in Israel? Who paid for his plane
ticket?''
</P>
<P>
   The family also has posted a $10,000 reward for information
leading to Goldberg's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand, and it's not fair for someone who has
struggled so much in life to give her daughters everything, give
her grandchildren everything and go to work, and somebody can come
in, a psychotic, can came in and kill her.'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   She also accused investigators of letting Goldberg slip through
their fingers, even though he was a suspect since the night of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators obtained a search warrant for Goldberg's Bellaire
apartment that night and questioned him about the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was living in a $625-a-month, all-bills-paid,
one-bedroom apartment a few blocks from the wig shop.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a 1997 Bellaire High School graduate, was studying
hotel management at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Two male acquaintances of Golberg's at Bellaire High but who
haven't seen him since said they could not think of anything bad to
say about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a thousand people up, he'd be the last person I'd
pick'' to commit a vicious crime, said Sam Spindel, who also knew
Goldberg from a Jewish youth group.
</P>
<P>
   Spindel said he played high school football with Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomi Uziyahu, a 1996 graduate, called Goldberg ``the last
person I'd think of as violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Uziyahu said Goldberg is good-looking, smart and has wealthy
parents, leading him to wonder how he could be involved in a
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg moved out of the apartment shortly after the killing,
and his father, who had been paying the rent, paid the final month
on his son's lease in December.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said Goldberg, believed to have dual U.S.-Israeli
citizenship and grandparents in Israel, may have fled this country
in late January.
</P>
<P>
   He said Goldberg had just returned from Tel Aviv and was issued
a visa to return to Israel after the killing by the Israeli
consulate in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   However, Modi Ephraim, Israeli vice consul in Houston, said
Goldberg was not issued a visa.
</P>
<P>
   He did confirm that Goldberg's father held an Israeli passport,
but he said he does not know if the younger Goldberg is an Israeli
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea if he is in Israel.'' Ephraim said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, he said, an Israeli citizen is tried in
Israel for a crime committed in another country but will not be
extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, an Israeli judge ruled that U.S.-born Sheinbein,
charged with the September 1997 chainsaw murder of another teen in
Maryland, could be extradited because he had ``no other
connection'' to Israel except for visiting there occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   The judge described Sheinbein as an ``outside observer'' who was
entitled to Israeli citizenship because his father was an Israeli
citizen, but that his degree of citizenship did not merit
protection under Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's parents flew him to Tel Aviv to avoid prosecution.
He had never lived in Israel prior to becoming a murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein's attorneys, who include former Israeli Justice
Minister David Libai, argue that any Israeli citizen, regardless of
their degree of citizenship, should be guaranteed protection by all
Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Silverio's daughters fear that Goldberg, shielded by
his parents' wealth, may never return to this country to stand
trial, and they may never receive justice for their mother`s
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very close, we're all very close, she was my best
friend, she was my life,'' Palmer said. ``She was always there for
me always. We were like the three musketeers, everywhere you saw
us, we were all three together all the time and now she's not going
to be here any more.''

UMASS AID, ADMISSIONS TO RELY LESS ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of successful legal and political assaults on
affirmative-action policies in this state and nationally, the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst is issuing a pre-emptive
strike: It will rely less on race and ethnicity in admitting
students and awarding financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   The university announced Friday that it will begin using
household income and other non-race factors as variables in
choosing students _ a decision that the university acknowledges
will result in a decrease in its minority student population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an adjustment in light of the changing legal
environment,'' said Joseph Marshall, assistant vice chancellor for
enrollment services. ``It is clearly a sign of the times,
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the move will allow the university greater flexibility
and will allow it to shield itself from criticism and, perhaps,
lawsuits claiming affirmative action by race or ethnicity is a form
of ``reverse racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But diversity will pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   The minority student population is expected to drop from 19
percent to between 13 and 16 percent next year, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The university began rethinking its policy after a federal court
judge ruled in November that it was unconstitutional for Boston
Latin School, one of the city's three elite public high schools, to
use race as a factor in admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston School Committee decided not to appeal the case to
the Supreme Court _ knowing the conservative court's ruling could
have meant a reversal of the 1978 Supreme Court decision Bakke v.
California.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to appeal was encouraged by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the US
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The Bakke decision _ which allows institutions of learning to
use race and ethnicity in admitting students _ still stands, but a
growing wave of sentiment against affirmative action has dealt
blows in several states.
</P>
<P>
   In California in 1997, a referendum question, Proposition 209,
struck down affirmative action. The same happened in Washington
with Initiative 200, which passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal court struck down the affirmative action policy
of the University of Texas in 1996, that institution chose another
way to get a diverse enrollment: It granted automatic admissions to
the top 10 percent of every high school graduating class in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   University officials calculated that because high schools there
are largely segregated by race, such a policy would ensure the
admission of the best black and white students. The 10 percent rule
has helped, but officials there report that it has not achieved the
level of minority enrollment that the old policy of affirmative
action did.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said it has always been a struggle to attract minority
students, but said he is confident the university can come up with

   About 19 percent of the 3,800 students in the freshman class at
UMass-Amherst this year are members of minority groups, which is
about the same percentage of minorities in the graduating classes
of Massachusetts high schools, university spokesman Kay Scanlan
said.
</P>
<P>
   UMass-Amherst plans to broaden its diversity definition away
from race and ethnicity to include age, gender, family income, and
whether the applicant would be the first generation in his or her
family to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The average family income of a UMass student is $75,000, said
Scanlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work to do to reach out to lower-income
families,'' she said.

THE SPORTING MUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's confused and annoyed edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Dennis Rodman does better than rebound is annoy
people. He is just as skilled annoying people who like him, too, as
people who don't.
</P>
<P>
   That fact may wind up being the bottom line when and if Rodman
becomes a Laker. Whatever acceptance was coming his way from Laker
players, managers, fans and media types is fading faster than a
cheap tattoo obtained from a street vendor in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman may consider himself invaluable, but a majority of
basketball people do not agree with him. Lakers owner Jerry Buss
does, but the latest twists in the will-he-or-won't-he circus has
reached the point where everyone can smell the elephants.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Rodman will unify the Lakers' locker room without
being in it. Team Psych needs a fleet of couches, but on the issue
of Rodman, they appear unified. Wouldn't that be a turn of events?
...
</P>
<P>
   Rodman says his choices come down to the Lakers and Miami Heat.
If I had to make a list of NBA coaches incapable of handling
Rodman, my first two choices would be Del Harris and Pat Riley.
These two coaches are wound tighter than fishing line. ...
</P>
<P>
   I re-read Rodman's book, ``Bad As I Wanna Be'' -- it only took a
few minutes -- trying to find his salacious comments on Shaquille
O'Neal. But other than wondering how someone who has everything can
focus on basketball, he really didn't rip Shaq. The toughest line
was ``I don't feel anything when I watch Shaq play.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. That's the same reaction I have when I watch Rodman
act. ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real reason why Rodman is unsigned: He can't get
teams to accept Jack Haley as part of a deal. ..
</P>
<P>
   I like Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' General Manager, but someone
has to tell him to shut up. A day after the Yankees obtained Roger
Clemens and redefined the word overkill, Malone was saying the
Dodgers and Yankees are destined to meet in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger opponents have enough reason to dislike the Dodgers
without Malone painting a bigger blue target on the back of their
jerseys. And a team that won 83 games last season has no right
mentioning itself with one which claimed 125 last season. ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if Clemens is inducted into the Hall of Fame
tomorrow. There's simply no way he improves upon a team which had a
once-in-a-lifetime season. David Wells was 18-4 last season, so how
is Clemens supposed to improve upon that?
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens deal and Malone's comments could serve baseball very
well in 1999. Because if the Yankees ($87.6 million in salaries)
and Dodgers (first $100 million man) both trip over their cleats,
it will put a chink in baseball's theory of excess. ...
</P>
<P>
   Based on the rather skimpy inventory sold in the O.J. Simpson
auction, a lot of his other memorabilia must be well hid in the
homes of family members. Players have a lot more stuff left over
from their careers than a few jerseys and awards. ...
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of one 49er win and one Cal Poly SLO loss and
Wayne Morgan's 49ers will earn a berth in the Big West tournament.
You may commence champagne popping tomorrow evening if the 49ers
beat hated Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers would prefer to finish second or third rather than
fourth in the Big West's Western Division. A fourth place finish
means a first-round game against 18-5 Eastern Division leader Boise
State, the only conference team with a win against the Pac-10 this
season (over Washington in December).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else in the league looks the same -- average on their
best nights, if they're playing at home, the moon is full and their
opponent had a bumpy four-hour bus ride on the way to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's record against name opponents doesn't project
any field of 64 shockers. It is 2-23 versus the ACC, Big Ten, Big
12, Pac-10 and SEC, and even a sickly 7-14 against the West Coast
Conference. They're 3-9 versus ranked teams, and two of those wins
were in rivalry games (New Mexico State over New Mexico, Utah State
over Utah).
</P>
<P>
   Other Big West lowlights:
</P>
<P>
   Five of Cal Poly's 10 wins came against Division I-AA teams;
Irvine has lost 12 straight, and four of its five wins came against
Cal State Stanislaus, Northern Arizona, South Oregon and 2-21 North
Texas; Santa Barbara, 9-5 and atop the West, began the season 0-8
and lost at home to North Texas Thursday; Fullerton is 2-10 and
Idaho 3-8 on the road; and Pacific scored only 38 points in a loss
last week.
</P>
<P>
   In happier Big West developments, the baseball season is
underway. ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: IOC hints that Atlanta exceeded $200 limit on gifts
to Olympic delegates. Reaction: I had no idea grits were that
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>
   The guy who paid $233,000 for O.J. Simpson's Heisman Trophy said
he bought it to impress his girlfriend. How thoughtful, and just a
few days after Valentine's Day. ``Hey, sweetie. I bought you the
trophy of that guy who allegedly slashed his wife's neck.
Impressed?''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a Hallmark moment.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't that Chick and Adele Lebow do not enjoy each other's
company; the Royersford, Pa., couple have been married almost 55
years. But Mrs. Lebow is an avid golfer, with a passion for playing
the courses around their Philadelphia-area home, while Lebow's
passion for skiing keeps him away at least a month almost every
year. Even at 75, he has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave here, I'm heading for a week at Mammoth Mountain,
Calif., then to Taos, N.M.,'' Lebow said in a recent telephone
interview after coming off the slopes in Zermatt, Switzerland. The
week before he had skied at another Swiss resort, St. Moritz, and
shortly before that at Lake Tahoe, Nev., Salt Lake City and in
British Columbia. ``It's a lot of traveling,'' he acknowledged,
``but it's what helps keep me young _ or at least keeps me feeling
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebow, a semiretired furniture store owner, is emblematic of the
growing number of ``mature travelers,'' as the nonprofit Travel
Industry Association terms those over 55, who have not let age curb
their desire to travel. In fact, the 70-Plus Ski Club in
Schenectady, N.Y., to which he belongs, has 14,800 members.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees always have been big travelers. What is new is their
penchant for high-adventure travel more typical of those half their
age. These days, many older people, even octogenarians, can be
found riding elephants in India, horseback riding in Costa Rica and
bungee-jumping in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure-travel industry is rushing to accommodate them.
While many tour operators still offer typical retiree fare _
lengthy bus tours of Europe and the United States _ they now also
have offerings like river rafting, hiking and mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Globus &AMP; Cosmos of Littleton, Colo., the world's biggest
escorted-travel operator, has added eight tours this year, offering
more excursions and optional tours as well as river rafting in the
Rockies and diving at Australia's Great Barrier Reef. It also has
tours of two weeks or less to accommodate the work schedules of the
growing group of travelers who are not yet retired or semiretired.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Nisbet, executive director for marketing at the tour
company, said this accommodation would become more important with
each year because many baby boomers were expected to continue
working full- or part-time well beyond their normal retirement
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation of adventure travel for seniors didn't exist
10 years ago,'' said Tom Otwell, a spokesman for the American
Association of Retired People.
</P>
<P>
   But now at least a dozen adventure travel companies either
market primarily to over-50 travelers or have discovered that they
do not need to single out mature travelers because they are signing
up for adventure trips without special prompting. According to Mark
Campbell, marketing director of Mountain Travel Sobek, which
specializes in safaris, rafting trips, treks and sea kayaking
journeys, ``Our clients 60 and over have been growing steadily.
They have the money, the time and the love of travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement G. Motten is one of the many older citizens who have
retained their lifelong love of travel. ``I don't know how much
longer I'm going to be able to continue traveling,'' said the
82-year-old professor emeritus of Latin American history at Temple
University. He recently returned from his umpteenth trip to
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where he revisited Mayan ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Although his vision has deteriorated, Motten said: ``Even if it
degenerates more, I don't think I'd give up traveling altogether.
With so many places left to visit, I'm not ready yet to settle
down.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A study for the AARP found that travelers 50 and older spent
more than $30 billion on vacation travel in 1994. Since then, by
all accounts, their numbers, expenditures and travel options have
increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Although estimates vary widely as to the financial impact of
adventure travel, Campbell said the industry consensus is that it
is about $8 billion a year. ``But it is the fastest-growing segment
of the travel industry,'' he added, ``growing at 8 to 10 percent a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many older Americans are too ill or too poor to
travel. But many mature Americans, including many of the 35 million
who are 65 or older, have paid off their mortgages and their
children's tuition bills. ``They have more money to spend on travel
than any large group of adults before or since,'' said Joe
Gallagher, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   David Oakley Sr., 61, an auto dealer in Bartlesville, Okla.,
whose two children are long out of college, acquired his love of
travel when he sailed to Chile and Taiwan in the Navy. In the last
30 years, he and his wife, Carolyn, have made about 25 trips to
Europe. ``Travel is my sin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley is a mere stripling next to Otto Lang of Seattle, who
during a long career with 20th Century Fox produced movies
including ``Call Northside 777.'' Now 91, Lang plans his annual ski
trip to either Sun Valley, Idaho, or Vail, Colo., later this month.
If he does not spend as much time on the ski slopes this year as in
the past, he said, it will be because ``the knees have started to
become a maintenance problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 88, Louise Wollan of Springfield, Ill., knows that
feeling; sore knees and assorted other aches and pains make getting
out of bed quite a challenge some mornings, she said. But she likes
challenges, especially when they are combined with travel. Four
years ago, for example, on a tour with her grandson, Dennis, and
two weeks short of her 84th birthday, she bungee-jumped from a
bridge over a gorge in Queenstown, New Zealand, plunging 150 feet
and, as she described it, ``bobbing like a yo-yo.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't she scared? ``Not really,'' she said, adding that she had
also flown in hot air balloons over France, traveled in Vietnam a
year ago with a son who served there as an Army engineer, and had
visited all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived a fairly dignified life, as my five children would
probably agree,'' she said, ``but I bungee-jumped on impulse, and I
found it exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   Globus &AMP; Cosmos put together a ``travel think tank'' made up of
a geography professor, a mountain climber, a European tour guide,
travel agents and tour operators from six countries. The group drew
up some 300 possible tours, which will be trimmed to about 40, then
will be made available next year.
</P>
<P>
   Maupintour, another large tour operator, started in 1951 to
cater to what its founder, Steve Kang, described as ``a small,
elite group who could afford to take long escorted tours.'' Its
current 150 tours in 50 countries and 35 states include eight
first-time ``soft adventure'' tours designed primarily for
travelers 45 to 60 but available to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Five tours include horseback riding, others hot air balloon
trips, river and white-water rafting, hiking and canoeing. ``But
they aren't Spartan,'' Kang said. ``After you've been out all day,
you still come back to a comfortable hotel and get to have a nice
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gunnar, 70, a retired engineer and semiretired free-lance
photographer in Langley, Wash., said he and his wife, Antje, had
nothing against comfort, but not at the expense of a good
adventure. The Gunnars have been to the Antarctic and the North
Pole, and in September they hiked the Inca Trail through Peru,
crossing mountain passes up to 13,000 feet, and camping at 11,000-
to 12,000-foot elevations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember when I was young the many old people in
rocking chairs waiting to die,'' Gunnar said. ``Now a lot of older
people have enough money and good enough health to travel. And when
they do die, they hope it's while traveling.''

JUDGE IN POLICE TORTURE CASE REFUSES TO MOVE TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The judge in the case of four police officers charged
with brutalizing a Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn rejected a request
Friday to move their trial outside the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had asked for the change because of intensive
news coverage of the beating of Abner Louima in 1997 and the events
arising from it.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Eugene H. Nickerson of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, said he would reconsider the ruling if the selection
process showed that an impartial jury could not be found. Jury
selection is to begin March 29.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers had argued that the news coverage _ and similarly
abundant coverage of the recent killing of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed West African immigrant, by police officers in the Bronx _
had so inflamed public sentiment that a fair and impartial jury for
their clients could not be found in, or close to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn argued
in legal briefs against a change of venue, saying that the news
coverage would not ``render it virtually impossible'' to empanel an
impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, they said, the ``best time to determine
whether a change of venue is required'' is during jury selection,
``when the court will have an opportunity to thoroughly examine the
potential jurors for prejudice from the pretrial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson not only agreed with prosecutors Friday about a change
of venue, but also granted their request to allow the jurors to
remain anonymous, withholding their identities from the defense
lawyers and prosecutors as well as from the public.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had argued that anonymity was necessary to keep
the jurors' judgment from being tainted by outside pressures. They
said it was not unusual to have anonymous juries in controversial
cases that have racial or emotional overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the defense lawyers had opposed the anonymity, saying it
would encourage jurors to think there was something to fear about
the officers and would create prejudice against them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers, Marvyn M. Kornberg, who represents Officer
Justin A. Volpe, had said he did not object to an anonymous jury
``based upon media attention,'' although he had objected to other
arguments the prosecution had offered on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson did not specify the reasons for his rulings Friday. He
announced them from the bench and said he would elaborate on paper
later.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is charged with torturing Louima in a bathroom at the 70th
Precinct station house by thrusting a stick into his rectum,
causing major internal injuries, after Louima was arrested in a
street brawl in Flatbush. A second officer, Charles Schwarz, is
accused of holding Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   They are also accused of joining two other officers, Thomas
Bruder and Thomas Wiese, in beating Louima in a police car before
they arrived at the station house. All four officers say they have
been falsely accused.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth officer, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is to be tried with them
on charges that he tried to cover up the beating in the police car.
He denies the accusation.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia on Friday not to ``stonewall'' a peace
settlement in Kosovo and threatened to bomb Serbia if Milosevic
misses the Saturday deadline for an end to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on increasing the pressure on Milosevic, Clinton said it
would be a mistake to extend the noon deadline (6 a.m. ET) and
praised the ``courage'' of the negotiators representing the
Albanian Kosovars at the talks in Rambouillet, France. But the
president set no clear timetable for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic refused on Friday even to meet with the American
ambassador, Christopher Hill. Clinton said that allowing a peace
agreement and permitting NATO peacekeepers into Serbia was the best
way to guarantee that Kosovo remains part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   With President Jacques Chirac of France at his side during a
White House news conference, Clinton emphasized that an agreement
in France, which has been endorsed in broad outline by the Albanian
Kosovar delegates, would compel the Albanian Kosovars to give up
their demands for independence for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the U.S. and France ``stand united in our
determination to use force, if Serbia fails to meet its previous
commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo and if it fails to accept
the peace agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an option'' other than NATO airstrikes,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has remained in Belgrade during the negotiations
in France, repeated Friday that he would not accept an
international peacekeeping force inside the Serbian province of
Kosovo. He refused to meet with Hill, declaring, instead, that he
would not surrender Kosovo ``even at the price of bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and the two leaders agreed that Milosevic ``should be under
no illusion about our resolve should he prevent a deal'' on Kosovo,
according to a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Friday, Clinton underlined that the NATO
allies would not allow Milosevic to talk his way out of a real
troop withdrawal, as he did last October.
</P>
<P>
   Then, NATO also threatened the Serbian leader with airstrikes if
he did not pull back his forces following their bloody summer
offensive that led to the massacre of well over 1,000 Kosovo
civilians, the destruction of 200 villages and the driving from
their homes of some 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But after nine straight days of negotiations in Belgrade between
the American envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and Milosevic, NATO ended up
settling for an unarmed monitoring mission rather than a full
withdrawal down to the agreed- upon level of 15,000 Serbian troops
and police.
</P>
<P>
   Both the French and British withdrew their nonessential embassy
staff from Belgrade on Friday. The United States authorized the
departure of family members and nonemergency employees at its
embassy but withheld ordering a nearly full departure. That could
very well come Saturday if Milosevic does not meet the noon
deadline, according to a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and Britain also issued advisories Friday
against travel to Yugoslavia, with the British citing ``the
increasingly volatile situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Kosovo Verification Mission, established by
last October's negotiations, are also expected to be withdrawn by
NATO troops in neighboring Macedonia, according to allied
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a mistake to extend the deadline,''
Clinton said Friday at the joint press conference, the first since
his acquittal on impeachment charges one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have ordered our aircraft to be ready to act as part of a
NATO operation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no agreement and NATO decides to strike, it could
take 48 to 72 hours before the bombing begins, according to Clinton
administration officials. In late January, NATO gave its
authorization for strikes against Serbian military targets in
Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Pentagon ordered more B-52s to join NATO
forces in Europe to prepare for a possible bombing mission against
Serbia. In addition, the United States this week sent F-117 Stealth
fighters and refueling aircraft.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The planning for a bombing campaign has been drawn around two
phases, according to Pentagon officials. The first would be an
attack by Cruise missiles launched from battleships on the Adriatic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic continues to resist accepting a settlement, this
attack would be followed by concerted allied air attacks on the
Serbian air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the administration's Kosovo policy say NATO
seems to be serious about striking Serbia this time, although it
has threatened strikes before only to extend deadlines to persuade
Milosevic to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now NATO's credibility is truly on the line,'' said Ivo
Daalder, a Balkan specialist formerly at the National Security
Council. ``Not to follow through on a serious threat tied to a
serious deadline would fundamentally undermine the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomats and administration officials say Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the French foreign minister, Hubert
Vedrine, and the British foreign minister, Robin Cook, may go to
Belgrade over the weekend if it appears that such a high-level
delegation could convince Milosevic to accept the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While allied leaders were threatening Milosevic, their military
forces were moving closer to Kosovo to take part in a peacekeeping
mission should an agreement be reached. Last weekend the United
States joined the British and French in making formal troop
commitments for the initial force that could arrive in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 Marines are sailing toward the Greek port of
Salonika on the Aegean Sea, where British ships are also expected
to land and unload heavy equipment for their troops. British
soldiers will be flown into the airport in Macedonia and then
driven into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will also provide the NATO headquarters in
Pristina with command &AMP; control, telecommunication and intelligence
experts, according to Pentagon officials, for the initial phase of
the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing for war and we are preparing for peace,''
said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon news conference, Clinton was also asked what he
had learned from the past year of investigation and impeachment.
Adopting a thoughtful expression, he said he came away with an
enhanced respect for the Constitution and its framers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Constitution has been, in effect, re-ratified,''
Clinton said. ``And I hope the presidency has not been harmed. I
don't believe it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I can't say that I think this has been good
for the country. But we will see.''

BENITEZ LUGS HIS BAGGAGE AND MANY TALENTS TO METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ His agent, Mike Powers, vividly remembers
the first time he set eyes on the family home of Armando Benitez _
a 15-by-15-foot two-room shack in the Dominican Republic _ in which
Benitez lived with his mother, two brothers and a sister.
Electricity and plumbing were merely a rumor. There were no windows
or doors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Benitez was about 18, and not long removed from
working in a sugar-cane factory for a dollar a day. Carlos
Bernhardt, the scout who discovered him, remembers a lanky child
weighing about 135 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the 26-year-old Benitez has filled out more than
his frame. With tree trunks for arms and telephone poles for legs,
the hulking right-handed pitcher _ who stands 6 feet 4 inches and
weighs nearly 240 pounds _ is now a millionaire, thanks to a right
arm that can hurl a ball at speeds approaching 100 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is with that tattooed right arm that the Mets _ who acquired
Benitez from the Baltimore Orioles in the off-season three-team
deal that sent Todd Hundley to the Dodgers _ are hoping they can
help turn a competitive bullpen into a formidable one.
</P>
<P>
   And it is because of that right arm that Manager Bobby Valentine
admitted Friday, on the first day pitchers and catchers reported to
camp, that Benitez is the new pitcher he is most excited about this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had those kind of numbers,'' Valentine said,
referring not only to Benitez's lively fastball, but also to his 87
strikeouts in only 681/3 innings last season. The Mets have not had
a reliever who can throw this hard since they traded Randy Myers
for John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how far he has come from his dirt-poor beginnings,
Benitez _ who recently purchased a house for his mother in one of
the most expensive districts of Santo Domingo _ still appears to be
something of a man-child in the promised land of American
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great kid,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who
managed Benitez with the Orioles in 1996 and 1997. ``But you have
to understand, here's a guy who is still really young in baseball
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, it sometimes seemed as if Benitez
threatened to quit the game nearly as often as he would finish one
off. In June 1995, as a 22-year-old rookie, Benitez temporarily
packed his bags after he drilled Tino Martinez, then with Seattle,
one pitch after surrendering a grand slam to Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   This past May, the same Tino Martinez, now with the Yankees, was
in the unlucky position of following another big home run. This
time, it was a three-run shot by Bernie Williams. Benitez fired his
next pitch, a 97-mph fastball, into Martinez's back.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's pitch sparked a Yankee Stadium brawl, but Valentine
defended his action Friday and said that the Orioles' Cal Ripken
had mentioned to him in the off season that he was impressed that
Benitez had the courage to do what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ripken thought it was the most manly thing he's seen a guy
do,'' said Valentine, who added, in jest, that Benitez ``should
have worked on his jab a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Ripken was impressed, many of Benitez's Oriole
teammates were not. And Benitez was so despondent after the
incident that he went into a funk that lasted until the All-Star
Game break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a bad guy at all,'' said Alan Mills, who was with
Benitez in the Orioles bullpen from 1994-98. ``But I think a lot of
times people misunderstand him.'' That, said Mills, might be
because of the language barrier. It also could be because Benitez's
emotions often seem to get the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   And so, while those close to Benitez speak of how he has matured
over the years, the question now is whether he can deal with the
glare of playing in New York. It was only last season that Mets
fans practically booed reliever Mel Rojas out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel didn't have Armando's fastball,'' said Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips. All the same, how will the emotional
Benitez react if he struggles early and faces the kind of jeers
that Rojas did?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people boo me, that will make me more emotional, and I
will work harder to show the people that I can do it,'' Benitez
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if Benitez does his job well, there might be problems
of a different sort. Franco has been the Mets' closer since 1990.
But it's hard not to sense that the hard-throwing Benitez, who
recorded 22 saves in 26 opportunities last season, is waiting in
the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' was Phillips' response when asked if Benitez will take
over the closer's role should he pitch well early. ``I'm assuming
that if he does real well early, he'll be getting the ball to
Johnny, who will be closing out the games.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Franco, who saved 38 of 46 opportunities last season
but had an 0-8 record, should struggle early? It was a question
from which Valentine quickly stepped aside. ``We can't look into
the future,'' is all he would say.
</P>
<P>
   According to Benitez, he does not want Franco's job, anyway. ``I
know I'm not the closer,'' he said. ``Franco is the closer. I just
want to help.'' &QL;

TIGER STALKS ON THE FRINGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hold that Tiger. The Nissan Open's leaders better
adopt that motto, because golf's biggest star is lurking in the
rough and primed to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods shot a not-so-special 68 on Friday at Riviera
Country Club and sits four shots behind second-round leader Bob
Estes. Even more daunting, he would have to surpass eight other
golfers to win the tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   But don't discount Woods.
</P>
<P>
   You only have to go back to last weekend to realize Woods is the
one name missing from the leaderboard who should not be ignored.
Not that anyone would actually ignore Woods.
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds at the Buick Invitational in San Diego, Woods
had an identical two-round total of 137. But he was in even worse
shape, nine shots off the lead. Woods then went out and shot a 62
and 65 to claim the tournament title last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Are we about to witness a repeat performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Four) shots back is not where I want to be; obviously I want
to be closer,'' Woods said. ``(But) I'm right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was nothing if not consistent Friday. He had 15 pars and
three birdies, and easily could have shaved three or four more
strokes off his score with a little luck on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone following Woods might have a hard time believing he
actually shot a 68. He slammed his putter into the fringe at 13,
forcing some emergency divot replacement. He tossed his iron at his
bag on the 15th fairway after his shot landed in an undesirable
spot on the green. After narrowly missing a 25-foot putt, Woods
took his putter and stuck it in his chest, pretending to commit
hara-kiri. And after slicing a fairway wood on 17, he yelled an
expletive.
</P>
<P>
   Tough day, Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play all that great, but I scored well,'' Woods said.
``I hit five greens through nine holes. I hit a lot of good putts,
but they didn't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Woods' behavior wasn't that unusual. His emotional
outbursts on the course are well known, if rarely reported. It's
usually dismissed as part of his competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most ironic occurrence of the tournament is that
Woods and David Duval _ unquestionably the tour's top two players _
are tied at 3-under after 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend could easily intensify the budding rivalry between
the two. Unless you listen to Woods, who quickly dismissed
questions about dueling with Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a media thing. You guys keep asking about it,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's also on the minds of other top players, who are
concentrating on figuring out a way to overtake the dynamic duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a golfer-celebrity, (Woods) has taken it to another
level,'' Davis Love III said. ``It's going to be hard to knock
Tiger and David off the roll they've been on the last couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think the difference from being the fourth- or
fifth-best guy in the world to being No.1 is not a big difference,
but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to understand that is by looking at the
galleries. Woods' supporters dwarfed everybody else's Friday, and
they were younger and more diverse than the other crowds.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the most familiar crowd Woods has seen recently,
since this is more or less the local stop on the tour for the
former Orange County resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels nice. I see friends and family out here,'' Woods
said. ``It brings back good memories.''

GIANTS SIGN COLLINS FOR $16.9 MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins Friday to a
four-year, $16.9 million free-agent contract that makes him the
highest-paid player in team history and the highest-paid Giant by
nearly $1 million annually. Danny Kanell, the Giants' quarterback
of the future just a year ago, was released.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, with a $5 million signing bonus in hand, was then told
by Giants Coach Jim Fassel to take a seat on the bench, bringing
new meaning to the notion that good seats to Giants games are rare
and valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel named Kent Graham, the starter at the end of last season,
the No. 1 quarterback Friday in an attempt to ease the pressure on
Collins as he joins the National Football League's second-worst
offense. The coach also recognized the potential friction that
Collins' arrival might spawn on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel will spend the better part of the next six months
trying to explain how he can pay Collins more than $4 million a
year not to play. Graham's base salary is $1.2 million. At a time
in the NFL when salary-cap issues dominate teams' decision-making,
it is an economic reality that there will be pressure on Fassel to
play Collins. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, that reality could spark a rift in the
Giants' leadership. General Manager Ernie Accorsi was the driving
force behind the pursuit and signing of Collins. Fassel has long
been a Graham advocate and believed before the events of the past
two days that the team could win with him. (The team finished 8-8
last season, including 5-1 with Graham as the starter.) There is
the long-term potential for an internal argument over who the
quarterback should be.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough to complicate Collins' arrival, there is
the possibility that Collins could be greeted coolly by his new
teammates, especially the black players on the team who are well
aware of Collins' use of a racial slur at a Carolina Panthers party
in 1997 _ an incident that ignited racial tensions in the Panthers'
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highest-paid Giants are the team's only Pro Bowl
players, defensive end Michael Strahan and linebacker Jessie
Armstead. Both are black, and Strahan earns slightly more than $3
million a year, Armstead slightly less.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and Accorsi said they had examined and investigated
Collins' myriad off-the-field woes the last two years, which
include a drunken driving arrest, and concluded that Collins was
committed to changing some of his old habits.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Leigh Steinberg, said Collins seeks regular
counseling from a psychologist and ``understands he has a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met with Kerry he said all the right things in a
convincing, sincere way,'' Fassel said of Collins, who was released
by the Carolina Panthers last season and ignored in the free-agent
market by the New Orleans Saints, for whom he started late in 1998.
``He's coming here to start over and restructure his whole
approach. The entire focus of his life has to be football. I needed
to be assured that he knows that, and I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a worthwhile risk. When you're looking at a quarterback
with a major league arm and talent with a big upside, there's
always a price to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who was having dinner with Collins last night in
Indianapolis where the football executives have gathered for the
annual scouting combine of college players, said Collins' job was
to work on his passing fundamentals so he could be the long-term
answer in the Giants' quarterback picture.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi was less specific about when he thought Collins might
contribute on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have a way of playing out,'' Accorsi said. ``You just
don't know. Injuries occur, a lot can occur. You need to stockpile
as many players at each position as you can, especially at
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   His contract is structured so the Giants can release him after
this season without much cap damage if they are unhappy with him.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the team, Collins said: ``I am
grateful for this opportunity. A great deal has happened in my life
over the past year or so, and I am looking forward to a fresh start
with the Giants. They have given me an opportunity that will allow
me to develop as a person and a player. It is up to me to take
advantage of that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said he felt a little bitter about his release by the
Giants, who drafted him in the fourth round in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed; I think it's a mistake by the Giants,''
Kanell said. ``I started 20 games and won 10. This season, I played
poorly sometimes but really didn't get much help. I was taking a
pretty good beating. Next thing you know I'm out of here. I feel it
was a quick hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, whose exit saved the Giants $2 million on this year's
salary cap, said he had agreed to take a pay cut to stay with the
Giants. He is expecting to sign with another team, and his first
choice was the Miami Dolphins, close to his home in Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who was returning from a Florida family vacation Friday,
issued a statement through the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to be the starter this season,'' he said. ``Jim
gave me a job to do last year _ to win games _ and we went 5-1. I
felt I had earned the right to start this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he had talked to Graham. ``Kent wasn't real happy,''
Fassel said. ``But I explained some things to him. Kent will be
fine.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Allegation of rape by Clinton hits print
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The story has been around for years, but picked up
renewed interest on the Internet the last few weeks: Bill Clinton
was said to have raped an Arkansas woman in 1978. NBC became the
first media outlet to interview the woman, on Jan. 20, but since
has sat on the story, leading some critics in this charged
political environment to suspect pressure from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Wall Street Journal became the first mainstream
press outlet to publish an article on Juanita Broaddrick in which
she details her version.
</P>
<P>
   While stories concerning the president's sex life often have
ignited a media frenzy, the effects of the Wall Street Journal
story had yet to be determined by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Washington reporters did not address the Broaddrick story Friday
during Clinton's first news conference since his impeachment trial
ended last week. Charles Gibson did discuss it on ABC's ``Good
Morning America,'' and it was mentioned on the Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN didn't mention it, and the three network evening
newscasts also avoided the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have fallout over the next few days and weeks, but
it's a little too early to know whether it will have impact,'' says
CNN's Jeff Greenfield. ``It's not as though this is a shocking new
thing _ it has been around a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, denied Broaddrick's
account: ``Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs.
Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false. Beyond that,
we're not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also dismissed the story,
telling reporters, ``I spend very little time reading the Wall
Street Journal editorial page. They lost me after they accused the
president of being a drug smuggler and a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have chased the Broaddrick story since the 1992
presidential campaign, but the Van Buren, Ark., resident would not
talk with the press. Her story arose again last year when she told
independent counsel Kenneth Starr that an affidavit she signed
denying wrongdoing by Clinton was false, and that he'd assaulted
her in a Little Rock hotel room. Broaddrick said Clinton held her
down on a bed, forced intercourse and bit her lips.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's story was written by editorial page writer and TV
critic Dorothy Rabinowitz, who went to Arkansas last week to
interview Broaddrick about her frustration over NBC's not airing
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   While NBC has been knocked by some critics, spokeswoman Alex
Constantinople said Friday the Broaddrick story is ``a work in
progress. It hasn't been killed. We're still trying to nail it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As potentially explosive as the Broaddrick story is, it appeared
on the Journal's editorial page, not its front page. The placement
led some observers to wonder whether the Journal was pulling its
own punches. But Journal Editor Robert Bartley says there is ``a
long tradition of doing our own reporting on the editorial pages,''
and that the story's placement was never discussed.

ended last week. Charles Gibson did discuss it on ABC's ``Good
Morning America,'' and it was mentioned on the Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN didn't mention it, and the three network evening
newscasts also avoided the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may have fallout over the next few days and weeks, but
it's a little too early to know whether it will have impact,'' says
CNN's Jeff Greenfield. ``It's not as though this is a shocking new
thing _ it has been around a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, denied Broaddrick's
account: ``Any allegation that the president assaulted Mrs.
Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false. Beyond that,
we're not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also dismissed the story,
telling reporters, ``I spend very little time reading the Wall
Street Journal editorial page. They lost me after they accused the
president of being a drug smuggler and a murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have chased the Broaddrick story since the 1992
presidential campaign, but the Van Buren, Ark., resident would not
talk with the press. Her story arose again last year when she told
independent counsel Kenneth Starr that an affidavit she signed
denying wrongdoing by Clinton was false, and that he'd assaulted
her in a Little Rock hotel room. Broaddrick said Clinton held her
down on a bed, forced intercourse and bit her lips.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's story was written by editorial page writer and TV
critic Dorothy Rabinowitz, who went to Arkansas last week to
interview Broaddrick about her frustration over NBC's not airing
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   While NBC has been knocked by some critics, spokeswoman Alex
Constantinople said Friday the Broaddrick story is ``a work in
progress. It hasn't been killed. We're still trying to nail it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   As potentially explosive as the Broaddrick story is, it appeared
on the Journal's editorial page, not its front page. The placement
led some observers to wonder whether the Journal was pulling its
own punches. But Journal Editor Robert Bartley says there is ``a
long tradition of doing our own reporting on the editorial pages,''
and that the story's placement was never discussed.

 &HT;    Lucky No. 7: Georgia Gym Dogs defeat Michigan
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The Georgia Gym Dogs, recently resuming the top
spot in collegiate gymnastics, proved too much from top to bottom
for No. 5 Michigan on Friday night to remain undefeated for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to their seventh win of the season, the Gym Dogs had
several high spots for the year:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gym Dogs opened the meet with their highest score on the
year in vault with a 49.5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Senior Sam Muhleman, competing in vault for the first time in
her career, hit a 9.82.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sophomore Kristy Lichey scored a career high on the bars with
a 9.8. She then moved to a career high on the beam with a 9.95
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of night for Georgia. The final totals were
Georgia 197.200 to Michigan's 196.375.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan senior Nikki Peters put the Wolverines in position to
compete with a 9.9 in vault, a 9.87 in bars and a 9.85 on floor
exercises. Junior Sarah Cain the also helped keep Michigan close
with a 9.95 in the beam and a 9.950 on floor exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gym Dogs had too much and showed it by trotting out
freshmen Talya Vexler, who scored a 9.75 on the beam, and Eileen
Diaz, who hit a 9.85 on the bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome out here,'' Vexler said. ``I tried not to worry
about the points or score but just to complete my routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia regained the top spot last Saturday by defeating rival
Alabama in Tuscaloosa. They didn't intend to lose it at home
against Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the floor exercises, we were probably a little
better tonight than we were against Alabama,'' said Georgia coach
Suzanne Yoculan.
</P>
<P>
   Yoculan said the Gym Dogs worked in seven new parts to their
routines _ the final adjustments of the year _ and now Georgia will
focus on refinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are where we want to be, right now,'' Yoculan said.
``Our goal tonight was One: win the meet; two: no let down (from
Alabama) and hit the 197 and three: put in our new skills. I think
we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the defending national champion Gym Dogs did show a weakness
and surprisingly, it was it a usual strength area _ floor
exercises. Karin Lichey, normally a show stealer, fell apart and
scored an 8.40. Unheard of for the senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' said Lichey. ``I just hope I got
it all out of me in this one meet. I did just fine in the vault and
beam. I felt comfortable. I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoculan said she was not totally surprised by the Lichey let
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it in practice and actually, Karin said this week
she felt better a month ago. But she's methodical. She works hard.
What she needs is a break and our team will have a week off on
spring brak March 6,'' Yoculan said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has now defeated the Wolverines seven consecutive
matches.

 &HT;    Roundabout trip ends with victory in hurdles for Torian
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ Winning the 60-meter hurdles at the Adidas D.C.
Invitational was easy for Reggie Torian. The real headache was just
getting into town.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that sounds like a flashback from the Atlanta
Olympics, a shuttle bus driver lost his way from Dulles
International Airport, and it took Torian more than five hours to
reach his hotel here. What should have been a half-hour trip
included a side trip to Baltimore, where a frustrated Torian
abandoned the bus and hailed a cab _ costing him $75.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (bus) driver is asking me for directions,'' said Torian,
able to laugh about it Friday night. ``I'm from Chicago, and I
don't know my way around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Torian, a former wide receiver at Wisconsin, is fast figuring
out the hurdles _ winning his third indoor race in a row over last
year's No. 1-ranked hurdler, Mark Crear, at the George Mason
University Fieldhouse. Torian, the defending national indoor
champion, won in 7.45 seconds to Crear's runner-up time of 7.57.
</P>
<P>
   In the final tune-up before the USA Indoor Track and Field
Championships next weekend in Atlanta, Torian and women's hurdler
Melissa Morrison were among several top medal contenders turning in
strong performances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Tech grad David Krummenacker, the defending NCAA
indoor 800 meter champ, made a late decision to step up to the mile
here and finished second to Matt Holthaus in 4 minutes, 1.07
seconds. Krummenacker ran near the back of the pack most of the
race and made his move just before the bell lap.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to change events was based on a desire to compete
in the longer distance next weekend in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a debate over whether I could get a waiver into the
mile at the championships, so I just decided to run a qualifying
time here and get it over,'' Krummenacker said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defending indoor and outdoor national champ Mark Everett won
easily over a strong field in the 800, though he's elected not to
run at next week's championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this since 1987, and people shouldn't be
surprised,'' he said. ``I'm not going to lose to an American. I'm
not going to lose this year, period.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta resident Tisha Waller continued her dominance in the
women's high jump, winning her third straight event on the indoor
circuit with a clearance of 6-feet-4 1/4. The defending indoor
champion made three solid, though unsuccessful attempts at a
meet-record 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inger Miller remained undefeated in the women's 60 meters this
indoor season, while Jon Drummond took the men's in his season-best
6.50 seconds, setting the stage for a race against training partner
Maurice Greene that could possibly produce a world record next
weekend in the Georgia Dome.

REFORM PROCESS COULD CHANGE ENTIRE IOC STRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a century, the International Olympic Committee has
existed as an exclusive club, answering only to itself, making its
own rules, choosing its own members, operating in an insular
climate that its critics and supporters alike admit lacked openness
and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   But now that a fifth of its members has been implicated in the
Salt Lake City scandal, and with drug scandals further eroding
confidence in the integrity of many international sporting events,
the Olympic committee is facing tremendous pressure, from within as
well as without, to reform itself. Having successfully turned the
Olympics into a lucrative business marketed on the idea of sports
as a kind of universal good, there is an urgency to limit the
damage and recover the luster and earning power the Olympics has
come to take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, no shortage of skeptics who wonder whether the
IOC, because of its diverse makeup and tradition of unchecked
autonomy, is capable of significantly altering itself and its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for instance, in its latest attempt to set
serious drug policies, the committee failed badly, proving unable
to gain uniform support among international sports federations for
applying penalties to athletes who use performance-enhancing
substances. In that episode, during which government and sports
officials from round the world castigated the leadership of the
IOC, even Juan Antonio Samaranch, the committee's president, was
rebuffed in his attempt to head an agency that would oversee
worldwide anti-doping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And so on March 17 and 18, the dates of the IOC's next full
meeting, the Olympic movement may face yet one more watershed
moment. The committee will attempt to ratify the expulsion of at
least five members for their roles in the Salt Lake City scandal,
and perhaps many more. The committee will also seek to reform the
process by which cities bid for the Winter and Summer Games. Such
steps, though, may be only the beginning of a process that could
eventually change the entire structure of an organization entrusted
with organizing what it likes to portray as the world's purist form
of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be reform throughout,'' said Michael Payne,
the IOC's marketing director. ``I'm convinced the IOC is going to
come out a lot stronger. It may be a very different organization
coming into the new millennium. It's going to be a painful year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no questioning the stakes involved in the March meeting
in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public, sports people and the corporate sector are waiting
to see if the IOC is serious about cleaning its house,'' said Tomas
Sithole, IOCan Olympic committee member from Zimbabwe. ``If they
see the IOC is serious, they will continue to support us. If not,
there is going to be serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting last week in New York with Payne and Richard Pound,
an Olympic committee IOC vice president from Montreal who headed
the investigation of the Salt Lake City scandal, corporate sponsors
were firm in their demands for reform and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for thorough reform at the highest levels,
expulsion of members, important changes in the bidding process and
controls, specifically financial disclosure consistent with any
organization that is responsible for billions of dollars in
revenue,'' said Debra Gottheimer, a spokeswoman for IBM, an Olympic
sponsor. ``We think they understand what the concerns are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With reform appearing inevitable, there has been considerable
speculation in recent weeks about what the dimensions of that
change might be, and if the ouster or resignation of Samaranch was
a possibility. But every call for Samaranch's removal has been
balanced by a worry about whether the organization could withstand
such a degree of upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's great strength, his critics even concede, has been
building consensus among the more than 100 delegates who make up
the committee. Samaranch may be the only one who can force through
real reform, IOC Olympic committee officials believe. If he
resigned now, vicious infighting could follow among those jockeying
to be his replacement, and the winner would then need time to build
his or her own base of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to have a presidential election now, it would be
suicidal,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has insisted he will finish his term, which expires in
2001. But senior IOC officials believe that he may leave earlier.
Samaranch wants his legacy to include reform and not be dominated
by the smell of scandal. He has proposed, on an experimental basis,
not allowing IOC members to visit bid cities, and restricting the
voting to a handful of members on which cities play host to the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once all that is in place and there is relative calm,'' Pound
said, ``my guess is that he would want to sit back and say: `Is
this the best time for me to think about leaving? Should I stay for
another year or to the end of my term?' I think the jury is out on
what he might do and which is a better alternative for the IOC''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Samaranch's plan for limiting the number of
international committee delegates who can vote on which cities play
host to the Games has run into a roadblock. Mario Pescante, a
member from Italy, complained that this restriction amounted to an
admission that none of the IOC members could be trusted. A
compromise would have a small electoral college narrow the field to
two candidate cities the day before the vote, or the day of the
vote, and would allow the entire membership to select the winning
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do has to be fireproof,'' said Craig Reedie, an
Olympic committee IOC member from the United Kingdom. ``If this
method is fireproof, I can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any real reform cannot take place unless the IOC assembly
ratifies a decision by its executive board to expel five members
who were ousted in January for their part in the Salt Lake City
scandal. Several others have resigned, 3 remain under investigation
and 10 more were implicated in a report issued last week by a Salt
Lake City ethics panel. Some of the ousted members, including
Jean-Claude Ganga, the delegate from the Congo Republic who has
been accused of receiving more than $250,000 in payments from the
Salt Lake City bid committee, have said they will not go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch has done a good job, but now he wants to sacrifice
his friends,'' Ganga said. ``This is dangerous for him. It is war
now.''
</P>
<P>
   If the expulsions are not ratified by the full IOC assembly,
Pound and James Easton of the United States have said that they
would consider resigning as delegates. Already, one member, Crown
Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to the throne of the Netherlands, has
suspended his membership pending the outcome of the March meeting.
He has not been linked to the scandal in any way, but the Dutch
royal family has expressed concern that his reputation may be
sullied by being associated with the Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who don't need this for a feeling of self-worth are
the ones you need most,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, a corporate sponsor that has
halted negotiations with NBC for $20 million in Olympic
advertising, has expressed concern about the aggressiveness of the
IOC's investigation into other cities bidding on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not doing what any corporation with that kind of
revenue and reputation at stake would do,'' said David
D'Alessandro, the president of John Hancock, noting that the
investigation amounted to sending out letters asking for
incriminating information. ``They're too busy trying to cover their
tracks, too busy trying to make it all go away. They're trying to
give everybody a sleeping pill in hopes that they'll wake up and
forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of additional reform proposals have been made: restrict
delegates to term limits instead of an age limit of 80 years old;
elect delegates by national Olympic committees and international
sports federations rather than by Samaranch's appointment, and
forbid IOC members from also serving as presidents of their
national Olympic committees. Officials who investigated the Salt
Lake City corruption said cities seeking the Games should not be
allowed to give support to national Olympic committees during the
bid process, which was the guise used for a number of payments to
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know you are there 8 or 12 years, it's easier to follow
the principles of the Olympic charter,'' said Gerhard Heiberg, an
IOC Olympic committee delegate from Norway who favors term limits.
``If you sit there 30 years, you may be tempted to benefit a little
too much from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reedie, the IOC member from the United Kingdom, supported
wide-ranging alterations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole structure and governance will have to be
looked at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing question raised by the scandal is whether the IOC
is necessary at all to put on a worldwide sporting event. Soccer's
world governing body, FIFA, puts on its World Cup every four years
and dwarfs the Olympics in terms of television audience for the
monthlong event. Figure skating, the most popular Winter Olympic
sport, holds an independent world championship every year. Track
and field, the most important summer Olympic sport, holds a
separate world championship every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Ted Turner has been organizing the Goodwill Games,
an international event held every four years that rivals the
Olympics in terms of competition, if not drama and name
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system seems very fragile at this point,'' said Harvey
Schiller, the president of Turner Sports and a past executive
director of the United States Olympic Committee. ``If the IOC
doesn't make the right corrections, those federations that can
sustain themselves may try to mimic what FIFA does with the World
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   However, for women's sports, where there are few professional
leagues, and in many men's sports outside of soccer, the Olympics
remain the pinnacle of athletic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pass an Olympic medal around a classroom, it creates
a drama that's not there for a medal from the world
championships,'' said Lynn Jennings of the United States, who won a
bronze medal in the women's 10,000-meter run at the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shorter, the 1972 Olympic marathon champion, said that a
confluence of events from the Tour de France drug scandal to the
Salt Lake City corruption scandal has awakened an urgent need for
reform, leaving him more optimistic than he has felt in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC used to have total discretion to do what it wanted,''
Shorter said. ``Now they don't have total discretion anymore.
They're going to have to adjust to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller, who won a gold medal for the United States in the
women's 4x100-meter relay at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta,
said she believed that fans made a clear distinction between
Olympic scandal and Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the general public really even knows or cares''
about the Salt Lake City scandal, Miller said. ``They want to see
the athletes do what they do. I don't think it will affect
viewers.''

GOVERNOR URGES BLACK CLERGY TO TRUST INQUIRY ON TROOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI  
(DW) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and top state
prosecutors met with leaders of an influential council of black
minister's Friday to assure them that the attorney general's office
will throughly investigate charges that the state police unfairly
single out black motorists on the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   But after an hourlong, closed-door discussion with Attorney
General Peter G. Verniero, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, chairman
of the Black Ministers Council, said he would be ``astounded'' if
the state's review does not confirm that state troopers routinely
pull over motorists based solely on their race. Jackson also
renewed his call for the dismissal of the superintendent of the
state police, Col. Carl A. Williams, and said he believed it is
imperative that the U.S. Justice Department continue its own
investigation, which has been under way since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stand in Macy's window at high noon and say that the
Justice Department needs to investigate the New Jersey State
Police,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The state police have long been accused of using racial
profiling in deciding whether certain motorists should be stopped.
But the issue became a source of increased controversy last April,
after troopers shot 11 times at four unarmed minority men who had
been pulled over on their way to a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Whitman said Friday that she went to the meeting with the
black ministers to demonstrate that she will not tolerate
profiling. Some civil rights leaders have said they do not trust
Verniero's office to carry out a thorough inquiry, because the
attorney general is defending the state police in an appeal of a
1996 court ruling that found evidence of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitman said that the state investigation will be led by
Paul Zoubek, a first assistant attorney general who as a Justice
Department official led several police corruption inquiries. She
said she is confident the state's own assessment of the force will
be thorough and unflinching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day that government can't police itself will be a scary
day in this state,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced this week that its civil rights
division has been conducting a ``pattern and practice''
investigation of the racial complaints against troopers since 1996.
If the civil rights division finds evidence of discriminatory
practices, they can file a federal lawsuit and ask a judge to order
the force to reform.

NISSAN NOTES: KELLY GETS SOME REPAYMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry Kelly, the former high school hockey star
who says he loves Riviera even though he has never made the cut
there, got a little hug back from the Pacific Palisades course on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's 7-iron tee shot to the 156-yard par-3 sixth hole was
rewarded with a hole-in-one and, ultimately, his first Nissan Open
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   He got to 3-under par for the day with the ace, parred out to
complete a second-round 69 and wound up 5-under 136 at the halfway
mark. It was enough to make his first Nissan cut by five strokes.
Only cut survivors are paid in PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gone but not forgotten: This week's Nissan Open is without
two of its most-familiar faces. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist
Jim Murray, who died at 78 in August, was remembered with a name
card and empty chair at a front-row media-room table.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Everett also was remembered. The man who had hand-penned the
media-room scoreboard as long as any tournament official could
remember died in December at 92.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been his 50th year,'' said PGA Tour director
of information Dave Lancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to come up and watch him,'' Bob Lowe said of the
Nissan's star calligrapher. Lowe replaced Everett on the scoreboard
this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Home sweet home: Former Cal State Northridge golfer Bob Burns
is just six shots off the lead, but the best part of his Nissan
Open could be that he gets to stay with his parents in Granada
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who has lived in Knoxville, Tenn., since 1994, has been
especially grateful that he could stay at home because he has
battled a cold since Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be home and have all the amenities,'' Burns said.
``My parents have the medicine cabinet stocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit is Burns has plenty of friends and family
offering support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of people following me. They're rooting me
on,'' Burns said. ``It's not that distracting. It'd be terrible not
to have anybody following you.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Attendance update: After two days, the crowds at Riviera
Country Club are besting last year's numbers at Valencia Country
Club. Friday's attendance of 24,319 outdrew the 19,383 who showed
up for the second round at Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 37,971 spectators the first two days at Riviera.
There were 30,863 at Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turning it around: Brad Fabel made the biggest turnaround in
the second round, improving from a tie for 103rd to a tie for
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 2-over 73 on Thursday, Fabel bounced back with
a 4-under 64 on Friday. He is four strokes behind the leader at
137.
</P>
<P>
   He credits his round to going back to a simple approach after
trying to work on his mechanics the day before. He also pointed to
improvement on the back nine, where he went from a 40 on Thursday
to a 31 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday I hit the ball terrible,'' he said. ``I haven't been
playing, period. I've been out there, but I wasn't playing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: Nick Price was the last player in the
tournament to record a bogey, going 24 holes without one before
bogeying No. 7 on Friday. . . . Tiger Woods made the cut _ the 23rd
straight event in which he's done that. It's the longest streak on
the PGA Tour. Fred Funk ended his streak of making the cut at 18.
He shot a second-round 75 to finish at 145. . . . The 77 players to
advance to today's third round are the most to make the 72-hole cut
on the tour this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Second-round leader: A Texan at the top of the leaderboard
might not be surprising, but it is when he's Bob Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Estes put together a solid 67 on Friday for a two-round total of
133 to break out to a one-stroke lead at the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   While fellow Texan David Duval fell out of the lead, Estes
emerged as the tournament's leader at the halfway point with his
four-birdie, no-bogey round.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a second that Estes is comfortable at the top,
considering there's a pack of four golfers lurking at 134, three at
136 and Duval and Tiger Woods, among others, at 137.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be leading after 54 holes and it wouldn't matter
because we all still remember what David did,'' said Estes in
reference to Duval's final-round 59 to win the Bob Hop Chrysler
Classic last month.
</P>
<P>
   __ Advantage Woods: While David Duval lost his grip on the lead
when he shot ``only'' par 71 on Friday, Tiger Woods recorded a 68
to create a tie between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 golfers at 137.
</P>
<P>
   While their names are linked on the leaderboard, the two won't
be linked on the links. Woods and Duval are not paired together for
today's round. Oh well, maybe on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hacker of the day: On Friday the sun came out, the scores
went down and the golf was good.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ed Fiori.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five golfers posted scores of par or better, although
Fiori wasn't one of them. He shot 81 _ the only golfer in the
tournament to go over 80 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, we feel it necessary to mention that Fiori is
playing the 1999 season on special medical extension because of
back problems that limited him to three tournaments last year. It
is also necessary to mention that Fiori's nickname is ``The Grip''
because of his unusually strong grip on the club.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``It used to be the (high school) golf team
was the guys who weren't going to make the football team. Now,
every kid wants to play golf. If I came out now, I probably
wouldn't make it. __ Davis Love II.

SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FROM COUNTY FOR FAILING TO REVOKE GUN PERMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine, for a second, that the police know about a
licensed gun owner who has been cited for belligerent behavior.
Then one day, his pistol is used by a relative in a murder.
</P>
<P>
   The gun owner, in all likelihood, is going to be sued. But
should the local government be liable, too, because it knew about
his past but failed to revoke his permit?
</P>
<P>
   This is the crux of a lawsuit now moving through U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, involving a murder in the Westchester County
village of Dobbs Ferry in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The killer, an off-duty New York City police officer, used a gun
licensed to his father, who had been the subject of at least two
dozen complaints to the local police by people who said he had
harassed and threatened them. And now, the victim's family is suing
the village for failing to take preventive action.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes at a time when many people are looking for
ways to expand liability for the use of guns beyond the individuals
who fire them and toward those who make them, distribute them and
regulate their use.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a Brooklyn jury found nine gun manufacturers
liable for shootings with illegally obtained handguns, saying the
companies' had negligent marketing and distribution practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dobbs Ferry case also presents a novel argument that
some lawyers say could set a precedent for determining where
government responsibility becomes government liability _ not just
with guns, but with all sorts of licensing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fairly bold theory, and a difficult, but
important case,'' said David Leebron, the dean of Columbia Law
School and a specialist in the field of tort litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although courts have generally been loath to hold governments
responsible for the indirect consequences of their policies,
Leebron said, ``the lesson of the tobacco litigation is that even
claims that don't look legally sound can, for a variety of reasons,
prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of the outcome of this case, he said, it seems
likely that more people will ``use the tort system as a way to
address the problems raised by guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is quite clear about how people qualify for a gun
permit. Before 1989 in Westchester, for instance, it was the duty
of the local police department to investigate an applicant's
background. Since 1989, the county has taken over the checks,
presenting its findings to a county judge, who makes the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The law is not as clear, though, about revoking a permit; the
most common circumstances prompting revocation, the law says,
include the improper use of a firearm or an arrest. In Westchester,
perhaps fewer than 100 gun permits are revoked a year, said Alan D.
Scheinkman, the Westchester County attorney.
</P>
<P>
   There is no methodical review of gun permits; the county is not
even sure how many valid gun permits exist. But in general, the
County attorney's office is supposed to collect information about
arrests or complaints pertinent to permit holders, and in the more
serious cases, ask a county judge to revoke the permit.
</P>
<P>
   In Dobbs Ferry, the gun owner involved in the lawsuit, Richard
B. DiGuglielmo, received his gun permit in 1972. In 1986, he was
arrested on third-degree assault and harassment charges after
scuffling with someone who had parked in front of his business, the
Venice Deli, without patronizing the store. The case was eventually
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, more than two dozen other people filed
police complaints against DiGuglielmo, saying he had threatened,
harassed or assaulted them for parking in the wrong spot. Countless
others also tangled with DiGuglielmo over the parking spot,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, Charles Campbell, 37, a sanitation worker and
youth counselor, was fatally shot by DiGuglielmo's son, Richard D.
DiGuglielmo, in a fight over a parking spot outside the store.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, the son was convicted of murder and sentenced to
20 years to life in prison; his father was acquitted of assault
charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Westchester officials revoked the father's permit
for all six of his guns, saying he had displayed ``a pattern of
aggressive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell's brother, Bill, said that action came too late.
``They should have done more beforehand,'' said Campbell, an
insurance broker who is now the guardian of his brother's only son.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Campbell family's lawyers filed a federal civil
rights lawsuit against the DiGuglielmos and, among others, New York
City and its Police Department, saying the city had trained the
younger DiGuglielmo to shoot to kill. Then, after unearthing more
information about his father's record, the lawyers filed an amended
complaint in December 1998 against the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not suggesting that every time a city licenses a gun
permit, whenever a gun is misused, the city is liable,'' said
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, a lawyer for the Campbell family and a
professor of law at Pace University School of Law. ``But when there
is a known danger, and the city is indifferent to that danger, then
the city should be liable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles G. Fiore, a lawyer for the DiGuglielmos, said that he
did not want to comment on current litigation. But government
lawyers argued that the Campbells' case, while intellectually
intriguing, rested on shaky legal theory.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the local authorities appeared to have followed
the proper procedures, so it was uncertain whether they even had a
duty to take preventive action, said Kevin J. Plunkett, whose firm,
Plunkett &AMP; Jaffe, represents the village.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinkman, the lawyer for the county, which was a defendant in
the original lawsuit in 1997, also expressed concern that the
lawsuit, if successful, could spur much litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about potential liability way beyond any
reasonable bounds, and saddling an agency with a task that it
couldn't manage,'' said Scheinkman, who has filed a motion that
would remove the county as a defendant from the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, municipalities have recently been on the defensive,
fending off lawsuits seeking to hold government bodies responsible
for the actions of individuals, said Juan Otero of the National
League of Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankel Rosenbaum case is one example. In that case, which
New York City settled out of court for $1.1 million, the city was
sued for failing to protect Hasidic residents from a rioting crowd
in Crown Heights, thereby contributing to Rosenbaum's death.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, municipalities have been wary of potential
lawsuits stemming from the year 2000 computer problem, Otero said.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have generally been reluctant to hold government
bodies liable for anything other than deliberate, active
wrongdoing, said Karen M. Blum, an expert on federal civil rights
law and a professor of law at Suffolk Law School in Boston. So the
odds are, the plaintiffs in the Dobbs Ferry case may do well to
force legislative, not legal, action on the issue of gun permits,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But given the unexpected outcomes of recent cases, Campbell's
lawyers like their chances. ``We are certainly charting new waters
here,'' Scott-McLaughlin said. ``But if the tobacco companies can
be held accountable, and the gun manufacturers can be brought
before the bar of justice, then I don't see why we can let cities
off when they put guns in the hands of a known violent person.''

ROUND-THE-WORLD SAILORS FEELING VULNERABLE IN TREACHEROUS WATERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is as if the nine solo yachtsmen still competing
in the Around Alone race are sailing on broken glass these days.
Jolted by the accident that took the boat, and almost the life, of
Isabelle Autisser on Monday, those still competing in the
round-the-world competition are feeling a touch more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area full of ghosts, and I will be happy to get out
of it,'' Jean-Pierre Mouligne, a French sailor said in an interview
by e-mail Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Add to his concern a dose of trepidation over a storm that began
to blast the 40- to 60-foot sailboats Friday. The gale, predicted
for a week, was sending 45-knot winds across the 2,500-mile stretch
of South Pacific Ocean where the Around Alone sailboats were
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in a full gale,'' Mouligne said, ``with triple-reefed
mainsail and a little bit of jib. I am going 14 knots, and it's
downright scary.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference about ghosts comes because two years ago, Gerry
Roufs, a Canadian solo sailor in a French nonstop competition,
disappeared during a storm in that same area of southern ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isabelle's accident, of course, is making me even more
careful,'' Mouligne said. ``I think that our boats are totally
safe, but in strong reaching conditions, they are closer to sailing
a multihull than a monohull.'' Mouligne was referring to the
typically wilder ride that a sailor on a multihull experiences.
</P>
<P>
   It took a night of searching before Giovanni Soldini, aboard
Fila, found Autissier holed up in her overturned yacht. Together
now, on one boat, they were about 500 miles astern of Marc
Thiercelin of France, the leader Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thiercelin was close to Cape Horn at the tip of South America.
Once the boats round it, they head north out of the treacherous
Screaming Fifties into the relative calm up to Punta del Este,
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier is forbidden by race rules to help Soldini, who is
still a bona fide competitor. ``You sleep better, you have someone
to talk to,'' Soldini told race officials Friday. ``But after
rescuing Isabelle, I figure I've pretty much won this race.
Anything else ultimately isn't very important.'' &QL;

TEXAS BOXER GETS HIS FIGHTING CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Six months ago, Paulie Ayala fought for a
world bantamweight title in front of 18,000 fans in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Fort Worth boxer will be thousands of miles and
thousands of fans removed from the highlight of his young career
when he takes on David Gutierrez-Vazquez (13-4-2, eight knockouts)
in the main event of a seven-bout card at John Justin Arena.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Ayala (26-1, 12 KOs) finds himself on the long
road back to another title shot. But since losing a six-round
technical decision to World Boxing Council champion Joichiro
Tatsuyoshi in August in Yokohama, Ayala is convinced he can get to
the top no matter how many thousands of miles he must endure in and
out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm good to go, just waiting to get my title fight,'' he said.
``I shook \Rthe loss\S off easy. ... But now, I don't see anyone
beating me.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss against Tatsuyoshi was bad enough for Ayala (26-1, 12
KOs), but things got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Tatsuyoshi lost his title in his next defense to Thai challenger
Veeraphol Sahaprom. Sahaprom became the WBC champion, and Ayala
consequently dropped to being the WBC's fourth-ranked bantamweight,
behind Tatsuyoshi.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of his defeat, Ayala, 28, returned to the gym to
train. He kept busy by easily disposing of Ivan Salazar with a
fourth-round knockout in his most recent bout, Nov. 14 in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala has been sparring with San Antonio's John Michael Johnson,
rated the No. 1 super bantamweight by the World Boxing Association
and the WBC's No. 6 bantamweight, to sharpen his skills in case he
gets a title shot sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, he waits patiently.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my job,'' Ayala said. ``It depends on my promoters
to get me an opportunity to fight for a world title. It's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   The job belongs to Top Rank Inc., his promotional team, and his
management team at Boxing Management Inc. They say the wheels are
now in motion, but the time frame for his next title shot is vague
and could not be narrowed down to anything more specific than
``sometime within the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all of the different champions, but it has
to be the right place at the right time,'' said Todd Deboef of Top
Rank. ``Of course, the loss to Tatusoyshi was not ideal, but we
have to sweep that under the rug. We have to find the right person
and make it happen. It is my job to deliver and give him the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala and his camp are counting on it, but they're not waiting
for a high-profile opponent to fall in their lap. BMI is pursuing a
match with WBA champion Johnny Tapia. Tapia is scheduled for a bout
in April, but no opponent has been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our name in the hat. We want that fight badly,'' said
Rick Yuill of BMI. ``Paulie is at the point where he needs a
defining fight in front of a large audience, and Tapia would do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another option for Ayala is challenging the WBC's top-rated
bantamweight, Adan Vargas, in a bout for the opportunity to fight
the champion. Such a bout might be an unnecessary gamble for
Vargas, but could happen if the right purse is offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paulie's camp will not show any reluctance to fight anyone,''
Fort Worth matchmaker Wayne Harrison said. ``Challenging Vargas is
a very makable fight, but somebody will have to step up with some
major money for him to take that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Mendez, Ayala's co-trainer, said they will do whatever it
takes for another title shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fight anybody,'' Mendez said. ``We'll even fight twice a
night if we have to if that's what it takes.''

WETTELAND WORKS OUT AT FULL STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Manager Johnny Oates described closer
John Wetteland ``very impressive'' after the Rangers' first
scheduled workout for pitchers and catchers yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland underwent arthroscopic surgery Oct. 27 to remove a
bone spur and one loose body from his right elbow, but the
32-year-old right-hander participated in every drill without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through the full workout, but that doesn't surprise
me,'' Oates said. ``He's not the type of guy who babies anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will monitor their relief ace closely this spring
and may reduce his work to ensure his availability for Opening Day.
Oates gave Wetteland the option to reduce his work yesterday, but
the pitcher declined the offer despite an undershirt drenched from
top to bottom with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows you how much he puts into it,'' Oates said.
RODRIGUEZ ABSENT
</P>
<P>
   Oates appeared annoyed that catcher Ivan Rodriguez was absent
from yesterday's first scheduled workout for pitchers and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez remains in Puerto Rico, and the Rangers do not know
when their seven-time All-Star will report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be here,'' Oates said, ``and I would hope that he'll be
here soon.''
</P>
<P>
   So does ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez will be featured with ESPN anchor Dan Patrick for a TV
commercial supporting ``ESPN Magazine.'' ESPN plans to begin
filming next weekend.
SMOKELESS ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will not provide smokeless tobacco products for
their players or opponents this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will not prevent their players from possessing or
using the products, but clubhouse attendants will not be permitted
to purchase the products, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be a party to them killing themselves,'' said Zack
Minasian, the Rangers' clubhouse and equipment manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox follow similar
guidelines.
EARLY BIRD
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Lee Stevens participated in the workout even
though infielders and outfielders need not report until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too early to start, and I need the work,'' said
Stevens, who reported to camp early the previous two seasons as
well. ``Plus, I couldn't sit at home while they're here. I would
feel guilty.''

   NEW YORK _ This has been some week for the Valentin family. It
began with Valentine's Day, which always has extra meaning for this
Bronx clan, whose very name is a reminder of the affection that
they share every day. It ends Saturday with the 22nd birthday of
their youngest son, Derek, a young man who would probably be
telling them about his plans for graduating from college and
starting a career.
</P>
<P>
   But he will not.
</P>
<P>
   Derek died on Aug. 8, 1994, killed with his friend Keith Simmons
during a fight over a girl. They had arrived on the corner of
Allerton and Barnes avenues full of adrenaline, but their hands
empty.
</P>
<P>
   One of their teen-age rivals held a $50 gun. Another shouted,
``Buck 'em! Buck 'em!'' The last words Derek heard became the
prologue for the dark mood that claimed his family.
</P>
<P>
   February is now a cruel month for Derek's parents, Al and
Nellie. The holidays they used to celebrate at home now include a
trip to Derek's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Making it more difficult this year, Ash Wednesday fell smack in
the middle of this week. That day, the Valentins went to church,
where a Roman Catholic priest smudged an ash cross on their
foreheads while intoning the words, ``Remember, man, you are dust
and to dust you will return.''
</P>
<P>
   They need no reminder of this, since so much of their old life
vanished when Derek died. Their active social life with friends and
family gave way to support group meetings with parents of other
murdered children.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in a relentless, and successful, quest to see his
son's killer convicted, Al closed his real estate business for two
years so he could attend every single court date. He ran through
his savings and into serious debt to pay for lawyers and private
investigators for the case, counselors for his family and college
tuition for his son Michael and his daughter Vanessa (both of whom
had to postpone graduation by at least a year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks about what happens to us and how difficult it is
to get up and survive,'' said Nellie, who is helping Al reopen his
real estate business. ``It took my husband three years to get back
on his feet. We suffered dearly. Starting all over affected us
financially, emotionally and socially.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valentins talked about their predicament not because they
were looking for money or sympathy. They had a chance to join the
relatives of murder victims in a lawsuit against gun manufacturers,
but they were so busy with the trial of their son's killer that
they missed the filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lawsuit was decided last week in U.S. Court in Brooklyn,
where several manufacturers were held liable, although they were
ordered to pay damages only to the family of the lone surviving
victim. That is why Valentin is talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun companies made money on the bullet and the gun,'' he
said. ``Somebody else lost a son. They go through hardship paying
for funerals. Families are destroyed. And somebody tells them
that's not worth anything? I boiled. When you love somebody so
much, it's not the money, it's the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife don't think anyone can put a dollar value on a
human life. But they agree with the lawsuit's contention that the
gun companies have profited by oversupplying guns to states with
weak laws. Those weapons, in turn, are used in crimes in cities
with tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies know it, but they don't care,'' Nellie said.
``But it shouldn't be just about making money. This is about
accountability. Somebody has to be accountable when these guns get
into young hands. We're not at war. Why do we need so many guns?''
</P>
<P>
   The only accounting the Valentins will get this year is their
own, as they tally the toll taken by their lingering loss.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Al's business is slowly recovering, even though he had
to give up prime office space on Castle Hill Avenue after his eight
salesmen left when business dried up. Their daughter Vanessa
graduated from college, while their son Michael will get his degree
in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Al and Nellie will join some relatives Saturday and go over to
St. Raymond's Cemetery, where red and silver Valentine's Day
balloons still decorate Derek's headstone. They'll talk to him and
pray for him. Each word brings them closer to Derek and the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painful to go there, but since I have no other choice, I
go,'' Nellie said. ``Instead of sending him birthday cards and
talking about his college graduation I have to go to the cemetery
with flowers, balloons and cards and cry my heart out.''

PAYCHECKS AT MORGAN STANLEY INCREASE FOR TOP EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weathering last year's financial storm better than many
rivals, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's &UR;  &LR; top executives will take home
more money this year than last, but the Wall Street firm's profits
grew even faster than their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief
executive, earned $31 million in salary, stock and stock options
last year, about 7.6 percent more than he took home in 1997. John
J. Mack, the president and chief operating officer, was paid just
shy of $17 million, an increase of 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That puts them among the best-compensated corporate executives.
But the increase was roughly half Morgan Stanley's profit growth of
15 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, a leading compensation expert and shareholder
activist, said Purcell was ``grossly overpaid.'' But he said that
growth in the Morgan Stanley leaders' pay was modest relative to
the company's stock performance. The stock price has comfortably
outpaced the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index in each of the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that you can deliver good performance like they
have, I don't think you will see shareholders begrudging them their
pay,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, the largest Wall Street firm as measured by
capital, avoided the worst of the downturn in financial markets in
August and September that pounded earnings at several rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase for the Morgan Stanley bosses was lower than
that of Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chairman and chief executive of
Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's fourth-largest firm by capital. With
stock options factored in, Fuld earned $13.3 million last year, a
gain of 18 percent over 1997. Lehman's profits grew 14 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are based on proxy statements filed by the
securities firms this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley is shifting compensation more in the direction of
stock, and especially stock options. Cash earnings were cut this
year. The proportion of compensation paid in equity instead of cash
rose to 47 percent, from 32 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell, 55, and Mack, 54, have jointly run Morgan Stanley since
it merged with the retail brokerage firm Dean Witter almost two
years ago. They took home identical cash and stock bonuses last
year, including $775,000 in base salary, $8.11 million in cash
bonus and $4.44 million in restricted stock. But Purcell received
783,507 stock options valued at $17.7 million compared with 149,645
stock options valued at $3.56 million for Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options confer the right to purchase stock at specified
prices at some time in the future and can expire worthless if the
company's stock price slumps.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan Stanley's stock price has soared after hitting a
recent low in October. It closed at $93 Friday, up 68.75 cents, not
far off its all-time high of $97.875 last July.  &QL;

SANDAY TRIPS OVER FINE LINE, MISSES CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is not much difference between playing well
and playing poorly on the PGA Tour, which Jeff Sanday discovered
the hard way in Friday's second round of the Nissan Open at Riviera
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The South Pasadena resident and Cal State Northridge graduate
struggled to a 2-over-par 73 for a two-round total of 2-over 144
and missed the cut by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Sanday, who salvaged an even-par 71 in Thursday's round with
birdies on two of his last three holes, did not have the same good
fortune Friday and was 1-over on his last eight holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough out here,'' he said. ``You have to do everything
well . . . you have to be very efficient. It's a fine line between
playing good and playing bad. The difference between missing the
cut and making the cut is not a whole lot. One thought, one swing,
that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the difference between making the cut and winning, or
getting to the top, is a big gap. There's a big difference between
me and Nick Price. Nick Price could eat me for lunch . . . at this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm working on trying to get better. Maybe one day I'll be
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanday drove the ball well off the tee Friday (he missed just
three fairways), but his iron play left him only a few good birdie
opportunities. It also left him in precarious positions, especially
on the par-3, 156-yard sixth hole made famous for a bunker in the
center of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Sanday tried to hit an easy 7-iron but came over the top and
left it on the back left portion of the putting surface. The only
problem was the pin was front right, and the bunker was directly in
Sanday's line. He chipped over the bunker, but his effort came to
rest about 20 feet below the hole. He barely missed his attempt to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   His caddy, Joe Citro, said he would have preferred Sanday putt
it instead of lob it over the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have gotten it just as close for his third
shot,'' he said. ``I wish he would have putted it. It would have
been neat to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a split decision, 50-50,'' Sanday said. ``If I putted
around the bunker, I didn't know if it would have enough speed to
get down there. Plus, I thought it would go too far on the other
side of the green. I was actually trying to just pick it off with
my wedge and hit it just over the bunker. I just hit it too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanday said he had a great time playing before family and
friends _ ``even friends I didn't know I had,'' he joked _ but
plans to put in plenty of practice and perhaps take a few lessons
in trying to sharpen his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been playing all that great this year,'' he said.
``The rounds I have played, I've either been putting very well or
getting up and down a lot. My short game is in great shape right
now because I've had the practice of doing so. That's good, but I
need to hit it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing is not where I'd like it to be. I don't trust it,
that's the big thing.''

AFL-CIO FOCUSES ON COMPANIES THAT RESIST UNION ORGANIZING 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ In his three years as president of the
AFL-CIO, John Sweeney has repeatedly given a stark message to the
labor federation's 70 unions: organize or die.
</P>
<P>
   With union membership plunging to 14 percent of the work force
today from 35 percent in 1955, Sweeney has warned that unless
unions attract millions of new members, labor's influence in
bargaining and politics will continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Many unions have begun taking Sweeney's warnings to heart, and
as a result, the discussion at the AFL-CIO's executive council
meeting here often this week focused on how to woo more workers to
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the talk was nearly comical: There was a debate about
whether union organizers who visit workers at their homes should be
barred from wearing tongue rings. To the dismay of some of its hip
organizers in California, the Service Employees International Union
has decided to prohibit them, concluding that such rings would
alienate potential members.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the discussion was serious. One important strategy
that emerged was to ask politicians, community leaders and
clergymen to bring their moral and political weight to bear on
companies that resist unionization drives. Sweeney made clear that
organized labor would also make a big push to unionize three groups
of workers viewed as especially ripe for labor's message: low-wage
workers, minority workers and female workers. One of labor's
selling points is that unionized workers earn 34 percent more on
average than nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said the best welfare program is a job, but lots
of people who have jobs are earning the minimum wage and they still
need welfare or food stamps,'' said Kirk Adams, the federation's
organizing director. ``We're saying the best welfare program is a
union job.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is also mounting a nationwide campaign to publicize
labor's view that American companies are systematically trampling
on the right of workers to form unions. In speech after speech,
union leaders complained that companies illegally threaten to close
operations if workers vote to join a union and illegally fire
thousands of workers each year merely because they support
unionization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers are constantly faced with harassment, intimidation,
firings and threats of firings,'' said Arlene Holt, director of the
AFL-CIO's campaign to defend the right to organize. ``The
environment is not conducive to workers who want to freely form and
join unions. We want to change that, and we intend to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO not only plans to argue that the right to organize
is a fundamental right, but it also hopes to turn the campaign to
protect the right to join a union into a civil rights crusade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, the AFL-CIO held a forum at which it sought to
test-drive many of these ideas, among them that the right to join a
union free of intimidation is a civil-rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, which was attended by more than 200 workers,
several workers described the roadblocks and harassment they face
in trying to form a union. Their efforts were endorsed by a panel
of community leaders, including Bishop Thomas Wenski of the
archdiocese of Miami and two members of Congress from Miami, Carrie
Meek, a Democrat, and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the community engaged in your struggle,''
John Due, widely viewed as Miami's foremost civil-rights leader,
told the forum. ``We might have to get arrested to protect the
right to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the forum, labor leaders said, was to stress that
civic leaders should fight for unions because when workers unionize
it often helps communities by raising living standards and helping
foster a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   After unions did little organizing for two decades, recruitment
efforts are picking up. But Sweeney said far more needs to be done.
The United Steelworkers of America has budgeted $40 million, far
more than ever before, to organize workers, while the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees has approved
$35 million for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The service employees union is engaged in the largest organizing
drive in 60 years: About 80,000 home-health-care aides in Los
Angeles County are voting this month on whether to unionize. The
Association of Flight Attendants is seeking to recruit nearly
15,000 attendants at Delta Air Lines while the International
Association of Machinists is organizing 12,000 limousine drivers in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of union
members rose by 100,000 last year, reversing several years of
losses, but that the percentage of workers in unions continued to
decline. Unions, however, reported that they recruited 475,000
members through organizing efforts. The difference is explained
largely by the many union members who lost their jobs when their
plants closed or downsized.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Chamber of Commerce president Thomas Donohue, who was in
Florida to become the first chamber president to speak at an
AFL-CIO executive council meeting, said unions were blaming
companies for their own problems in attracting members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that no company is breaking the law,'' Donohue
said. ``There are probably 20 million companies in America, and my
experience is companies are tending to live within the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who received heavy applause when he
spoke to the executive council Friday morning, was far more
supportive. Thursday, the federation announced that it would wait
at least until August before endorsing a presidential candidate for
2000. It urged individual unions to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very deeply in the right to organize,'' Gore said at
a news conference. ``The decisions by some employers, thankfully a
minority, to use tricky loopholes to frustrate and ultimately deny
workers from joining a union is unfair, and it must stop.''

KINGS HIT ROAD FOR CRUCIAL STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Step one as the Kings try to get back in the
playoff race was Thursday night's 3-2 victory over Edmonton, the
team that holds the final postseason spot in the NHL's Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part _ a six-game trip _ and if Friday's
travel woes were an omen, the Kings are already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' charter flight to Calgary took off on time Friday
afternoon, but after 20 minutes a warning light came on and the
plane returned to Los Angeles. The team switched planes and took
off again late in the afternoon, about three hours behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this unpromising note that the Kings' longest trip of
the season began. Starting tonight against the Flames, also
fighting for the last playoff spot, the Kings (21-31-4) begin a
stretch that will be key to their season.
</P>
<P>
   Three things could happen:
</P>
<P>
   __ They could completely fall out of the postseason picture,
leaving them with 20 games on the schedule to start thinking about
next year.
</P>
<P>
   __ They could continue to hang around, as they are now, not
really in the race but not really out of it, either.
</P>
<P>
   __ Or they could somehow use games at Calgary, St. Louis,
Detroit, Chicago, Dallas and at the Pond against the Mighty Ducks
to pull themselves into the thick of the race.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Kings coach Larry Robinson sounded as if he'd
settle for the realistic hopes provided by the second option, then
count on his team to make its major playoff push on the seven-game
home stand to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know our record against Dallas, Detroit,'' Robinson
said. ``If we can beat those teams, then it would be like bonus
points, and right now we need some bonus points.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury updates: Winger Vladimir Tsyplakov, who has played in
every game this season, suffered a sprained medial collateral
ligament in his left knee against Edmonton and is sidelined on a
week-to-week basis. Tsyplakov is not on the trip with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Glen Murray, sidelined with a knee injury since Jan. 2,
is on the trip, and his availability to play against the Flames is
considered a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big night for Boucher: During a recent 21-game stretch, Kings
defenseman Philippe Boucher was a healthy scratch 20 times and
during that time there were reports he wanted to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, Boucher had a hand in every Kings goal,
picking up a pair of assists and a goal, his first this season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the time on the bench might have been good for
Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you sit,'' Robinson said, ``maybe you
realize what you were doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Motivational speaker: Kings general manager Dave Taylor
addressed the team Thursday morning and they beat the Oilers that
night for their most important victory to this point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the team prided itself on being a team that was
hard to play against,'' Taylor said. `I challenge them to say they
can't give any more. I think every one of them can give more
effort, a little smarter play and make us a better team.''
