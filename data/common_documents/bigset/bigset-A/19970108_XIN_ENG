<HEADLINE> Retired French Troops Help Zaire Recruit Mercenaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Scores of retired French military
men have helped Zaire recruit mercenaries to drive the Tutsi
rebels out of eastern Zaire, the daily, Le Monde, said today.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200-300 former French soldiers recruited
mercenaries from Belgium, Britain and France as well as Angola,
Mozambique and South Africa, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry immediately denied any official
involvement in the affair.
</P>
<P>
``Even if some were former French soldiers, of course we would
have no control over them, and one could in no way infer that
there is a link with French policy in the region,'' a defense
ministry spokesman told Agence France Presse (AFP) today.
</P>
<P>
France denied on Monday an accusation by Zairean rebel leader
Laurent-Desire Kaliba that 1,000 French troops and South African
and Angolan mercenaries are in the Zairean city of Kisangani, 500
kilometers west of Goma, to help prepare a counter-offensive by
the Zairean government troops.
</P>
<P>
The local daily, Liberation, said today that France was now in
an awkward situation over Africa after the rebel accusation and
the assault on Sunday by French troops on rebels of the Central
African Republic.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Origins of Breast Cancer Studied in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South African medical
researchers have launched a joint program to study the genetic
origins of breast cancer, according to a cancer expert.
</P>
<P>
About one in 10 women develop breast cancer and of these,
between five and 15 percent of the cases are familial, women
inherit a predisposition to the disease, said Professor Peter
Beighton, Head of the Department of Human Genetics at the
University of Cape Town's Medical School.
</P>
<P>
Beighton said at least three moderately common genes
predispose to breast cancer, and others were being identified.
</P>
<P>
"The three major genes account for about 30 to 40 percent of
familial breast cancer. So many women who get breast cancer have
a genetic component to their condition," said the Professor.
</P>
<P>
Beighton's department had already set up a program with
Associate Professor David Dent of the Department of Surgery of
the School to study the problem, said a source.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, researchers would identify families most
probably carrying the gene responsible for breast cancer. They
would then take blood samples from the relevant families for
further analysis.
</P>
<P>
Researchers would extract DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) from the
samples, which they would test for faulty genes.
</P>
<P>
Beighton said, however, the study would be a major project
that would grow over time, given the numbers of women involved.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that women carrying the relevant faulty genes
had a high chance of developing breast cancer, but they formed a
small minority of the total population.

JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
approved a grant of about 3.1 million US Dollars to Lesotho for
the construction of development projects in the land-locked
kingdom, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pako Petlane, head of the Lesotho National Development
Corporation (LNDC), said in Lesotho's capital Maseru that the
World Bank loan will be used to continue the construction of
factory buildings and infrastructure at three industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
Petlane said the factory buildings on Maseru West, Thetsane
and the Nyenye are part of a plan to attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"The advance factory shells are established to shorten the
investment cycle to ensure that potential investors do not worry
about long delays in the construction of factory buildings," he
added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Declined in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Factory orders in the U.S.
slipped by 0.4 percent in November, the first time in three
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for both durable and nondurable
goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 320.5 billion dollars in the
month, down from 321.9 billion in October.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the first since the factory orders declined by 2.1
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The report said that durable goods orders fell by 1.5 percent
in November but the orders were down by only 0.7 percent excluding
the often-volatile transportation orders.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods such as food and clothing rose by
0.8 percent, just half of the 1.6 percent advance in October.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft slipped
by 1.9 percent, nearly erasing a 2 percent gain a month earlier.
These orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand and
modernize. They have been a major source of economic strength
during the current expansion in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased by 0.4 percent, the
sixth increase in seven months, suggesting that businesses may
increase production facilities and manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, were up by 0.9
percent, the fifth straight advance.
</P>
<P>
Inventories rose 0.4 percent, also the fifth consecutive
advance.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's
manufacturing strength. Continued declines could result in
decreased production and fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although factory orders fell in November, a closely watched
survey of purchasing managers indicated manufacturing had bounced
back in December to the highest level since June.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa May Ban Mercenaries Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (xinhua) -- South Africa may ban
mercenaries training as parliament is to debate a new law to this
effect.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law is likely to cripple operations of the
Executive Outcomes, a South African private company which
provides mercenary services to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
The company's Chief Executive Eben Barlow said here today that
his firm will ask the Constitutional Court to debate on the
fairness of the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied his company will close down because of the
expected legislation.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the company will shut down business in
South Africa and open new offices in Britain, Germany and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Mercenaries from the company have fought alongside government
troops in Angola, Sierra Leone and a few other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila claimed yesterday
mercenaries from the Executive Outcomes are in Zaire for a likely
counter-offensive against anti-government forces in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is opposing the company's
mercenary services to foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Wins 42 Pct of World Aircraft Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Airbus Industry announced on
Monday that it won 42 percent of world aircraft orders in 1996 and
planned to increase production over the next two years, the
Financial Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The four-nation European consortium said that it won 326 firm
orders worth 23.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, more than three
times as many as the 106 it received in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Airbus said that if it added orders which were subject
to letters of intent and memoranda of understanding, the total
number rose to 498.
</P>
<P>
On this basis, Airbus said it had won 42 percent of all orders
last year for aircraft with more than 100 seats, adding that 366
of the 498 orders were for single aisle family of aircraft, the
A319, A320 and A321.
</P>
<P>
Airbus delivered 126 aircraft last year, generating a turnover
of 8.8 billion dollars. Although the delivery was two more than
the number of 1995, turnover dropped from 1995 level of 9.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Airbus officials explained that this was because it had
delivered a higher proportion of large aircraft in 1995 than last
year.
</P>
<P>
Airbus deliveries are expected to rise by 45 percent to 183
aircraft in 1997 and the total number of deliveries would reach
200 in 1998, with production rates increasing accordingly.

<HEADLINE> UK People Have to Make Choice between "Smiles And Tears", </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that the electorate have to make a choice between
"smiles and tears" in the coming election.
</P>
<P>
Major made the remarks in the first of a series of the U.S
presidential-style news conferences designed to bolster morale of
his party.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who are trying to win the fifth election in
a row, are now over 20 points behind the aggressive Labor Party in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Major used today's press conference, which is regarded as an
early shot in the new year election campaign, to stress three
issues he wants to focus on -- the economy, Europe and
constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
"The economic outlook is extremely bright. It would be very
foolish indeed were that to be thrown away," the Prime Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a choice economically between smiles and tears. I hope
and believe when the election comes that people will choose the
smiles and avoid the tears."
</P>
<P>
On European affairs, Major delivered a rebuke to anti-European
Conservatives who have hampered his efforts to boost the Party's
morale, saying there was no reason for Britain to quit the
European union.
</P>
<P>
He refused to bow to the "Eurosceptics" in his party who want a
new, hard line on EU intergration, saying: "I don't believe when
you examine the implications of leaving the European Union that
there is any remotely plausible case to be made for leaving...."
</P>
<P>
Referring to constitutional reform, Major said the
Conservatives were not opposed to the reform. But he accused Labor
and Liberal Democrat Party of proposing "foolhardy" and "extremely
damaging" changes simply for the sake of being different.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Opposition parties are discussing
sweeping changes to Britain's constitution, including a bill of
rights, parliaments for Scotland and Wales and possibly even the
adoption of proportional representation.

<HEADLINE> Killers of Jordanian Driver Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi authorities Tuesday
announced the arrest of two gangsters who killed a Jordanian
driver in Iraq, the Iraqi news agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The authorities claimed Tuesday that the killers were arrested
the same day the murder happened on November 11.
</P>
<P>
After the murder, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry urged Iraq to
bear all the responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The two murderers, identified as Zibbin Battah Hayech
al-Roweili, born in Saudi Arabia in 1970, and Nasr Hantour
al-Bashir, a Jordanian of 33, confessed themselves to be guilty.
</P>
<P>
They said a third gang member named Tarrad al-Halaby, a Syrian
national, was also involved in the killing.
</P>
<P>
The three followed the Jordanian driver Omar Ahmed Ali Al-Sobh,
who was working in the Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad, and shot him
to death at a gas station 160 kilometers away from Baghdad on the
Baghdad-Amman highway.
</P>
<P>
Roweili and Bashir stole the Jordanian Embassy car and drove it
into Syria and set it on fire, the INA report said.
</P>
<P>
The criminal gang illegally made its way into Iraq through
Jordan. The members were engaged in smuggling of drugs, especially
hashish which they bring from Turkey to Syria, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities concerned have asked Syria and Jordan
through the interpol, to hand over Tarrad al-Halaby to Iraq for
trial.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Youth Crashes Car Into Market, One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian teenager today
crashed a car into a busy Jerusalem market, killing one people and
wounding six others. Police are investigating if it is an accident
or terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Palestinian boy drove the car from a main
street onto the sidewalk and then crashed into a crowded bake shop
in the bustling Mahane Yehuda free market.
</P>
<P>
One of the injured was in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Police said the boy, who was employed by a vegetable vendor in
the market, did not have a driving license. The shocked boy was
detained by police immediately and he claimed that he lost control
of the car.
</P>
<P>
Fearing this could be a terrorist act, police are questioning
the boy's employer, who owns the car, to determine whether the key
to the car was given by him or stolen by the Palestinian
boy. Several Palestinian workers in the market were also under
investigation by the police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been on high alert against
possible revenge attacks following the last Wednesday's terrorist
shooting in a central Hebron market by an Israeli soldier
who wounded six Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> HCHR: 5460 Recent Returnees under Detention in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 5460 people who have
recently returned to Rwanda are being held under detention through
the country, according to a press release issued here today by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR).
</P>
<P>
The press release is based on a report from the Human Rights
Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) on Monday, the HCHR says.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the returnees from northeastern Tanzania were
originally from Kibungo and Mutara prefectures in Rwanda near the
border between the two countries. 2243 returnees are under
detention in Kibungo prefecture while 676 are being held in Mutara
prefecture, says the HRFOR report, claiming that "local
authorities in some communes in Kibungo have responded to the
large number of arrests by releasing detainees accused of common
crimes".
</P>
<P>
According to the HRFOR, 310 members of the former Rwandese
Armed Forces have been registered in Kibungo. Registration figures
for Mutara are still being compiled.
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests in Kibungo and Mutara in the first weeks
of the return is significantly higher than than recorded during
the return to northern prefectures of refugees from camps in Zaire
in mid November, when only 162 returnees were detained after two
weeks, the HRFOR says.
</P>
<P>
Two major explanations for the differences noted by the HRFOR
are:
</P>
<P>
--More people were killed during the genocide in Kibungo than
in the northern prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri;
</P>
<P>
--Unlike the camps in Zaire, where organizers of the genocide
were reportedly able to take advantage of war conditions to
escape, many organizers of the genocide sheltering in Tanzania
were unable to flee and were compelled to return to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"HRFOR is particularly concerned with the level of tension
between the local population and recently-arrived returnees in
Kibungo," says the HRFOR, adding that it has been receiving
reports of ill-treatment in communal detention centers and during
interrogations, as well as of illegal arrest procedures.
</P>
<P>
In another report on Monday, the HRFOR says that it is
satisfied with the first genocide trials in Kibungo, Kigali and
Byumba in Rwanda from December 27, 1996 to January 3, 1997.
However, it says that it is concerned over "several aspects of the
proceedings in Kibungo, in particular the lack of respect for the
right to a defense as guaranteed by Rwanda's justice system and by
the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights", to
which Rwanda is a party.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Pessimistic About Ross' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials have
voiced pessimism about whether U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross could
conclude a Hebron deal, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report was in sharp contrast with the newly emerging
optimism about signing the Hebron deal after the Sunday secret
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross is continuing his intensive mediation today shuttling
between Jeruslaem and Gaza in efforts to finalize the
long-delayed Hebron deal. After holding talks with Netanyahu
early today, Ross traveled to Gaza to meet with Arafat in order to
bridge the remaining gap.
</P>
<P>
State-run Israel Radio quoted one senior Palestinian official
as saying that the PNA was pessimistic about the success of Ross'
current mediation because he had so far rejected the Palestinian
demand on further Israeli redeployments.
</P>
<P>
He added that Ross was expected to remain here for only
another one or two days before returning home.
</P>
<P>
The real negotiations on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron
have already been concluded, and the last obstacle blocking the
signing of a deal centered on the timetable for further Israeli
troop pullbacks from rural areas of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is demanding the U.S. to guarantee in
written form of the timetable for Israeli troop redeployments in
the West Bank following the Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu only promised to complete further troop
pullbacks by 1999, the PNA insists on Israel's accurate
implementation of the Oslo accords which demand the completion of
the process by September this year.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly proposing a compromise between the two
dates in order to clear the last obstacle. Some analysts said that
Netanyahu is seeking delay of further pullbacks in order to retain
more territorial cards pending the upcoming final-status talks
with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has already voiced his complaints about Ross' bias
toward Israel, saying he would prefer European envoy Miguel Angel
Moratinos to replace him in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian
talks.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Rocks Military Bus, Killing One in Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- An army bus conveying soldiers to
work was hit by an explosion this morning at the foot of a bridge
in Lagos, killing one person and injuring several others.
</P>
<P>
According to a police source here, the bus was hit by the
explosion, believed to be a blast of a time-bomb or a bomb with
remote control, at 7:00 AM (8:00 GMT) this morning as it was
ascending the bridge.
</P>
<P>
A soldier has been confirmed dead at the spot and the number
of the injured, who were rushed to a nearby military hospital, is
yet to be ascertained.
</P>
<P>
A report from the News Agency of Nigeria said the glasses on
the left side and the rear windscreen of the bus were shattered
and there was a big hole on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The blast also affected a nearby clinic and a sports equipment
company.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted eyewitnesses as saying that a car belonging
to a bank was damaged as the driver rammed into the bus after the
blast.
</P>
<P>
The number of soldiers in the bus is also unknown but
eyewitnesses said it was full, adding that such bus usually has a
capacity for 42 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Security men have cordoned off the scene and police bomb
experts are in search for clues, the police source said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third bomb explosion targeted at military
personnel in this biggest commerce center of Nigeria in three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The first bomb exploded on December 16 morning near the
location of the Lagos state government, and destroyed a car in
the convoy of State Administrator Colonel Muhammed Marwa, leaving
three persons seriously injured. The administrator escaped
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, another bomb exploded when a bus carrying
soldiers of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Task force
to work passed by. Twelve passengers were injured.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of the two previous bomb blasts is still
underway.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, the former chief security man of the
international airport in Lagos was also killed with his nephew
when a bomb in his car exploded.
</P>
<P>
The man was later proved to work for an anti-government
organization. He was killed by the time-bomb he assembled
himself.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Criticizes U.S. Attitude Toward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today strongly rejected
the United States' accusation of an arms deal between Cyprus and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not react in a similar fashion when Turkey vastly
upgraded its occupation troops on the Cyprus Island, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Turkish occupation troops are armed
with U.S.-made and NATO weapons in contravention to U.S. law and
NATO principles.
</P>
<P>
"Such weapons are meant to be used against possible NATO
enemies. Cyprus is certainly not one of them," the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's criticism came following a U.S. statement
protesting the Cypriot government for signing of an agreement last
Saturday on buying S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The United States regrets this step," and "we believe this
will complicate efforts to achieve a lasting peace in Cyprus," the
U.S. statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the deal "makes any mediation effort that much
more difficult and harms the political atmosphere," and "the
action of the government of Cyprus is a step down the wrong path."
</P>
<P>
Dismissing such accusations, which also came from some other
countries, Cassoulides said "We consider that boosting our defense
will facilitate the peace process because we see that Turkish
intransigence and arrogance stems from its military superiority
due to the presence of the Turkish occupation troops in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the missiles will not be used "unless it
(Cyprus) is attacked."
</P>
<P>
"No reasonable man would believe that Cyprus will use its
armed forces, the National Guard, to launch an offensive. I would
also like to assure the Turkish Cypriots that they are in no
danger at all," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus does not want to cancel the missile contract, he
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the Russian-made missiles, with a
range of 150 kilometers, will be deployed to protect naval and
air bases under construction on the west coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The bases are being built under a joint defense pact between
Cyprus and Greece, agreed in November 1993 to face possible
Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at adds over this
East Mediterranean strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island would mean war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> France to Keep Continuity of Foreign Policy in 1997: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that France will keep the continuity of its
foreign policy in 1997, which is focused around European
construction and expanding France's influence around the world.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to more than 100 Paris-based French and foreign
journalists at the French Foreign Ministry, de Charette said that
France wishes to base the organization of a new international
community on multipolarism and the principles of multilateralism.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that France would pursue its work, increase its
influence, demonstrate its ambition which will be above all
centered around the belief that the property for all the world,
the security of our fellow citizens, and the development of Europe
depend on the efforts we make on all of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that France also wishes to reinforce its
presence and that of Europe in other parts around the world, where
he said France has "a role (to play), the connections and very
great responsibility as well as great interests."
</P>
<P>
He said that France regards a strong economy as an important
aspect for the success of its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
While describing the diplomacy of France in 1996 as "one
strong and brilliant year," he admitted that France met with
difficulties in the Middle East peace process, in a number of
African countries, and in the succession of former U.N. secretary
general Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

<HEADLINE> Winter Sale Season Begins in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The winter sale season in Greece
began today around the country earlier than usual due to a number
of supermarkets and department stores jumping the gun and cutting
prices on goods immediately after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The sales will run through February 28.
</P>
<P>
A merchants' representative said retail turnover in December
was down by 15-25 percent, an added incentive to begin the
seasonal sales early.
</P>
<P>
There was a marked increase in shopping traffic in downtown
Athens today as shoppers competed for bargains in clothing and
footwear. The clothing sector has marked the biggest discounts --
up to 60 percent -- while footwear discounts are in the region of
25-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The consumers' institute (Inka) however advised shoppers not to
fall victim to misleading advertising and buy cheap imitations
brand-name products.

<HEADLINE> European Car-makers Gain in U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- European automakers made great
strides back to the U.S. market in 1996, while General Motors
continued to retreat, according to statistics revealed by auto
makers these days.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and import auto makers sold 15.1 million vehicles in 1996,
up 1.9 percent from 1995, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Companies like Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Volkswagen have kept
reasonable prices to the taste of younger buyers. As a result,
European auto sales in the U.S. market climbed 13 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
But in December, car and truck sales fell 4 percent on the U.S.
market, led by General Motors, whose sales plunged 14 percent in
the month. Japanese car makers also suffered decreased sales in
December.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, which dominated the industry decades ago, saw
its market share slip another 1.5 percentage points last year to
31.1 percent, lowest since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
But Ford Motor Co. posted a strong increase of 11 percent in
December, thanks largely to heavy retail incentives.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., which set sales records nearly every month in
1996, reported a modest 1 percent increase in light-vehicle sales
in December.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes to Improve Relations with Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Acting Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah AL-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah has voiced hope that relations between Kuwait
and Libya would be boosted in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased with an unannounced visit by Juma
Fazani, Secretary of Arab Unity in Libya, Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Fazani paid a two-day visit to Kuwait and conveyed Monday a
message to Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad AL-Sabah from
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He also held talks with Sheikh
Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti acting prime minister expressed hope that officials
of the two Arab countries would hold regular meetings "until we
reach joint understanding to tackle any misunderstanding and boost
these relations in the future."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides discussed issues of common concern, adding
that their talks also dealt with "certain conditions in the Arab
region and their effects on inter-Arab relations," but he did not
specify.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Libyan envoy came after a period of
restrained relations caused by Tripoli's support for the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi's reported remarks that Kuwait should be a part of
Iraq or Saudi Arabia because it is unable to defend itself further
strained the already-cold ties between the two countries. The
Libyan leader made the remarks while he was giving a lecture in
Egypt's Cairo University last year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Libyan official declared his country's backing
for Kuwait's independence and sovereignty and deplored the Iraqi
invasion of the emirate, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
"This Libyan stand has remained a clear principle expressed
by Commander of the Revolution Muammar Gaddafi on several
occasions," he was quoted by KUNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the visit by the Libyan official
was part of Kuwait's efforts to improve relations with a
number of Arab countries which stood by Iraq or expressed support
for it during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan envoy arrived in Kuwait Sunday and left late Monday.

LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Most of the three major stock
markets in Europe ended a lack-luster session weaker, depressed by
Wall Street's losses and worries about interest rates hike, with
Frankfurt the only market managing to close slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
Today's call from the Bank of England's deputy governor for

The FTSE 100 index on the London market finished 27.7 points
down at 4,078.8, with a downturn on Wall Street further dampening

German shares in Frankfurt finished a listless session
fractionally higher, with the DAX-30 index 4.81 points up at

<P>
Dealers said that German November industrial orders, in line
with expectations, were unable to inject any life into the market.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Closer toward "Fuel Cell" Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 auto
maker of the United States, said it has overcome the bottleneck
for producing a kind of "fuel cell" electric cars, 10 years closer
to reality, according to the report of the local press here.
</P>
<P>
The company said the electric car gets its power from hydrogen
which is extracted from gasoline. And the new car could be 50
percent more fuel-efficient than cars with conventional
internal-combustion engines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is quieter and emit much less harmful
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
A fuel cell produces electricity from a chemical reaction
between hydrogen and oxygen, using a platinum catalyst and an
on-board fuel processor which breaks down the gasoline into
hydrogen and water.
</P>
<P>
Last month, General Motors Corp. became the first big
automaker to roll out an electric car intended to generate
market demand. But the two-seater is powered by lead-acid
batteries, not by hydrogen.

<HEADLINE> Kok: Reform of EU "Key Challenge" Facing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands will, in the
upcoming six months as the presidency of the European Union(EU),
make sharp choices in order to ensure the successful future of the
Union.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok today at a joint
press conference with European Commission(EC) President Jacques
Santer, after a meeting between members of the European Commission
and of the Dutch Government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting program included bilateral discussions in
specific areas between ministers and EU commissioners of the
relevant departments and a plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mr. Kok called it the "key challenge"
for the Dutch presidency to reform the European Union, which will
make place for new members in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three most difficult issues before IGC were
flexibility, majority decision and institutional reforms and
solutions for these issue must be found.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kok stressed that, in a larger European Union, flexibility
was necessary in order to prevent one or more countries moving
more slowly and other countries working together, but he added
that flexibility "must not lead to fragmentation".
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Prime pointed out that the importance of the
enlargement of the European Union(EU) and the conclusion of the
Economic and Monetary Union(EMU) were dependent upon concluding
the Inter-Governmental Conference(IGC), which started last March
to review the Maastricht Treaty, on time successfully.
</P>
<P>
"In the months ahead, we will have to narrow the focus and take
decisions, above all inspired by political will," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for EU's foreign and security matters, Mr. Kok said EU
countries must enhance their action and together "for a single
voice".
</P>
<P>
He said the international political weight of the EU must be in
the line with the economic force of the Union.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the EU should get more involved in the
peace processes in the Middle East and the Balkan region, provide
fresh momentum for EU-US relations, develop partnership links with
Asian countries, and forge new relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
President Santer, for his part, expressed his hope that the
Dutch presidency would achieve "full success" which could be
expressed in "concrete terms".
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU summit in Dublin last month had taken
political decisions in the context of the completion of the EMU.
</P>
<P>
"Now these have to be couched in legal terms, and the important
decisions taken in Dublin must be implemented in resolutions to be
adopted by the Amsterdam summit in June," he said, adding that
"this important work has to be completed at the latest by the
Amsterdam summit".

<HEADLINE> Disarment Under Threat of Continuing Factional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The disarmament of faction
fighters in southeastern Liberia is under threat of continuing
factional clashes barely four weeks before the deadline for the
60,000 fighters to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Spokeswoman of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC),
Ruth Arteelah, made the remarks Monday in the LPC stronghold in
Zwedru, 290 kilometers east of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
She said that the disarmament "is in danger and may become a
failure in southeastern Liberian if factional skirmishes continue
in Monrovia."
</P>
<P>
Rival fighters from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia
(NPFL) have continued to attack LPC positions in Grand Gedeh and
Sinoe counties since a ceasefire agreement was signed in August
last year in the Nigerian capital Abuja, she said.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 civilians were killed and two LPC soldiers were
wounded along the Greenville-Zwedru Highway when rival NPFL
militia attacked their vehicle last week, she added.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman warned that if "nothing is done to stop the
attacks on LPC positions, the disarmament exercise may become a
failure."
</P>
<P>
However, NPFL denied the allegations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL) said in a statement on Monday that the Ceasefire
Violations Committee investigated 31 complaints of ceasefire
violations from September 1995 to March 1996, but it has not
released any of its findings.
</P>
<P>
Four other ceasefire violations, including the last September
massacre of at least 25 civilians in Sinje, 70 kilometers west of
Monrovia, were still under investigation, the UNOMIL said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Absorbs 40 Percent of Global Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East as a whole
absorbs about 40 percent of global arms exports with the Gulf
arms bazar being the richest and most complex in the world.
</P>
<P>
The six member states of the Gulf Cooperation council (GCC)
are the largest procurers, according to the latest issue of Gulf
Business published in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The monthly magazine said that the major reason for the active
buying is the need to protect the region's oil resources which are
the basis for the region's wealth and prosperity as well as the
engine that drives the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States is a key factor in the GCC's
defense strategy, adding that the special relationship between
the U.S. and the Gulf countries since the Gulf War has had
several major effects on the region's arms purchase.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have managed to remain the
principle source of weapons for the GCC, despite attempts by
other countries to breach this wall.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which stationed most of its troops and hardware in
Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War when it led the allied armed
forces to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation, has taken
the lion's share of new Saudi military contracts over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
Major allies of the Gulf War had until recently shared the
Kuwaiti purchases with the U.S. receiving air defense contracts,
the British rebuilding the army, and France re-equipping the
navy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, whose limited armed forces were nearly totally
devastated in the Gulf War, made a re-armament program worth 11.7
billion U.S. dollars until 2004.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the largest single arms buyer in the world
with a defense budget of 13.2 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Several billion U.S. dollars worth of weapons were reportedly
purchased by Qatar during the past several years.
</P>
<P>
The arms purchases of these countries include advanced main
battles tanks, aircrafts, missiles and other heavy equipment, the
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
It said that great potential of arms deals in the Middle
East, mainly the Gulf region, exists in the future.

NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said here today that "no single country or group of
countries should pursue their own narrow individual interests" in
the world affairs."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of Cyprus' House of
Representatives, Mugabe called for full respect of international
law, the equality of sovereign nations and their right to
participate as equal partners in the United Nations.

He noted conflicts between states are now less prevalent,
whereas intra-state ones are erupting and called on the U.N. to
act accordingly "by giving priority and resources to peace-making
and peace-keeping operations."

Mugabe said the Zimbabwe-Cyprus relations are excellent, adding
he and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides have explored more

<HEADLINE> China Urges Guatemala to Change Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun today urged Guatemala to observe the United Nations Charter
and relevant resolutions to clear the barriers to Sino-Guatemalan
cooperation in the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations
elaborated China's position when the Security Council held
consultations on Guatemala today, according to diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Before the government of Guatemala and the Unidad
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) signed the final peace
agreement on December 29, 1996, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the then UN
secretary-general, had recommended that the strength of the United
Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala
should be increased with 155 military observers and some medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China has always supported the peace process of
Guatemala. China voted in favor of the resolutions on Guatemala at
recent sessions of the General Assembly. China welcomed the final
peace agreement signed by the government of Guatemala and the URNG
and considered it necessary to send military observers to verify
the cease-fire in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
However, the actions of Guatemala in the UN have damaged the
basis of cooperation between China and Guatemala and created
barriers for China to support the draft resolution on sending
military observers to Guatemala. "It is up to Guatemala to clear
the barriers now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed, "World peace is inseparable. One cannot stress
peace and stability of one country or region without consideration
of peace and stability of another country or region. The
realization of the peace process of one country should not hurt
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country."

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is considering
whether to restore elephant-hunting, banned since 1990, so as to
effectively curb the mounting number of the big animals.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are suggesting to allow the murder of three or
four elephants every year in each of the elephant-concentrated
provinces such as northern Tete, Niassa and Zambezia, said an
official of the National Forest and Wild Life Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
Since the war ended in 1992 in the southern African country,
the number of elephants there has risen sharply to some 3,000,
said the official who refused to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Thus has caused a lot of troubles for local residents because
the elephants often wound people and destroy crops.
</P>
<P>
"The restricted restoration of elephant-hunting as a sporting
item will not heavily affect the existing of the animal," said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Currently an elephant can be sold at 40,000 U.S. Dollars on
international markets. Therefore, the hunting of elephants will
be conducive to improving local people's life, said Virgilio
Ferrao, the chief of the Tete province.

DAMASCUS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel is challenging Arab
states and the international community by pursuing an extremist
policy, Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi said here today.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the denunciation when attending a ceremony
held by the Executive Bureau of the Syrian Federation of Trade
Unions.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi said Israel is challenging the Arabs with violence and
threats, and by subjugating the inhabitants of the occupied Arab
territories to the severest forms of suppression.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi pointed out that by killing, detention, demolition of
homes, confiscation of lands, and denial of all previous accords
and pledges daily, Israel is disdaining United Nations
resolutions and international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Israel is determined not only to maintain its rejection of the
peace process, but to dynamite it altogether, and to escalate the
state of tension and concern in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian prime minister stressed that his country is keen on
the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace, and to
follow-up the peace talks in line with the land-for-peace
principle, as well as U.N. Resolution 425 on an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>

He vowed that Syria is determined not to relinquish one inch

<HEADLINE> France Geared Up to Commemorate Mitterrand's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- France is geared up to commemorate
Wednesday the first anniversary of the death of President Francois
Mitterrand, who remains a highly admired and mysterious figure in
the eyes of the French people.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac will place a bunch of flowers
Wednesday morning at the tomb of his predecessor in Jarnac, the
department of Charente in south-central France, to memorize the
former president, who died on January 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The widow of Mitterrand, Danielle Mitterrand, will plant an oak
tree Wednesday in Chateau-Chinon, the department of Nievre in
central France, where Mitterrand was mayor from 1959 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
Danielle also gave back last month to the state a small piece
of land she and her husband obtained under controversial
circumstances from the Regional Natural Park of Morvan in Nievre
in May 1995, which they once planned to take as their burial
place.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party of Lionel Jospin will organize
commemorative activities Wednesday throughout France to mark the
death of its former leader, while the Francois Mitterrand
Institute of Paris is calling on people to go to 9 Avenue Frederic
le Play of Paris, a house where the late president died, to place
a rose there.
</P>
<P>
The northern city of Lille will inaugurate Wednesday a statue
of Mitterrand at a square already named after him, while a plan to
change the name of a central square into that of Mitterrand has
aroused controversy in the southern city of Joue-les-Tours between
its socialist mayor and local rightwing deputies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French presidential office has denied a story
told by journalist Georges-Marc Benamou in his newly published
book "le Dernier Mitterrand (the Last Days of Mitterrand),"
according to which Mitterrand played a personal role to support
Jacques Chirac in succeeding him as president.
</P>
<P>
Benamou said that Mitterrand sent a personal envoy to Chirac,
who was then mayor of Paris, on November 1, 1994, asking the
latter to rapidly announce in a place outside Paris his
candidacy for the presidential election in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chirac announced three days later in Lille, a city loved by
General Charles de Gaulle, his plan to run for the presidential
seat.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's narrow measure of money
supply, M0, jumped 0.9 percent in December, following a rise of
0.8 percent in November and 0.7 percent in October and the
strongest rate for six months.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Monday by the Bank of England,
notes and coins in circulation, which account for the bulk of M0
with bankers' deposits making up the rest, rose 0.7 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
This took the annual growth in total M0 down to 7.1 percent
from 7.4 percent in November, largely because of a sharp rise in
M0 a year earlier. However, year-on-year growth of cash in
circulation remained stuck at 7.4 percent for the third month
running.
</P>
<P>
Although consumers only finance a small part of their spending
in cash, M0 has long been regarded by analysts as a guide to
retail sale trends.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth in M0 has now been above the government's
monitoring range of 0-4 percent for almost four years.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke will be under pressure from the Bank of England to
raise base rates at the monetary meeting next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They expected that borrowing costs will be increased either
this month or next to choke off the growth in consumer spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is ready to
discuss with banks and organizations concerned the possibilities
of setting up a fund for Jewish people who left assets in Swiss
banks during World War Two, said the Swiss federal council
(government) today in a declaration.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, 1996, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the Swiss
president during the war, rejected the demand for creating a
compensation fund of 250 million Swiss francs (about 200 million
U.S. dollars) for Jewish victims by Nazi Germany during World War
Two.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Swiss reporters, Delamuraz said that the
creation of a compensation fund is not a good idea, which could
make the investigation of the alleged Jewish assets in Swiss banks
more difficult. He dismissed the demand as "no less than ransom
and chantage."
</P>
<P>
During the past week, the declaration said, organizations like
the World Jewish Congress and the United States made statements
criticizing Delamuraz's speech.
</P>
<P>
Delivered after a conference of council members by telephone
this morning, the declaration is aimed to reaffirm the
government's position on the controversial compensation fund
clearly.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Swiss government has to wait for the results
of the investigation by an independent commission of experts
established at the end of last year, before taking any measures
like the creation of a compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it said, the government is ready to discuss
with banks and organizations concerned the possibilities of
setting up a fund in favor of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz, now Swiss foreign minister, today regretted again
that his frank words have hurt the feelings of the Nazi holocaust
victims and their families.

A statement is expected to be issued after the meeting, sources

The two countries have been locked in a dispute over possession

Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries have been trying to

Bahrain insists on Saudi mediation and wants Qatar to withdraw
its case from the International Court of Justice at the
Hague. Qatar says it will only accept mediation by the Saudis if
they come up with a plan acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The dispute caused the refusal of Bahrain to take part in the
six-member GCC summit in Doha, capital of Qatar, last month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will "seek to improve the atmosphere between the
two countries with the aim of settling the dispute regarding
sovereignty on the islands of Fisht Ai-Dihel and Hawar," a
diplomatic source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the file of the Qatar-Bahraini question said
that the one-day meeting is being held amid high hopes that
strains in Qatari-Bahraini relations would be removed, KUNA
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had charged two Qatari citizens with espionage but
later pardoned and released them while Doha returned to Manama an
aircraft aboard which a Bahraini officer defected to Qatar,
showing goodwill towards each other.

<P>
BAGHDAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and three
others injured when three mortar shells exploded in the center of
Baghdad at 10:30 p.m. (19:30 GMT) Tuesday, witnesses said today.
</P>
<P>
They said that the shells were fired from three mortars on a
camouflaged truck and landed on the Andrews Square.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred 200 meters away from the building of
Iraqi Irrigation Ministry and 250 meters from the office of the
Irani opposition Islamic Mujahad in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
No comments are available from the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here today, a spokesman of the Islamic
Mujahad said its office was the target of the attack, adding both
the mortars and shells were made in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian terrorists are responsible for the explosions, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the incident.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chirac Justifies Reprisal by Troops in C. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today sharply justified the reprisal by French troops who killed
mutinous soldiers in the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
Those who assassinated French soldiers could not expect France
not to react, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was reacting to a criticism made on Monday by Lionel
Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Jospin asked the government to let the French people know what
it intended to do before taking any action in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was surprised to note that some political leaders
suggested that France not react when its soldiers were
cold-bloodedly and publicly assassinated, said government
spokesman Alain Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Charles Million said today at a cabinet
meeting that the "trap" into which the French soldiers fell did
not make a war, but an assassination.
</P>
<P>
Two French officers, on a mediation mission and not bearing
arms, were ambushed and assassinated last Saturday in Bangui by
the mutinous soldiers, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, French soldiers killed a dozen rebels in a pre-dawn
assault on strongholds of the rebels, who have been holding part
of Bangui since mid-November last year and are seeking the ousting
of President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said today that the rebels were
still holding two sections of the city, the Kouanga district in
the southwest of Bangui and the Kasai military barracks in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
A senior French officer is taking part in negotiations with the
rebel chief, Captain Anicet Saulet. The negotiations began this
morning under the mediation of former head of state of Mali,
General Amadou Toumani Toure.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the defense ministry said that French troops
were not planning to oust the rebels from their last strongholds,
"because we are following a logic of mediation and negotiation."
</P>
<P>
Some 1,400 out a total of 2,000 French troops deployed in
Bangui are in the streets controlling the strategic points of the
city.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Foreign Minister to Visit South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda will visit South Korea on January 15 to meet his South
Korean counterpart, Yoo Chong-ha, on preparations for President
Kim Young-sam's forthcoming visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's visit, originally set on December 26-27 last year, was
then postponed indefinitely in the wake of the hostage crisis in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
President Kim is to pay a working visit to Japan's Kyushu
Island on January 25-26 in return for Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to South Korea's Cheju Island in June
last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Suh Dae-won said that during his
one-day visit, Ikeda would discuss with Yoo the agenda of the
South Korean-Japanese summit, and exchange views on ways to
coordinate policies of the two neighboring countries on the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Ikeda is expected to pay a courtesy call on President Kim to
discuss issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between Seoul and Tokyo have been
damaged by euphemistic remarks made by Japanese officials about
Japan's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and Japan's claim
to Tokto Island.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the peninsula as a colony from 1910 until its World
War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
On December 10 last year, Hashimoto said he would raise the
issue of Tokto (which the Japanese call Takeshima), during the
summit talks with Kim in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Seoul, However, has repeatedly warned that it will react firmly
to any attempt by Japan to claim sovereignty over the island,
where scores of South Korean policemen are stationed.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Tokyo territory dispute erupted in February last year
when Ikeda said Tokto was part of Japanese territory, triggering
anger from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it
would build a wharf on Tokto Island, an outcropping rock in the
East Sea (Sea of Japan) about midway between South Korea and
Japan. The islet has an area of 0.186 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Tung: PLC Winning More Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Executive
 designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said today that the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) is
winning support from more and more Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"More and more Hong Kong people have come to understand the
importance and necessity of the PLC, and increasingly more Hong
Kong people begin to support it," said Tung at a dinner reception
held by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association (CMA) this evening.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the PLC is critical to Hong Kong's handover
and it is legally well-founded, he said, adding that there should
not be any misunderstanding about this.
</P>
<P>
"I hope those who are against the PLC would understand that
everything we do should be in favor of the long-term interests of
the Hong Kong people. Harmony is very important," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the tasks ahead are quite challenging, and yet
he is very confident about the smooth transition and future of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"After recent talks with leaders of the country in Beijing, I
deeply feel that the central government is quite sincere and
determined in upholding the principles of 'one country two
systems', 'Hong Kong people running Hong Kong' and high-degree
autonomy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many top officials of the Hong Kong government attended the
reception, including Chief Secretary Anson Chan and Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group were also present.
</P>
<P>
CMA President Herbert Liang extended the Association's welcome
to Tung Chee-hwa for being elected the first HKSAR Chief
Executive.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Demands Abolition of UN Resolution 1070 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has demanded the
abolition of U.N. Security Council resolution 1070 which imposes
an air embargo on Sudan, local newspaper Akhbar Al Yom reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Sudanese Minister of Aviation al-Tigani Adam
al-Tahir as saying that Sudan would accept nothing short of
abolition of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister said despite the fact that postponing
the implementation of the resolution would appear at face value
in favor of Sudan, yet, the reality of the matter indicated that
the resolution had had a negative effect on air traffic in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1070 was adopted by U.N. Security Council on August
16, 1996, which calls for imposing an air embargo against Sudan
unless it handed over three suspects charged with the attempted
assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in
1995 for trial.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the resolution was postponed
for 30 days on November 23 due to a French-Russian request that
offers the U.N. Security Council an opportunity to assess the
consequence of the implementation of the resolution.

<P>
SEOUL, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The net inflow into South Korea of
foreign investments in stocks last year amounted to 4.45 billion
U.S. dollars, the Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
The amount is the second largest since the South Korean stock
market was opened to foreigners in January 1992. It is second only
to the 5.7 billion dollars record in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Funds brought into South Korea by foreigners last year for
stock investments totaled 12.4 billion dollars, while they
remitted 7.9 billion dollars back home upon selling stocks in the
country, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The largest portion of the net inflow of the funds came from
the United States with 2.48 billion dollars, followed by
Britain with 378 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of foreign funds for stock investments in South
Korea totaled 41.6 billion dollars from 1992 to 1996, and the

<HEADLINE> Nepali Cabinet Reshuffled to Reinstate Resigned Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba, in a move to stabilize his three-party government,
today reshuffled his cabinet, or the council of ministers, to
reinstate six resigned ministers and induct three new MPs.
</P>
<P>
Six MPs, five from the second largest ruling partner in the
coalition government -- the National Democratic Party (RPP) -- and
one from the third ruling partner -- the Nepal Goodwill Party
(NSP), who last month resigned from the cabinet and supported an
opposition-tabled censure motion against the government led by the
Nepali Congress (NC), were reappointed cabinet members in the
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The five RPP MPs Monday declared that they will support the
NC-led coalition government after the no-trust motion, tabled by
the main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML), was defeated in parliament two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The reasserted support by the five resigned ministers was
important for the Deuba government as it had been reduced into a
minority status in parliament after a House voting over the
no-trust motion.
</P>
<P>
A total of 101 MPs voted in favor and 84 MPs against the motion
in the voting held in the powerful lower house of parliament. The
motion required a majority of 103 votes to pass in the 205-seat
House, which currently has five vacant seats.
</P>
<P>
With the five RPP MPs' comeback to the ruling side, the Deuba
government will certainly regain majority support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
An NSP MP, who earlier resigned from the cabinet but was absent
from the house voting over the no-trust motion later, was also
reinstated today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deuba today added three new members including one
from a small leftist party into his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Bhatka Bahadur Rokaya of the Nepal Workers and Peasants' Party
(NWPP) was appointed State Minister for Land and Soil Conservation
because of his absence from the house voting over the no-trust
motion despite his party's support for the motion.
</P>
<P>
Two more cabinet members were appointed today, each from the
main ruling NC party and the RPP.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali coalition government was formed in September 1995
after the three-party alliance of the NC, the RPP and the NSP
overthrew a minority CPN-UML government through a no-trust motion.
</P>
<P>
After several reshuffles since its formation, Deuba's cabinet
so far has 47 members including 25 ministers, 13 state ministers
and 8 assistant ministers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Immigration
Department today said an average of 100 white South Africans are
applying to settle in Zimbabwe every month.
</P>
<P>
Principal Immigration Officer Elasto Mugwadi said last month
alone, 393 South Africans, including dependents, applied for
residence permits.
</P>
<P>
Mugwadi said a significant increase in South African
applications was noticed around 1992 when winds of political
change began blowing over that country.
</P>
<P>
''The economic situation in Zimbabwe still favors the white
community and that is why South Africans find it easier to come
and live here because they can still be in control,'' said a
senior government official.
</P>
<P>
He said for most of white South Africa's displaced workers,
the Zimbabwe job market was attractive since it was in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
A number of Zimbabwe's successful companies are either
transnational or white-owned, while the black majority is still
crowded in the small scale business sector.
</P>
<P>
''While some of the whites who are coming into the country are
returning residents, some of them are South Africans and they are
coming in large numbers,'' said Mugwadi.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Sector Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers today
said 1997 could pose a number of challenges for the industry in
the face of an unfavorable economic climate and an anticipated
increase in world production of the crop.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary in the latest issue of the Zimbabwe tobacco
magazine, Tobacco Association President Robert Webb said efforts
to increase the country's share of the world market would largely
depend on its ability to produce a quality crop that meets
international standards.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''while we should look forward with some confidence
to increasing our share of the world's market for quality
flue-cured tobacco, market forces will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
''Quality must remain the key as prices will inevitably come
back in response to increased production internationally,'' said
Webb.
</P>
<P>
He warned that while demand for the crop, Zimbabwe's largest
single foreign currency earner, was currently very high,
shortages are likely before the opening of the southern African
country's auction floors on April 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
He urged farmers should carefully monitor the supply and
demand situation on the world market before making any decisions
to increase their output for 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects to produce 235 million kilograms of
tobacco this year compared with 201 million kgs in 1995/96 which
earned the country about 600 million U.S. Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Governor Wen Shizhen of
Liaoning Province in northeast China pledged today that his
province will open wider to the outside world in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning plans to use 2.3 billion US dollars of overseas
investment and export 7.5 billion US dollars worth local products,
all 10 percent increases over last year, the governor said today
at a provincial conference to discuss the issue of opening-up
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liaoning also plans to earn more profit from the
contracting of overseas engineering projects and exports of labor
and technology.
</P>
<P>
While making better use of the traditional means of introducing
overseas investment, the province plans to try some new measures
to attract overseas funds, such as selling rights of management
and stock-holding as well as setting up overseas investment funds,
 Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of the major heavy industrial bases in China,
and now has 26,000 industrial enterprises, including over 1,400
that are large or medium-sized. Most of these firms are operating
with equipment and technology that pre-dates the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The province has selected 100 state-owned enterprises for
restructuring with overseas cooperation, according to the
governor.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Bickering May Jeopardize Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian parliament's row over
tax reforms and a 1997 budget may lead to a failure in adopting
the budget by the March deadline and could thus endanger a huge
foreign aid package.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Suslov, chairman of the Finance and Banking Committee of
the Supreme Soviet (the Ukrainian parliament), said on Tuesday
that the legislature's delay in approving the budget, which called
for cuts in social spending and for tax reductions, could invite
cutbacks in promised aid.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul of the tax system and the budget draft, which the
government submitted to the parliament in November in a bid to
tackle what it called the country's "massive tax evasion", could
not be enforced without 3.5 billion U.S. dollars of foreign aid
Ukraine expected to receive in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned not only that Ukraine is not going to receive
the entire promised sum, but also that it will still be unable to
overcome the crisis after receiving significant help," Suslov said.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which reduces government subsidies for war veterans
and the victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant blast, drew
fire from leftists in parliament, while education and research
spending cuts were opposed by nationalist parties.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also criticized the government's proposed sweeping
tax reforms, which would lower the average income tax rate from 42
percent to 34 percent while adding a two percent property tax on
individuals and corporations.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pinzenyk warned that
failure to approve the budget, which had been endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and 14 other donor
nations, could jeopardized some of the expected foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other international lenders had pushed for measures
by the Ukrainian government to stabilize the budget, threatening
to suspend loans if the country did not take strong steps to
reform its post-Soviet economy.

<HEADLINE> China Defends Sponsoring Bank System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The advantages of the sponsoring
bank system have begun to emerge after six months of trial
operation, an official from the People's Bank of China said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Positive results have been scored since the new system was
implemented on a trial basis as of July 1 last year," the central
bank official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The sponsoring bank system, popular in countries such as Japan,
Germany and the Republic of Korea, has covered the overwhelming
majority of China's most important state enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 300 key enterprises designated by the State Economic
and Trade Commission, 270 have signed agreements with banks, he
said, adding that most went with the Industrial and Commercial
Bank, China's largest.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the new system, through which a bank
signs an agreement with an enterprise to provide it with loans,
financial information and other services, is instrumental in
industrial restructuring and in optimizing the distribution of
bank credits.
</P>
<P>
He denied that it will result in a return to the past practice
of dividing the business scopes of the state-owned commercial
banks according to sectoral differences.
</P>
<P>
China's big four state banks used to target different
sectors. The Industrial and Commercial Bank was responsible for
extending loans to industrial and commercial entities, the
Agricultural Bank for agricultural projects, the Bank of China for
hard currency business, and the China Construction Bank for
capital constructions and real estate development.
</P>
<P>
"The sponsoring bank system will not force us to go back to
the old path," the official said. "Instead, it will stabilize the
relations between banks and enterprises."
</P>
<P>
China will continue to uphold the sponsoring bank system and
solve the problems springing up in practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I believe that as reforms in the enterprise and
banking systems deepen, the sponsoring bank system will produce a
more positive effect," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges Cuts in Import of Farm Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today ordered 16 provincial administrations to pay close attention
to the government's corn production program with the aim to reduce
the import of agricultural products starting this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken special measures in these 16 provinces,
including partnership schemes to meet the local demand for corn,"
the president said at the state palace after awarding a number of
groups and individuals who won the national agriculture
intensification competition.
</P>
<P>
He said food reliance is an absolute necessity for every
country.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, self-sufficiency in food should be realized, not
only in rice but also in fishery, animal husbandry and
horticulture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia claims it has achieved self-sufficiency in rice, a
staple food for most Indonesians, since 1984. However, it has
been importing the commodity since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Indonesia's
rice imports have increased almost 10-fold in the last five years,
soaring from 53 million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 514 million U.S.
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Agriculture Minister Sjarifuddin Baharsjah said
self-sufficiency in food remains the top priority in the 1997/98
fiscal year which will be achieved among other things through
increasing the cultivation area of hybrid maize.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the budget for the agricultural sector in the
1997/98 fiscal year amounted to 880 billion rupiah (about 376
million U.S. dollars, an increase of about 13 percent compared
with the last year's budget.

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan Wednesday resigned
as manager of English Premier League soccer club Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old has been manager of Newcastle for the last five
years, said he no longer wished to remain in football management
at this stage of his life.
</P>
<P>
Keegan told Newcastle's Clubcall telephone service: "It was my
decision and my decision alone. I offered my resignation at the
end of last season but was persuaded by the board to stay.
</P>
<P>
"I feel I have taken the club as far as I can and that it would
be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned."
</P>
<P>
Keegan's assistant Terry McDermott and coach Arthur Cox have
assumed temporary control of first team affairs.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle director Douglas Hall said: "Kevin took over at the
helm of a club destined for the second division and scaled the
heights of the Premier League with a style of football never
before seen at St James Park.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin leaves the club in a far stronger position than when he
arrived and the squad of players he has built up is one of the
strongest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The former Liverpool and England star took over at St James
Park in 1992 while Newcastle was near the bottom of the then
second division.
</P>

In the summer he stunned the football world by signing striker
Alan Shearer for a world record 15 million pounds (about 22.5

anniversary on the throne will start on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Queen Margrethe said that she and her mother, Queen Ingrid, who
is the sister of Prince Bertil, were anxious to attend the
funeral. Under these circumstances, the Swedish royal court
decided to hold the funeral before the Danish celebration.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia are expected to
decline the invitation to the Danish celebration because of the
three-week court mourning proclaimed following the death of Prince
Bertil.

<HEADLINE> Pak Religious Party Announces Election Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam
(Noorani) today announced that it will boycott the general
elections scheduled for February 3.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by JUP Chief Maulana Shah Ahmed
Noorani at an emergency press conference in Karachi this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The JUP (Noorani) has become the second religious party which
declared the boycott of February 3 polls. The Jammat-e-Islami had
announced its boycott decision late last month.
</P>
<P>
However, Noorani said at the press conference that his party
will not oppose the polls, nor would it resist the election
process.
</P>
<P>
He said the JUP and other religious parties have held a number
of meetings recently. They believed that the process of
accountability is not taking place at the required speed.
</P>
<P>
Noorani also said that the demand for elections on
proportionate representation has also not been taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the JUP decided to boycott the elections and
directed its candidates to withdraw their nominations.
</P>
<P>
The JUP Chief also said that his party will not resist any
future government coming into power as a result of the forthcoming
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, it will continue to put pressure on the government for
accountability through public meetings and processions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Kick Off Huge Canal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
is to inaugurate an ambitious project Thursday that aims at
adding Egypt's arable land by 30 percent and inhabiting the vast
parched south through digging a canal.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed Canal, the so-called New Valley Canal, is just
the beginning of an integrated development project to divert
people from the crammed Old Nile Valley to new communities in the
Western Desert in two decades, according to an official report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation potential is estimated at 2.2 million feddans
(946,000 hectares), equal to the capacity of the Aswan High Dam,
which had added 30 percent to the total cultivable area of Egypt
when its ten-year construction was completed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Under the first stage, the 30km-long canal will be able to
irrigate at least half a million feddans(215,000 hectares) with
water diverted from the Aswan High Dam through the Toshki
Depression, where surplus water from the Lake Nasser has been
accumulating.
</P>
<P>
This will be done by installing a pumping station, the largest
in the world, at the Toshki Depression to pump 30 million cubic
meters of water a day from a level of 150 meters to a level of
200 meters into the new canal.
</P>
<P>
At the site of the envisaged canal, Mubarak will review the
blueprints for a number of other huge national projects, known as
"Egypt's 21st century project."
</P>
<P>
These integrated works will provide necessary infrastructure
to open the door for industrial, agricultural and tourism schemes
on the map of the New Delta.
</P>
<P>
It will ease the imbalance of population distribution,
enabling 58 percent of Egypt's land to be inhabited. At the
moment, 99 percent of the population crams in the Nile Valley,
which forms 4 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has assured the Egyptians that the giant project,
which costs about 300 billion Egyptian pounds (88 billion
u.s. dollars), would be carried out over four five-year plans in
accordance with Egypt's potential and resources.

<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's government has began negotiations to
reinstall the country's railway system, which will link the
eastern Beqaa valley with Syria, according to Minister of
Transport Omar Miskawi.
</P>
<P>
Today's Daily Star quoted the minister as saying that Lebanon
is "now negotiating with the Syrian government to link the Beqaa
region to Syria through a 90-kilometer line that will include
several Bridges."
</P>
<P>
Miskawi said that a similar project linking north Lebanon with
Syria is also being discussed.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Tadiran Communications and Systems, a major
Israeli defense industry company based in Holon near Tel Aviv, has
won a 35-million-dollar contract to supply military communications
equipment to the Spanish army, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The equipment is meant to integrate the different levels of
command and control, including communications and navigation
terminals and integrated tactical systems.
</P>
<P>
Hezi Hermoni, Tadiran president and chief executive officer,
said Tuesday that the order is part of an multi-year acquisition
program by the Spanish army. Tadiran will begin supplying the
equipment this year until 2002 in cooperation with Amper, a
company partially owned by the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Teledata Communication Ltd., a company based in
Herzlia, north of Tel Aviv, has received a 7.2-million-dollar
order for its CT Loop Pair Gain System form an undisclosed
European customer, according to the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The CT Loop is a digital transmission system used by
telecom company's to connect 10-60 subscribers to an exchange
through a single pair of copper wires. This enables companies
to maximize the use of their existing access network, the
portion of the telephone network that connects subscribers to the
local exchange, without having to make heavy investments in
additional infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government has decided to raise three
new taxes to make up a shortfall of 270 million shekels (some 90
million dollars) in the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that the changes will fall on
car air conditioners, VAT on mini-vans and diesel prices. The
existing exemption from purchasing tax on air conditioners will
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of a 30 percent tax will raise an estimated 120
million shekels (some 40 million dollars). The vehicles affected
will be those which are imported without air conditioning systems
and therefore have them fitted in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jeeps and mini-vans will be defined as commercial vehicles for
tax purposes. This change will bring in some 70 million shekels
(some 23 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf cooperation Council (GCC) states have
agreed to Link their external loans to the import of local
products by receiptors of the aid, aiming at boosting their
exports and easing the current strains.
</P>
<P>
The GCC secretariat said in a recent statement that using GCC
industrial products as part of the loans and grants is a good and
important idea as it will support the industrial sector amid the
persistence of budget deficits and ensuring spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
GCC Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs Abdullan
Al Khalita said that in line with the new decision, beneficiaries
of GCC-provided loans should buy at least 25 percent of the
products needed for the project.
</P>
<P>
"In case they imported 50 percent of those products, the GCC
creditors will offer additional facilities for them, covering the
period of the loan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC is a key Financial donor to developing countries and it
has reportedly provided nearly 100 billion U.S. dollars in loans
and grants to more than 50 developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Fair Opens in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli trade fair opened
here this morning at the Amman International Fair with about
1,000 demonstrators against it outside.
</P>
<P>
The two-day exhibition is the first of its kind held in
Jordan after the kingdom and Israel signed a peace treaty in
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said such a fair might be the beginning of
the Israeli "invasion of Jordanian economy and even the whole
Arab economy."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators shouted anti-Israel slogans at a
intersection leading to the fair, while armed police stood around.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the decision to hold such a fair in Amman has drawn
fierce criticism from political activists who oppose
normalization of relations with Israel as well as from
businessmen who argue that the time is inappropriate for such an
event.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Engineers Association (JEA) was the main force
behind the call for the protest along with the "National
Jordanian Committee for Canceling the Trade Fair" which is set up
by the opponents of normalization of ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Press Association (JPA) also boycotted the
exhibition by urging the country's press establishments and
journalists to refrain from covering the event.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has adopted a neutral stand, saying
the exhibition was strictly a private sector event.
</P>
<P>
The fair, organized by a private Jordanian firm, was
initially due to open on December 15, 1996, but was postponed
twice.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Consequences Grave If Peace Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has warned that the collapse of peace process would have grave
consequences in the Middle East region and in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks in an interview with the U.S. BBS
T.V. network Tuesday, which was published by today's local
English language daily Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question if Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu continued his insistence on forcing his point of view
in the peace process and ignoring the already signed accords,
Mubarak warned this would mean freezing Israel's relations with
all the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned that if no solution was reached to the Jewish
settlement problem in the Palestinian territories, the situation
would burst "because the Palestinians and the Israelis will fight
each other throughout the West Bank and Gaza and the situation
will go out of control."
</P>
<P>
He said it was simply unacceptable to reconsider agreements
which had already been signed.
</P>

"We are dealing with the state of Israel, not parties. If
governments are changed this does not mean changing what has been
agreed upon. This creates many suspicions on Israeli intentions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said in the interview that Netanyahu
has failed to honor his word since their meeting here in July
when the Israeli prime minister promised to commit himself to
these accords and their implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu knew well that peace would never prevail so
long as Israel maintained the occupied lands in the West Bank and
on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that Netanyahu could win back his trust by
doing one thing, that is to respect the Oslo agreements and their
implementation.
</P>
<P>
While taking account of the Israeli "security obsession,"
Mubarak said it was possible to reach an agreement which satisfy
all the parties "through negotiations and good will."
</P>
<P>
On the Egyptian role in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
Mubarak said he could never pressure Arafat to accept things
which the Palestinian people would never accept.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
today told two senior Japanese officials that the Chinese
government would like to make a commitment to the development of
Sino-Japanese long-term stable friendship.
</P>
<P>
To do so, he said, the Japanese side must correctly recognize
events that occurred in the past, acknowledge the history of
Japanese militarist aggression, and educate the younger generation
with the facts.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also the country's foreign minister, made the
comments during a meeting with Taro Nakayama, former Japanese
foreign minister and chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and Yasuo Fukuda, chairman of
Foreign Affairs Committee of LDP.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese guests agreed with Qian, and gave a briefing on
the Japanese government's and LDP's principles for advancing
Japanese-Chinese friendly ties based on an accurate assessment of
the history between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
They said that the majority of Japanese people oppose the
beliefs and actions of Japan's right-wing extremists, as well as
the country's attempt to revise its current constitution and the
actions to revive militarism.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese guests are here at the invitation of the Chinese
people's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

<P>
The figure represents a 68.4 percent increase from the previous

with the industrial and commercial administrations throughout

<P>
LUANDA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Seventy UNITA parliament members
will arrive here on January 17 and a government of national unity
and reconciliation of Angola will be formed on January 25, a
United Nations envoy has announced.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made at the airport on Tuesday evening by UN
special representative to Angola Blondin Beye when he returned
from a short retreat in his motherland Mali during the Christmas
and New Year period, reported the National News Agency of Angola
today.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos are trying to put the new government together under a 1994
peace plan that ended two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a government of national unity means a
landmark move on the country's path to peace, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
Beye said the recent good momentum of the Angolan peace
process will continue, adding that he hoped the final peace and
national reconciliation will be realized in 1997.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has proposed that Savimbi become leader of Angola's
official opposition in parliament, rather than take up a vice
presidential position offered by the ruling MPLA party, which he
has already rejected.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attacks Hezbollah Targets in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces opened artillery
fire this morning at bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of
God), in south Lebanon following three Israeli soldiers injured
in a blast in the occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon reported that Israeli
artillery fired about 60 shells at Hezbollah targets in Iglim
Al-Toffah, some 60 kilometers southeast of the Lebanese capital
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, is a mountain area
often used by Hezbollah fighters as a springboard to launch
attacks on the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also fired some 40 artillery shells at
vicinities of Meidoum village in the southern part of the Beqaa
valley where the Shiite Hezbollah possesses many bases.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military helicopters hovered over Iglim Al-Toffah and
the area of Nabatieyh, carrying out reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous police sources noted that the bombardment,
which started around 7:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) has not caused any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman said in Jerusalem that three
Israeli soldiers were injured in a "mysterious explosion" in the
eastern sector of the buffer zone in south Lebanon earlier this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The incident added to eight the Israeli soldiers wounded in
south Lebanon since the New Year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, 181 Israeli soldiers had been killed and
480 others wounded on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, according to Uri Lubrani, the coordinator
of Israeli activity in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a five-nation committee monitoring
a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border wound up this
morning its first meeting in 1997 in the south Lebanon's border
town of Naqoura, without blaming anyone for a military escalation
just before the year-end.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the
cease-fire monitoring committee urged the Israeli forces and
Lebanese guerrillas, who are engaged in a war of attrition in
south Lebanon, to prevent civilians from being hurt in military
operations.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting started on Monday morning and lasted
until 6:45 a.m. (0445 GMT) today with a recess over Monday
night, in order to discuss four complaints - two filed by Israel
and two by Lebanon - over cease-fire violations during the last
two weeks in December.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising France, the United States, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel was established under a cease-fire
understanding brokered by the U.S. and France last April between
Lebanon and Israel, which put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It urged the conflicting sides in south Lebanon to keep their
commitment to the April understanding, which warns against
attacks at or from civilians areas, and demands civilians be
kept away from all dangers caused by military actions.

<HEADLINE> HK, Second Most Expensive Place in Office Rent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is the second most
expensive place in the world to rent an office, according to a
global survey conducted by a local estate agent, C. Y. Leung &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy cost in Hong Kong is 22 percent lower than in the
top-ranking Tokyo, said Leung Chun Ying, head of the chartered
surveying firm. The Global Office Occupancy Costs study has taken
into account costs such as service charges, taxes and other fees.
</P>
<P>
It costs 44 percent more to lease an office in Hong Kong than
to rent the same floor of space in Singapore, which takes the
third on a list of 49 cities surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high rents, multinational companies are still
willing to locate their regional headquarters in Hong Kong. Leung
said that Hong Kong's role as a gateway to the Chinese mainland is
a major consideration.
</P>
<P>
Three other Asian cities -- Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei -- are
among the ten most costly cities in terms of office rents,
according to the survey.

<P>
HANGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation to standardize
construction project planning has formulated by the Standing
Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
One official says that the regulation, along with three others
regulating the construction industry, bidding on construction

"These regulations are designed to ensure the quality of
construction projects and improve investment returns," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulation, advanced technology,

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Holds Talks with Hashimoto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today held talks with his Japanese counterpart
Ryutaro Hashimoto on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told Hashimoto that Malaysia's "Look East" policy is
"very much alive" and in this regard he hoped Japan could be able
to provide more opportunities for Malaysian trainees and students,
Malaysian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Abdul Kadir Mohamad
told a news conference after the two-hour talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed bilateral economic issues, Kadir
said.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on regional issues, Kadir said, adding
"our prime minister reiterated his views which he had expressed
many times before that Malaysia certainly feels that a policy of
friendship is better than a policy of containment."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Japanese prime minister responded to
Mahathir's view, Kadir said Hashimoto actually just asked for
Mahathir's views in the context of regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Kadir said another subject Mahathir raised to Hashimoto was
international economic relations.
</P>
<P>
As Mahathir is chairman of G-15 for 1997, he asked Hashimoto to
help find ways and means for communicating with G-7, of which
Japan is a member.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir emphasized that the reason for this was that decisions
taken or to be taken by G-7 have impacts on developing countries
as well.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that the two groups should communicate
with each other.
</P>
<P>
Kadir said as Hashimoto is on a five-nation Southeast Asian
tour, he expressed his special interest in discussions on how
Japan could deepen relations with the Association of southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The deepening of relations can be in various fields like
culture, environment and welfare of the people, the official
quoted Hashimoto as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto proposed to hold regular meetings between ASEAN
leaders and Japanese leaders on Japan's ties with ASEAN, according
to Kadir.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here earlier today for a two-day official
visit to Malaysia to promote bilateral relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto who came here after visiting Brunei will also visit
Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> New Economic Development Zone Regulation For Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A 22-article regulation with
stipulations on establishing economic and technological
development zones went into effect in northeast China's Liaoning
Province on January 1.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official says that this type of regulation can be
found in only a few provinces and municipalities in China, such as
Shanghai and Jilin.
</P>
<P>
It provides more safeguards for rights and interests of foreign
investors, and emphasizes practices suited to the development of a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning currently has four national-level economic and
technological development zones and 12 provincial-level zones. By
the end of last year, 2,300 foreign-financed companies had been
set up in the zones covering a total of 87 sq km.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the zones manufactured 18 billion yuan worth of goods,
generated 1.4 billion yuan in profits and taxes and earned one
billion US dollars from exports.
</P>
<P>
The number of economic and technological development zones in
China ballooned after its reforms and opening-up policy of 1978,
and they have become the major recipients of foreign investment
and enjoy various preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
However, as China's reforms enter a new phase, the official
said, "a relatively complete legal system and improved investment
environment are gradually replacing the preferential policies as
the major means of attracting foreign investment."

schools have also co-operated with foreign counterparts,
especially with schools in Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 13 people were killed and about 100 wounded on
Tuesday in a bar bomb explosion on one of the most frequented
streets of Algiers. About 80,000 people were been killed in
violences in Algeria from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- General Amadou Toumani Toure, former head of state of Mali who
is mediating in Bangui, will meet with Captain Anicet Saulet, the
leader of mutinous soldiers of the Central African Republic this
morning. For the first time since the mutiny began in mid-November
last year, the rebels are no longer asking the resignation of
President Ange-Felix Patasse as a precondition for negotiations.
This could give Toure some room for manoeuvre, and France a decent
way out.
</P>
<P>
-- Judging from its past performances within the European Union,
the new EU president the Netherlands could attempt to slow down the
process of building a single European currency. The Dutch are
apparently waiting for the outcome of the general elections in
Britain in the spring before deciding which policy it should adopt.
Many fear that the Dutch would make it difficult, if not impossible,
for EU countries to adopt a revised Maastricht Treaty at the
Amsterdam EU summit to be held in June.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Markus Wolf, the former East German intelligence chief, and
the spymaster ``Karla'' under the pen of John le Carre, began to
appear in a court in the German city Dusseldorf on a second trial
organized by the German judicial authorities against him on charges
of ``illegal confinement, constraint and physical injuries'' in
three cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
-- Alain Le Carro, the former lieutenant-colonel of the
presidential security guard has denied allegations by the media
that he was one of the leaders of a mercenary recruitment
enterprise which is serving the government of Zaire. Robert
Montaya, another former presidential security officer, also denied
any involvement in recruitment of mercenaries for Zaire.

<HEADLINE> The Dong's of Liukeng Village Seek World Fame For Their Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese village where every
single person shares the same surname wants to take its place on
the world stage.
</P>
<P>
Liukeng Village consists of just 820 households and its 4,290
villagers all go by the family name of Dong.
</P>
<P>
The village, which is now located in Lean county of east
China's Jiangxi province, has applied to the United Nation's for
listing as a World Heritage Site.
</P>
<P>
"The village's rich historical culture, unique residential
buildings, and the rare and precious historical records and
cultural relics are all of great value," said Professor Luo
Zhewen, who is also the head of the expert group for ancient
architecture under the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
"I am excited about the village, which I believe is well
qualified for UN listing of world cultural heritage," said the
professor.
</P>
<P>
Liukeng village started life in the Later Tang of Five
Dynasties (923-936).
</P>
<P>
Throughout its history the village produced 44 Jinshi
(successful candidates in the highest imperial examinations), two
Zhuangyuan or Number One Scholars (a title conferred on people
coming first in the highest imperial examination) and more than
200 Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examinations at
provincial level).
</P>
<P>
"More than 200 people from the village were appointed ranking
government officials during its history," a local source said.
</P>
<P>
Around 94 of the village's residences were built during the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1364), and 215 others were built during the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
In addition, there remains a large number of art works and
cultural relics in the chess-board shaped village, which is well
planned and laid out in lines with traditional Chinese ideals.
</P>
<P>
"As a group of ancient buildings, the village is rather like a
treasure house or a living museum," said a visiting expert.
</P>
<P>
"Actually it is a microcosm of Jiangxi's ancient
civilization", he said.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Kuwaiti Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Constitutional
Court announced today the elections of Ahmed Al-Saadoun as
speaker of the National Assembly effective, thus ending three
months of controversy over the election legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The court, which gives final verdict on legal affairs in
Kuwait, approved the 30 votes elections for Al-Saadoun against
the 29 votes given to parliamentary MP Jassem Al-Khorafi, saying
that "whoever gained 30 out of 59 total votes has the absolute
majority," referring the voting results last October in the first
session of Kuwaiti new parliament.
</P>
<P>
The controversy developed on the interpretation of the term
"majority" as Saadoun was elected by 30 votes against 29 in a
session that was attended by 60 deputies, leaving one paper
blank.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khorafi, the other contender of the post, declared his
opposition to the election results on grounds that it did not
comply with the constitution of Kuwait because the law stipulates
that the assembly speaker should be elected by an absolute
majority of present lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The constitution calls for holding another election in case
one of the two candidates fails in obtaining the absolute
majority.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliamentary legal and legislative affairs committee
referred the concerned article of the constitution to the
constitutional court for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun was the speaker of the 1992 Kuwaiti Assembly. He
won the first place in the parliament elections in his
constituency on October 7, 1996 when Kuwaiti voters elected the
eighth parliament in the Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the only Gulf country that has a parliament which
consists of 50 male members. Cabinet members also have the right
to vote in the parliament.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- After a four-year delay, India
has agreed to a 1.5 million US dollar deal to purchase two
Kilo-class diesel submarines from Russia, Press Trust of India
(PTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a US publication, The Defense News, in a
recent issue, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense News quoted Indian defense officials as saying that
New Delhi would release additional funds to build two HDW (Howald
Swerke-Deutsche-Werft)-class submarines after the new defense
budget was finalized in March.

It also quoted Indian navy officials as saying that the service
had a critical requirement for new submarines as six Russian
Foxtrot-class submarines would be decommissioned over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The navy's submarine fleet, it said, now comprises six
Foxtrot-class, four HDW-class and eight Kilo-class boats.

The navy officials said funding problems had delayed the
medium-term refit planned for the Kilo-class submarines, with at
least four of them requiring normal mid-term overhaul.

<HEADLINE> China's Machine-Building Industry Targets For Next Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China announced today a goal of
400 name-brand products and 200 elite businesses in its
machine-building industry for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a national conference on machine-building industry
in Beijing say that in spite of an industry growth rate of 10
percent last year, money-losing enterprises still account for 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bao Xuding, Machine-Building Industry minister, says that
China's machinery products' share of the domestic market has
fallen from 90 to 60 percent in the past several years, while the
competition has intensified, and the industry faces challenges
from joint ventures and overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Electrical machinery products have, however, become the
country's leading exports since 1995, when the industry's exports
began to exceed textiles for the first time. In the first ten
months of last year, the export volume of China's electrical
machinery products accounted for one-third of the country's total
export volume.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said that
the machinery and automotive industries are important to improving
the role of the equipment industry in the national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of
overall social development in China's capital of Beijing ranks
first among all Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The first year of China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000)
provided a good start for Beijing, which maintained a fast
development in the fields of science and technology, education,
culture, public health, media and publications, and population.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the municipal government put education top on
its agenda in 1996 with a budget of 2.7 billion yuan (about 325
million US dollars), an increase of 17.2 percent over 1995. The
increase in spending on schooling grew faster than that in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
And schools with poor infrastructure and lower quality teaching
forces were offered a total of 100 million yuan. Some 90 percent
of junior middle school graduates have access to senior middle
schools and secondary technical schools.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's scientific and technological community held the first
ever seminar and negotiations on the transfer of technological
findings with manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Present at the seminar were representatives from 160
universities and research institutes. And 203 contracts worth 530
million yuan were signed.
</P>
<P>
Contracts signed so far in Beijing amount to 3.16 billion yuan,
an increase of 4.17 percent over the corresponding period.
</P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan to Carry out Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
finally embarked on the process of much-talked reforms for the
financial sector which has long been blamed for the worsening of
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soon after entering the new calendar year, the caretaker
cabinet made certain vital decisions about financial reforms which
include enhancement of the autonomy and independent functioning of
the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and abolition of the Pakistan
Banking Council (PBC).
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the decisions on these highly important
issues will surely have a strong bearing on the entire financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the PBC's supervisory powers over the nationalized banks
are now to be transferred to the SBP, the long-running dual
controlling system in relations to the banks will wind up.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of the PBC has been widely endorsed as a "welcome
decision" as it had overshadowed the real functions of the SBP.
The duplicity in supervision of nationalized banking caused
confusion in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The SBP, which has so far been functioning under the control of
the Finance Ministry, is believed to be practically helpless in
matters such as checking on government borrowings from the banking
system and overseeing and monitoring the affairs of the
nationalized commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government treated the resources of the
commercial banks as part of the treasury and maintained a
borrowing spree from these banks for the purpose of filling the
budgetary gap, without taking care or making efforts to raise its
resources through appropriate taxation measures.
</P>
<P>
Because of the government's growing dependence on commercial
banks and the SBP, the gap between revenue and expenditure is
widening with the government debts multiplying.
</P>
<P>
The repayment of these debts consumes almost half of Pakistan's
total revenues.
</P>
<P>
It is nothing new that the biggest problem facing Pakistan's
economy is the public debt crisis. The country has borrowed to an
extent that it appears to be extremely hard to repay the debts.
</P>
<P>
Debt servicing in the 1996-97 fiscal year is budgeted at 227
billion rupees (about 5.7 billion US dollars), and the figure
would go further up with fresh foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pakistan's debt servicing has been increasing by an
annual rate of 20 percent over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of this situation have led to unchecked
expansion in money supply which in turn spur severe inflationary
tendencies in the economy marked by galloping price inflation on a
wide front.
</P>
<P>
The SBP has so far enjoyed little independence to resist the
government pressure for borrowings from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that with implementation of the latest decision for
financial reforms, the SBP will be given full independence for its
role of monetary management and for carrying out large scale
structural reforms in the financial sector, including speedy
privatization of the nationalized banks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the latest policy changes will
undoubtedly help do away with the political influences on the
banking system, and the SBP would be able to exert its weight to
control monetary expansion and inflation and thereby bring about a
better and healthy change to the whole economy.

<HEADLINE> Ten Dead, 29 Missing In Northern China Snow Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- By Tuesday, ten people had been
killed, four severely injured, and 29 missing in heavy snowstorms
in Alltay Prefecture in China's northwesternmost Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
More than 980 people in the area are still trapped in by the
snow.
</P>
<P>
"This is the heaviest snowstorm ever seen in this area for 30
years," a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The snow, which began to fall on December 27 along with strong
winds, is 40 centimeters deep on average, with the deepest layers
reaching 2.4 meters in mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 186 houses were demolished by the storms, and 1,267
cattle and sheep pens were buried, with 532 caving in causing
580,000 horses, cattle and other livestock to be homeless and
short of food.
</P>
<P>
Roads became impassable or were closed, telecommunications
facilities broke down and mountain villages were cut off by the
snow.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the heavy snow has caused the
prefecture to suffer economic losses worth of several tens of
millions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government sent helicopters to drop
relief food and aid material in the disaster areas and to search
for the missing people.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are rushing to rural areas on horseback to
guide people in the fight against the disaster, and medical
service teams are being organized for the disaster areas.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Tourist Arrivals Break 2 Million Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The annual tourist arrivals in
the Philippines broke the two-million mark last year when
2,053,585 tourists visiting the country, a news release from the
Presidential Palace said today.
</P>
<P>
The news release quoted Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor as saying
that the total number of tourists in 1996 was 12 percent higher
than the 1995 figure of 1,760,163.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to generate something like 2.7 billion US dollars
out of the 2.053 million arrivals, which will represent 5.23
percent of the Gross Domestic Product," Gabor said.
</P>
<P>
She further said that some 1.11 million jobs were generated by
the 1996 tourist arrivals. In 1995, tourism was able to provide
jobs to only 865,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Tourism last year had 115 major tourism
development projects, amounting to 26.4 billion pesos (about 1
billion US dollars), the most expensive of which was the

very exciting" as the department targets 2.2 million tourist
arrivals with estimated visitor receipts of 3.2 billion US

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Army to Guarantee Security After Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
has pledged again that the Lebanese army will guarantee security on
the border with Israel after Israeli troops withdraw from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks published in Beirut's conservative An-Nahar
daily today, Hrawi repeated a demand for the implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in an interview Tuesday with
Mohammed Baalbaki, Chairman of the Lebanese Press Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning Lebanon, the Issue of peace is not complicated,"
the Lebanese president said. "The complication is what (Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu wants with the proposals he
puts forward from time to time."
</P>
<P>
He specified that the proposals which the Israeli Likud
premier has raised included the so-called "Lebanon first" and
that of sending Jordanian and Egyptian forces to the borders.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israeli decision on the achievement of peace with
Lebanon is serious, the thing would become clear and there
would not be any obscurity," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied south Lebanon in late 1970s and turned a
1,100-square-kilometer border strip into Israel's buffer zone in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi reaffirmed the country's pledge "not to fire a single
bullet across the international border if Israel withdraws from
all Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz urged Israel Tuesday to return
to the Madrid formula for peace negotiations, saying that "it
is time for Israel to realize that its occupation of south
Lebanon has been the most costly of all its conflicts with
its Arab neighbors."
</P>
<P>
At a New Year reception of foreign diplomats at the Foreign
Ministry, the minister accused Israel's right-wing government led
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of "betraying" the Madrid
formula by rejecting a land-for-peace principle for a Middle East
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Once for a while, Boueiz said, the world felt peace in this
volatile region was attainable "until the new Israeli government
came in with its four no's: No to withdrawal from the West Bank;
no withdrawal from the Golan Heights; no negotiations over
Jerusalem; and no to the establishment of a Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
By pursuing such a policy, he said, "Israel has plunged the
region, including itself, into a vicious circle and total
deadlock."
</P>
<P>
After assuming power last June, Netanyahu put forward the
"Lebanon first" proposal in an apparent attempt to lure Lebanon
into a separate peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was categorically rejected by Lebanon, which
said that it was aimed at "driving a wedge between Lebanon
and Syria."

ZHENGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has closed down more than 17,000 polluting factories, according to
the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Provincial Bureau of Environmental
Protection show that the factories included small paper mills,
leather processing, printing and dyeing, local-method coking
plants and other factories with pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The move was in line with an order issued by the State Bureau

country's 15 kinds of small-sized factories with serious pollution
problems to close.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has pledged to disassemble the
equipment at the now-silent factories.
</P>
<P>
A total of 159 legal persons of the factories were detained for
failure to cease production last year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Airlines Carries 2.57 Million Passengers in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Airlines carried
nearly 2.57 million passengers in 1996, topping the previous
year's figure by 370,000, Vietnam Airlines said today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Airlines said in a report that of the last year's
total 2.569 million passengers, 1.022 million were foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the airlines also transported 44.12 million tonnes of
cargo including 18,398 tonnes to overseas destinations, compared
to 1995's 32.8 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Vietnam Airlines had 23 flights to 18
overseas destinations, an increase of 15.8 percent as compared
with the previous year. There were 22 domestic flights between 15
airports across the country representing 31 percent increase than
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The airline has paid taxes and profits about 259 billion
Vietnamese dong (about 25.4 million u.s. dollars) to the
government from last year's operations, a 21.17 percent increase
over the planed figure set for last year.
</P>
<P>
The steady operational growth was mainly attributed to the
improvements in service quality by purchasing and leasing of new
aircrafts manufactured in foreign countries, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 18 of 28 Russian-made aircraft of
Vietnam Airlines'fleet have been replaced with less than
one-year-old aircrafts including four Boeing 767s, eight Airbus
A320s and four Atr-72s.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Now Has 50 Clinics Providing Care for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has opened a
number of special clinics that are qualified to treat foreign
patients, in more than 50 major hospitals, making life much easier
for them.
</P>
<P>
Included are Beijing Hospital, the Beijing Union Medical
College Hospital, Friendship Hospital, Sino-Japanese Friendship
Hospital, and the Beijing Emergency Care Center, all of them among
the country's best.
</P>
<P>
The clinics offer round-the-clock service for foreigners who
live and work in the city, or are here on a temporary
basis. Medical hotlines have also been opened for their benefit.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the clinic at the Beijing Union Medical College
Hospital alone received more than 40,000 foreigners, and now sees
an average of 100 foreign patients per day, and 200 on a peak day.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, seeing a doctor in Beijing was not an easy
thing for most foreigners because the procedures took an immense
amount of time and energy.
</P>
<P>
Although things have also shown signs of improving for local
people as well, Beijing residents still feel that it is a headache
to go see a doctor at hospitals.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Paddy Field Found in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and archaeologists
from both China and Japan have found what they believe to be the
world's oldest paddy field.
</P>
<P>
It shows that people in Suzhou in eastern Jiangsu province,
had grown China's favorite rice some 6,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that the
rice field is about 3,500 years older than a paddy field found in
Japan, and it could be the earliest paddy field ever found in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The international scientific community has previously held that
the earliest rice field appeared in Japan 2,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The find, while indicating that man's history of cropping rice
is much earlier, has provided new evidence and a breakthrough in
the study to confirm that Asia was the first region to start rice
cropping," a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
International scientists have been searching for the original
region of rice for over a century, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, researchers from Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural
Sciences have worked in collaboration with Japanese researchers to
look for the oldest rice field in the province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the Sino-Japanese research team has
found 33 early paddy fields occupying a total area of 450 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found carbonized rice as well as old wells,
irrigation systems and a path for drawing water in the old rice
field.

<HEADLINE> GCC Committee Ends Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) four-man committee ended its first round of talks on
solving the decades old border row between Bahrain and Qatar
Tuesday night in Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh with specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting described the discussions
as "positive and cordial", saying a second round of talks will be
held in Riyadh on January 12.
</P>
<P>
The committee headed by Saudi Arabia was formed by a GCC
summit held in Qatari capital Doha last December to mediate in
the disputes among the GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al-Saud
was reportedly saying that "the meeting put forward specific
proposals ... to prepare an atmosphere between the two countries
thus enabling them to have a compromise formula and allowing
friendly and neighboring states to exert efforts to continue the
consultation for their benefit."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Qatar and Bahrain who arrived in
Riyadh to join their Saudi, Kuwaiti, Omani and the United Arab
Emirates' counterparts also held separate talks under Saudi
Arabian sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
The committee said in the statement that the ministers
discussed in detail a memorandum of understanding "regarding
means of solving any dispute that might erupt among the GCC
state."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in a territory dispute over
the islands of Hawar, Fasht al-Dibal and the Jaradah reefs as
well as the Zubara region, which are reportedly rich in gas and
oil.
</P>
<P>
The dispute caused the refusal of Bahrain to take part in the
GCC summit in Doha last month.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries have been trying to
mediate between them but no results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef Ben Alawi
paid several visits to Qatar and Bahrain before the new efforts
started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain had charged two Qatari citizens with espionage but
later pardoned and released them while Doha returned to Manama a
military helicopter aboard which a Bahraini pilot defected to
Qatar on December 30, showing goodwill towards each other.

NANJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing University has started a
campaign to select the best class and will name it "Zhou Enlai
Class" in honor of the late Chinese Premier.
</P>
<P>
The university has also started a campaign to learn from the
great leader to mark the 11th anniversary of the death of Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at the university joined Zhou's relatives
from his home town of Huai'an in Jiangsu province, and two of his
body-guards, at a ceremony in the Meiyuan Xincun Museum, in
downtown Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou worked in Nanjing as head of the delegation of the Chinese
Communist Party in its negotiations with the Kuomintang
government after the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Meiyuan Xincun Museum and the Zhou Enlai Museum in his home
town presented books and a documentary film about Zhou to the
university at the ceremony.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Part-Time Tourist Guides Now Being Used In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Half the people sitting for a
tourist guide license exam in central China's Hubei Province in
1996 were doing it for part-time work, according to the Provincial
Travel and Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingyin, an official with the administration, says that
most of the part-time guides are university teachers and
students. Many young people want to be guides because the job
gives them experience and the pay is high, according to a survey
in Shanghai, and the growth in the number of part-time guides is
supported by tourist agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is seasonal. With a large number of part-time guides,
travel agencies don't need to keep so many professional guides,
and that increases their profits," the director of one agency
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw more than 800 people taking the exam for a
tourist guide license, with a success rate of more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"That is the best result in several years," Chen noted,
explaining that it may be the increase in the number of part-time
guides that contributed to it.

<HEADLINE> Car Thefts Rampant in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Car thefts increased to a
record high of 36,732 in Israel in 1996 compared with 33,050 in
the previous year, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Itamar Borowitz, Chairman of the Insurance Companies
Association (ICA), was quoted as saying Tuesday about 130 cars
are stolen each day, of which only 30 percent are recovered.
</P>
<P>
In December, 4,028 vehicles were stolen, up 16.2 percent from
November.
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest number of cars ever stolen in one month
in Israel," said Borowitz, adding that the number of stolen cars
has increased each month since April. The average figure of car
thefts for 1993-94 was 25,000.
</P>
<P>
The ICA and the Ministry of Transportation are working on a
program to mark popular vehicle parts in an attempt to reduce car
thefts and prevent trade in stolen spare parts. About 60 percent
of all stolen cars return to the market in the form of spare
parts, said Borowitz.
</P>
<P>
The cost of developing a network and data base to mark the
vehicle parts is estimated at about 900 million shekels (about
300 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian and Turkish security
officials started their first round of security talks focusing
on the current sensitive and complicated issues, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the Turkish
delegation was headed by Deputy Interior Minister Bakir Aksoy
while the Iranian delegation was led by Hussein Motahar, Director
General in charge of security affairs of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two sides stressed on ways of
expanding bilateral relations in security and military affairs at
the meeting, which began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official was quoted as saying that the security
cooperation was crucial in promoting the Tehran-Ankara relations.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the mutual respect for the observation of
territorial integrity of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
However, he also claimed bases of the Turkey's opposition
exist on the borders of Iran and urged Iran to help resolve this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Motahar, however, replied that there exists no single Turkey's
opposition faction (PKK) base on the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Motahar said that Iran will not allow any individuals or
factions to damage the relations between Iran and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The PKK issue is the security problem of turkey... ... the
Islamic Republic of Iran, based on the observation of its good
neighborly relations with Turkey, is prepared to help Ankara
resolve its plight," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he expressed his disappointment over the failure
by Turkey's security officials to fulfill their responsibility in
terms of a Turkish helicopter attack on Iran last August.
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian report, two Turkish helicopters
violated the Iranian airspace and fired two rockets, killing
six citizens and injuring 15 others.
</P>
<P>
Iran asked Turkey to officially and clearly announce its stance
in the matter and clear all the barriers in security aspects
between the two nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
saw price increases slowed in 1996, according to recent statistics
from the regional bureau of commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The region's retail price index fell by ten percent in the
first eleven months of 1996 from the same period in 1995, and the
price index of consumer goods percent by 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and the price index of consumer goods in
the region are expected to drop by 10.4 and 11.9 percent in the
whole of 1996, respectively, an official of the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "Prices are no longer a hot topic among
residents in the regional capital of Lhasa."
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in price hikes in the region is mainly attributed
to a nationwide decline, because 85 percent of the region's
supplies come from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
It is also the result of the tightened economic policies and
sufficient supplies of consumer goods on the market.
</P>
<P>
Price controls over a number of items, such as the chemical
fertilizers and electricity have been halted.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Says U.S. Payment to U.N. Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said today that payment of U.S. debt to the
U.N. was the "top agenda" of the Clinton administration in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the remarks in a meeting with new U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, according to State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 2.2 billion U.S. dollars owed to the world body by
member states, the United States alone owes 1.3 billion, a debt
that causes endless financial crisis in the organization.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that the U.S. should meet its obligation to the
United Nations," said Burns, adding that President Bill Clinton
will be making some recommendations on the issue to the Congress
soon.
</P>
<P>
One reason for Christopher's visit to U.N. since Annan
was elected last month was to prepare for Annan's trip to
Washington later this month.
</P>
<P>
But despite warm words exchanged between the two men, they
appeared to have different approaches to the key issue of
U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, reform means deep cuts in personnel
while for Annan the emphasis is on restructuring the world body to
make it more efficient and viable.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has said that reform does not really
mean reduction (in staff). Reform means building a consensus of
what the organization is supposed to do once there is agreement
and getting everyone to pay to achieve those objectives," said
Fred Eckhard, spokesman of the new secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Annan told Christopher that bloc politics
dominated the United Nations and that "the United States will need
to work more closely with others. Sometimes a good leader must
also be a good follower."
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who will be replaced next month by the current
U.N. ambassador, Madeleine Albright, arrived here with Peter Tarnoff,
under secretary of state for political affairs.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Takes Steps to Cut Traffic Death Toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has taken a
series of new measures to reduce road death toll which reached
1,121 during the first week of the year, said Transport Minister
Mac Maharaj.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj was quoted by today's local newspapers as saying that
the measures, including the introduction of a lower alcohol
limit, stronger enforcement of existing regulations, regular
road-blocks and on-the-road traffic courts, should reduce traffic
death toll by 10 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a draft plan for the newly-approved Road Traffic
Management Strategy in Pretoria, Maharaj said the alarming death
figure had brought deep shock to the community.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people are killed and 46,000 seriously injured
in 498,000 traffic accidents on the South African roads every
year, costing the country 2.2 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, about 69 percent of drivers exceeded
the speed limit of 60 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
About 37 percent of front-seat vehicle occupants failed to
wear seat-belts, while about 7 percent of all drivers were
intoxicated during night time.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the plan proposed regular road-blocks be held
to control driver and vehicle fitness by the provincial and local
traffic authorities with the assistance of the police.
</P>
<P>
On-the-road traffic courts would also be established by the
Department of Justice starting from March 14.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasised that it was not just enforcement which
would be stepped up, but also awareness of traffic safety through
extensive educational and advertising campaigns.

<P>
CHENGDU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese college
students have taken to self moral cultivation in the campus these
years in line with the old tradition, and they find that what the
people advocate today just fit the traditional scholarly wish to
develop "perfect characters".
</P>
<P>
They are found involving in a wave of helping others and in
return achieving self satisfaction in developing high moral
standards. This, they believe, prepares themselves to live and
work in modern civilization that the country is building,
according to one leading educationalist.
</P>
<P>
Wang Weicheng, a freshman at Sichuan United University, has
found big interest in the "Citizens' Handbook" compiled in Chengdu
city through mass participation, and he decided to do according to
the requirements of a good citizen.
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of the over 20,000 students at the prestigious
university in southwest China's Sichuan Province who took pains to
get a copy of the new bestseller.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, college students nationwide have shown big
enthusiasm in the Young Volunteers Project which organizes young
people to contribute to the building of a modern society. These
days, in chilly Heilongjiang, China's northernmost province, such
young volunteers brave wind and snow to bring warmth to those in
need. Some students are found busy at the Harbin railway station
helping travelors.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the Chinese capital city, college students are
found sweeping snow on the street and helping the old. Members of
Beijing Univerty's "Love Heart Society" are more and more active
to show concern for others.
</P>
<P>
A veteran educator regarded the trend among college students as
a sign to show their maturity in developing their sense of
responsibility toward society.
</P>
<P>
"For years, many Chinese college students cared only about
themselves, and concentrated only on academic studies. Today, they
find that this is not enough and the society today needs people
with fine characters," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that more college students are trying to
understand the meaning of the word "citizen," and its overtones.

"Citizenship means both individual rights and responsibility
toward society," said Huang Lisheng, a student in the physics
department at Sichuan United University. A year ago he attended an
initiation ceremony for those who reached adulthood at 18.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the value orientation of college students is
a big part of social trends in China, which still has a high rate
of illiteracy particularly among its farmers living in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
"We find it our responsibility to help develop healthy social
trends," said a college student who volunteered to donate blood at
the Chengdu Blood Center.
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts for morality promotion on the campus,
one of China's oldest seats of learning, Beijing University, has
witnessed marked ethical progress among all the students.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of higher education at the State
Education Commission said that the initiatives shown by students
are something never experienced years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Their soul-searching and moral culvivation also resulted in
greater enthusiasm for theoretical studies.
</P>
<P>
"Those college students are fixing their eyes on specific
political and economic issues with sober minds," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Politics books are yet another fad in the ivory towers -- the
schools of higher learning in China. Students are found powdering
over the inevitable trend of historical development. Books and
lectures on economics are also hot favorites among students. Many
officials and experts in economics are frequently invited to give
lectures at colleges. The students all wish to learn how should a
socialist market economy operate, and how should they act when
they are working in society.  "If you do not know about politics
and economics, it is difficult to keep abreast of the wave of
reform," said a student.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Calls for Balanced Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has called on
state agencies to prune public spending by at least 100 billion
baht (4 billion US dollars) for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The requests, made at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, were
aimed at reducing the country's current economic problems, such as
the balance of payments' deficit and the slowdown in exports.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Eighth National Economic and Social
Development Plan (1997-2001), the public, state and private
enterprises will spend a combined 362 billion baht (14.48 billion
dollars) in infrastructure projects in the 1997 fiscal year, which
began in October 1996, and a total of 1,937 billion baht (77.48
billion dollars) during the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet called for revision of the state budget for the
next two years so as to reduce the current account deficit, which
has been running at more than 8 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Government agencies involved in finance, investment, budget and
planning, have been asked to review which projects should be cut
during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will help the private sector to
obtain long-term offshore loans in limited amounts to support
projects that can compete against imports.
</P>
<P>
The government will also support more projects that have
foreign equity participation, especially in infrastructure and
major undertakings.

<P>
And the long-distance fees for the public phones are 6.9 times
higher than those for other calls.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Develops High-Yielding Maize Varieties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Seed Company has
succeeded in developing three new varieties of Maize which are
high yielding and can be grown in varying climates, the Kenya
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Managing Director of the company Nathaniel
arap Tum as saying that the new varieties would take 180 days to
mature, and yield up to 45 bags of maize in each acre of land.
</P>
<P>
Another variety which grows in medium altitude areas will take
145 days to mature and give good yields too, he added.
</P>
<P>
The managing director noted that his company has 28,000 tons
of seeds for the current planting season from March to April.
</P>
<P>
Kenya needs between 18,000 and 20,000 tons of seeds each
year. But the demand for maize seeds was set to increase and
possibly outstrip the current stock of 28,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the restoration of the East African
Cooperation had allowed his company to sell maize seeds
throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects US Compromise Proposal on Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hebron talks are
backtracking again as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
rejected a U.S. compromise proposal over the timetable for
further Israeli troop pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
After intensive talks Tuesday night with Arafat, U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross failed to wrap up the long-delayed Hebron
deal. In a sign of renewed tension, a scheduled summit between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was
canceled in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani described the Arafat-Ross
meeting as "extremely tense." He warned that the hardline
position taken by Netanyahu and the U.S. bias toward Israel
would "destroy all hopes that we could reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday night, Netanyahu said it would become clear
very soon if the Hebron deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the Palestinian side to show good will to reach
the Hebron deal. "The decision not to close the agreement has
essentially been the Palestinian decision. I think we can close
the agreement if there is good will on the other side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross is continuing today his tireless mediation in order to
press the two sides to sign the Hebron agreement. But Palestinian
officials have predicted that the U.S. envoy would only remain
here for a couple of more days if the deadlock drags on.
</P>
<P>
The renewed tension is in sharp contrast with the newly
emerging optimism about signing the Hebron deal after the Sunday
secret summit between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron itself
have already been concluded, but the last obstacle blocking the
signing of the deal centered on the timetable for further Israeli
troop pullbacks from the rural areas of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is demanding the U.S. to guarantee in
written form of the timetable for Israeli troop redeployments
in the West Bank following the Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu only promises to complete further troop pullbacks
by spring 1999, the PA insists on Israel's accurate implementation
of the Oslo accords which demand the completion of the process by
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly proposing a compromise between the two
dates in order to clear the last obstacle for signing the
Hebron deal: summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that Netanyahu is seeking delay of further
pullbacks in order to retain more territorial cards pending the
final-status talks with the PA.

<HEADLINE> China Streamlines Farm Vehicle Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China has issued an official
list detailing the country's 247 farm vehicle manufacturers,
"China Machinery and Electronics Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the country's efforts to streamline farm vehicle
production, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Machine-building Industry will establish an
office to take charge of the industry as well as a technology
development center.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister Shao Qihui said that China will make efforts to
improve the quality of farm vehicles, and not increase the
quantity.
</P>
<P>
China built 2.4 million farm vehicles in 1996, an increase of
100,000 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers need reliable, cheaper and applicable farm vehicles,
Shao said.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people are engaged in the farm vehicle industry,
which has fixed assets valued at eight billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The supply of farm vehicles basically meets the demand, with
the market for some vehicles saturated.

<HEADLINE> Dalian: City Without Enclosing Walls (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the city is not big in usual Chinese sense, and has
many slopes, Dalian people feel they have a wider view of their
city after bringing down the traditional walls that once enclosed
their communities.
</P>
<P>
A park keeper said that in the past some people climbed into
the parks through railings or fences to have a better view. It
seldom happens now. Inside or outside the parks, people have an
unobstructed view of the beautiful sea, beaches, green lands,
grassed areas and flowers, as if the nature and people have
started to melt in perfect harmony.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim that Dalian people have not only smashed the
traditional walls that have enclosed Chinese people for thousands
of years, but have also opened a door to free their minds.
</P>
<P>
An old man, surnamed Li, said that the local governmental
organs gave an impression of mystery in the past. Now when people
pass through government buildings and officials can be seen busy
with work, they feel relaxed and at ease.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly acknowledged that the daily life in the city has
improved as a result of the local booming economy, more efficient
government, a higher living standard and a stabilized social
security system.

<HEADLINE> Dalian: City Without Enclosing Walls (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Dalian in northeast China has
become a city without walls, giving its population a fresh view of
the world.
</P>
<P>
City walls have been a common feature in China for thousands of
years, but in highly developed port city of Dalian it is hard to
find any walls.
</P>
<P>
In the city noted for its enthusiasm for football, there are
parks and squares and an abundance of lawns and trees, with deers
and peacocks roaming freely.
</P>
<P>
Governmental and Party organs have also joined in the spirit of
the new-look, without walls around their office buildings. Police
cars in front of public security bureaus are parked in neat lines,
and lawns at the people's court are like green carpets.
</P>
<P>
It started in 1995 when the local government decided to bring
down all walls and have them replaced with decorative iron
railings or white wooden fences.
</P>
<P>
The starting point was a government campaign to promote ethical
and cultural progress. And what the residents got in return was a
more beautiful and delighting living environment, as they joined
in the endeavor with their own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Parks started to launch operations to remove walls, various
improper entertainment places and unsightly selling points were
cleared, while pine trees, peony trees and tulips added a splash
of color to the city.
</P>
<P>
Residential areas were also cleared of enclosure walls, with
flowers and grass growing without any obstacles. Clean walkways
and new buildings add to a perfect harmonious picture of the
coastal city in Liaoning Province, to illustrate the way a city
without walls has led to a better-off life.

<HEADLINE> China Closes More CD Production Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials have closed
more illegal CD production lines, brining the total number to over
20 within one month, it was announced today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state "Anti-Porn" work group revealed that
the underground production lines were all located in the southern
province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"They were involved in the production of unauthorized and
pornographic laser discs and compact discs. The authorities closed
them after receiving reports from the public. Some of the suspects
have been arrested," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the production lines had been imported from
the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and other foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The government has given rewards to citizens who provided clues
to help close the plants. According to a new regulation, to report
one production line, the informant can obtain 300,000 yuan (37,000
US dollars) in reward.
</P>
<P>
"After the crackdown, there are few underground production line
that are still in operation," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
China has been carrying out a new crackdown on pirated and
pornographic materials since early December. The move features the
closure of underground CD production lines, a measure serving to
"eradicate the roots".
</P>
<P>
Seven provinces and cities where piracy was rampant have been
targeted, with a number of wholesale markets and printing plants
being closed and criminal gang dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the campaign is significant as a means
of curbing copyright infringement, keeping order in the culture
market, safeguarding the country's stability and image, and
improving citizens' morality.

<HEADLINE> Fake Banknotes Found in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The counterfeit money
floating in the top of the North Island in New Zealand has now
turned up in Wellington, TVNZ reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police said a man tried to use a suspicious looking 100 dollar
note at a bar in the central city. He fled with the note when
challenged by the bar staff.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 dollars of counterfeit notes were seized
before Christmas. Since then, they had appeared in Hamilton,
Auckland, Rotorua and other cities in the North Island in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Police have made a number of arrests for possession of fake
money, but have not determined the source of the counterfeits. But
they believe professional printing premises are being used to
produce the notes.
</P>
<P>
The counterfeits, in 100 dollar notes and 20 dollar notes,
have no watermark and the solid vertical strip clearly visible on
the genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
However, the Reserve Bank has indicated that it has no plans to
make changes to the way it makes banknotes.
</P>
<P>
Bank spokesman Gordon Dry said the amount of counterfeits
turning up is tiny compared with the total banknotes in
circulation.

<HEADLINE> Germany Confident in NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said here today the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) could erase Russia's obstruction to its eastward expansion
before the Madrid summit scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he believed that the Western military alliance
could reach at the Madrid summit an agreement on the eastward
expansion and on the setup of a special partnership relation with
Russia for security matters.
</P>
<P>
He said the West must recognize Russia's equal partnership
status as well as its role in consultations among the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialized nations and at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He suggested that NATO and Russia establish a "close
consultative mechanism," and renew the treaties on reduction of
nuclear arms and disarmament of conventional arms in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO should declare to abandon the deployment of
nuclear weapons on the territories of its new members from the
former East bloc and work out accords on joint military exercises
and deployment of heavy weapons and troops.
</P>
<P>
On January 4, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Russia as
the first Western leader to tour the country this year. During his
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Yeltsin restated the
country's opposition to NATO's expansion.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Bail Out Commercial Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has decided
to speed up the recovery of the bad debt-ridden Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) with a 60 billion baht (2.4 billion US dollar) fund
to be operating over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The decision announced Tuesday marked the first time the
central bank had made it clear how much money it intended to spend
to help the BBC's recovery.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be spread in annual installments to clear the
bank's bad debt and recall low-quality debt, according to a
Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has estimated the BBC's bad debt loan at 40
billion baht (1.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The central bank's supporting scheme is aimed at making the BBC
still attractive to prospective bidders and to encourage a quicker
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The fund, called the financial institutions development fund,
currently holds 56 percent share in the BBC, which was near
bankruptcy because of mismanagement and embezzlement by its senior
executives over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The fund's burden would be covered through the sale of the
fund's BBC shares.
</P>
<P>
Fund director Sawangchit Jaiyawat said, "the quicker we can
rehabilitate the bank and make the bank operate by itself, the
more confident foreigners will be in the Thai economy."
</P>
<P>
The fund currently has assets of 90 billion baht (3.6 billion
dollars), contributed by local banks and finance companies which
must donate 0.1 percent of total deposits annually.
</P>
<P>
A new bidding round to operate the bank will be announced as
soon as bid details are worked out and approved by the Bank of
Thailand and the Finance Ministry, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Reaffirms Support to Peru in Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Rio Group, of 12 Latin American
nations, reaffirmed today its support to the efforts being made by
the Peruvian government for a peaceful end to the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The group's stand was contained in a communique read by
Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar after a meeting at the
Bolivian embassy with Ecuadoran and Paraguayan representatives.
</P>
<P>
The group expressed "its solidarity with the people and
government of Peru as well as with the foreign diplomats and
Peruvian authorities and those are still being held hostage."
</P>
<P>
The message is similar in content to the group's statement made
on December 18, a day after the hostage crisis broke out at the
Lima residence of Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki.
</P>
<P>
It expressed "its firm hope for the prompt release of all the
people who continue to be unjustly deprived of their liberty" by
members of the rebel Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
</P>
<P>
The Rio Group, formally established in 1990, has 12 members
including Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico and Peru. Bolivia,
Paraguay and Ecuador currently is serving as the "troika" to
preside over the forum of the group on rotational basis.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, the Bolivian foreign minister has
expressed support for the Peruvian government's position for a
peaceful solution to secure the lives of 74 remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
Aranibar said the four presumed MRTA members serving time in
Bolivian prisons for their involvement in kidnapping Samuel Doria
Medina, a former Bolivian minister and industrialist, will not be
released.

<HEADLINE> Germany Helps to Rebuild Sri Lanka's North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The German government has made a
grant to Sri Lanka to rehabilitate its war-torn Jaffna peninsula
in the north, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Germany will implement water supply schemes
for Jaffna municipal area, Karaveddi, Kampolai, Navatkuli,
Watharawatti, Point Pedro and Kayts regions.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels who have been waging a 14-year war for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The German project is the largest so far after the armed forces
brought Jaffna back under government control in May last year.
</P>
<P>
A four-member German technical cooperation team has already
visited Jaffna and studied the situation. They said that they were
confident of implementing the water schemes there.
</P>
<P>
Germany has also pledged to repair 336 schools which were
damaged by the war, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are also underway to secure further German
assistance to rebuild damaged houses and to expand the
Kankesanturai harbor.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Germany, a British team has reportedly toured Jaffna
city to explore the possibility of providing electricity to the
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Calls for Attention to Somalia's Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A top representative of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to Somalia warned today against
neglect of the emergency in the war-ravaged East African nation.
</P>
<P>
Agostino Paganini, the U.N. specialized agency's new ambassador
to Somalia, told a press conference here: "Ignoring Somalia now
will be very costly in the future for the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Somalia has ended up in oblivion," Paganini said, partly
attributing the situation to the media's abandoning of the country.
</P>
<P>
"This would not be a big problem if it did not have
repercussions on the actions of international governments and
organizations, which end up forgetting a Somalia that still
deserves to be considered an emergency," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The international community, the U.N. official said, should
help Somalia's autonomous local governments forge a "solidarity of
government," or the unrest could spread throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Paganini complained of insufficient assistance funds for
Somalia, especially compared with 1992, when more than 50 million
U.S. dollars were at UNICEF's control.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we can count on just one-fifth of that amount,
one-third of which is used to upkeep the UNICEF structure there,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF today announced programs to help women and children,
particularly with education, which was virtually nonexistent
during the six-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, leaders from Somalia's 26 armed sects met
in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Abeba and agreed to form the
National Salvation Council of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The council was expected to initiate a national meeting aiming
at ending the war that began with the oust of former President
Mohamed Siad in December 30, 1990.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Panel to Continue Studying Gulf War Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered a presidential panel to continue searching for the
cause of the mysterious illnesses afflicting Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
The executive order came after the panel, known as the
Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses,
presented its final report with no definite conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The physical toll of severe stress may prove a more likely
explanation for the sickness than the nerve gas many soldiers
blame, said the panel, whose mandate was set to expire today.
</P>
<P>
Declaring an extension of nine months of the committee's
mandate, Clinton said, "We haven't ended the suffering, we don't
have all the answers, and I won't be satisfied until we have done
everything humanly possible to find them."
</P>
<P>
The committee also criticized the Pentagon for inadequately
investigating the illnesses, popularly known Gulf War syndrome,
reported by veterans who participated in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's early probes of chemical weapons exposure have
"lacked vigor, fallen short on investigative grounds and stretched
credibility" and are responsible for "mistrust that now surrounds
every aspect of Gulf War veterans' illnesses," said the panel of
12 independent doctors and scientists.
</P>
<P>
Some veterans blame exposure to Iraqi chemical weapons for the
illnesses. The Pentagon vehemently denied that possibility until
last June, when it admitted 20,000 troops were in the vicinity of
an Iraqi chemical weapons depot that was blown up by Americans
after the Gulf War in March, 1991.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Profits Decline But Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Squeezed between higher production
costs and lower market demands, Italian companies have cut down on
their profit margins to survive, more on the external market.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released today showed labor cost rises of 1.7,
1.0 and 0.5 percent in last year's first three quarters pushed up
the production cost by 0.6, 0.2 and 0.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the National Statistics Bureau (ISTAT),
the cost of prime resources kept rather stable.
</P>
<P>
The overall cost increase, along with slow demands, hit hard on
the sales services sector, where the gross profit margin was down
0.4 percent in the first quarter and 0.8 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
However, said the ISTAT in its latest report, 1996 was a good
year for Italy's export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
Keen to adjust prices and costs, and to deal with a swift
strengthening of the lira, the exporters enjoyed sales increases
of 0.2 and 0.4 percent in the first two quarters, and made a two
percent leap in the third.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Refugee Hijacks Airliner but Soon Overpowered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian airliner was hijacked
to Berlin today but the drama soon ended peacefully with the
hijacker overpowered by the police.
</P>
<P>
The police commandos, who secretly boarded the plane, pushed
the Bosnian hijacker out of an open door before he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police said none of the 28 passengers and five crew members
were hurt during the accident.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-87, took off from Berlin's
Tegel airport at 11:15 a.m. local time (1015 GMT) and was
scheduled to land on Vienna's Schwechat airport at 12:35
a. m. (1135 GMT).
</P>
<P>
However, a 39-year-old Bosnian broke into the cockpit as the
plane flew over Prague, capital of the Czech Republic. Wielding a
25 cm long knife and a 30 cm baton, the man forced the pilot to
turn back to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker demanded a right of residence in Germany when many
of the 320,000 Bosnian refugees in Germany faced repatriation
after the 43-month war in their country was ended.
</P>
<P>
The plane then returned to Berlin's Tegel airport. A translator
and police were preparing to negotiate with the hijacker when the
commandos struck.
</P>
<P>
Two police officers sneaked in the plane from the rear. They
stormed to the front and one of the officers was able to push the
hijacker, who was standing at an open door, out of the plane and
was arrested, said a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Police said the hijacker was charged with kidnapping and air
piracy and could face up to 15 years in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Austrian Airlines' history that a
plane has been hijacked.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Tegel airport has been renowned for its security
measures since the Cold War era, which includes body searches of
all passengers boarding aircraft. The police spokesman declined to
say how the man had managed to get the knife and the baton onto
the plane.

<HEADLINE> Manila-Rebels Peace Talks Make No Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
failed to achieve any substantial results in their initial peace
talks on Tuesday, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Technical Committee formed by both sides has not
discussed the proposed ceasefire agreement and has not come up
with any agenda on what to take up for the formal talks, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF claimed to have submitted a four-point agenda for a
"cessation of hostilities," but a joint press release signed by
the representatives of both sides did not mention them.
</P>
<P>
The statement merely said that both sides had "exchanged
position papers on cessation of hostilities, which are intended to
generate a favorable atmosphere for the formal peace talks."
</P>
<P>
As the negotiations went on, the Army announced that it did not
favor the MILF's demand for government soldiers to pull out of the
areas it claimed to be under its control.
</P>
<P>
The MILF wants the military to pull out its forces in southern
Basilan island, and some areas in nearby Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad al-Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs,
said that the pullout of the government forces from these areas is
a prerequisite for the signing of a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Besides the withdrawal of government troops, the MILF also
listed three other conditions for formal talks to begin -- the
recognition of the MILF territories and the Geneva Convention on
War, and no more deployment of forces around the MILF camps.

<HEADLINE> High Export Figures Based on Tax Fraud, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Amnuay Virawan has blamed false reports for the high export growth
of 24 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday that in 1996
Thailand's export figures showed no increase because of a false
high export figure in the previous year as a result of exporters'
collusion with government officials to claim VAT (value-added tax)
refunds.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said a company might report its export value as 1,000
million baht while the actual export value is only 500 million
baht, in the hope of claiming a VAT refund.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said export figures have been distorted since 1992, the
year the VAT system was introduced in Thailand, a Bangkok Post
report today quotes him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said VAT refund fraud was most prevalent in 1995 during
the Democrat-led administration, which lasted until mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay believed that the export increase in 1995 should not be
over 10 percent of the previous year, and the 24 percent increase
was impossible.
</P>
<P>
The fraudulent VAT refunds are believed to total over 10,000
baht (400 million US dollars) in 1995 alone, according to a
Finance Ministry report.
</P>
<P>
However, no action was taken in connection with the VAT refund
fraud during the past few years for fear it could affect the
economic system and scare investors away.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, Amnuay urged the Interior Ministry to
take action and said both exporters and government officials who
are found involved in tax fraud must be punished according to the
law.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to try
and establish a common index to monitor air pollution in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached as ASEAN environment ministers
Tuesday met in Phuket in southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called for more action-oriented programs to
address problems caused by land-based and sea-based pollution
sources, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN environment ministers are seeking to harmonize air
pollution standards at the meeting. Thai officials present at the
meeting said that this is a tougher issue because of the diversity
of pollutants and their impacts.
</P>
<P>
The ministers believed that an index with each type of
pollutant given a certain weight may be a solution and countries
in the region will be given an air pollution rating based on how
much and what type of air pollution they have.
</P>
<P>
A more specific problem raised at the meeting was the haze
caused by forest fires and post-harvest burning in Indonesia,
which is then often blown by winds to affect Singapore and
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members earlier have agreed to harmonize their water
quality standards, but enforcement of the standards is only
voluntary, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The standards may be made legally binding in the future, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Yingphan Manasikarn, Thailand's Minister of Science, Technology
and Environment, said that the laws in each country should be
studied first to tighten control on marine pollution, like oil
spills.
</P>
<P>
Yingphan also expressed concern over the mercury pollution in
the Gulf of Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Air Force has
grounded all four of its remaining F-5 jet fighters following
Monday's crash of a F-5 during an exhibition flight, which left a
pilot and a farmer dead.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. William Hotchkiss, the Air Force commander, Tuesday
ordered a thorough inspection of the remaining F-5s to check for
defects.
</P>
<P>
Hotchkiss Monday witnessed the crash of the ill-fated F-5 in an
air base in the northern province of Pampanga, which killed a
pilot and a farmer fishing in a nearby river.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orlando Mercado also urged the Air Force to review the
plans to purchase units of refurbished F-5s from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Philippine Air Force will soon get a
squadron of updated F-5s from South Korea, which will serve as
training aircraft for the Air Force before it obtains more modern
fighters from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The F-5s, though antiquated, has been the sole jet fighters of
the country since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
As part of the country's drive to modernize its armed forces,
the Air Force has planned to procure two squadrons of multi-role
jet fighters from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Budget Deficit Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian government said
today it has succeeded in controlling its budget deficit in 1996
for the first time in five years, with the number decreased to
89.4 billion schilling (8.93 billion U.S. dollars), or 3.7 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the budget deficit can decrease to 68
billion schilling (6.8 billion dollars) in 1997, accounting for
only 2.7 percent of its GDP, Finance Minister Viktor Klima told a
news briefing.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Austria hopefully can qualify itself in time for
the European Union's target as set by the Maastricht Treaty, which
demands its member country's budget deficit accounting for 3
percent of its GDP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Klima attributed the decrease in budget deficit to the increase
in its revenue and spending cut in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Oil Deposits Estimated at 9 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is at present
estimated to have 9 billion barrels of oil deposits which are
expected to be exhausted within the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to find new oil resources are continuously
being conducted, an official of the state oil company Pertamina
said on Tuesday in Cirebon, central Java, Antara news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pertamina's Director for Exploration and Production Priyambodo
Mulyosudirjo said that Pertamina is very actively conducting
explorations to find new oil reserves, particularly in the eastern
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The oil reserves are decreasing, while the demand for fuel oil
is increasing so that at the end Indonesia could become a crude
oil importing country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are therefore being carried out to minimize the gap
between supply and demand through encouraging the use of natural
gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the use of geothermal energy for power generating,
Priyambodo said that at present geothermal power plants had an
installed capacity of 309 mw which was expected to increase to
1,200 mw by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan
(1994-1999).

<HEADLINE> Argentina: Bankruptcies Record High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,755 cases of
bankruptcy were registered in Argentina in 1996, the highest
number since the government put the convertibility plan
into operation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the bankruptcies in the country
last year increased by 50 percent over the 1995 figure, hitting
most hardly the sectors of textile industry, construction and
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
As most bankruptcies were caused by the employers' inability to
pay taxes, they together resulted in about 102.7 million pesos
(102.7 million U.S. dollars) of debts last year, up 45 percent
over the previous year and the highest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some most well-known companies in Argentina went bankrupt in
1996, including Electrodesticos Aurora.
</P>
<P>
Some other companies are facing problems with their
future existence, such as the state-owned Argentina Televisor
Color, which owed 70 million dollars but was able to bring it down
in November.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Names New Justice Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
today appointed Vlasta Parkanova as new justice minister to
replace Jan Kalvoda, who decided to resign last month after
admitting using a false academic title.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Havel today accepted Kalvoda's request to
resign from his cabinet post of justice minister and deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Kalvoda, leader of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) -- a
junior partner in the three-party coalition government, decided to
quit on December 17 after telling parliament in a surprising
speech that he "wasn't happy to be the next episode of a soap
opera, but the title Juris Doctor does not belong to me."
</P>
<P>
Havel had called on Kalvoda to re-consider his decision.
</P>
<P>
Parkanova, the only female in the coalition government, was an
ODA member and a former parliament deputy. The 45-year-old Doctor
of Law had been working in the foreign ministry and then the
interior ministry since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a new deputy prime minister has not been
decided yet.

MACAO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The mountain fire on a island of
Macao was put out by ten o'clock last night after burning for more
than five hours. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The fire was first noticed at about 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday on
the Taipa Island, one of Macao's two islands. Due to a strong
north wind, dry weather and a shortage of water, the fire burnt
more than 10,000 square meters of forest and bushes before being
put under control.
</P>
<P>
Firemen sent seven fire engines, including one long-armed
vehicle, in the action. It cost them more than five hours to put
out the fire completely.
</P>
<P>
The police is now investigating the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Macao fire departments and their counterparts in
neighboring Zhuhai City, China's Guangdong Province, will hold a
joint fire-fighting exercise on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 130 firemen and officers, plus 16 vehicles,

<HEADLINE> Shots Heard Around Japanese Embassy Compound in Lima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Three shots were heard early this
morning around the residential compound of Japan's ambassador in
Lima as the hostage deadlock entered its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
The shots were heard at 03:54 a.m. local time, but the reasons
for and consequences of the shots are still unknown. The police
immediately moved into a state of alert after the shots.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
occupied the Japanese compound on December 17 and took 490 people
as hostage to press for the release of 400 detained fellow
comrades.
</P>
<P>
Since then, most of the hostages have been released through the
mediation of the International Red Cross and other organizations.
Only 74 are remaining in the compound.
</P>
<P>
Television footage showed a man dressed in combat gear and
carrying an automatic rifle running across the driveway in the
compound shortly before the shots.
</P>
<P>
Police surrounding the compound speculated that the guerrillas
might be trying to make their presence felt after President
Alberto Fujimori repeated his "no compromise" stand.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori's government has been pushing for a peaceful solution
to the occupation and insisting that the guerrilla group lay down
its arms.
</P>
<P>
The hostages still held in the compound include Peruvian
Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, Agriculture Minister Rodolfo
Manante, Bolivian Ambassador Jorge Gumucio Granier and Japanese
Ambassador Morihisa Aoki.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control on Medicine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to rationalize the
pharmaceutical industry and accelerate reform, Chinese
administration departments are being urged to tighten examination
of new pharmaceutical projects to avoid duplication, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be taken to improve use of foreign
investment, to help make China a leading producer of medicines by
2010, said Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the State Pharmaceutical
Administration during a four-day national conference on the
pharmaceutical industry which opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed better techniques and facilities for
producing medical materials than for making finished preparations,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Yet only ten percent of Chinese manufacturers meet the
international Good Manufacturing Practice standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
The administration registered more than 5,600 factories in
1995, compared with 800 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent are small-sized enterprises, many of them
making low-level products which are already in strong supply and
can not compete with foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 pharmaceutical joint ventures have opened, making up
40 percent of all State-run pharmaceutical enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures have brought modern techniques and
facilities and have helped State-run enterprises improve their
market options and upgrade management, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
But few joint ventures use leading-edge technology, and many
sell the bulk of their products in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour pharmacy network will be set up in all Chinese cities
this year. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers must
improve after-sale services, and complaints from consumers should
be responded to within 24 hours, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Both manufacturing and marketing units must give proper
instructions on the effects of medicines. Advertisements must not
make exaggerated claims about the effects of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The administration aims for at least 50 medicine trading units
to achieve the international Good Sales Practice standard this
year, Zheng said.

<HEADLINE> Remittances From Overseas Filipino Workers Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The dollar remittances from
overseas Filipino workers are expected to reach 7.5 billion US
dollars in 1996, 59 percent higher than the 4.73 billion dollars
in the previous year, according to the country's labor
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said
the number of overseas Filipinos in 1996 declined by 0.53 percent
from 1995, attributing to regulations on the deployment of
vulnerable people like domestic helpers and entertainers.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Labor and Employment Leonardo Quisumbing said the
strict regulations allowed only highly skilled workers to be
deployed, more than making up for the decline in the number of
overseas Filipino workers in terms of remittances.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE said most of the workers deployed are engineers,
medical technologists, nurses, therapists, and computer
technicians who are highly in demand abroad.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, the dollar remittances of overseas
Filipino workers went up tremendously, making them the real
propellers of national growth and development, the DOLE said.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE stressed that while the government aims to reduce the
deployment of landbased workers by 10 percent, it aims to increase
the deployment of Filipino seafarers in international vessels by
10,000 yearly.
</P>
<P>
There are at present 4.2 million overseas Filipino workers,
including some 165,000 Filipino mariners in ocean-going vessels.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' International Reserves Hit All-time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' international
reserves reached an all-time high of 12.1 billion U.S. dollars as
of Monday, according to the Philippine Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The current level is an increase of 198 million dollars from
the end-1996 level of 11.84 billion dollars and a 55 percent jump
from the end-1995 level of 7.77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The huge reserves strongly helped in shoring up the value of
the peso from a stable 26.293 pesos to the U.S. dollar to 26.287
pesos as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said Tuesday the increase
was due to the steady inflow of remittances from the country's
over 4.2 million overseas Filipino professionals and contract
workers.
</P>
<P>
For the entire 1996, the central bank expected the remittances
from overseas workers to reach more than 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the central bank had expected the country's
international reserves to reach the current level at the end of
1996. But the goal was not achieved due to the repayment of debts
and the central bank's intervention in the foreign exchange
market, he added.

BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok
failed to take away British Prime Minister John's reserves with
regard to the reform of the European Union during their informal
meeting this evening in the Hague, the Dutch television reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the television report, Major said after the
meeting that he had made clear to his Dutch counterpart that
Britain's concern at the EU's reform was "upright."
</P>

Major has reportedly told Kok that Europe needs "a good dose of
British pragmatism."

the EU.
</P>
<P>
But during the talks he said the EU must be flexible to reach
agreement on its future.

London has made objections to, among other things, the proposal
to restrict the veto right in the EU's decision making and to
strengthen the EU's employment and social policies.

Major was invited to the Netherlands to calm Dutch fears that
the British election would harm progress in the EU.

President Jacques Santer and other members of the commission.

LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A police patrol with two vehicles
survived a bomb attack today in Londonerry, the second-largest
city of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
None of the officers in either of the vehicles was hurt in the
blast, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted as saying that it was not
immediately clear if a bomb had exploded at the side of the road
or whether it had been fired at the patrol.
</P>
<P>
The incident came as police in Northern Ireland questioned two
men over an Irish Republican Army (IRA) rocket attack on the High
Court in Belfast Monday.
</P>
<P>
After that attack by the IRA, which is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland, security forces were on heightened alert
for further violence.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, is pressing for inclusion
in multi-party peace talks, but British Prime Minister John Major
said the rocket attack made it difficult to see how this could be
achieved.

</P>
<P>
The award consists of a certificate of appreciation and a
monetary prize of 2,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Delia Buratto was nominated for her work in Zimbabwe. According
to the nomination, over three years as a U.N. volunteer, and as a

remarkably broad and very significant impact on population action
and thinking in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bhagwan Shrestha of Nepal was nominated for his work in Guyana.
Traveling throughout the country, Shrestha trained the Guyana
Responsible Parenthood Association's staff, health professionals,
educators, and community leaders in information, education and

Coordinator of the U.N. Volunteers Brenda Gael McSweeney and by
UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Nafis Sadik at a ceremony here at the

</P>
<P>
"The population dimension has to be addressed," said Ms.
McSweeny, "whether one is working in agriculture, education,
health and the like."
</P>
<P>
"If no account is taken of population dynamics, even the best
planned initiatives may fail. That is why the U.N. Volunteers is
delighted that, every year, some 50 of its specialists assist
the initiatives of the UNFPA, in demography, public health, or
census taking."
</P>
<P>
"The UNFPA award is a most relevant and imaginative way of
marking the 25 years of service of the U.N. Volunteers," she said.

NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Web surfers
visited shopping sites and ordered articles on line last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics quoted by the Journal of Commerce show that in 1996,
the percentage of people of the United States doing on-line
shopping doubled from 12.5 percent to 25 percent in September.
Meanwhile, the numbers of home Web surfers grew from 6.4 million
households in January to 11 million in October.
</P>
<P>
Free-to-download software and sales of computer-related
equipment used to drive much of the cyber-shopping activity. But
in recent months, things have diversified.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 shopping destinations on the Web include three sites
that sell music CDs and one bookseller, the paper reported. Also,
the retail giant Wal-Mart has emerged as a top-25 Web-shopping
site.
</P>
<P>
The continued growth of the medium was bolstered by a surge of
holiday shoppers towards the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Cyber-retailers can use less expensive warehousing facilities.
They are not burdened by the real-estate costs of traditional
stores.
</P>
<P>
Men represent the greatest percentage of cyber-shoppers, since
most of Web surfers are men. And among the top 10 shopping sites,
those most heavily dominated by males were computer related.
</P>
<P>
Female shoppers are best represented at sites offering consumer
goods.

<HEADLINE> US 105th Congress Takes Oath of Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Republican-led
105th U.S. Congress were sworn into office today with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich re-elected to a second-term and a passing of
procedural rules.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony marked the second time since 1931 that Republicans
have held majorities in both the House and Senate for two
successive Congresses.
</P>
<P>
Sworn in were all the 435 members of the House, including 74
new faces, as House terms last two years, meaning the entire
chamber must be sworn in at the start of each new Congress.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four senators also took their oaths -- 15 taking the
oath for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, the House elected its speaker. With a
total of 425 votes cast for candidates, Gingrich won a second-term
by receiving 216 votes against Democratic leader Dick Gephardt,
who had 205, and some others, who got the support from one or two
members.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich enters the 105th Congress under a cloud cast by ethics
violations and possible disciplinary action. Following a two-year
investigation, he admitted recently that he had used charitable
donations for partisan political use. But he denied intentionally
breaking any rules.
</P>
<P>
Taking up the gavel as new term speaker, Gingrich told the
House, "To whatever degree in any way that I brought controversy
or inappropriate attention to the House, I apologize."
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention to do everything I can to work with every
member of this Congress," Gingrich said. "I apologize to the House
and the country for having done so. Some of it is part of the
natural process of partisan competition."
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the 105th Congress was gaveled to order, the
Republicans rebuffed a Democratic attempt to postpone the
speaker's election until Gingrich's ethics case is completed. The
Republicans prevailed on the 222-210 procedural vote, clearing the
way for balloting on whether Gingrich should keep his office.
</P>
<P>
But some Republicans demonstrated their dissatisfaction with
Gingrich. Four Republicans voted against Gingrich and five
others abstained by voting "present."
</P>
<P>
The White House said President Bill Clinton was expected to
call Gingrich and Gephardt later in the day.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
summoned senior envoys from two rival Kurdish factions in northern
Iraq for a meeting at the State Department this week to arrange a
summit between their leaders in Turkey next months.
</P>
<P>
The envoys from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) will meet jointly Thursday with
Assistant Secretary of State Rober Pelletreau, who is brokering a
reconciliation between the two feuding sides, U.S. officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said the representatives
will "be talking about how there can be reconciliation in northern
Iraq." But senior U.S. officials said their discussions will focus
on preparations for the summit between KDP leader Massoud Barzani
and PUK leader Jalal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the two Kurdish factions went into clashes in
northern Iraq, resulting in Iraqi troops entering the once
U.S.-designated Kurdish enclave to help Barzani seize large chunks
of territory previously under the control of his rival Talabani.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of protecting the Kurdish people, the
United States launched two missile attacks on Iraqi air-defense
systems in southern Iraq, and evacuated more than 5,000 Kurds from
northern Iraq after the area was lost to the Iraqi troops.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Ready to Consider Possibilities to  Create Fund for Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government is ready to
discuss with banks and organizations concerned the possibilities
of setting up a fund for Jewish people who left assets in Swiss
banks during World War Two, said the Swiss federal council
(government) today in a declaration.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, 1996, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the Swiss
president during the war, rejected the demand for creating a
compensation fund of 250 million Swiss francs (about 200 million
U.S. dollars) for Jewish victims by Nazi Germany during World War
Two.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Swiss reporters, Delamuraz said that the
creation of a compensation fund is not a good idea, which could
make the investigation of the alleged Jewish assets in Swiss banks
more difficult. He dismissed the demand as "no less than ransom
and chantage."
</P>
<P>
During the past week, the declaration said, organizations like
the World Jewish Congress and the United States made statements
criticizing Delamuraz's speech.
</P>
<P>
Delivered after a conference of council members by telephone
this morning, the declaration is aimed to reaffirm the
government's position on the controversial compensation fund
clearly.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Swiss government has to wait for the results
of the investigation by an independent commission of experts
established at the end of last year, before taking any measures
like the creation of a compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it said, the government is ready to discuss
with banks and organizations concerned the possibilities of
setting up a fund in favor of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
Delamuraz, now Swiss minister of economy, today regretted again
that his frank words have hurt the feelings of the Nazi holocaust
victims and their families.

CAIRO, January 7 (Xinhua) --The following are business briefs

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Trading dipped by 40.7 per cent and prices shed nearly
4 percent at the stock market in 1996 over the previous year, said
an annual report of the Amman Financial Market (AFM) showed.
</P>
<P>
The decline could be largely attributed to the political
uncertainties surrounding the Middle East peace process, said
Wahib Shair, the AFM director-general.
</P>
<P>
"Investors preferred to keep a low profile and kept their
capital and holdings largely to themselves during the year,"
said Shair.
</P>
<P>
Another depressing factor was high interest rates, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The AFM's annual report showed that trading during 1996 was
286.6 million Jordan dinars (about 403.7 million U.S. dollars),
down 40.7 per cent from the 1995 volume of 418.9 million
dinars (about 590 million dollars).

ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states would
raise import tariffs on tobacco and cigarettes to 100 percent by
the year 2000, Khaleej Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Omani Minister of Health DR. Ali bin
muhammad bin Moussa as saying that duties on tobacco and
cigarettes in the Gulf states would go up to 70 percent this year
from the present 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it would rise to 100 percent by the year
2000 in a move to discourage smoking in the GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that some of the Gulf companies have
agreed to launch campaigns to highlight the risks of smoking,
which include lung cancer and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister is here to attended two-day GCC Health
Ministers meeting which conclude here Sunday.

TEHRAN -- Iran's oil prices of light and heavy crude hit a
record of 22.5 U.S. dollars per barrel in the international
market in the past nine months, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Persian daily Iran, Iran's oil export revenue
would exceed the pre-set annual target by 2.67 billion
U.S. dollars, in view of the price hikes in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The oil export revenue is expected to amount to 18.67
billion dollars during this Iranian calendar year which ends
March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Oil Ministry did not disclose
the detailed prices of light and heavy crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the average price of the Iranian oil
was 18 dollars per barrel during the last Iranian fiscal year.
The figure shows that the Iranian oil price has risen by 4.5
dollars per barrel during this Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The official from the Oil Ministry warned that the crude
prices would not stay as high as they are now due to the
re-entry of Iraq into the oil market and the expected drop
in oil consumption in Spring.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Middle East as a whole absorbs about 40
percent of global arms exports with the Gulf arms bazar being the
richest and most complex in the world.
</P>
<P>
The six member states of the Gulf Cooperation council (GCC)
are the largest procurers, according to the latest issue of Gulf
Business published in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The monthly magazine said that the major reason for the active
buying is the need to protect the region's oil resources which are
the basis for the region's wealth and prosperity as well as the
engine that drives the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States is a key factor in the GCC's
defense strategy, adding that the special relationship between
the U.S. and the Gulf countries since the Gulf War has had
several major effects on the region's arms purchase.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its allies have managed to remain the
principle source of weapons for the GCC, despite attempts by
other countries to breach this wall.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the largest single arms buyer in the world
with a defense budget of 13.2 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The arms purchases by countries in the region include advanced
main battles tanks, aircrafts, missiles and other heavy equipment,
the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
It said that great potential of arms deals in the Middle
East, mainly the Gulf region, exists in the future.

</P>
<P>
Gingrich became the first Republican re-elected speaker in 68
years.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 425 votes cast for candidates, Gingrich won
216; Democratic leader Dick Gephardt had 205; Rep. Jim Leach,

The remaining five million dollars will be used to help
Angolan refugees return their home, Steinberg added.
</P>
<P>
He said although he is optimistic about the smooth peace process
in Angola, there are a big deal of work yet to be done, citing
the return of the deputies of the opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to the parliament.

<HEADLINE> US to Send Mediator to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said today that it will send a mediator to Cyprus next weekend to
try to promote a settlement on the Mediterranean island amid
rising tensions provoked by the Cypriot government's purchase of
Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
Carey Cavanaugh, the American mediator, will take with him U.S.
proposals to reduce military tensions by urging Turkey and Greece
to restrict their military overflights of the island and reducing
troops along the dividing line between Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sectors.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh will make stops in Athens and Ankara as well as
Nicosia in a week-long trip, during which he intends to go beyond
the military steps to sound out all sides on what a settlement
might look like, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has criticized the Cypriot government for
purchasing Russian SA-10 missiles systems with a 144 kilometer
range, saying the military deal will only introduce a new
"destabilizing" element on the island.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said lasting security
and peace for the people of Cyprus should be achieved "at the
bargaining table with all sides committed to finding a solution."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ignores U.S. objections and its Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides said in Nicosia that the missiles are "purely for
defense" and will not be used to attack anyone.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Russia also dismissed U.S. complaints, saying its
sale of the advanced air-defense system to the Cypriot government
cannot be perceived as a threat.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Moscow that Russia
has no intentions to end its military cooperation with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey again said today that it will unite with the breakaway
state of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"In no way can Cyprus be made to unite with Greece, be it
through the European Union or by any other way," Turkey's Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan said in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Burns, however, advised Turkey to be restrained in its response
to the Greek Cypriot government's deal with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope and believe there will be no military
reaction. That would be absolutely beyond bounds."

<HEADLINE> Serbian Ruling Party Condemns Attack on JUL Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A Serbian ruling party official
has condemned the hurling of an explosive at the Yugoslav United
Left (JUL) directorate building as "an act of terrorism" against
democracy, human rights and freedoms in Belgrade and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Zarko Obradovic, secretary of the Belgrade Committee of
Serbia's ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), said the incident
Monday evening was one of a series of incidents over the past two
months which were aimed at intimidating people and political
parties who had independent thinking and who are concerned about
Serbia and its citizens.
</P>
<P>
An explosive device was thrown at the building of the JUL
directorate in downtown Belgrade Monday night, causing substantial
material damage but without casualties. The JUL, a leftist party
headed by Mira Markovic, wife of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, formed the left coalition with the SPS in the November
federal parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the official Tanjug news agency and
to be published in the Belgrade daily Borba Wednesday, Obradovic
also said that a frangible grenade had been hurled at Belgrade SPS
municipal boards on the eve of the November 3 elections, causing
fires and great material damage.
</P>
<P>
State organs would find out the perpetrators and punish them in
accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obradovic said that the SPS headquarters in some Belgrade
municipalities had been bombed during protest marches by the
opposition coalition Zajedno (Together), and SPS offices were also

Zajedno has organized peaceful marches and demonstrations in
Belgrade over the past 50 days to protest against the annulment of

Obradovic stressed, "Everything indicates that these are
extremist forces who want to intimidate citizens and make
difficult the work of leftist parties and their partners."

"Solutions for all problems, including those in connection with
the local elections, must be found within the institutions of the
system, in dialogue and respect of facts; anything else can cause
developments which none of us would want," Obradovic said.

The attack on the JUL offices Monday was also condemned by the
independent student movement.
</P>
<P>
"The bomb attack on the offices of a political organization is
yet another in a series of attempts to introduce terrorism on
Serbia's political stage. We justly ask who is behind all this and
for whose interests, and what their ultimate intentions are," said
a statement of the independent student movement released by the
Tanjug news agency.
