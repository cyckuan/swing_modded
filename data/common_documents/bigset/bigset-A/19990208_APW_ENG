<HEADLINE> MGM Sues Sony Over Video Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc. sued Sony Pictures  
Entertainment, Columbia TriStar Home Video and other Sony 
subsidiaries Monday, accusing them of underreporting the earnings 
from overseas video sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court,  
seeks more than $20 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The breach-of-contract lawsuit claims Sony, which handled  
overseas video distribution for movies produced by MGM subsidiary 
Orion Pictures Corp. ``substantially and systematically 
underreported the proceeds of the films due to Orion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims Sony failed to report all revenues  
generated from the overseas video sales from 1985 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Giaquinta, a spokesman for Sony, declined comment Monday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't yet seen the lawsuit, only the press release.  
Unlike MGM, we do not litigate in the press. We will defend our 
rights in court, where we expect to prevail,'' Giaquinta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims that Sony reported overseas video sales from  
the movie ``Silence of the Lambs'' at $203.00 even though more than 
30,000 videos were sold. The suit also claims, among other things, 
that Sony refused Orion's request to review accounting books, and 
providing Orion with ``untimely, inaccurate, inadequate, incomplete 
and/or misleading accounting statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sony's resistance to pay monies they clearly owe Orion has  
left us with no alternative but to seek legal remedies,'' MGM's 
lawyer, Robert Brada, said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in '82 Murders Held in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Milwaukee laborer whose videotaped admission to  
two fatal shootings freed another man after 17 years on death row 
was held without bond Monday after the judge doubted his 
self-defense claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon, 48, was returned to jail while his estranged  
wife, Inez Jackson, was freed on bond after she promised to help 
prosecutors untangle the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Nicholas Ford said evidence that the two victims  
were both shot twice at close range made him doubt the shootings 
were an act of self defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Another man, Anthony Porter, 43, remains convicted of murdering  
Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, in what attorneys say was 
a dispute over drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, a private detective working with a  
Northwestern University investigative journalism class got a 
videotaped statement from Simon in which he admitted shooting the 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was freed on bond Friday after 17 years on death row  
while police got an arrest warrant for Simon, who surrendered over 
the weekend. He was silent in court Monday.

<HEADLINE> New Generation Rules the Pro Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The Pro Bowl turned into a showcase for the  
NFL's new generation of stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrone Law and Keyshawn Johnson were selected co-MVPs. Randy  
Moss was sensational and Jamal Anderson showed he can run over 
people as the AFC beat the NFC 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those young guys, they're fun to watch,'' said 38-year-old  
John Elway, who threw a 3-yard touchdown pass on the AFC's first 
possession then spent the rest of the game on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	New England's Law, in his fourth year in the league, had a  
67-yard interception return for a touchdown and also made five 
tackles and broke up three passes. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets' Johnson, who has played three NFL seasons,  
had seven catches for 87 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very deserving,'' Elway said of his AFC teammates.  
``I'm glad they got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law, who dedicated the game to injured Patriots' teammate Robert  
Edwards, said, ``I'm happy I came out and played well with the best 
and was named co-MVP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, asked if he was proud of his performance, said, ``Of  
course. It's an all-star game. You have a great time trying to 
perform as an all-pro and approaching each game during the regular 
season or the playoffs the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although overlooked in the MVP balloting, probably because he  
was on the losing side, Minnesota rookie Moss had seven receptions 
for 108 yards, both game highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who came into his own with Atlanta this season, his  
fifth, was limited to four carries for 21 yards, but 14 of those 
yards came on a spectacular run when he seemed to bowl over half 
the AFC defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm unstoppable,'' Anderson joked. ``It's a lot of fun to get  
recognized as one of the best players in the league. It's an honor, 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the young players are looking forward to great futures, a  
couple of players with great pasts -- Elway and Reggie White -- may 
have played their final game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, MVP of the Broncos' 34-19 Super Bowl win over Atlanta,  
plans to announce within the next couple of months whether he'll 
return for another season and a shot at an unprecedented three 
consecutive NFL titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My timetable on that is still the same,'' he said after  
Sunday's all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
	White, selected for the Pro Bowl 13 times, plans to retire, but  
he planned to retire last April and instead returned for another 
season with Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys I played with, I'll miss,'' the Packers' defensive  
end said after logging two tackles in the loss to the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
	White, an ordained minister, stressed the he still intends to  
retire, unless God tells him otherwise.

<HEADLINE> ABA: End Independent Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The American Bar Association voted  
overwhelmingly Monday to recommend letting the independent counsel 
law die when it expires in June, calling it a well-intentioned 
statute that has turned into ``the pursuit of the hunted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an abomination,'' said noted lawyer Judah Best of  
Washington. ``It should be removed from the books and the matter 
should be given back to the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote by the association's House of Delegates, 384-49, ended  
the group's 20-year history of support for the Watergate-era law. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Neal Sonnett, a member of an ABA task force that  
reexamined the law, lashed out at special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, 
whom he called ``the poster boy for the independent counsel 
statute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not promote confidence in our system of justice when  
the individual chosen to conduct an investigation of the president 
of the United States has never been a prosecutor or tried a 
criminal case,'' Sonnett said. ``It does not promote confidence ... 
when the grand jury secrecy rules are abrogated by leaks bigger 
than those on the Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, ABA President Philip A. Anderson told reporters he did  
not see the vote as a referendum on Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe this was reflecting on any one investigation  
or any one prosecutor,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which the ABA helped craft, was part of the 1978 Ethics  
in Government Act that sprang from the Watergate scandal of 
President Nixon's administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Civiletti, attorney general under President Carter,  
said it ``has produced unintended and terrible consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept deteriorated into ``a pursuit of the hunted'' and  
has become ``a Jean Valjean nightmare,'' he said -- a reference to 
the hero of the classic novel ``Les Miserables'' who is pursued 
relentlessly for a trivial crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA resolution recommends that the statute be allowed to  
expire in June. However, a clause urges drastic changes in the law 
should Congress decide to retain it.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Sets Up Exploratory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer formally  
filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to set up a 
presidential exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploratory committees allow potential candidates to raise and  
spend money on trips, polls and other activities designed to gauge 
support. However, potential candidates do not have to disclose 
contributions or expenditures until they officially enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer had announced Jan. 31 that he wanted to run for president,  
and the FEC received his papers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for his presidential bid, the former Reagan  
administration official took a leave of absence as head of the 
Family Research Council, which under Bauer's leadership has come to 
rival the Christian Coalition as the voice of grassroots 
conservative activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans setting up exploratory committees include  
Arizona Sen. John McCain, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and 
former Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander. On the Democratic 
side, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley have 
established committees to run for president.

<HEADLINE> Truck Rams Van Carrying 11 Marines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An alleged drunken driver in a stolen pickup  
being chased by the highway patrol rammed a van overcrowded with 
Marines, killing one and injuring 10 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines, all from Camp Pendleton, were headed for a few  
days' leave late Sunday night when the truck thief ran into the 
back of the A-1 Shuttle van they were riding in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pvt. 1st Class Ryan O. Cooty, 18, suffered abdominal injuries  
and died Monday afternoon, said Camp Pendleton spokesman Sgt. 
Timothy Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle van was designed to carry only six passengers and a  
driver, but 11 Marines were stuffed inside, including some in the 
rear luggage area, said San Diego Police Detective Dan Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if any of the Marines were wearing seat belts.  
</P>
<P>
	One Marine remained in serious condition Monday, one was in fair  
condition and the rest had been treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged driver of the stolen pickup, 19-year-old Leonard  
Sambrano, was under guard at a hospital after being arrested on 
suspicion of four felonies, including drunken driving, auto theft 
and evading with injury. 
</P>
<P>
	His passenger, 20-year-old Narciso Gonzalez, was also under  
arrest at a hospital on suspicion of possession of a stolen 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conditions were not available.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Exec Discusses Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Microsoft executive testified Monday about  
lucrative incentives the company dangled before clients to force 
them to promote Microsoft's Internet browser and abandon the one 
made by rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates used such incentives himself to  
cinch deals. He described them in a 1996 e-mail to executives that 
described his negotiations with Scott Cook, founder of Intuit, 
which makes the popular financial software Quicken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite frank with him that if he had a favor we could do  
for him that would cost us something like $1 million to do that in 
return for switching browsers in the next few months I would be 
open to doing that,'' Gates said in the July 1996 memo. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit signed a deal with Microsoft the following spring.  
</P>
<P>
	The memo came up during Microsoft's antitrust trial. Department  
of Justice attorney David Boies used it to demonstrate how the 
software giant allegedly took advantage of its monopoly power to 
crush its competition. The government contends Microsoft often used 
illegal tactics to discourage clients from distributing the browser 
made by Netscape, which once dominated the Internet software 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies used the e-mail during his cross-examination of William  
Poole, Microsoft's director of business development. Poole helped 
negotiate the Intuit deal, which was structured around the Windows 
``channel bar,'' a list of prominent Internet sites that appears 
when a computer using Windows is turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit was offered a prime spot on the channel bar in a contract  
that prohibited the company from promoting Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit President and Chief Executive Officer William Harris  
testified earlier in the trial about learning ``that any such 
agreement would require, as a condition, that Inuit forgo any 
business relationships with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Poole said that Intuit agreed to the restriction because a  
place on the Windows desktop was ``very important to them.'' The 
spot would help provide access to millions of computer users, given 
that more than 90 percent of all personal computers use the Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole said the exclusionary contract was not that different from  
those signed between major businesses, particularly in the soft 
drink, restaurant and amusement industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreements are common place with Coke and McDonald's or  
Disney with McDonald's... to accomplish business objectives,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole also was questioned about plans to generate revenues from  
the channel bar. Poole admitted that Microsoft initially thought it 
could get some companies to pay $10 million a piece for placement 
on the channel bar -- potentially earning about $100 million 
annually. Microsoft ultimately decided against charging for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, the estimate was totally incorrect,'' Poole  
said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Closing Arguments-5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Monday's closing arguments in the impeachment  
trial against President Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 

</P>
<P>
	``I have started this process with great concern and I leave  
with a lot of contentment, because I believe the facts have stood 
the test of every type scrutiny, demagoguery you can throw at them. 
And they stand, they stand firm. And you know what? They're going 
to stand, they're going to stand the test of history.'' -- Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe that the president of the United States is a  
victim of Ms. Lewinsky, we all owe him an apology. He is not. He is 
not. You ask me why I want this president removed? Not only are 
there high crimes, not only do they arise to the level of 
Constitutional out-of-bounds behavior, not only are they worse than 
what you remove judges for -- they show a tremendous willingness as 
a national leader to put yourself above anything decent and good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that still matters in America.'' -- Graham  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do today will put a burden on the White House and the  
burden on our future -- one way or the other. Is it too much of a 
burden to say to future presidents: Don't fabricate stories in 
front of a grand jury. Don't parse words. Don't mislead. Don't lie 
when you're begged not to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it too much to say to a president: If you're ever sued,  
play it straight? Don't hide the gifts under the bed? Don't get 
people to file false testimony for you? Don't try to trash out 
people who are witnesses against you? If that's too much of a 
burden to put on the White House, this nation is in hopeless 
decline. It is not too much of a burden, ladies and gentlemen. It 
is only common decency being applied to the occupant of the White 
House.'' -- Graham 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my country to go boldly into the next century. I don't  
want us to limp into the next century. I don't want us to crawl in 
the next century regarding the rule of law.'' -- Graham 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Our most formidable opponent has not been opposing counsel nor  
any political party. It's been the cynicism -- the widespread 
conviction that all politics and all politicians are by definition 
corrupt and venal. That cynicism is an acid eating away at the 
vital organs of American public life. It is a clear and present 
danger because it blinds us to the nobility and the fragility of 
being a self-governing people.'' -- Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing begets cynicism like the double standard -- one rule  
for the popular and the powerful and another for the rest of us.'' 
-- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Infidelity is private and non-criminal. Perjury and  
obstruction are public and criminal. The deliberate focus on what 
is not an issue here is the defense lawyer's tactic and nothing 
more. This entire saga has been a theater of distraction and 
misdirection.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's defenders stay away from the word 'lie'  
preferring 'mislead' or 'deceived,' but they shrink from the phrase 
'sanctity of the oath,' fearing it as one might a rattlesnake.'' -- 
Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the managers has committed perjury, nor obstructed  
justice, nor claimed false privileges. None has hidden evidence 
under anyone's bed, nor encouraged false testimony before the grand 
jury. That's what you do if you want to win too badly.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the  
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed 
justice. The defense spent a lot of time picking lint.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We all claim to revere the Constitution, but a censure is  
something that is a device, a way of avoiding the harsh 
constitutional option, and it's the only one you have, either up or 
down on impeachment.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A failure to convict will make a statement that lying under  
oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious. 
Perhaps we can explain this to those currently in prison for 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but  
only if you are the president. Wherever and whenever you avert your 
eyes from a wrong, from an injustice, you become a part of the 
problem. On the subject of civil rights, it's my belief this issue 
doesn't belong to anyone. It belongs to everyone. It certainly 
belongs to those who have suffered invidious discrimination and one 
would have to be catatonic not to know that the struggle to keep 
alive equal protection of the law never ends.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you agree that perjury and obstruction of justice have been  
committed, and yet you vote down the conviction, you're expending 
and expanding the boundaries of permissible presidential conduct. 
You're saying a perjurer and an obstructer of justice can be 
president in the face of no less than three precedents for 
conviction of federal judges for perjury. You shred those 
precedents and you raise the most serious questions of whether the 
president is in fact subject to the law, or whether we are 
beginning a restoration of the divine rights of kings.'' -- Hyde 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe being a senator, being a congressman, and struggling  
with all our might for equal justice for all is a great enterprise. 
It's our great enterprise. And to my House managers, your great 
enterprise was not to speak truth to power, but to shout it. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now let us all take our place in history on the side of  
honor, and oh yes, let right be done.'' -- Hyde

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Monarchy Lies Forgotten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- In a yellow brick mausoleum, under a marble  
tomb engraved with golden writing, lies the body of an Iraqi king -- 
rarely visited and barely remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	In a neighboring nation, another king lies in state -- but his  
death is being mourned by millions, and his legacy appears likely 
to endure for years. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be hard to find a more vivid example of irony than that  
of the two Hashemite cousins: the internationally popular King 
Hussein of Jordan, who died Sunday, and Iraq's scarcely known last 
king, Faisal II, whose grave received its first visitors in a week 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We open the doors for people every day, but nobody wants to  
see what's inside. I don't think royalty matters much to people 
now,'' said Moheb Abdel Amir, the caretaker of the Royal Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	The turquoise-domed mausoleum's arched gateway leads to a  
circular, white and black marbled floor. Two antechambers to the 
left and right contain the tombs of Faisal II, his father Ghazi, 
and grandfather, Faisal I, the first king of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's grandfather, Abdullah, and Faisal II's grandfather  
were brothers who were installed kings of Jordan and Iraq by the 
British after World War I as a reward for the help their father, 
Sherif Hussein of Mecca, gave the British in the war. 
</P>
<P>
	It was this political chess move that locked the destinies of  
the two branches of the Hashemite family, the descendants of 
Islam's Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's king proved to be a strong leader, steering the country  
to peace with Israel and friendship with the West. With the death 
of Jordan's Hussein, his son, Abdullah, has taken over in what so 
far appears to be a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iraq, the Faisal lineage ended in 1958 when the monarchy was  
overthrown in an army coup. The present government, under President 
Saddam Hussein, has been in constant clashes with the Western 
powers since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Faisal II, unmarried, was shot in his palace garden at age 23.  
Some say his body was dragged across town before being buried 
outside the Royal Cemetery. With monarchy discredited under 
socialist governments, an entire generation grew up learning little 
about him or his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The royal family was given back its place in Iraq's history in  
the 1980s as a goodwill gesture to Jordan's Hussein for backing 
Saddam during his 1980-88 war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	A statue of King Faisal I was put up in a downtown square, where  
mobs had destroyed the original in the 1958 revolution. The Royal 
Cemetery, which was overrun with weeds, was rebuilt. Faisal II's 
remains were moved inside. 
</P>
<P>
	As Amir, the caretaker, was finishing his afternoon prayers, a  
couple with a baby and their elderly aunt walked in to pray at the 
graves. They said they were driving past the mausoleum and decided 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are history. History will stay for our sons and their  
sons. We have to show respect for history,'' said Salima Nasser, 
the aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	She and the others hadn't heard about King Hussein's death,  
which had been announced an hour earlier in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter told them, they recited traditional Islamic  
prayers: ``May God have mercy on his soul. May God widen his grave. 
May He shine light on his grave.''

	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- At the midpoint of the World Alpine Ski  
Championships, the powerful Austrian team has been, if anything, 
even more dominating than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of a possible 15 medals, the Austrian men and women have  
combined to claim 10, including four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	In their most authoritative performance to date, the Austrians  
swept the top four places in the women's downhill Sunday, led by 
gold-medalist Renate Goetschl. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to atone for her disappointing showing in the 1998  
Olympics in Nagano, Goetschl raised her medal haul to three in 
these championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great world championships,'' Goetschl said. ``My  
goal was to win any medal, because at Nagano I put too much 
pressure on myself and went home without anything. Now I have won 
three medals. This has been an unforgettable week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With downhill stars Picabo Street of Sun Valley, Idaho, and  
Katja Seizinger of Germany recuperating from injuries, the door was 
open for the Austrians to dominate, and they barged in. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second medal sweep by the Austrian women here; they  
claimed the top three places in the super-G on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, who already captured silver medals in both the super-G  
and combined events here, had slower times than teammate Michaela 
Dorfmeister after the second and third intermediate times, but she 
skied the bottom section of the course perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skied well in the last part,'' she said. ``I had a really  
good line. I couldn't ski it better. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have three girls on the podium, this is unbelievable for  
Austria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And unfortunate for the rest of the world. In a clear indication  
of just how dominant that country has been, Canada's Melanie 
Turgeon finished far back in seventh place but observed correctly, 
``Take the Austrians out of the way and I'm on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Goetschl, who leads this season's World Cup  
downhill standings, finished in 1 minute, 48.20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, bowing her head in disappointment after Goetschl's  
run, settled for the silver medal in 1:48.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefanie Schuster, matching the best finish of her career, was  
third in 1:48.37, and Alexandra Meissnitzer took fourth in 1:48.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Regina Haeusl was fifth in 1:48.92, followed by  
France's Melanie Suchet in 1:48.97 and Turgeon in 1:49.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American,  
finishing eighth in 1:49.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the top racers chose late start numbers because of the  
possibility of overnight snow, which would have slowed the course 
for the early runners. Vail received only a dusting of snow 
overnight, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster, who has been consistently fast in training on this  
mountain throughout her career, drew bib No. 3, and her solid run 
produced a lead that withstood the challenge of the next 14 racers. 
But it soon became clear that her major threats would come from her 
own teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, racing 17th, had quicker intermediate times than  
Schuster but lost precious seconds at the bottom and was .10 
seconds slower. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, racing 18th, overcame a slow start to edge Schuster  
by .02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three racers -- Germany's Hilde Gerg, Italy's Isolde  
Kostner and France's Florence Masnada -- came up short, but 
Goetschl, with bib No. 22, was the best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl was .55 seconds behind Dorfmeister after the second  
intermediate clocking and still .16 seconds behind at the third 
intermediate. Racing flawlessly over the last series of jumps and 
turns, she edged Dorfmeister by .15 seconds at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost it on the bottom, in the last three turns,'' said  
Dorfmeister, who won a bronze medal in super-G on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine, was 16th in 1:50.08. Kate  
Monahan of Aspen, Colo., took 19th in 1:50.42, and Jonna Mendes of 
South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 25th in 1:51.06. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longest downhill the women have raced this season, Gerety  
was quick for most of her run, clocking the third-fastest time 
through the last intermediate clocking. But she lost time at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jumps were quite a bit bigger today than in training, I  
thought,'' Gerety said. ``I kind of launched off the last one and 
got a bit behind the course. At least it was sunny. I was kind of 
stoked about that.''

<HEADLINE> First AIDS Vaccine Test in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first test of a human AIDS vaccine in  
Africa has begun in Uganda, says the U.S. National Institutes of 
Health, which is funding the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's announcement was pegged as an important step toward  
developing a vaccine for countries hardest hit by the epidemic. 
AIDS has devastated Africa. In Uganda alone, it has killed nearly a 
half-million people and left 1 million children orphaned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Uganda study tests a vaccine made by Pasteur Merieux  
Connaught that uses a canarypox virus to carry three HIV genes. The 
canarypox cannot cause human disease, and the HIV genes by 
themselves aren't infectious, the NIH said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine, known as ALVAC, already has undergone safety  
testing in the United States and France with no serious side 
effects reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NIH's question is whether the vaccine's genes -- taken  
from a subtype of HIV found in the United States and Europe -- will 
trigger a protective immune response to the different HIV subtypes 
found in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearlong study is enrolling 40 healthy adults at low risk of  
getting HIV; 20 will get the experimental vaccine. Researchers in 
Kampala and Entebbe will monitor safety reactions, and immune 
system changes that would indicate whether the vaccine has anti-HIV 
potential. If so, larger studies could follow.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Makes Last Appeal to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his lofty oratory and behind-the-scenes  
maneuvering, Rep. Henry Hyde pressed President Clinton's 
impeachment like none other. But in his final words to the senators 
poised to reject his case, he lamented that the personal loss of 
esteem among his colleagues ``cuts the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All a congressman ever gets to take with him when he leaves is  
the esteem of his colleagues and constituents -- and we have risked 
that for a principle, for our duty as we have seen it,'' the 
Illinois Republican said Monday in closing arguments at the 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Alone in the well of the Senate -- the last of 13 GOP House  
members to argue for Clinton's removal -- the silver-haired Hyde 
displayed the same fervor he has throughout the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted Shakespeare, poked fun at the Senate as the ``House of  
Lords'' and spoke in the most dire terms of the consequences if 
senators, as expected, acquit the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wonder if, after this culture war is over that we are  
engaged in, an America will survive that will be worth fighting to 
defend,'' Hyde, a World War II veteran, told weary senators. Will 
there be ``enough vitality left in duty, honor and country to 
excite our children and grandchildren to defend America?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Hyde inherited the impeachment investigation last fall as  
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, many looked at him as an 
elder statesmen at the helm of a difficult task. ``This is a lousy 
job, but somebody has to do it,'' he grumbled in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Months later, he has been branded a partisan by Democrats who  
said he proceeded with impeachment without bipartisan support after 
promising he would not. 
</P>
<P>
	After pledging impartiality, Hyde found himself zealously  
defending Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, even leading a 
Republican standing ovation in the Judiciary Committee room after 
the prosecutor testified there last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He pressed for witnesses that senators did not want, eventually  
winning the right to question three in videotaped depositions. 
Senators rejected his request to summon Monica Lewinsky for live 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he even tried anew to call more witnesses based on  
belated information casting doubt on the testimony of a White House 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own admission, Hyde was a pain ``in the bosom'' of a  
Senate eager to get the impeachment trial behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing an uphill battle for conviction, Hyde reserved some of  
his final argument to pay tribute to the 12 colleagues who joined 
him in prosecuting Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have gone through it all at your side -- the media  
condemnations, the patronizing editorials, the hate mail, the 
insults hurled in public, the attempts at intimidation, the death 
threats and even the disapproval of our colleagues, which cuts the 
worst,'' he said, looking over at his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have risked that for a principle, for our duty as we have  
seen it,'' Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he left some mocking thoughts for those senators who  
consider a censure of Clinton a better punishment than removal from 
office: 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the  
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed 
justice. ... Well, do you really cleanse the office as provided in 
the Constitution? Or do you use the Air Wick of a censure 
resolution?''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake's Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The city's own investigation into the  
Olympic bribery scandal could provide answers to questions many 
people in Salt Lake City are asking: Who knew what and when. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a report will be issued on the second of five  
investigations into the payments of cash and freebies to 
International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the IOC commission report that last month focused on IOC  
members, the closely guarded report by the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee's ethics panel looks into the role Utah Olympic boosters 
played in seeking the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	What began as a tip to a local TV station about a scholarship  
for an IOC member's child in November has grown into the biggest 
Olympics corruption scandal in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Four IOC members have resigned, five have been ousted by the IOC  
executive board and must fight to remain on the IOC, one was 
admonished, and three are still being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC investigators said they had found $800,000 in illicit cash  
payments, scholarships, free medical care and travel expenses from 
Salt Lake to 14 IOC members. The ethics panel reportedly has 
identified even more questionable spending, including 
reimbursements to employers who gave jobs to IOC member relatives, 
for a total of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Leavitt and SLOC Chairman Robert Garff say they do not  
expect the report to show any new broad categories of misdeeds. It 
is to be given the SLOC executive committee at 10 a.m. EST and the 
SLOC board of trustees and public at noon EST on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the document is expected to answer whether the lavish  
spending truly was the work of just a few bid executives, as 
Leavitt claims, or was endorsed by business leaders who served on 
the committee, Mayor Deedee Corradini or Leavitt himself, as bid 
and former SLOC President Tom Welch claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Dave Johnson, who worked with Welch to win the games,  
have been blamed up to now for the excesses. Leavitt has described 
a deliberate coverup by a small group of executives who kept lavish 
spending hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said last week he gave only small gifts of protocol  
and knew of nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, the volunteer chairman of the bid committee who  
later became SLOC president, said he and other business leaders on 
the bid board had been ``screened'' from the details and that he 
was dismayed to learn about the excessive spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik resigned as SLOC chief executive on Jan. 8, the same day  
he demanded the resignation of Johnson, who had become senior vice 
president of SLOC. The SLOC board also stripped Welch of the 
$500,000 pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract he was 
given when he resigned as president in mid-1997 amid a spousal 
abuse charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members Spence Eccles and Verl Topham have said they  
were deceived. Corradini has said little about her role. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said the ethics panel's report should not be expected to  
be complete, since the panel did not have subpoena powers and some 
people refused to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the investigations by the IOC and SLOC ethics panel,  
three others into the Salt Lake scandal have been announced: one by 
the Justice Department looking into violations of federal law; one 
by the U.S. Olympic Committee's ethics oversight board, led by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell; and one by Utah 
Attorney General Jan Graham, to examine potential violations of 
state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC Vice President Dick Pound said Monday the Salt Lake panel's  
report may help advance the IOC investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have seen a lot of documents we have not seen and talked  
with a lot of people we have not talked to, so it may be quite 
helpful,'' he said. ``If it concentrates on their end and gives the 
facts, that helps us on our end. I hope we can avoid endless 
finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel is comprised of Gordon Hall, a former chief  
justice of the Utah Supreme Court; David Jordan, a former U.S 
attorney for Utah; Patricia Hanna, dean of the University of Utah 
college of humanities; Barbara Day Lockhart, a two-time Olympic 
speedskater who now is a Brigham Young University professor; and 
Merrill Norman, a forensic auditor and expert witness in trials. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC will meet Thursday to take any action on the report and to  
vote on a reorganization plan proposed by Leavitt and Garff. The 
plan would expand the SLOC board of trustees from 33 to 50 members, 
but would give its decision-making authority to a new management 
committee.

<HEADLINE> Man Safe After 11 Days in Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- The yapping of two little dogs led to the  
discovery of a snowmobiler, who was hungry and hallucinating after 
being lost for 11 days in the rugged mountains with nothing to eat 
or drink but ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife was found dead nearby.  
</P>
<P>
	A group of snowmobilers on Sunday came upon 50-year-old George  
Back, lying face down, his boots sticking out of the snow. Back was 
in serious condition Monday with frostbite to his nose, feet, knees 
and elbows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those little teeny dogs were no bigger than a rat, but I think  
they helped save his life. They stayed right with him,'' Darrell 
Brunner told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunner and three friends found Back when they heard the barking  
of Back's Norfolk terriers named Keeper and Justine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in and out of it,'' Brunner said. ``He thought he had  
been there six months and was afraid we were going to leave him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the snowmobilers who discovered Back left to get help,  
and two stayed behind, feeding him Gatorade and beef jerky. 
</P>
<P>
	Three to 4 feet of snow had fallen since Back and Diane M.  
McManus, 44, left Jan. 27 for what was supposed to be a two-hour 
outing near Fish Lake, an area popular for winter sports about 110 
miles northwest of here in central Washington. Both were novice 
snowmobilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Back was in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center  
in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we can so he can keep all those body  
parts,'' said hospital spokesman Larry Zalin. ``It will be weeks, 
if not months, before it's clear that he can avoid amputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back was too ill to be interviewed, Zalin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several factors contributed to Back's survival. He was able to  
stay sufficiently hydrated and he did not suffer from hypothermia, 
Zalin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back was wearing a new snowsuit and new boots. He also had the  
dogs to keep him warm. 
</P>
<P>
	Back and McManus were on rented snowmobiles, with the little  
dogs tucked inside their snowsuits. They carried no provisions or 
special gear. 
</P>
<P>
	When they failed to return on time, the Chelan County sheriff's  
office led an air and ground search that ended without success Jan. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
	Back and McManus had gotten lost, and in their efforts to return  
to the resort, they left the groomed snowmobile trails. Up to 50 
inches of snow fell before Back was rescued in the Brushy Creek 
area, about 10 miles from the resort, said Sheriff Mike Brickert. 
</P>
<P>
	Back knew his wife was dead, but didn't know when she died,  
Brickert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary autopsy results show that McManus died of  
hypothermia, possibly Thursday, and that she was insufficiently 
dressed for the season, said Sandra Ellis, chief deputy coroner in 
Chelan County.

<HEADLINE> NFL Buys Stake in Arena Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL is buying a stake in the Arena Football  
League, which plays an indoor modified brand of football in the 
spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is designed to develop year-round interest in football  
and promote the game around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL agreed Monday to purchase an option in the league that  
can be exercised during the next three years. The final agreement 
must be approved by 24 of the 31 NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL can buy up to 49.9 percent of the Arena league and have  
a voice in its operation. But during a conference call, neither 
league would specify how much the NFL paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to support football at all levels,'' NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. ``An interest in the 13-year-old 
Arena Football League would enhance our stake in the future of the 
game, both in the United States and internationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league will have 15 teams next season, including the  
expansion Buffalo Destroyers. New Orleans and Los Angeles will 
begin play in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Goodell, the NFL's senior vice president for league  
development, said he envisioned the Arena league creating new NFL 
fans. In Arena football, spectators sit close to the field and are 
able to see and hear the contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives more people to see the game first hand,'' he said.

	The arrangement between the two leagues was facilitated by Neal  
Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports. He noted the cost of 
purchasing an Arena franchise has increased in the last three years 
from $500,000 to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL began its association with Arena football last June,  
when it gave Saints owner Tom Benson permission to operate an Arena 
franchise in New Orleans beginning in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL bylaws had prohibited NFL owners from investing in other  
football leagues or teams, but the amendment approving Benson's 
involvement could allow other NFL owners to buy Arena teams.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Closing Arguments-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Monday's closing arguments in the impeachment  
trial against President Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's literally nothing in the president's grand jury  
testimony that purports to adopt wholesale his testimony in the 
Jones deposition. If anything, it's evident that he's explaining at 
length and clarifying and adding to his deposition testimony.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of the seemingly insurmountable hurdle of Ms.  
Lewinsky's repeated denials that anyone ever asked or encouraged 
her to lie, the managers have persisted in arguing and continue to 
do so that the president did somehow encourage her to lie, even if 
she didn't know it.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, if there is no proof that the president encouraged Ms.  
Lewinsky to file a false affidavit, surely there must be some proof 
for the other charge that encouraged her to give perjurious 
testimony if she were called to testify. Well, there isn't.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The only witness, the supposed victim of the obstruction, the  
person whose testimony is being influenced, says that it didn't 
happen. And the managers nonetheless want you to conclude, I 
assume, that some subliminal message was being conveyed that 
resulted in the filing of a false affidavit, without the affiant 
knowing that she was being controlled by some unseen and unheard 
force.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What the managers have presented to you is a series of  
different speculative theories. As each one is shown to be what it 
is, they move on to the next, in the hope they will find one, 
someday, that actually has a connection to reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they cannot find that elusive theory, for the stubborn  
facts will not budge, nor will the stubborn denials by every 
participant in their mythical plot.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I don't know whether  
there's a market for used pillars, but they're all lying in the 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult for me as a lawyer, as an advocate for my  
client, to speak to this body about lofty constitutional principles 
without seeming merely to engage in empty rhetoric. But I'd like to 
think, I guess, that if there were ever a forum in which I could 
venture into that realm and be excused for doing so, could be heard 
without the intervening filter of skepticism that I fear too often 
lies between lawyer and listener, this is the time and this is the 
moment.'' -- Ruff 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You all must cast an eye to the past, looking over our  
shoulders to be sure that we've learned the right lessons from 
those who have sat in this chamber before us. We also must look to 
the future to be sure that we leave the right lessons to those who 
come after us. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that no one will ever have need of them, but if they  
should, we owe them, not only the proper judgment for today, but 
the proper judgment for all time.'' -- Ruff 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We are together, I think, weavers of a constitutional fabric  
in which all of us now are clothed and generations will be clothed 
for millennia to come. We cannot leave even the smallest flaw in 
that fabric, for if we do, one day someone will come along and pull 
a thread, and the flaw will grow, and it will eat away at the 
fabric around it, and soon, the entire cloth will begin to 
unravel.'' -- Ruff 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The voices of Madison and Hamilton and the others who met in  
Philadelphia 212 years ago and the voices of the generations since 
and the voices of the American people now and the voices of 
generations to come -- these, not the voices of mere advocates, must 
be your guide.'' -- Ruff 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	``And now our last words to you, which are the words I began  
with: William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that 
have been brought against him, he did not commit perjury, he did 
not commit obstruction of justice, he must not be removed from 
office.'' -- Ruff 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding the clever and resourceful arguments that  
White House counsel have made to you today and in the past few 
weeks, I suspect that most of you, probably more than two-thirds, 
believe that the president did indeed commit most of, if not all of 
the crimes he's charged with under these articles of impeachment. 
And I suspect that a great many of you share my view that these are 
high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``But nonetheless, it is my understanding that some of you who  
share these views are not prepared to vote to convict the president 
and remove him from office; that instead you are of the mind at the 
moment, subject to our persuading you otherwise and your own 
debate, to acquit him.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of arguing by White House counsel can erase one  
simple fact: If you believe Monica Lewinsky, you cannot believe the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believe Monica Lewinsky, the president committed most  
of the crimes with which he's charged in these articles today.'' -- 
McCollum 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anybody believe after hearing all of this that the goal  
of the president in the Jones deposition was to be truthful? He 
lied to the grand jury and he committed perjury.'' -- McCollum 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to vote to convict the president on the  
articles of impeachment regarding obstruction of justice, I urge 
you in the strongest way to also vote to convict him on the perjury 
article as well. I think you're doing a disservice not to do that, 
and sending a terrible message about perjury and the seriousness of 
it for history and to the American people if you don't.'' -- 
McCollum 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What are the consequences of failing to remove this president  
from office if you believe he's committed the crimes of perjury and 
obstruction of justice? What are the consequences of failing to do 
that? What's the downside? 
</P>
<P>
	``First, at the very least, you will leave a precedent of doubt  
as to whether perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes 
and misdemeanors when impeaching the president. In fact, your vote 
to acquit under these circumstances may well mean that no president 
in the future will ever be impeached or removed for perjury or 
obstruction of justice. Is that the record that you want?'' -- 
McCollum

<HEADLINE> Have Your Net and Privacy Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Privacy is one of those things you don't appreciate until you  
lose it. And the Internet and our electronic, computer-driven 
society are changing the matter of privacy in fundamental ways. 
</P>
<P>
	If you haven't thought much about who might be monitoring you as  
your surf the Net, e-mail a friend or electronically pay your taxes 
or file a medical claim, you'll be interested in the book, ``I Love 
the Internet, But I Want My Privacy, Too!'' (Prima Publishing, 
Rocklin, Calif., $16.95 paperback). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peterson's well-written 226-page volume is a thoughtful  
exploration of some of the real privacy concerns that arise from 
playing with those electrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's say you got cold feet at the altar and ran from the church  
before saying ``I do.'' You moved to another state and told no one, 
least of all your almost-bride's relatives and friends. Are you 
safe? If your telephone number is listed -- and sometimes, even if 
it isn't -- your name, address and phone number are only a few mouse 
clicks away, And so is a map with directions to your house! 
</P>
<P>
	And you might not have realized it, but someone is picking your  
pocket, often on a daily basis. Oh, the amounts are small but if 
you pay for Internet access, you are essentially paying for connect 
time, and someone sending spam (unsolicited e-mail) is stealing 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	As Peterson points out, spam constitutes fraud. It's  
fundamentally different from postal junk mail, which costs the 
sender postage and which you can often identify unopened before 
placing it in the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
	The book points out that few Net surfers realize their online  
activities are often tracked by the sites they visit and that this 
information is used and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	While most are aware that chat rooms can have a dark side, the  
book cautions you to assume nothing from an online handle. Sure, 
``Amy14'' in a chat room could be a 14-year-old girl, but it could 
also be a 60-year-old man or a convicted murderer. There's simply 
no way to tell, and you should take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	The book also deals with the issue of children on the Internet.  
While much noise has been made about children having access to 
adult material on the Net, the book also raises the question of 
marketing approaches aimed at kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Included are a list of online privacy resources, and places to  
report and combat spam, pedophiles, con artists and such. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson makes the point that the technology being used to  
invade privacy can also be used to protect it. Since the Internet 
and computers are probably here to stay, and since we all do things 
we don't want the world to see, it's an important issue and one the 
book explores well.

<HEADLINE> Molinari Urges Bush To Run in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A prominent New York Republican said Monday  
he is working with other GOP leaders to persuade Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush to jump into the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has his own network and he inherits the network of his  
dad,'' said Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a 
former congressman. ``He represents our best opportunity for taking 
back the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he and about four dozen other Republicans would  
meet in Washington on Tuesday to pursue the goal of making Bush a 
candidate. He identified Rep. Vito Fossella of Staten Island and 
retired House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon of Glens 
Falls as among those who would attend and said many other House 
members and some senators would be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari, whose daughter Susan gave up a promising career in  
Congress for a short-lived job in television, has been close to 
former President Bush for years and served as the elder Bush's New 
York presidential campaign chairman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari said he has not talked with the Texas governor about  
whether he will run for the GOP nomination. The younger Bush has 
said he will make a decision within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Molinari also said that New York Gov. George Pataki is hurting  
his chances of being on the ticket as vice presidential candidate 
by warring with New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The two have 
been at odds over everything from how the city school system is run 
to how much state aid the city receives. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lawmakers from Iowa, the state with the nation's  
first presidential precinct caucuses, traveled to the governor's 
mansion in Austin, Texas, and told Bush he should enter the race. 
The 15 lawmakers delivered two letters of support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gov. Bush, we urge you to run for president of the United  
States. Iowans will welcome your candidacy with open arms,'' said 
two letters signed by more than 60 members of the Iowa House and 
Senate.

<HEADLINE>  Rebel Guerrillas Join Cambodia Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAMLOT, Cambodia (AP) -- Hundreds of Khmer Rouge guerrillas  
joined the Cambodian army today, but warned they could turn against 
their new comrades if the government tries to arrest their 
bloodstained leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 600 former rebels gathered for the ceremony at this  
mine-ridden jungle enclave, marking the second time the 
Samlot-based faction aligned itself with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	It first joined in a mass defection in 1996 that crippled the  
radical communist movement, which ruled in the 1970s and caused the 
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians before being overthrown 
by a Vietnamese invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rebels did not receive the autonomy they expected. When  
Cambodian leader Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister in a violent 
1997 coup, they fought against Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
	After elections last year, the two leaders reconciled in a new  
power-sharing arrangement and Khmer Rouge remnants announced they 
wanted peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ceremony was a formality to bring veteran guerrillas  
into the army. In all, about 1,800 were being integrated into the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Iem Phan repeated threats voiced by other Khmer Rouge  
that civil war could return if a tribunal is formed to bring senior 
leaders to justice for their brutal rule between 1975 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is any trial, war and revenge between Cambodians will  
never end,'' Iem Phan said. ``Let's forget about old stories and 
begin talking about the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. legal experts will complete a report this month on the best  
options to try senior Khmer Rouge for crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hun Sen has hedged his support for a tribunal by frequently  
suggesting he would not risk renewed fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of hostilities in Samlot has cleared the way for the  
return of more than 14,000 Cambodians now living in a refugee camp 
in Thailand's Trat province. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief agencies warn that the Samlot area is strewn with land  
mines, but refugees will voluntarily begin crossing the border 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees are aware of the danger, but are desperate to return to  
their homes before planting season begins, said Annheli Aldhammar, 
a protection officer for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are going to be mines, but we are going to make it as  
safe as possible for them,'' Aldhammar said in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 300 mine clearance experts have been dispatched to  
ensure routes taken by the refugees are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands who returned late last year have already been  
frustrated by mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Chang Ran, 42, a mother of four, said she cannot work on her old  
rice fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to walk through the jungle to clear new land by the  
mountains to farm,'' Chang Ran said. ``That place is also mined, 
but I have to take the risk because nothing is left for me.''

<HEADLINE> Kernen Leading Ski Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Norwegians Kjetil Andre Aamodt and  
Lasse Kjus have made the combined event their personal playground 
all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even the presence of a Swiss interloper, Bruno Kernen, was  
likely to spoil their fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernen took a slim lead over the Norwegian duo on Monday in the  
downhill portion of the men's combined in the World Alpine Ski 
Championships, but no one expected it to last. 
</P>
<P>
	Two slalom runs, scheduled for Tuesday, will conclude the event,  
with the combined times for all three runs determining the combined 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt and Kjus are legitimate threats in slalom. Kernen,  
although he has had some success in combined events throughout his 
career, hasn't scored a point in slalom on the World Cup circuit 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea how I can ski in slalom, sometimes good,  
sometimes bad,'' Kernen said. ``I've had a really tough season so 
far, but I always knew I could ski fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt said he was ``absolutely happy'' with his position. ``I'm  
eight-hundredths behind Kernen and six-hundredths ahead of Kjus, 
and they'll be my main competitors tomorrow,'' he said. ``I think 
the slalom is going to be interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus was likewise pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK,'' he said. ``It's good not to be too far behind.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kernen, gold medalist in downhill and silver medalist in  
combined at the last world championships in 1997 in Sestrieres, 
Italy, had a smooth run that was timed in 1 minute, 13.44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt was lurking .08 seconds back, however, and Kjus was only  
.14 seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Norwegians know the territory. Kjus was first and Aamodt  
second in a combined in Wengen, Switzerland, on Jan. 17. A week 
later, Aamodt was first and Kjus second in a combined in Kitzbuhel, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who tied Austrian ace Hermann Maier for the gold medal in  
the super-G on Tuesday and finished second to Maier in the downhill 
on Saturday, was the early leader in Monday's race. Racing sixth, 
Kjus bettered the time of Austrian Werner Franz, finishing in 
1:13.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Two racers later, Aamodt, the defending world champion in  
combined, came across .06 seconds quicker than Kjus at 1:13.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernen was next, and avoided the problems in a couple of corners  
that hurt him in the downhill on this same Birds of Prey course, 
where he placed seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz was fourth in 1:13.91, followed by Kristian Ghedina of  
Italy in 1:14.15 and Paul Accola of Switzerland in 1:14.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Darin McBeath was ninth in 1:14.87, and Jakub Fiala of  
Breckenridge, Colo., was the top American, placing 14th in 1:15.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reiter of Austria, the 1998 Olympic combined champion, was  
far back in 18th place at 1:16.14 but relieved to have finished 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, this downhill was too tough,'' Reiter said. ``I will  
not ski a downhill that is so fast again. I'm too old for that to 
risk my life. 
</P>
<P>
	``My chances are, of course, very, very small. But there's at  
least another 100 slalom gates to go, and you never know what 
happens in slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., had a wild run. Miller was out  
of control early in his run then crashed near the finish, losing 
his left ski. He bounced on the snow several times, but rose to his 
feet and skied across the finish line on one ski to post a time of 
1:21.48. He was later disqualified for missing a gate.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Head to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Calm seas and increasingly dire straits at home  
have driven an unusually high number of Cuban and Haitian refugees 
to the shores of south Florida, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six boats with 90 people on board landed over the weekend,  
bringing the number from those two countries to 433 since the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the weekend kept border officials busy, the record number  
of landings was the weekend of Jan. 15 when eight boats came 
ashore, said Dan Geoghegan, a spokesman for the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave has been made easier by unusually calm seas, Geoghegan  
said. But perhaps a more important factor is the condition of the 
economies in Cuba and Haiti, some experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is really out of control in Haiti,'' said George  
DePontis of the Haitian American Foundation. ``There is no 
employment there. Calm seas? I don't buy that. Let's look beyond 
that at the economic conditions of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers of Cubans and Haitians immigrating have increased  
since 1998, and experts expect the trend to continue this year. In 
1998, Coast Guard vessels intercepted 1,025 Cubans and 1,206 
Haitians at sea, compared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest Shooting in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Packed shoulder to shoulder and chanting for  
justice, about 1,000 people gathered outside the home of a West 
African immigrant who died when police fired 41 shots at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an execution, plain and simple,'' Donald Cox, 19,  
said at Sunday's rally outside the home of Amadou Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, 22, who immigrated from Guinea two years ago and worked  
as a street peddler, died in the vestibule of the building after 
being hit 19 times by four police officers early Thursday morning. 
The officers were looking for a rapist and thought Diallo had a 
gun, but no gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. Attorney's office has begun investigating  
the case and a grand jury convened by the Bronx district attorney 
was expected to begin reviewing evidence today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to fight for justice and not accept anything  
else,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the protest 
outside the brick apartment house in the Bronx where Amadou Diallo 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
	In a private City Hall meeting, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani briefed  
Guinea's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Aly Thiam, and 
its ambassador to the United Nations, Mahawa Bangoura Kamara, about 
the shooting, said his aides. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest attracted activists from various causes,  
neighborhood residents and people from outside the city.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Rebels Call for Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians pressed for a formal  
cease-fire for Kosovo while Serbs sought a pledge to keep 
Yugoslavia's borders unchanged as the two sides held peace talks 
Monday at a French chateau. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, international mediators wanted to drop what  
they called these ``side issues'' and move on to details of a peace 
settlement for Kosovo, where more than 2,000 people have died and 
about 300,000 have been driven from their homes in a year of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides remain so estranged that they are not meeting  
face-to-face. The mediators, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S. 
ambassador to Macedonia, are shuttling between rooms at a splendid 
14th-century chateau outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashim Thaci, political director of the rebel Kosovo Liberation  
Army who is acting as head of the Albanian delegation, called for 
``an immediate cease-fire agreement between the warring factions in 
Kosovo -- the Serb forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That cease-fire, he said, should be guaranteed by the United  
States and the five other European countries that make up the 
Kosovo Contact Group: Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a cease-fire of sorts since October, when  
American troubleshooter Richard Holbrooke worked out a deal with 
hard-line Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	But that deal, which averted NATO airstrikes, has been shaky  
from the start, broken by repeated outbursts of violence in Kosovo, 
a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal cease-fire, signed by both sides, would amount to a de  
facto Serb recognition of the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were forced to the table by the renewed threat of  
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia and further measures to cut off 
the KLA's arms supplies and financing. The talks began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs are insisting that all sides sign the list of basic  
principles drawn up by the Contact Group as the basis for the talks 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	That is very important for the Serbs because those principles  
contain a guarantee that Yugoslavia's borders won't change. That 
would mean the ethnic Albanians would have to give up their demand 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference spokesman Philip Reeker insisted, however, that all  
sides already had agreed to the principles merely by coming to the 
talks, and that they are not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Serb official in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade,  
speaking by telephone, said the delegation was insisting the 
Albanians sign off on the basic principles because ``they contain 
guarantees for our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Kosovo Albanian official at the talks said the Albanians  
could not sign such a document, at least not now, because that 
would be giving away everything. Both spoke on condition they not 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign the talks might already be heading for trouble, Reeker  
announced that British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French 
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine were expected here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a member of the Serb delegation inside the chateau, who  
also requested anonymity, described some of the details in the 
Contact Group plan as ``horrifying'' because they would 
significantly reduce Serb authority in the province. He said the 
Serbs were preparing a list of proposed amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha Ditore, published in  
Pristina, capital of Kosovo, quoted Albanian sources as saying 
their delegation has made three demands at the conference: holding 
a national referendum on the status of Kosovo following the interim 
period of three years, having NATO be a signatory to the agreement, 
and clearly defining the status of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum demand is important, because with the province  
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, the population is sure to vote for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-line KLA guerrillas, who are represented by five officials  
in the 16-member ethnic Albanian delegation, have said they would 
accept only independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has rejected independence for Kosovo, which has 2  
million residents, as well as the suggestion that tens of thousands 
of U.S. and other NATO troops would be deployed in the province to 
police any agreement.

<HEADLINE> Duke Back at No. 1 in Men's AP Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, which had been No. 2 for the past eight weeks, moved to  
the top of the AP college basketball poll today, ending 
Connecticut's 10-week run at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (23-1), winners of 18 straight games, made the  
move after a week that saw seven Top Ten teams -- including 
Connecticut -- lose at least one game and 16 ranked teams lose a 
total of 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was No. 1 in the preseason poll and for the first two weeks  
of the regular season until losing to Cincinnati in the 
championship game of the Great Alaska Shootout. That's when the 
Huskies, who were second in each of those three polls, made the 
move to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	After an 18-point win over Maryland and a come-from-behind  
victory over Georgia Tech, Duke received 59 first-place votes and 
1,763 points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	That was well ahead of the 12 No. 1 votes and 1,712 points of  
the Huskies (20-1), who lost 59-42 to Syracuse without leading 
scorer Richard Hamilton and leading rebounder Jake Voskuhl, both 
out with injuries. They followed that with a 70-59 victory at 
Stanford, this time without Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (22-1), which won two games by an average of 27 points  
last week, jumped from sixth to No. 3, the school's highest ranking 
since one week at No. 2 in February 1959. The Tigers have never 
been No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which lost to DePaul in overtime on a controversial  
call by an official, dropped one spot to fourth. Michigan State, 
the only Top Ten team besides Duke and Auburn not to lose last 
week, jumped from eighth to No. 5 and was followed by Stanford, 
Maryland, Kentucky, UCLA and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, which lost road games to Florida and Alabama, dropped  
three spots to No. 8, matching the school's lowest ranking of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's dropped two places to lead the Second Ten and was  
followed by North Carolina, Ohio State, Utah, Wisconsin, Miami, 
Indiana, Syracuse, Iowa and College of Charleston, which also has 
an 18-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Purdue, Minnesota, Florida,  
Kansas and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (16-5), which beat Kentucky in its only game, and Kansas  
(16-6), which won road games against Kansas State and Colorado, 
returned to the Top 25 after one-week absences. The Gators had been 
in for one week before dropping out, Kansas for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas (16-7), which beat Tennessee and lost to Vanderbilt,  
dropped out from No. 23. The Razorbacks were 19th in the preseason 
poll, their highest ranking, and had been ranked in every poll 
since the third week of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri (16-5), which returned to the rankings last week after  
a 3 1/2-year absence, beat Texas Tech and lost to Nebraska and dropped 
from No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which beat St. John's and Georgetown, made the week's  
biggest jump, from 25th to No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The four ranked teams that lost two games each last week had the  
biggest falls. In addition to Kentucky's three-place fall, New 
Mexico dropped eight spots to No. 25, Iowa fell five to 19th and 
Wisconsin four to No. 15.

<HEADLINE>  Goetschl Wins World Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- At the midpoint of the World Alpine Ski  
Championships, the powerful Austrian team has been, if anything, 
even more dominating than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of a possible 15 medals, the Austrian men and women have  
combined to claim 10, including four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	In their most authoritative performance to date, the Austrians  
swept the top four places in the women's downhill Sunday, led by 
gold-medalist Renate Goetschl. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to atone for her disappointing showing in the 1998  
Olympics in Nagano, Goetschl raised her medal haul to three in 
these championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great world championships,'' Goetschl said. ``My  
goal was to win any medal, because at Nagano I put too much 
pressure on myself and went home without anything. Now I have won 
three medals. This has been an unforgettable week for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With downhill stars Picabo Street of Sun Valley, Idaho, and  
Katja Seizinger of Germany recuperating from injuries, the door was 
open for the Austrians to dominate, and they barged in. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second medal sweep by the Austrian women here; they  
claimed the top three places in the super-G on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, who already captured silver medals in both the super-G  
and combined events here, had slower times than teammate Michaela 
Dorfmeister after the second and third intermediate times, but she 
skied the bottom section of the course perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skied well in the last part,'' she said. ``I had a really  
good line. I couldn't ski it better. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have three girls on the podium, this is unbelievable for  
Austria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And unfortunate for the rest of the world. In a clear indication  
of just how dominant that country has been, Canada's Melanie 
Turgeon finished far back in seventh place but observed correctly, 
``Take the Austrians out of the way and I'm on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Goetschl, who leads this season's World Cup  
downhill standings, finished in 1 minute, 48.20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, bowing her head in disappointment after Goetschl's  
run, settled for the silver medal in 1:48.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefanie Schuster, matching the best finish of her career, was  
third in 1:48.37, and Alexandra Meissnitzer took fourth in 1:48.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Regina Haeusl was fifth in 1:48.92, followed by  
France's Melanie Suchet in 1:48.97 and Turgeon in 1:49.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American,  
finishing eighth in 1:49.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the top racers chose late start numbers because of the  
possibility of overnight snow, which would have slowed the course 
for the early runners. Vail received only a dusting of snow 
overnight, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster, who has been consistently fast in training on this  
mountain throughout her career, drew bib No. 3, and her solid run 
produced a lead that withstood the challenge of the next 14 racers. 
But it soon became clear that her major threats would come from her 
own teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, racing 17th, had quicker intermediate times than  
Schuster but lost precious seconds at the bottom and was .10 
seconds slower. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, racing 18th, overcame a slow start to edge Schuster  
by .02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The next three racers -- Germany's Hilde Gerg, Italy's Isolde  
Kostner and France's Florence Masnada -- came up short, but 
Goetschl, with bib No. 22, was the best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl was .55 seconds behind Dorfmeister after the second  
intermediate clocking and still .16 seconds behind at the third 
intermediate. Racing flawlessly over the last series of jumps and 
turns, she edged Dorfmeister by .15 seconds at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost it on the bottom, in the last three turns,'' said  
Dorfmeister, who won a bronze medal in super-G on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine, was 16th in 1:50.08. Kate  
Monahan of Aspen, Colo., took 19th in 1:50.42, and Jonna Mendes of 
South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 25th in 1:51.06. 
</P>
<P>
	In the longest downhill the women have raced this season, Gerety  
was quick for most of her run, clocking the third-fastest time 
through the last intermediate clocking. But she lost time at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jumps were quite a bit bigger today than in training, I  
thought,'' Gerety said. ``I kind of launched off the last one and 
got a bit behind the course. At least it was sunny. I was kind of 
stoked about that.''

through the last intermediate clocking. But she lost time at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jumps were quite a bit bigger today than in training, I  
thought,'' Gerety said. ``I kind of launched off the last one and 
got a bit behind the course. At least it was sunny. I was kind of 
stoked about that.''

<HEADLINE> Air Force To Spend $54M on TV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Worried about falling short of its recruiting  
goal for the first time in 20 years, The Air Force said Monday it 
will spend $54 million on television ads to try to boost 
enlistment. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign pushes the Air Force's overall advertising budget  
to $76 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The television spots will begin airing in March, during the NCAA  
basketball tournament, and will consist of public service 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force also plans to launch a national ad blitz in  
October to coincide with the new fall programming schedule. Those 
ads will feature commercials developed by a private ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Having previously relied on print ads and public service  
announcements, this marks the first time the Air Force has used 
paid ads in its recruiting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is having trouble with recruitment despite the  
introduction last fall of new enlistment bonuses of up to $9,000 
for 115 qualifying career specialties. The armed service is 6 
percent short of its recruitment goal of 33,800 this fiscal year, 
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Race Caller Sues Over Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The race caller at the nation's premier  
harness track sued the Meadowlands on Monday, claiming his 
employers are giving him added duties that threaten his recovery 
from compulsive gambling and might tempt him to begin betting 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bothe, 43, contends his compulsive gambling is a disability  
and Meadowlands Racetrack management is discriminating against him 
because of it. 
</P>
<P>
	While other workers have won back pay and other claims against  
employers who fired them for problem gambling, Bothe's lawsuit is 
believed to be one of the first filed by someone employed in the 
gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe, known as ``The Voice of the Meadowlands,'' began working  
at the track in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute arose in December, when Bothe (pronounced BOHTH-ee)  
was told his duties on a daily closed-circuit television show for 
track patrons would include ``handicapping'' the races -- predicting 
the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe balked, asserting that picking horses would rekindle the  
gambling fever that nearly ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The track operator, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition  
Authority, would not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe attends weekly Gamblers Anonymous meetings and works a  
second job -- reading the weather on WCBS-AM in New York -- to pay 
more than $100,000 in debts from two decades of gambling. He said 
he has not placed a bet for nearly seven years despite working 
within feet of wagering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	His therapist and colleagues in Gamblers Anonymous all advised  
him against accepting the new duties, Bothe said. ``They said, `For 
your life's sake, you cannot do that,''' he said. ``I'm a 
compulsive gambler. A sick one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said track officials responded by threatening to cut his pay  
from $73,000 to $52,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He is suing in state court under New Jersey's  
anti-discrimination law.

<HEADLINE> Stroh Brewery Exits Beer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Tough competition and a trend toward  
consolidation has led to the end of 149-year tradition, as Stroh 
Brewery Co. announced that its beer-brewing days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Brewing Co., the nation's second-largest brewer behind  
Anheuser-Busch Inc., Monday agreed to buy No. 4 Stroh's Henry 
Weinhard's and Mickeys brands. Fifth-ranked Pabst Brewing Co. 
agreed to buy the rest of Stroh's brands -- including Stroh's, Old 
Milwaukee and Schlitz -- and its brewery in Lehigh Valley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I struggled with this decision,'' said John  
Stroh III, the company's president and chief executive officer and 
a fifth-generation member of the Stroh family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the years, we have had several opportunities to sell the  
business, but due to the family's commitment to our brewing 
heritage, we felt none were compelling enough to pursue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deals announced Monday, Stroh will continue operating  
its five other breweries until production can be shifted to a Pabst 
or a Miller brewery. The transition is expected to last about nine 
months. Afterward, Stroh will seek buyers for the breweries. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel had  
said the sales could be worth $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh began brewing in Detroit in 1850, after the family had  
already been brewing for two generations in Germany. During 
Prohibition the company converted facilities into making a variety 
of products, from ice cream and soda to the ingredients necessary 
for home brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh said the offers and competitive outlook of the industry  
led to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``(We) concluded that it is the appropriate time to exit the  
beer business and focus on the family's other ventures,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is the latest in a shrinking beer industry as it  
becomes harder to compete with the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Frank Walters of M. Shanken Communications in New York  
said the move gives Miller and Anheuser-Busch 70 percent of the 
beer market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough to compete with the wherewithal of a Miller or  
Anheuser-Busch,'' Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the industry's growth is sluggish, ``The middle-tier  
brewers (like Stroh) are the ones that have suffered the most,'' 
said Gary Hemphill, vice president of Beverage Marketing Corp. of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh's market share shrank from 7.9 percent to 6.7 percent last  
year, and Pabst's from 2.4 percent to 2 percent. Anheuser-Busch 
represented 46.7 percent, Miller had 21.2 percent and No. 3 Coors 
had 10.5 percent. Analysts says Miller will likely increase a 
couple of points with the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements to sell the brands are expected to be completed  
in early April, and are subject to antitrust review by the U.S. 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The brands to be sold to Pabst, based in San Antonio, Texas, are  
Stroh's, Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, Schaefer, Old Style, Schmidt's, 
Lone Star, Special Export, McSorley's, Schlitz Malt Liquor, and 
Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the brewery it is selling in Pennsylvania, Stroh has  
breweries in Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Longview, Texas; 
Winston-Salem, N.C.; and La Crosse, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also announced that Pabst has reached an agreement  
to transfer its Hamm's and Old English 800 brands to Miller. And 
Pabst has agreed to expand its contract brewing agreement with 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the move will intensify Miller's share of the malt  
liquor category.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Off on Export Data / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly  
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs of weak export 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans took the hardest tumble, falling after the U.S. Agriculture  
Department reported that announcements of export intentions for the 
past week have been extremely weak. The data comes as Brazilian crops 
grow under near-ideal conditions, raising the potential for bumper 
competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures finished mixed, trading in a listless market marked  
by a lack of fundamental news. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures retreated as market participants ignored reports  
of winter wheat crops emerging prematurely from dormancy -- leaving 
them vulnerable to late frost -- and focused on continued weak demand 
and large inventories. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for March delivery fell 3 cents to $2.66 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn fell 1/2 cent to $2.18 a bushel; March oats fell 1/4 cent 
to $1.07 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 3/4 cents to $5.08 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle rose 0.02 cent to 67.77 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose 0.10 cent to 74.87 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose 0.33 cent to 48.25 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 0.95 
cent to 60.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines canceled more than  
400 of its flights Monday, the most since a dispute with pilots 
began over the company's recent purchase of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 flights have been canceled since talks bogged  
down late Friday over when Reno Air pilots will get paid the same 
as American pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty percent of American's 2,250 flights were canceled Monday,  
with Miami and New York the hardest-hit regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Carty, chief executive of American's parent company AMR  
Corp., said at a news conference that the airline is considering 
asking a court for an injunction against the pilots' job action, 
but a decision has not yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot's association is urging its members to consider  
whether emotions from the bickering would affect their ability to 
safely pilot a jet -- apparently prompting the unusually large 
number of cockpit crew members who say they are ``unfit to fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have said is we want you to use common sense and your  
best judgment,'' said Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied 
Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, a number of American pilots are refusing to take  
on extra flights. While American pilots are barred by federal law 
from striking over the issue, they are allowed to refuse overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	While considering legal action, the airline is not considering  
requiring doctor's notes from pilots who call in unfit, Carty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all grownups,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association wants the airline to immediately  
upgrade the lower-paid Reno pilots to American's pay scales. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty noted that such a move would cost AMR as much as $50  
million extra this year. Reno Air was purchased for about $124 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth-based airline says it needs 12 to 18 months to  
properly train Reno Air pilots and convert Reno Air equipment to 
American standards. When completed, the deal will add about 300 
pilots to American's roster of more than 9,000 and bring in 27 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiations have taken place since Friday and none are  
scheduled, Carty said. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots see the issue as one of job security. They do  
not want to allow American to buy smaller airlines and use those 
lower-paid pilots in place of American crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said he believes this disagreement is not truly about the  
Reno acquisition, but rather trying to get language into the 
contract to set precedent for any future deals the airline may 
make. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate was the latest in a series of disputes between the  
company and the pilots, who staged a brief strike over their 
contract two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, more than 450 flights were canceled as pilots  
refused to work overtime to protest a passenger-sharing deal with 
Canadian Airlines Corp. And more than 1,000 flights were canceled 
during a dispute eight years ago in which American sought a court 
injunction against the pilots, whom the airline accused of staging 
an illegal sick-out. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots weren't the only personnel problem AMR encountered this  
past weekend. American maintenance workers at Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport have been picketing since Saturday because 
they will not be allowed to handle tasks such as air-conditioning 
repair at American's new DFW terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the airport board requires the majority of  
maintenance work be done by airport workers rather than American 
employees because the new terminal is shared by several airlines.

<HEADLINE> Gibson's New Film a Big 'Payback' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Men looking for a post-Super Bowl jolt of  
action and violence found it in theaters this weekend as Mel 
Gibson's revenge film ``Payback'' had the biggest movie opening so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Gibson as a crook who racks up a body count after he's  
double-crossed, ``Payback'' collected $21.4 million in North 
America, knocking the teen romance ``She's All That'' to second 
place with $12 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's  
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' debuted with a disappointing $2.4 
million for ninth place. The film was stung by bad reviews and 
fierce competition in the youth market from ``She's All That'' and 
``Varsity Blues,'' which was fourth with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Robin Williams' ``Patch Adams'' remained strong,  
collecting $4.5 million for third place. ``Patch'' got a boost from 
being double-billed in hundreds of theaters with sneak previews of 
``October Sky,'' which will be released Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of weeks dominated by teen films, ``Payback'' had  
the older male audience mostly to itself. It was among the better 
debuts for a Gibson film, besting ``Conspiracy Theory'' and 
``Maverick'' but falling behind ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gibson's ``Lethal Weapon'' movies, the audience for  
``Payback'' was about 55 percent male and mostly over age 25, 
according to Rob Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion 
Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the studio held onto the film from the summer so it  
wouldn't clash with ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``February was a good time (for the film) because it's after  
football, after the Super Bowl, and adults start to come back to 
the movies in a big way again,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also finding older audiences was ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which  
DreamWorks re-released to cash in on its Golden Globe wins and the 
buzz surrounding Tuesday's scheduled announcement of Oscar 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan,'' the No. 2 movie of 1998 after ``Armageddon,''  
collected $3.6 million for a fifth-place tie with another film with 
Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky Bill Murray film ``Rushmore'' also did strong  
older-audience business in limited release, grossing $1.9 million 
on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of just under 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney plans to expand ``Rushmore'' to about 580 screens, hoping  
the film can stretch beyond the art house crowd and looking for an 
assist in the form of an Oscar nomination for Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done extremely well in the review-sensitive markets and  
as we expand it, we'll kind of hold this picture's hand, do it with 
kid gloves, and see where we end up,'' said Disney marketing 
executive Chuck Viane. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the weekend overall box office was down -- this time  
by 7.6 percent -- from the same time last year, when ``Titanic'' was 
shattering records and ``Good Will Hunting'' was charming 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Payback,'' $21.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``She's All That,'' $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Patch Adams,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Varsity Blues,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``A Civil Action,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Stepmom,'' $2.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes-Benz Fires Ad Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz of North America dismissed its  
advertising agency of more than five years despite surging sales of 
the German luxury cars. The agency, Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, said it 
was appalled by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The auto importer cited concerns Monday about management at the  
ad agency and a ``potential conflict of interest'' since Lowe's 
sister agencies, under parent Interpublic Group of Companies, work 
for rival General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz officials declined to say how much they spend on  
advertising but industry sources put it at between $100 million and 
$125 million a year. It was among the agency's biggest accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been trade publication reports in recent weeks about  
a growing rift between the car importer from Montvale, N.J., and 
its New York ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe created award-winning ads for Mercedes, often using music  
classics to soften Mercedes' image and make it appear more 
approachable. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ads that it created was one that featured the Marlene  
Dietrich recording of ``Falling in Love Again'' and another that 
featured Janis Joplin's recording ``Lord, Won't You Buy Me a 
Mercedes-Benz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal of the ad agency is effective April 30 and comes  
after a year in which Merecdes-Benz' U.S. sales climbed 39 percent 
to 170,245. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in making Monday's announcement that ``we have  
been pleased with the caliber of the creative work done by Lowe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it added it was concerned that there was ``a substantial  
void within the agency's upper management team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Jackson, president and chief executive of the car importer,  
said Mercedes executives had a difficult year in 1998 working on 
business and other issues with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to address these issues before they impact sales or  
quality of the creative work that appears in the markteplace,'' he 
said in a telelphone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Sloves, who had been co-chairman of the agency, retired  
at the end of 1998, leaving Lee Garfinkel as the lone chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said, ``There were difficulties beyond that.''  
</P>
<P>
	The potential for conflict at the ad agency became a larger  
concern for Mercedes-Benz after last November's merger of 
Daimler-Benz with Chrylser Corp., which competes more directly with 
GM in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusually blunt statement, the agency said it was  
``appalled by this turn of events,'' saying its advertising was 
``universally admired'' by the auto importer's rivals and dealers 
as well as the ad industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not lose the account because of the quality of work or  
the quality of service we provided to Mercedes-Benz,'' Garfinkel 
said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS employs about 450 people and handled  
advertising billings -- the amount its client advertisers spend on 
placing their ads -- of about $840 million before the account loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Its other clients include Coca-Cola Co., Eddie Bauer, Heineken  
USA, Denny's and Long John Silver's restaurants and Valvoline motor 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Eberhardt, head of marketing for Mercedes-Benz, said the  
company would start talks with the agency owners True North 
Communications and Omnicom Group that have each worked for Chrysler 
about the assignment and broaden the search if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is too early to say how quickly a new agency will be  
selected.

<HEADLINE> No Cancer Found in Mercy Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- Prosecutors said Monday an autopsy found no  
trace of cancer in a woman whose husband shot her to death because 
he believed she was terminally ill with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't known whether doctors had misdiagnosed the woman or  
her husband had misunderstood the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernal ``Bob'' Ohlrich, 76, pleaded no contest Monday to  
manslaughter for shooting his wife of 57 years in the head as she 
lay in a hospital bed Oct. 27. He could get up to 20 years in 
prison, but a long sentence was considered unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told by doctors that she should call her children home  
because she's not going to make it overnight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich also disclosed that he had put the gun to his own temple  
after shooting his 74-year-old wife, Phyllis, but it jammed. ``I 
just wanted to go with her,'' he said. ``I would have, if the gun 
wouldn't have misfired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, prosecutors said that while Mrs. Ohlrich had undergone  
an operation for colon cancer in May 1998, she was cancer-free at 
her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not dispute that Mrs. Ohlrich was in a lot of  
pain, or argue with testimony from Ohlrich and neighbors that she 
had said she wanted to die, but they said the pain may have been 
from a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure the autopsy report is correct,'' defense attorney  
Joe Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ohlrich underwent chemotherapy after her cancer surgery,  
but it was discontinued over the summer because of the side 
effects. She was readmitted to Thayer County Hospital in September 
after injuring her back. 
</P>
<P>
	She was on painkillers and had to be restrained in the hospital  
because she thrashed around in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital administrator Larry Leaming had no comment. A doctor  
who performed surgery on Mrs. Ohlrich last May also would not 
comment on the specifics of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich entered his plea after prosecutors agreed to drop  
charges of first-degree murder and use of a weapon to commit a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to his lawyer, which was read in court Monday,  
Ohlrich explained his decision to plead no contest by saying it 
would be less of a burden on his four children and less stress on 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can hope is that the judge won't give me prison time,''  
said the letter, which appeared in Tuesday's editions of The Omaha 
World-Herald. ``But if he does I will accept it and expect to die 
in prison. I might look healthy but I have a lot of health 
problems. ... I will accept the Manslaughter charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Daniel Werner said he would seek some prison time but  
did not know how much. He said he agreed to the plea bargain 
because it would be pointless to give the elderly man a long prison 
sentence. No sentencing date was set. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich's lawyer called the shooting an act of love rather than  
of malice. 
</P>
<P>
	After the plea hearing, Ohlrich said he did not regret what he  
had done: ``She said she wanted to die several times. I was with 
her every day.''

<HEADLINE> SI Swimsuit Issue Features Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Annika Sorenstam, Nikki McCray, Joe Montana,  
Chuck Finley and Tom Gugliotta are among the athletes who posed in 
this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the usual bare-skinned models, the magazine this year  
again featured pro athletes and their ``significant others'' in 
swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe didn't want to do this shoot, so he hid the letter from SI  
in his day planner. When I found it, he felt so guilty that there 
was no way he could back out,'' said Montana's wife, Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Montanas, the LPGA's Sorenstam posed with her  
husband, David Esch; McCray, of the WNBA's Washington Mystics, was 
shown with fiance Thomas Penson; Allan Houston of the New York 
Knicks was with his wife, Tamara; Finley, of the Anaheim Angels, 
was pictured with his wife, the actress Tawny Kitaen; Julie Foudy 
of the U.S. women's World Cup team was shown with her husband, Ian 
Sawyers; Gugliotta of the Phoenix Suns was with his wife, Niki; and 
the PGA Tour's Tom Lehman appeared with his wife, Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is the cover model for the first time. The  
issue hits newsstands Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels Angered by Kent St. Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina officials said they were  
stunned and angered by Kent University's decision to back out of a 
contract to play in Chapel Hill in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kent State's actions have really put us in a difficult  
situation,'' North Carolina athletic director Dick Baddour said. 
``It's unfortunate a university would drop out of a game at any 
time, let alone eight months prior to kickoff. ... We realize many 
people plan functions around major university events, and this is 
one of several reasons we are upset with Kent's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels said they didn't learn that Kent planned to play  
Pittsburgh instead on Sept. 18 until mid-January -- after the Golden 
Flashes published their 1999 football schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``One person at Kent thought we had been told last summer and  
another though we had been told in October,'' Baddour said in a 
prepared statement. ``They told us they decided in late December 
and it was their intention to notify us by mail later in January. 
In my opinion, that's a poor way of doing business with another 
NCAA institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent athletic director Lang Kennedy said the Golden Flashes  
entered into a contract with the Tar Heels in 1994 but had recently 
decided it would be better for their program if they scheduled 
teams closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret very much having to make this decision but we have  
redefined our football scheduling goals and are looking to play 
more regional opponents,'' said Kennedy. ``I have to take full 
responsibility for this and I'm sorry about the timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina is looking for an opponent to replace Kent on  
Sept. 18 or on another open date, Oct. 30.

<HEADLINE> Predators Extend Ronning's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Predators have signed  
leading scorer Cliff Ronning to a two-year contract extension worth 
about $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronning, a 12-year NHL veteran with 38 points this season, came  
to the Predators in a trade with Phoenix in October. He was to be 
an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Predators general manager David Poile said signing Ronning was  
the team's top priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronning is glad to be staying with the expansion Predators.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many positive things,'' he said. ``The fans are  
incredible, the team is good for a first year and I fit in the 
style. It's an exciting style ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville (18-28-5) is 10th in the Western Conference in points  
(41), but only three points out of the eighth playoff spot.

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Anti-Swearing Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A judge Monday upheld an 1897 Michigan  
law against cursing in front of children and ordered a man who let 
loose with a stream of profanities after falling out of a canoe to 
stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in the case of Timothy Boomer, 24.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Boomer's words, when used as they were, were  
constitutionally protected speech, then a person could stand on a 
crowded public beach and shout those same words all day,'' County 
Judge Allen C. Yenior ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This cannot be what the framers of the Constitution and the  
First Amendment intended to protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy said he heard Boomer explode in a  
three-minute barrage of profanity after the mishap on the Rifle 
River last summer. A woman and her two young children were nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer could get up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine if  
convicted. His trial was set for Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer insisted his words have been exaggerated. He and the  
American Civil Liberties Union say the law violates the right to 
free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Yenior ruled that what Boomer allegedly uttered did not meet the  
U.S. Supreme Court's definition of obscenity, but they could 
constitute ``fighting words,'' which the court has ruled lack 
constitutional protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has granted wide protection to speech, but those  
rulings have come in cases where the words conveyed ideas or 
thoughts about matters such as the military draft or abortion, 
Yenior wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Boomer's words were without any socially redeeming quality  
whatsoever,'' Yenior wrote. ``The First Amendment suffers no damage 
here by taking a backseat to the compelling interest in the 
morality of our children.''

	Last Arguments Made in Clinton Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors argued their last stand  
against President Clinton today, challenging the Senate to 
``cleanse the office'' by convicting him of impeachment counts of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. ``A failure to convict will 
make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to 
be avoided, is not all that serious,'' said chief prosecutor Henry 
Hyde. Earlier, in a final summation for the defense, White House 
Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff launched a sharp attack on the Republican 
prosecutors themselves, saying they were focused on retribution, 
not facts. The Senate will vote on Clinton's fate later this week. 
Even Republicans concede they do not have the two-thirds majority 
needed for a conviction. 

</P>
<P>
	House Republicans Work on Agenda  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to move beyond impeachment, House  
Republicans are coalescing behind a four-point agenda but are torn 
over cutting taxes and whether to bust spending limits set just two 
years ago. Leaders used a three-day retreat to galvanize support 
for buttressing Social Security, defense and education spending, 
and cutting taxes. But the meetings found Republicans disagreeing 
over specifics. Many Republicans voiced opposition to House Budget 
Committee Chairman John Kasich's plan for cutting income-tax rates 
by 10 percent across the board, complaining that it would be an 
easy target for Democrats to argue that Republicans were helping 
the rich. 

</P>
<P>
	Justice Dept. May Investigate Starr  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has advised Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr that it intends to investigate his handling 
of the Monica Lewinsky affair, but the probe has not begun, 
officials said. One topic for the impending investigation is the 
Jan. 16, 1998, offer by Starr's deputies to Lewinsky of an immunity 
deal conditioned on her not discussing it with her lawyer.

	World Leaders at Hussein's Funeral  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Dignitaries and leaders from all over the  
world -- some from states sworn to enmity -- attended King Hussein's 
funeral today, a testament to Hussein's status as a mediator and a 
statesman. Some of the dignitaries put aside pressing problems to 
hasten to Amman, including impeachment-shadowed President Clinton 
and ailing Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who spent only a few 
hours in Jordan before flying back to Moscow. The funeral also 
produced a stunning handshake between a Palestinian guerrilla 
leader and Israeli President Ezer Weizman. 

</P>
<P>
	Mediators Push for Kosovo Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- International mediators today urged  
ethnic Albanians and Serbs attending talks on the future of Kosovo 
to drop what they called ``side issues'' and focus on the details 
of a peace settlement. More than 2,000 people have died in a year 
of fighting in the Yugoslav province. But the sides remain so 
estranged that they are not meeting face-to-face, leaving 
mediators, led by the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, to shuttle 
between them. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Study Picks Slovenia for NATO  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of the nine central European countries that  
have applied to join NATO, Slovenia is the most qualified to become 
the next member, a congressional survey concluded. The report by 
the Congressional Research Service also suggested Lithuania and 
Slovakia may be next in line behind Slovenia. The report concluded 
that Slovenia meets or surpasses standards that had been set by 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all of which will be 
admitted to the alliance in April. 

</P>
<P>
	Common Wireless Standards Sought  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Motorola Corp., the mobile-phone maker, and  
Cisco Systems Inc., the maker of computer-networking equipment, 
said today they will create a set of common technical standards to 
enable equipment used by different wireless systems to easily work 
together. The standards, due out in May, should make it easier for 
operators of wireless networks to offer services such as e-mail and 
voice mail without worries about compatibility. The companies said 
they will spend a total of $1 billion over five years in the 
effort.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 13.13

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mixed today with the Dow  
industrials closing down 13.13 at 9,291.11. On the NYSE, losers led 
gainers 1,593-1,399. The Nasdaq rose 31.29 to 2,404.91. 

</P>
<P>
	NBA Ratings Surprisingly High  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Not even the loss of Michael Jordan or the  
impact of the lockout kept viewers away from their TV sets on the 
NBA's opening weekend. NBC's afternoon doubleheader yesterday 
averaged a 5.8 overnight rating -- up 2 percent from 1998. Turner 
Sports posted an overall mark of 2.8 for two games Friday night on 
TNT. That was a 65 percent jump from Turner's average last season.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Ex-Presidents at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A sorrowful trip to the Middle East brought  
together an extraordinary assembly of four American presidents who 
flew through the night on Air Force One to today's funeral of King 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and predecessors Jimmy Carter, George Bush and  
Gerald Ford -- two Democrats, two Republicans -- turned the plane 
into an airborne seminar, comparing notes on the leading 
international problems they faced in the Oval Office: the Middle 
East, Russia, North Korea and Kosovo, the latest trouble spot in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In a senior staff cabin, Clinton joined talks with the three  
former presidents for nearly two hours. The only missing member of 
the world's most exclusive club was Ronald Reagan, who turned 88 
Saturday. He has Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussions, Ford and Bush slept on pulldown bunks in  
a medical annex on the jumbo jet. Carter wound up on an air 
mattress and sleeping bag in senior staff quarters. Clinton claimed 
the spacious presidential suite at the front of the plane, although 
he had offered the other presidents room there on pullout couches. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications the group discussed Clinton's  
impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	State funerals have brought former American presidents together  
on earlier occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan sent Ford, Carter and Richard Nixon to the funeral of  
Egypt's assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981. When Nixon died 
in 1994, Clinton and all the former presidents attended. Presidents 
past and present also came together at the dedications of the 
Reagan and Bush presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation to the king's funeral was intended to send a  
message. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an ``extremely strong statement to the people of Jordan  
that America stands with them during this difficult period,'' said 
Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the United States has full confidence in King  
Hussein's successor, his 37-year-old son, King Abdullah, and wants 
to help the new monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is ``the front edge of a new generation of leadership  
in the Middle East'' that will come to power over the next 10 
years, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein had ``obviously been the transcendent voice'' for peace  
in the Middle East over the past several years, Berger told 
reporters on the plane. ``Obviously we will miss that presence and 
that voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Berger said the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace accord was ``in  
place and I believe it's durable and believe the new king is 
committed to it. We've lost other towering figures in this peace 
process: Sadat, (Israeli) Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin, but the 
process has gone forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said peace in the Middle East would remain one of  
Clinton's highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 46 years, was a voice of  
moderation. In 1994, he broke with most of the Arab world and 
followed Egypt in signing a peace agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton flew to Jordan at the time to witness the signing of  
that agreement and pay tribute to Hussein's bold move. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 world leaders were gathering here for the funeral,  
creating a traffic jam of presidential aircraft as Air Force One 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's only formally scheduled meetings were with  
Abdullah and Queen Noor, Hussein's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton circulated through a four-story guest palace, where  
he met briefly with various world leaders: Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin; Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles; 
French President Jacques Chirac; Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister 
Wim Kok of the Netherlands; Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; 
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey; President Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt; Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority; and 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	He also stopped to speak for a few moments with President Hafez  
Assad of Syria and the leaders of Oman, Bahrain and Yemen. He 
talked with the crown prince of Kuwait, King Juan Carlos of Spain 
and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also flew with Clinton, as did  
the parents of the American-born Queen Noor and four members of 
Congress: Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 
and Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and David Bonior, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy told reporters he was relieved to be away from the Senate  
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Leahy, who also was  
involving in taking depositions last week from former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said that when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Saturday that closing arguments were to begin today, senators 
looked in amazement at each other because they thought that was the 
point of Saturday's long presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he believed that a final vote on the articles of  
impeachment would come Thursday and that senators could use Friday 
to debate a censure motion against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens did not talk to reporters on the plane.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Ex-Presidents at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A sorrowful trip to the Middle East brought  
together an extraordinary assembly of four American presidents who 
flew through the night on Air Force One to today's funeral of King 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and predecessors Jimmy Carter, George Bush and  
Gerald Ford -- two Democrats, two Republicans -- turned the plane 
into an airborne seminar, comparing notes on the leading 
international problems they faced in the Oval Office: the Middle 
East, Russia, North Korea and Kosovo, the latest trouble spot in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In a senior staff cabin, Clinton joined talks with the three  
former presidents for nearly two hours. The only missing member of 
the world's most exclusive club was Ronald Reagan, who turned 88 
Saturday. He has Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussions, Ford and Bush slept on pulldown bunks in  
a medical annex on the jumbo jet. Carter wound up on an air 
mattress and sleeping bag in senior staff quarters. Clinton claimed 
the spacious presidential suite at the front of the plane, although 
he had offered the other presidents room there on pullout couches. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications the group discussed Clinton's  
impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	State funerals have brought former American presidents together  
on earlier occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan sent Ford, Carter and Richard Nixon to the funeral of  
Egypt's assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981. When Nixon died 
in 1994, Clinton and all the former presidents attended. Presidents 
past and present also came together at the dedications of the 
Reagan and Bush presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation to the king's funeral was intended to send a  
message. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an ``extremely strong statement to the people of Jordan  
that America stands with them during this difficult period,'' said 
Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the United States has full confidence in King  
Hussein's successor, his 37-year-old son, King Abdullah, and wants 
to help the new monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is ``the front edge of a new generation of leadership  
in the Middle East'' that will come to power over the next 10 
years, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein had ``obviously been the transcendent voice'' for peace  
in the Middle East over the past several years, Berger told 
reporters on the plane. ``Obviously we will miss that presence and 
that voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Berger said the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace accord was ``in  
place and I believe it's durable and believe the new king is 
committed to it. We've lost other towering figures in this peace 
process: Sadat, (Israeli) Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin, but the 
process has gone forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said peace in the Middle East would remain one of  
Clinton's highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 46 years, was a voice of  
moderation. In 1994, he broke with most of the Arab world and 
followed Egypt in signing a peace agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton flew to Jordan at the time to witness the signing of  
that agreement and pay tribute to Hussein's bold move. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 world leaders were gathering here for the funeral,  
creating a traffic jam of presidential aircraft as Air Force One 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's only formally scheduled meetings were with  
Abdullah and Queen Noor, Hussein's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton circulated through a four-story guest palace, where  
he met briefly with various world leaders: Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin; Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles; 
French President Jacques Chirac; Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister 
Wim Kok of the Netherlands; Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; 
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey; President Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt; Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority; and 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	He also stopped to speak for a few moments with President Hafez  
Assad of Syria and the leaders of Oman, Bahrain and Yemen. He 
talked with the crown prince of Kuwait, King Juan Carlos of Spain 
and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also flew with Clinton, as did  
the parents of the American-born Queen Noor and four members of 
Congress: Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 
and Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and David Bonior, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy told reporters he was relieved to be away from the Senate  
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Leahy, who also was  
involving in taking depositions last week from former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said that when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Saturday that closing arguments were to begin today, senators 
looked in amazement at each other because they thought that was the 
point of Saturday's long presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he believed that a final vote on the articles of  
impeachment would come Thursday and that senators could use Friday 
to debate a censure motion against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens did not talk to reporters on the plane.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose today for the first time in six  
trading days and the dollar gained against the yen as investors 
were relieved by a fall in bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 94.41 points,  
or 0.68 percent, to close at 13,992.49, after losing more than 100 
points earlier in the day. On Friday, the average fell 188.77 
points, or 1.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.50 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 1.44  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 113.20 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 112.72 yen 
to 113.66 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the rebound in the stock market to the drop  
in long-term bond yields, which also triggered the selling of the 
yen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of relief spread in the market following the fall in  
interest rates and the weaker yen,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general 
manager at Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has slipped  
back to 2.160 percent from Friday's finish of 2.365 percent, 
driving up its price to 97.19 yen from 95.67 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields fell after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa urged  
Japan's central bank to consider taking steps to curb rising 
long-term yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said Friday the Bank of Japan should consider  
conducting twist operations, in which sales of short-term 
securities are offset by purchases of long-term bonds. The 
operation would help bring down long-term bond yields by reducing 
the supply of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, a BOJ policy board member indicated he was  
against further monetary easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent rises in bond yields have weighed on share prices,  
because higher capital costs are expected to hurt corporate 
earnings, put a damper on housing mortgages, and threaten to stall 
an economic recovery further. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's long-term interest rates began rising in December, when  
the government announced plans to issue a large volume of bonds in 
the next fiscal year starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,090.63. The 
TOPIX closed down 6.13 points, or 0.56 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 261.19 million  
shares, down from Friday's 365.63 million. Advances outnumbered 
declines 527 to 516, with 226 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in bond yields helped to pushed down the yen against  
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Contradictory comments by Japanese officials on whether the Bank  
of Japan should expand its purchases of government bonds has made 
many currency traders reluctant to move in either direction, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currency trading, the euro traded at 127.66 yen,  
up from 126.88 yen late Friday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Jason Schwartzman To Debut in Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's tough being an ``unknown'' trying to make  
it as an actor in Hollywood. And it probably doesn't help to be 
just 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jason Schwartzman, who plays a nerdy 10th-grader in  
``Rushmore,'' did have a few things on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	Try a mother who is an actress, a father who was a producer --  
and an uncle named Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartzman, who makes his acting debut in the film, tells  
Sunday's Daily News that it was mostly chance that got him the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	At a party at Coppola's Napa Valley, Calif., vineyard, a casting  
director from ``Rushmore'' was describing the teen-age character to 
Schwartzman's cousin, Sofia Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sofia says, 'Oh my God, that sounds like my cousin Jason,'''  
Schwartzman says. Next thing Schwartzman knew, he was being 
introduced to the director, and had his first role. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the film for the young actor was working with an  
idol -- Bill Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to watch him in his element -- working and creating  
-- was incredible,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Delta To Offer Web-Only Low Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- This time, Delta Air Lines is using incentives to  
try to lure more people into using its World Wide Web site to book 
their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier, which last month tried and subsequently dropped a  
$2 surcharge on non-Web ticket bookings, announced Monday it will 
offer weekly ``Web Fares'' that will be posted Wednesday mornings 
offering discounted travel for that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Introducing the weekly program for this holiday weekend, with  
Valentine's Day on Sunday and Presidents' Day on Monday, the 
special roundtrip fares will include a $214 fare from Atlanta to 
San Francisco, a $114 price from Cincinnati to New York and $64 
from Dallas-Fort Worth to San Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-San Francisco fare is nearly $100 less than a 14-day  
advance purchase ticket, and more than $600 less than a roundtrip 
booked this weekend by traditional means. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really trying to condition consumers not to look  
anywhere else -- not to access comparative travel information,'' 
said James Ashurst, spokesman for the American Society of Travel 
Agents. He added that such discounts leave out many Americans who 
lack ready Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the other large airlines also offer special fares or  
additional bonus miles to consumers booking through their 
respective Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta stirred controversy among travel agents and some travelers  
last month by adding the $2 surcharge on roundtrip tickets booked 
by traditional means. At the time, the carrier cited rising 
distribution costs. It dropped the surcharge two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta, which has sporadically offered Web-only sales, still  
books less than 2 percent of its tickets that way.

<HEADLINE> Last Arguments Made in Clinton Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors argued their last stand  
against President Clinton at his impeachment trial Monday in 
closing arguments to senators ready by all accounts to return 
verdicts of not guilty by week's end. Clinton's lawyer dismissed 
their case as retribution ``to achieve partisan ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is still the truth and a lie is still a lie, and the  
rule of law should apply to everyone,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, 
R-Wis., said in a final plea for guilty votes on charges of perjury 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, don't be fooled by the president's excuses and spin  
control,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Countering for the president, White House Counsel Charles F.C.  
Ruff launched a sharp attack on the Republican prosecutors 
themselves. They are, he said, ``more focused on retribution, more 
designed to achieve partisan ends, more uncaring about the future 
we face together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to prosecution claims of ``seven pillars of  
obstruction,'' he ridiculed them for building their case on 
``shifting sand castles of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority is required to find Clinton guilty and  
automatically remove him from office. Even Republicans concede that 
won't happen, and some GOP senators have suggested that -- 
particularly on the perjury charge -- it is possible a majority of 
the Senate might vote to acquit. The charges stem from Clinton's 
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The final presentations -- three hours to each side in the  
historic trial -- marked the end of the argument phase in the 
four-week trial. Beginning Tuesday, senators will deliberate on 
Clinton's fate, with final votes on the articles of impeachment 
expected on Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for opening final deliberations to the public faded  
during the day, when Majority Leader Trent Lott announced his 
opposition. ``It's going to be hard to meet the two-thirds hurdle'' 
needed to open the doors, conceded Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, a supporter of open debate. 
</P>
<P>
	While the outcome of the trial seemed sure, House prosecutors  
showed they intend to fight to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief proscutor, asked Senate leaders to  
approve three subpoenas for people who have cast doubt on sworn 
testimony that White House aide Sidney Blumenthal gave in the trial 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has denied feeding reporters a story -- attributed  
ultimately to Clinton -- to the effect that Ms. Lewinsky had told 
the president she was known as ``the stalker'' and that she had 
made a sexual demand on him. 
</P>
<P>
	In sworn affidavits in recent days, freelance journalist  
Christopher Hitchens and his wife, Carol Blue, said that Blumenthal 
had told them at a lunch in March 1998 that Ms. Lewinsky was known 
as a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third affidavit released Monday, R. Scott Armstrong, an  
author and journalist, said that Hitchens and his wife told him 
that Blumenthal had referred to Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from either Lott or Democratic  
leader Tom Daschle to the letter from Hyde. Daschle did object to a 
request from Lott to make the Hitchens and Blue affidavits an 
official part of the record. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Blumenthal's testimony appeared to have  
little direct impact on the trial itself, where it has been clear 
that Clinton has enough support to win acquittal on both articles 
of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan combat loomed, however, on a Democratic demand for a  
formal vote to censure the president immediate after the trial 
ends. Many Republicans are opposed, and one, Phil Gramm of Texas, 
has all but threatened a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters that Democrats would force the Senate to  
return to the issue later this year if Republicans don't agree to 
permit a vote on censure after the close of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated that several of the Senate's 45 Democrats oppose  
censure and that it would take ``20 Republicans to join'' the 
supporters to overcome any filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats favor censuring Clinton to make clear their  
displeasure with his behavior. But they have insisted the vote 
occur outside the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who oppose censure contend that it would set a bad  
constitutional precedent, that the only remedy available to 
Congress is conviction and removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks of sitting in silence while the two legal teams  
jousted, senators were eager for an end to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Democrat Patrick Leahy of  
Vermont, excused for the day to join the official United States 
delegation at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate chamber, by-now familiar faces repeated well-worn  
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's ``lies to the grand jury were not to protect his  
family or the dignity of his office, but to protect himself from 
criminal liability for his perjury and obstruction of justice in 
the Jones case,'' Sensenbrenner said, referring to the sexual 
harassment lawsuit that had been filed against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House prosecutor, Rep. Stephen Buyer of Indiana, said,  
``None of our laws provide for good job performance, contrition, 
forgiveness or popularity polls as a remedy for criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``...Clinton, by his persistent and calculated misconduct and  
illegal acts, has set a pernicious example of lawlessness, an 
example which by its very nature subverts respect for the law. His 
perverse example inevitably undermines the integrity of both the 
office of the president and the judicial process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff alone delivered the closing argument for the president.  
Speaking for over an hour from his wheelchair, sipping occasionally 
from a cup of water, he ended with the words he had uttered at the 
beginning of the trial four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that  
have been brought against him. He did not commit perjury. He did 
not commit obstruction of justice. He must not be removed from 
office.''

<P>
	Excerpts from Monday's closing arguments in the impeachment  
trial against President Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``I submit -- and I feel this so strongly that it bothers me that  
I can't make it clear -- that to violate the oath as a witness in a 
civil case or a criminal case, in the Jones matter or in the grand 
jury, smashes against the integrity of our system of government.'' 
-- Rep. George Gekas, R-Penn.

<P>
	``Despite the dire warnings and scare tactics and heavy-handed  
threats by those who would circumvent the solemn constitutional 
process that we're all engaged in, our great country has 
survived.'' -- Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A few months ago I stood in your shoes, as did all the

make what would likely be the most important vote of our careers.

President Clinton, however, refuses to admit what all of us know is

	``The question before you now is, how will this chapter end?  
Will the final chapter say that the United States Senate turned its 
back on perjury and obstruction of justice by the president of the 
United States? Or will it say that the Senate took a principled 
stand and told the world that no person, not even the president,

even the president?'' -- Chabot.

that's the purpose of the rule of law. It's the functions of the

a vision more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve 
partisan ends, more uncaring about the future we face together.'' -- 
Charles Ruff, White House counsel.

Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the 
president in office?

<P>
	``Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it  
would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you

<P>
	``Empty pots. Attractive containers, but when you take the lid  
off, you'll find nothing to sustain you.

<P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Down; Dow Off 40.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today after giving up  
early-morning gains. Technology shares, which have set the pace for 
the broader market in recent months, shook off last week's slump. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
at 9,263.82, down 40.42 from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Stock Market, dominated by technology stocks,  
rebounded modestly from several weak sessions last week. The index 
hit a new record of 2,510.09 last Monday, then spiralled lower to 
end the week 5.5 percent below its new record. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.67 points to 2,378.29.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week's selloff was prompted by bad news from computer-chip  
makers and online brokerages, but left no part of the sector 
unscathed. Today, industry giants were mostly responsible for the 
comeback, with Microsoft rising 1 13/16 to 161 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 1.72 at 1,237.68, the NYSE composite index was down 
1.60 points at 585.69, and the American Stock Exchange composite 
index was off 0.62 at 705.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 220.6 million shares, 
considerably slower than Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are also awaiting the next word from Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who will testify this week before a House 
committee. A recent streak of robust economic reports have stirred 
fears that the Fed will soon raise interest rates to help cool off 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.68 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.06 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.42 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.48 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cecil Fielder Rejoins Blue Jays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cecil Fielder is starting over again with the  
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, who began his major league career with Toronto in 1985,  
signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays on Monday and was 
invited to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old designated hitter-first baseman will earn  
$500,000 if he makes the team, along with an additional $1.5 
million available in performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very fortunate to get this opportunity to come back to  
Toronto and play,'' Fielder said from Florida during a conference 
call. ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (signing minor league deal) doesn't bother me. That's  
just the situation that is at hand. If I was that concerned with 
the contract, I wouldn't be going to camp,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder split last season between the Anaheim Angels and  
Cleveland Indians, hitting a combined .233 with 17 homers and 68 
RBIs in 117 games. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year major league veteran, he has a .255 career average  
with 319 homers and 1,008 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder left Toronto in 1989 to sign with Japan's Hanshin  
Tigers. He returned to the majors a year later, spending seven 
years with Detroit (1990-96) and hitting 51 home runs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder was traded to the New York Yankees in the summer of 1996  
and made $7.2 million with them in 1997. He signed a free-agent 
contract with Anaheim in 1998 for $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, 35, rejoins a team in dire need of a productive DH to  
replace Jose Canseco, who hit a career-high 46 home runs with 107 
RBIs. He signed as a free agent with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put this into perspective,'' Blue Jays general manager  
Gord Ash said. ``This is a minor league contract with no guaranteed 
money, so it's a free look in essence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil has a ratio which translates into 100 RBIs over 600  
at-bats. There are not many players that have that kind of ratio. 
This is an opportunity. There's no commitment and we'll just see 
what develops,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder's weight has always been an issue throughout his major  
league career. But the 6-foot-3, 261-pound Fielder says production 
-- not what he tips the scales at -- will dictate whether he sticks 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter if I'm light or heavy, if I don't hit the ball,  
that's all that matters,'' he said., ``If the way you looked made 
baseball players, there would be a whole bunch of guys still 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays also re-adjusted their ticket prices Monday after  
reducing seating capacity at SkyDome for baseball games. The club 
will provide about 45,000 seats, about 6,000 less than capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	While the club cut the cost of some seats, the overall average  
ticket price increased 14.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pirate-Free Online Music Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM and the record industry's top companies plan  
to test new technology that would let people take music off the 
Internet while protecting the music industry from bootleggers. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM scheduled a news conference today with BMG Entertainment,  
EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group 
and Warner Music Group to demonstrate a secure digital music system 
that would be delivered through cable modems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that the IBM technology  
would allow people to order entire albums over the Internet and 
copy them onto compact discs. Using high-speed cable modems, 
someone could download a 60-minute disc in less than 10 minutes, 
the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. was among several  
high-technology companies that pledged in December to help the 
music industry develop ways to distribute music over the Internet 
while preventing illegal copying. 
</P>
<P>
	The record industry's effort to create secure methods for  
offering digital music comes as a technology called MP3 is gaining 
popularity as a way to more easily compress, store and distribute 
audio files on the Internet. While some MP3 songs being distributed 
on the Internet are legal and endorsed by record labels, the amount 
of bootlegged material online has grown rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Congregation at King's Church Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The pews are filled long before the start of the  
morning service, and despite a heavy rain, worshipers spill onto 
the sidewalk outside the historic church. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a typical Sunday morning at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where  
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 76-year-old building is showing its age: the ceilings  
are cracked, the carpet is worn, the floors are creaky. 
</P>
<P>
	So next month, the congregation will pick up and move across the  
street -- to a new $8 million facility designed to accommodate twice 
as many worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some members are naturally nostalgic,'' said the Rev. Joseph  
Roberts Jr. ``But now that we're getting ready to move, they see it 
is sensible. Others are very excited about the opportunity to 
expand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service -- which already runs the visitors  
center at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site in the 
neighborhood where King grew up, preached and is buried -- will 
assume responsibility for the preservation of the historic church 
on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a lot of activities to keep the church alive,''  
said Park Service superintendent Frank Catroppa. ``We want the 
people who visit to experience something when they're in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation's decision to move, he said, was a dream come  
true for the Park Service. Despite its modest brick facade, worn 
red carpeting and tattered hymn books, Ebenezer is revered. 
</P>
<P>
	``People all over the world want to see where Dr. King  
preached,'' said Park Service historian Dean Rowley. 
</P>
<P>
	Long before King introduced the world to his gospel of social  
and economic justice, his father and grandfather had been teaching 
the same message from Ebenezer's pulpit. It's also the place his 
mother, Alberta King, was gunned down while playing the organ in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation's new church is an architectural marvel paid  
for by individual donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is it beautiful, but is ethnically sensitive with no  
sense of being exclusivistic,'' Roberts said. ``We are still going 
to welcome people from all races and all nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new building, which will feature eight towering  
stained-glass windows that depict the struggle for human rights, 
can accommodate both a 150-member choir and 1,600 in its oak pews -- 
more than doubling the number currently able to attend Sunday 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard King, who joined Ebenezer in 1966, said he and others in  
the congregation are excited about the move and believe Martin 
Luther King Jr. would be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many churches, I'm sad to say, are like Sunday morning  
social clubs,'' said King, who is not related to the civil rights 
leader. ``Churches have all sorts of opportunities to affect change 
outside their walls, and they don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Sunday in March, Roberts plans to hold a 30-minute  
service in the current sanctuary immediately before the children in 
the congregation lead them over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The children -- the children -- shall lead us in,'' Roberts said  
from the pulpit, alluding to the words of Isaiah.

<HEADLINE> Schulz Surprised by Broadway Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Schulz said he wasn't prepared  
for a multiethnic Broadway revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie 
Brown,'' but he's willing to give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The play includes a piano-playing Schroeder who is black and an  
Asian Linus, still trailing his blanket. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz said in Sunday's Press Democrat of Santa Rosa that he's  
not racist -- only concerned about others tinkering with the 
``Peanuts'' gang he still owns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, 'This is mine. I did this thing. Nobody helped me.  
I did the whole thing and now you're going to come in and show me 
how wonderfully open-minded and liberal you are,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz called United Features Syndicate to inquire about the new  
production and was told that other stage standards, including 
``Showboat,'' were being treated to the same multiethnic approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ... people are willing to accept it, willing to accept that  
Lucy's leaning on the piano playing up to a black Schroeder, all 
right, let's see how it goes,'' Schulz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The production opened Feb. 4 to mixed reviews, though audiences  
have been enthusiastic.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise, Break Losing Streak / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. Treasury bonds rose slightly Monday halting  
a five-session losing streak, as investors moved to take advantage 
of high yields. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 5.34 percent from 5.35 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices have fallen dramatically in recent weeks amid  
concerns that a strong U.S. economy would convince the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates. At the Fed's most recent meeting, 
last week, Fed policy-makers decided to leave rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates reduce the value of investments with fixed  
returns, such as bonds. Lower bond prices, though have cut yields, 
which make them more attractive to long term investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-termTreasury securities  
rose 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities rose between 1/16 
point and 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.14 
point to 1,302.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.52 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from Friday to 4.42 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.56 percent, as the discount fell 0.01 
percentage point to 4.41 percent. One-year yields were 4.64 percent 
as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1/8 to 125. The average yield to maturity 
fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp Agrees to Interviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Linda Tripp, whose taped conversations with  
Monica Lewinsky sparked President Clinton's impeachment crisis, has 
agreed to interviews with NBC's ``Today'' show and CNN's ``Larry 
King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's ``Today'' interview, a pre-taped talk with  
correspondent Jamie Gangel, will air Friday morning shortly after 
7:30 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll talk live with King in prime time the following Monday,  
Feb. 15, CNN said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who worked in the White House counsel's office  
before being transferred to the Pentagon, befriended Ms. Lewinsky 
and got her to talk about her relationship with Clinton while 
secretly taping their talks. She's yet to give an extensive 
interview about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangel repeatedly requested the interview over an eight-month  
period, ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said. It was Mrs. 
Tripp's choice to do the interview on tape instead of live, and 
Gangel will speak to her on Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're interested in what her thoughts are now that the  
trial is almost over and how this has affected her life,'' Zucker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second big interview on this story landed by ``Today.''  
The top-rated morning program featured a Matt Lauer interview with 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shortly after the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to speak to ABC's Barbara Walters first,  
but that interview can't be done until Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr grants permission. ABC had been hoping to run the interview 
during the February ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, was not available for  
comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Monday's developments in President Clinton's  
Senate impeachment trial: 
</P>
<P>
	--During closing arguments, House Judiciary Committee Chairman  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., dismissed a censure resolution and called on 
senators to ``cleanse'' the presidency and convict Clinton. ``We 
have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if 
you are the president,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff sharply criticized the  
House prosecutors for seeking to convict Clinton based on 
retribution and circumstantial evidence. ``The stubborn facts will 
not budge, nor will the stubborn denials by every participant in 
their mythical plot,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., announced his  
opposition to holding open debate on the articles of impeachment. 
Senators will vote Tuesday on whether to open the doors to 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hyde asked Senate leaders to approve three subpoenas for people  
who have cast doubt on White House aide Sidney Blumenthal's 
deposition last week.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Farm Loan Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New federal regulations will make it easier  
and faster for farmers to get guaranteed loans, Vice President Al 
Gore said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes to be published in the Federal Register later this  
week are designed to reduce the time and paperwork required to 
approve applications as well as make the loan approval process more 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency guarantees loans with agricultural  
lenders for thousands of American farmers and ranchers each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing our procedures recognizes that lenders with  
sufficient agricultural lending experience are qualified to use 
some of their own loan-approval procedures,'' Gore said. ``This new 
policy will help expand the number of lenders participating in the 
program by making it easier to use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, for loans under $50,000, the application form will  
be cut from six pages to one. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy will also feature a Preferred Lender Program.  
Under that feature, lenders who have their credit management 
systems approved by the FSA can go through a streamlined process 
that includes automatic application approval if the agency does not 
respond within 14 days of submission. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said the new guidelines are part of a push to  
decrease the FSA's authority over individual guaranteed loans to 
more of an oversight and advice role.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Releasing the administration's five-part  
strategy to fight drugs, Vice President Al Gore called on Monday 
for an ``all-out effort to banish crime, drugs and disorder and 
hopelessness from our streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the Clinton administration's promise to take a  
balanced approach in cutting the nation's drug problem in half by 
2007, advocacy groups decried what they saw as a continued emphasis 
on law enforcement over prevention and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan continued to build on  
recent success in the fight against drugs, noting that government 
estimates show drug use by adults is at half what it was in 1979 
and that drug use by young people has started to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when drug dealers still roam our streets and rob our  
children of their dreams, and drug-related crime still ravages so 
many of our neighborhoods, we know that we have barely begun,'' 
Gore said. ``We must do so much more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide effort includes nearly $18 billion to be spent  
this year by the federal government. White House drug policy 
director Barry McCaffrey wants children to be the focal point for 
the drive against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``seeks to involve parents, coaches, mentors,  
teachers, clergy and other role models in a broad prevention 
campaign,'' McCaffrey said in the four-volume strategy sent to 
Capitol Hill on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The five parts of the administration plan are educating  
children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking the cycle of 
drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from drugs and 
reducing the drug supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and  
availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and 50 percent by 2007. 
Achieving the goal would mean just 3 percent of the U.S. population 
age 12 and older would be using illegal drugs. The current figure 
is estimated at 6.4 percent. In 1979, the rate was near 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But some advocates were unconvinced that the administration's  
proposal did enough to boost treatment and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's just another example of throwing billions  
of dollars down the bottomless pits of interdiction and failed 
prevention programs,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the 
Lindesmith Center, a drug policy think-tank funded by billionaire 
George Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadelmann and the ACLU said that two-thirds of the drug-control  
budget was still dedicated to law enforcement and interdiction. 
Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who has had a hand in writing anti-drug 
legislation in Congress, said the Clinton administration's budget 
numbers didn't match its promise to stress education and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is that the president's budget priorities don't  
match the rhetoric from the White House,'' Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey defended the administration's commitment to  
prevention, highlighting an advertising campaign that generates 
more than $195 million in matching contributions from media 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you take a three-year snapshot, we've increased prevention  
dollars by more than 40 percent,'' McCaffrey said. ``If you look at 
drug treatment dollars it's up 17 percent, and the FY 2000 budget 
continues that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey also trumpeted reduced coca cultivation in the Andean  
region, especially in Peru and Bolivia. However, cultivation in 
Colombia, where the product of the coca plant is used to produce 
cocaine, has risen 26 percent in just one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the fight against drugs was linked to a ``spiritual''  
struggle for the hearts of the nation's youth, and that education 
and adult role models were just as important as law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must start by recognizing that our nation's drug problem  
was not born in isolation and does not exist in a vacuum,'' Gore 
said. ``It is an interconnected problem and so our solutions must 
also be interconnected. We must mount an all out effort to banish 
crime, drugs and disorder and hopelessness from our streets once 
and for all.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Signs Bure Through 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Panthers wasted little time  
locking up Pavel Bure for the long term, signing the high-scoring 
Russian to a five-year contract extension Monday with an option for 
a sixth year. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star will remain under contract to the  
Panthers through at least the end of the 2003-04 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I can finish my career here,'' said the 27-year-old  
Bure, who has eight goals and 11 points in seven games since coming 
to Florida in a trade with Vancouver. ``That's why I took a 
long-term deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed, but sources put the deal at  
$47.5 million over five years with an option year at $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably among the top five (in the NHL), something like  
that,'' Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time 50-goal scorer came to Florida in a seven-player  
deal Jan. 17, ending a holdout in which he vowed never to play for 
Vancouver again. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida gave up defenseman Ed Jovanovski, centers Dave Gagner  
and Mike Brown and holdout goaltender Kevin Weekes for Bure, 
defenseman Bret Hedican and defenseman Brad Ference. The teams also 
traded draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers and Bure's agent, Mike Gillis, struck a $3 million  
contract for the rest of this season and began working on a 
long-term deal. Twenty-two days later, Bure was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``After going through what he went through in Vancouver -- for a  
team to step up and cut through what went on -- I told Pavel there'd 
have to be a commitment from him,'' Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been thrilled with everything that's gone on so far. I  
think his play so far is a reflection of how he feels. He's really 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure scored two goals in his first appearance, a 5-2 win over  
the New York Islanders, and became only the second player in the 
past 20 years to score six goals in his first three games with a 
new team. Bure scored a point in each of his first six games, as 
Florida went 4-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I surprised myself with the way I was playing, but for the  
team I'm not surprised,'' Bure said. 
</P>
<P>
	His streak ended when he sprained his knee Friday night in a 3-0  
loss to Pittsburgh. He sat out Saturday's tie against Carolina and 
did not dress for Monday's game against St. Louis, but is expected 
back by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing Pavel to a long-term deal is a major step for the  
organization to take, and a major investment,'' Panthers president 
Bill Torrey said. ``We are trying to make a statement to everybody 
that we are here to win and to put together the most exciting 
hockey team we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure won the 1992 Calder Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the year,  
scoring 34 goals in 60 games. He followed that with consecutive 
60-goal seasons, leading the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup finals 
with 16 postseason goals in 24 games. His 51 goals last season was 
one off the league lead.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Strong Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro Monday as the  
new European currency gained strength on reports that Germany's 
unemployment figures had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's strength against the yen also helped the dollar rise  
against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.43  
Japanese yen, up from 113.20 late Friday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1318, up from $1.1260.	   Investors bought euros and shed dollars and yen amid reports 
that government figures showed ``a sharp decline in the level of 
unemployment'' in Germany, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign 
Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave the euro support against the dollar and the yen,''  
Gilmore said. Before the euro rose, however, the European currency 
hit $1.1218, its lowest level against the dollar since it began 
trading on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar also gained strength against the yen as Japanese  
officials squabbled about rising yields on long-term government 
bonds that have helped the yen strengthen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa urged Japan's  
central bank to consider curbing rising long-term bond rates. But 
on Monday, a Bank of Japan policy board member indicated he was 
against further monetary easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields subsequently fell Monday, helping the dollar rise  
against the yen and allowing Tokyo stocks to ascend for the first 
time in six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of relief spread in the market following the fall in  
interest rates and the weaker yen,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general 
manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4151 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4220, and 1.4811 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4893. The British 
pound rose to $1.6399 from $1.6329. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7280 German 
marks, down from 1.7370; 5.7971 French francs, down from 5.8241; 
and 1,709.40 Italian lire, down from 1,718.21.

	American Cancels More Flights  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled some of its flights for  
a fourth day today as pilots again called in ``unfit to fly'' amid 
a labor dispute related to the company's recent purchase of Reno 
Air. More than 680 flights have been canceled since talks bogged 
down Friday over when Reno Air pilots will get paid the same as 
American pilots. The Allied Pilots Association wants the airline to 
immediately upgrade the lower-paid Reno pilots to American's pay 
scales. The Dallas-based airline says it needs 12 to 18 months to 
properly train the Reno Air pilots and convert Reno Air equipment 
to American standards. American's parent AMR was down 2 5/16 at 57 
today.

	Auto Dealer Profits Rise 27 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cost-cutting and a robust market for new  
cars and trucks helped the nation's franchised auto dealers boost 
profits 27 percent last year. The average pretax profit was about 
$390,000, the National Automobile Dealers Association announced at 
its annual convention today. That compares with $306,980 in 1997. 
The average net profit on new vehicles doubled to $150 from $73 a 
year earlier. Profits from service and parts sales also rose, as 
did earnings from used-car sales.

	Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 13.13  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as an early rally was  
deflated by analysts' predictions of a market correction. 
Technology stocks, which have set the pace for the broader market 
in recent months, stemmed last week's losses but failed to regain 
much momentum. Gains by some of the industry's blue-chip companies 
were matched by steep losses by younger, more volatile Internet 
businesses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,291.11, 
down 13.13 from Friday's close. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 
31.29 at 2,404.91. One of Wall Street's most persistently bullish 
analysts. Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at 
Prudential Securities, said a correction of 5 to 10 percent in the 
Dow is likely. And Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill 
Lynch &AMP; Co, said he expects the Dow to drop to the 7,500-8,000 
range.

	Ameritrade Suffers Half-Hour Outage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online broker Ameritrade suffered a half-hour  
outage before stock markets opened TODAY, the latest in a series of 
computer glitches to raise questions about the reliability of 
Internet trading systems. The company took down its system from 
8:56 a.m. to 9:24 a.m. EST in order to fix the problem, preventing 
online customers from placing orders before the opening of stock 
trading at 9:30 a.m. The outage also affected the accounts of 
Accutrade, a smaller online brokerage also run by the same company, 
said Paula Ebert, a spokeswoman for the Omaha, Neb.-based 
brokerage. Last week, rival online brokerage ETrade suffered a 
series of shutdowns during trading hours. Ameritrade Holdings stock 
was down 15 1/2 at 80 today.

first major step in an industry effort to develop security 
standards for digital music sales, while battling technology that 
lets people easily download free and often illegally copied songs. 
Beginning in the spring, IBM's new technology will be tested over 
six months by about 1,000 people in San Diego. BMG Entertainment, 
EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group 
and Warner Music Group will create an online music store with more 
than 2,000 albums available for purchase. IBM stock was up 1 7/32

distribution of movies. Justice spokeswoman Jennifer Rose said the 
department is looking into certain possibly anti-competitive 
practices in the distribution of motion pictures. She declined to 
name any companies whose practices are under review. The probe, at 
a very preliminary stage, focuses on possible violations of a 1948 
consent decree, known as the Paramount decree, that forced movie 
studios to sell their movie theaters and put other restrictions on 
their relationships, according to a source, who requested

	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government should force banks to

the stock market from harming the financial system, a think-tank 
proposed today. Banks traditionally have vast shareholdings in 
companies in a number of industries, making their accounts 
vulnerable to an overall drop in stock prices. Steep losses in the 
value of their share holdings could lead to worries about Japan's 
financial system, according to the think tank Daiwa Institute of

real -- which Cardoso used to call Brazil's ``passport to 
modernization'' -- has lost 35 percent of its value against the 
dollar. Inflation is roaring back, after plunging from 2,700 
percent in 1993 to about 2 percent last year. While there's no 
consensus on how to fix Latin America's largest economy, everybody 
agrees that the treatment will be long and painful, and that the

<HEADLINE> Final Arguments Due at Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate prepared for closing arguments  
in the impeachment trial, Democratic leader Tom Daschle estimated 
today that a follow-up resolution to censure President Clinton 
would need support from about 20 Republicans to clear an expected 
GOP filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said of the censure effort that could follow votes on  
the articles of impeachment this week, ``We're trying to make a 
historic statement of record'' on Clinton's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans are expected to vote for the impeachment  
articles, but if those votes fail -- as expected -- many of the GOP 
senators feel that a follow-up vote to censure would be too little 
punishment and a bad constitutional precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's estimate indicated that at least five of the 45  
Democrats want to end the impeachment matter with an acquittal -- 
and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties have been working on a censure  
statement, but the resolution would be debated only after the 
Senate voted -- as early as Thursday -- to acquit or convict Clinton 
on the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators are so strongly opposed to a censure  
that they would be expected to mount a filibuster, which could be 
stopped only with 60 votes in the 100-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said that ``it's in everybody's interest'' to consider a  
censure immediately after the trial ends and before the Senate 
takes a holiday recess next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For today's arguments, House prosecutors were packaging the  
now-familiar evidence into conclusions that Clinton should be 
removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers also planned to wrap up their case today,  
reiterating that while Clinton misled the nation in denying his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky, he committed no crime warranting 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	With 67 votes, a two-thirds majority of senators, needed for  
conviction, it was a foregone conclusion the president's side would 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few elements of suspense left was whether those  
supporting conviction would even reach the symbolic level of a 
simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats interviewed on the Sunday talk shows predicted that  
both counts would fail to win a majority. Republicans said the 
perjury charge might fall short but that a majority would vote to 
convict on the obstruction charge. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day of final arguments today, the 100 senators move into  
deliberations, probably behind closed doors, with the vote on the 
two articles expected Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with acquittal on both charges, the Senate would still be  
left with the question of whether to censure Clinton for his affair 
with the former White House intern and his attempts to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in Jordan to attend the funeral of King Hussein, as  
were two senators who will sit in judgment of him, Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. The lawmakers will not miss any 
votes today and Senate leaders decided to go ahead with the trial 
as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy, commenting to reporters aboard Clinton's plane on the  
flight to Jordan, said missing today's impeachment session was no 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Leahy, who was one of the  
Senate's overseers for last week's depositions. He suggested there 
was little point in a long day of closing arguments going over 
ground already covered repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he believed a final vote on the articles of  
impeachment would come Thursday and senators could use Friday to 
debate a possible censure motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's arguments, House managers were all but  
acknowledging defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the legacy of this trial was the fact that the  
Democrats took the hard line of ignoring the criminal activity of 
one of their own rather than viewing the evidence objectively,'' 
another prosecutor, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said on ``Fox 
News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One conservative Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama,  
said on ABC's ``This Week'' that he had concerns that both counts 
against Clinton were ``porous in nature,'' and guessed that 10 to 
15 of the 55 GOP senators might vote to acquit on the perjury 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democrats could vote to acquit on both counts. Possibly  
the only two doubtfuls are Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, the 
only Democrat to vote against an earlier Democratic motion to 
dismiss the charges, and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a staunch 
defender of the Constitution and Senate traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd introduced the motion to dismiss, but he told ABC there was  
``no doubt'' that Clinton's actions rose to the impeachable level 
of high crimes and misdemeanors as set out in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrd added there were other factors in deciding how to vote.  
``In these remaining two years (of Clinton's presidency), I can 
turn my back on this. I can close this as a chapter. I think we all 
ought to do that and think of the healing of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt to come up with a resolution censuring the president  
if he escapes removal from office was being led by Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah. But they faced 
tough opposition from senators of both parties who regarded censure 
as either unconstitutional or an unneeded afterthought.

<HEADLINE> IBM, Record Cos. Battle Bootleggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Five leading record companies are teaming with  
IBM to test a new technology that lets people quickly record 
CD-quality albums off the Internet, while protecting the music 
industry from online bootleggers. 
</P>
<P>
	The test announced Monday is the first major step in an industry  
effort to develop security standards for digital music sales, while 
battling increasingly popular technology that lets people easily 
download free and often illegally copied songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales represent just a tiny fraction of the $12  
billion music industry. Major record companies hope to outdo the 
music pirates by offering better-quality sound and greater choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial offers an extraordinary window on the future of the  
music business,'' said Roger Faxon, senior vice president of 
business development at EMI, whose music catalog includes the 
Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra and the Spice Girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in the spring, IBM's new technology will be tested  
over six months by about 1,000 people in San Diego. BMG 
Entertainment, EMI Recorded Music, Sony Music Entertainment, 
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group will create an online 
music store with more than 2,000 albums. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have not yet determined how much to charge.  
</P>
<P>
	But it shouldn't cost any more than buying a CD from a local  
record store, said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst at technology 
research firm Jupiter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to gauge consumer interest by charging a  
premium for this stuff,'' Mooradian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBM system would allow people to order songs or entire  
albums over the Internet, then store and play them on their 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology will include encryption coding to foil pirates  
who would copy the songs and distribute them widely over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback is a lack of portability. The only way for the  
consumer to transfer the music out of the computer is to buy a CD 
recording device, which generally costs anywhere from $150 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Lee, a 27-year-old lawyer from London, said Monday he  
would still be interested. Lee said the expense of the CD recorder 
would be offset by the convenience of online shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would assume they would keep a massive database, so you  
would be able to get something you ordinarily wouldn't find in the 
stores,'' Lee said as he browsed through Mick Jagger CDs in a 
Manhattan record store. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will also be able to download an album's cover art and  
liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference announcing the test, an IBM executive  
downloaded the Dave Matthews Band album ``Crash'' in about three 
minutes, and recorded it onto a CD in about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Record companies hope industrywide security standards will be  
ready in time for the next holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	The test initially will include only computer users with  
high-speed cable TV modems -- a tiny fraction of Internet-surfing 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually a service for more common, but slower telephone  
modems will be included, but the download would be many times as 
long as with a cable modem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see whether this technology can actually get the music  
into the home in a way that's convenient and effective for 
consumers. If that's the case, then it's a very promising way to 
bring that to the market very soon,'' Faxon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The record companies are trying to combat a technology called  
MP3 that is gaining popularity as a way to easily store and 
distribute audio on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	While some MP3 songs being distributed on the Internet are legal  
and endorsed by record labels, the amount of bootlegged material 
has grown rapidly. Once downloaded, an MP3 file can be copied 
endlessly and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp. was one of several  
technology companies that pledged in December to help the music 
industry develop security standards. Others include AT&AMP;T Corp., 
America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Toshiba Corp.

<HEADLINE> Little League Champs Meet Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ace of the staff was scratched, so the  
Toms River East Little League champions settled for the White 
House's No. 2 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Ocean County, N.J., kids were disappointed at meeting  
Vice President Al Gore instead of President Clinton on Monday, they 
didn't let on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all right,'' said Todd Frazier, who pitched the Americans  
to victory in August over Kashima, Japan. ``Just making it to the 
White House is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attended the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein, so he  
sent in Gore off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a thrilling accomplishment,'' the vice president said of  
the boys' exploits. ``You'll remember this all your lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recited the Little League pledge, which ends, ``I will  
always do my best.'' Then he added, ``Well, this past August, you 
did your best, and your best turned out to be the very best in the 
entire world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House tour was the latest, and possibly last, of many  
honors the boys have accumulated since winning the title. They 
appeared on Rosie O'Donnell's TV show, were feted by 40,000 at a 
parade in their hometown, went on the field with the Yankees, and 
met Yogi Berra, among other honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting their busy public schedule since the victory, Gore said,  
``Probably this is sort of old hat for you guys.'' He said he might 
ask for the players' autographs. Moments later he got an 
autographed hat and an autographed drawing of the Little League 
World Series field in Williamsport, Pa.

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors: Remove Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bringing their impeachment case to a close,  
House prosecutors today urged the Senate to remove President 
Clinton from office because ``the rule of law should apply to 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional  
consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing the president 
to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come,'' Rep. 
F. James Sensenbrenner said in making closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	As the historic trial entered its final week, prosecutors got  
one last chance to sway a Senate seemingly on track to acquit the 
president on the two articles of impeachment passed by the House 
last December -- perjury and obstruction of justice. White House 
lawyers were to follow with their own arguments before senators 
began their deliberations on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner asked senators not to be swayed by presidential  
lawyers' arguments or by attacks on prosecutor Kenneth Starr's 
investigation, and to recognize that Clinton himself was 
responsible for bringing the impeachment crisis upon the nation.

<HEADLINE> House Managers Near Likely Dead End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a long shot from the beginning, this  
business of trying to remove President Clinton from office, and the 
odds have only gotten worse. House prosecutors now appear to be 
appealing to history, rather than the Senate, in search of a 
favorable verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators should act ``not just for today, but for the ages to  
come,'' implored Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., in final arguments on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But for today, at least, the case to make Clinton the first  
American president removed for high crimes and misdemeanors 
appeared to be moving inexorably toward a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's acquittal later this week is being predicted by  
senators in both parties, as it has been for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ignoring the winds of public opinion and the realities of  
Senate arithmetic, the House managers forged ahead in their final 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, each of the 13 House managers rose to urge senators  
to find their courage. ``Convict him and remove him,'' insisted 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	And the long term was clearly on House Judiciary Committee  
Chairman Henry Hyde's mind as he wrapped up the prosecution's case 
by telling senators, ``The issues we're concerned with have 
consequences far into the future. ... Let us all take our place in 
history on the side of honor. And, oh yes, let right be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hyde, R-Ill., told reporters that, if the Senate failed  
to remove the president from office, ``we still are satisfied. We 
can live with our conscience. We did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate appears far short of the 67 votes needed to convict  
the president on either of the two articles of impeachment, and 
talk has turned to how many GOP senators would vote for acquittal -- 
and on the logistics of the next step, an expected resolution of 
censure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a movie and we know what the ending is,'' said Stuart  
Rothenberg, an independent analyst who publishes a political 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	He said House managers were going through the motions ``to play  
out the constitutional process. And they are trying to establish a 
record to show that their case is as strong as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The single-minded determination of House managers -- in fact, of  
all Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee -- to pursue the 
impeachment process to its conclusion appeared to rule out the 
possibility of any bipartisan compromise along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unclear how history is going to judge their  
performance, but I doubt if there's anything they can do in the 
closing argument that will have any bearing on it,'' Tom Mann, 
director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, said 
of the House managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mann said there were a number of times, early on, in which the  
process could have been concluded on a bipartisan basis -- but for 
the hard-line attitude of the House GOP managers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the House, basically, lost control of the case when  
Judiciary Committee Republicans declined to find common ground with 
Democrats short of impeachment -- such as a strongly worded 
reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	Had such a reprimand been permitted to come to the House floor,  
it would have enjoyed wide bipartisan support -- and received much 
the same in the Senate, Mann suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	But House managers, even against the odds facing them, never  
backed down one bit from their central contention of Clinton's 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will moral fortitude or political expediency rule the day?''  
asked House manager Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the final chapter say that the United States Senate  
turned its back on perjury and obstruction of justice by the 
president of the United States? Or will it say that the Senate took 
a principled stand and told the world that no person, not even the 
president, stands above the law?'' Chabot. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GOP Senate leadership seemed a little interested in  
expediency, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., began reminding  
senators preparing for deliberations that some of the best speeches 
are the shortest ones, as he looked toward final votes at week's 
end.

<HEADLINE> McCracken, D-Rays Avoid Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Outfielder Quinton McCracken avoided  
arbitration Monday when he agreed to a $1.85 million, one-year 
contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken, 28, hit .292 with seven home runs, 59 RBIs and 19  
stolen bases last season when he earned $270,000. He had been 
seeking $2.1 million for 1999, while the club was offering $1.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	By compromising, the two sides avoided an arbitration hearing  
scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCracken, the club's last arbitration-eligible player to agree  
to terms, led the Devil Rays games played (155), at bats (614), 
hits (179), total bases (252) and doubles (38). 
</P>
<P>
	His 18-game hitting streak from Aug. 18-Sept. 9 equaled the  
record for a player on a first-year expansion team. Defensively, 
his 18 outfield assists ranked second in the American League.

<HEADLINE> Last Arguments Made in Clinton Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors argued their last stand  
against President Clinton on Monday, challenging skeptical senators 
to ``cleanse the office'' by convicting him on impeachment counts 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton's lawyer dismissed 
the case as a dark vision of Republican retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under  
oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that 
serious,'' said chief prosecutor Henry Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican was scathing in rebutting defense claims  
that the House prosecutors had wanted ``too badly to win.'' None of 
them, he said, ``has committed perjury nor obstructed justice nor 
claimed false privileges. None of us has hidden evidence under 
anyone's bed nor encouraged false testimony before the grand 
jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what you want to do if you want to win too badly.''  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a final summation for the defense, White House  
Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff launched a sharp attack on the Republican 
prosecutors. They are, he said, ``more focused on retribution, more 
designed to achieve partisan ends, more uncaring about the future 
we face together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the prosecutors' claims of ``seven pillars of  
obstruction,'' he ridiculed them for building their case on 
``shifting sand castles of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority is required to find Clinton guilty and  
automatically remove him from office. Even Republicans concede that 
won't happen, and some GOP senators have suggested that -- 
particularly on the perjury charge -- it is possible a majority of 
the Senate might vote to acquit. The charges stem from Clinton's 
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The final presentations -- three hours to each side in the  
historic trial -- marked the end of the argument phase in the 
four-week trial. Beginning Tuesday, senators will deliberate on 
Clinton's fate, with final votes on the articles of impeachment 
expected on Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for opening final deliberations to the public faded  
during the day, when Majority Leader Trent Lott announced his 
opposition. ``It's going to be hard to meet the two-thirds hurdle'' 
needed to open the doors, conceded Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, a supporter of open debate. 
</P>
<P>
	While the outcome of the trial seemed sure, House prosecutors  
showed they intend to fight to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde asked Senate leaders to approve three subpoenas for people  
who have cast doubt on sworn testimony that White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal gave in the trial last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has denied feeding reporters a story -- attributed  
ultimately to Clinton -- to the effect that Ms. Lewinsky had told 
the president she was known as ``the stalker'' and that she had 
made a sexual demand on him. 
</P>
<P>
	In sworn affidavits in recent days, freelance journalist  
Christopher Hitchens and his wife, Carol Blue, said that Blumenthal 
had told them at a lunch in March 1998 that Ms. Lewinsky was known 
as a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third affidavit released Monday, R. Scott Armstrong, an  
author and journalist, said that Hitchens and his wife told him 
that Blumenthal had referred to Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from either Lott or Democratic  
leader Tom Daschle to the letter from Hyde. Daschle did object to a 
request from Lott to make the Hitchens and Blue affidavits an 
official part of the record. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Blumenthal's testimony appeared to have  
little direct impact on the trial itself, where it has been clear 
that Clinton has enough support to win acquittal on both articles 
of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Partisan combat loomed, however, on a Democratic demand for a  
formal vote to censure the president immediate after the trial 
ends. Many Republicans are opposed, and one, Phil Gramm of Texas, 
has all but threatened a filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	In his summation, Hyde addressed that issue, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He read aloud from a Democratic draft censure proposal to  
condemn Clinton ``in the strongest possible terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite, he said. Censure would be ``the next strongest  
possible terms,'' second to conviction and removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really cleanse the office as provided in the  
Constitution or do you use Air Wick of a censure resolution?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle moved to force a procedural vote on censure immediately  
after the trial. It will take 67 votes to prevail, virtually 
guaranteeing defeat, but will give Democrats a chance to make their 
positions clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also told reporters that Democrats would force the  
Senate to return to the issue later this year if Republicans don't 
agree to permit a vote on censure. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated that several of the Senate's 45 Democrats oppose  
censure and that it would take ``20 Republicans to join'' the 
supporters to overcome any filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats favor censuring Clinton to make clear their  
displeasure with his behavior. But they have insisted the vote 
occur outside the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who oppose censure contend that it would set a bad  
constitutional precedent, that the only remedy available to 
Congress is conviction and removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	After four weeks of sitting in silence while the two legal teams  
jousted, senators were eager for an end to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Democrat Patrick Leahy of  
Vermont, excused for the day to join the official United States 
delegation at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate chamber, by-now familiar faces repeated well-worn  
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's ``lies to the grand jury were not to protect his  
family or the dignity of his office, but to protect himself from 
criminal liability for his perjury and obstruction of justice in 
the Jones case,'' Sensenbrenner said, referring to the sexual 
harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff alone delivered the closing argument for the president.  
Speaking for over an hour from his wheelchair, sipping occasionally 
from a cup of water, he ended with the words he had uttered at the 
beginning of the trial four weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that  
have been brought against him. He did not commit perjury. He did 
not commit obstruction of justice. He must not be removed from 
office.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Police Probe Fraternity Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) -- Police were looking for four men after  
a fraternity pledge was fatally beaten at a weekend party. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas George Armstrong, a 21-year-old sophomore at Southwest  
Texas State University, died at a hospital Monday. He was a pledge 
at Tau Kappa Epsilon, where the party was held. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a very deep tragedy for Southwest Texas,''  
said Dean of Students John Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
	San Marcos police said the four men, who had been asked to leave  
the party, were wanted for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The men are not members of the fraternity and police do not know  
if they are students, said Police Chief Steve Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was over and Armstrong was sleeping on the ground  
floor of the fraternity house early Sunday when he was attacked, 
Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said two of the men wanted for questioning were seen at  
the fraternity house 15 minutes before Armstrong was discovered 
beaten at about 3:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no indications Armstrong was involved in the earlier  
incident in which the four men were asked to leave the party, 
Griffith said.

<HEADLINE> Stroh May Be Sold to Pabst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Stroh Brewery Co., the nation's fourth-largest  
beer producer, is reportedly discussing a deal to be sold to Pabst 
Brewing Co. for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the reported deal, Pabst would sell some Stroh brands to  
Miller Brewing Co., the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said in today's 
editions, citing unidentified sources. Pabst is the fifth-biggest 
U.S. brewer while Miller is second. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction, which could be announced today, could close  
some Stroh breweries and affect an unknown number of the Detroit 
company's approximately 3,000 employees nationwide, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh declined immediate comment this morning but said it  
planned to issue a statement later. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Pabst and Miller either refused comment or could  
not be located Sunday, according to the Journal Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh, a 149-year-old company, denied sale plans in October  
following published reports of a sale to San Antonio-based Pabst, 
which is owned by S&AMP;P Co. of Mill Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh has been struggling with declining sales, a loss of  
contract business, increased competition and heavy debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Pabst could acquire brands like Old  
Milwaukee, Schlitz and Heileman's Old Style, the newspaper said. 
Much of Pabst's production could be done by Miller at Miller's 
Milwaukee complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Miller could acquire Stroh's malt-liquor brands  
including Colt 45 and Mickey's, the newspaper reported. Stroh 
accounts for 55 percent of the malt-liquor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh has breweries in Allentown, Pa., Portland, Ore., Longview,  
Texas, Seattle, Wash., and Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Pabst said last February it was talking with BT Commercial  
Corp., an affiliate of Bankers Trust Corp., about a financial 
arrangement that would give it leeway to pursue acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewing for Pabst, a former Milwaukee-based company, could be  
profitable for Miller as it competes in an increasingly tight 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's beer sales volume increased 1.4 percent in 1998,  
trade publication Beer Marketer's Insights said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller accounted for 21.2 percent of the U.S. beer market last  
year while Stroh had 6.7 percent and Pabst had 2 percent, according

	Prosecutors Urge Clinton's Removal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors today made a final plea that  
President Clinton be removed from office, but the chief White House 
lawyer accused lawmakers of hurting the country by ``wanting to win 
too much.'' The prosecutors argued in closing arguments that the 
evidence supported the charges of obstruction of justice and 
perjury. White House Counsel Charles Ruff urged senators to 
conclude that Clinton's transgressions didn't rise to the level of 
impeachable offenses. Senators are to vote by week's end. 
Republicans concede they are short of the 67 votes needed to oust 
Clinton.

	Friends, Foes at Hussein Funeral  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein's ability as a mediator and a  
statesman was apparent even at his funeral today as adversaries 
from Israel and Syria, as well as the United States and Iraq, came 
together. The ceremony was attended by officials from about 40 
countries. There were no ice-breaking encounters among the major 
foes, but Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, shook hands and 
exchanged words with radical Palestinian guerrilla leader Nayef 
Hawatmeh. Hussein died yesterday at 63 of cancer after nearly a 
half century on the Hashemite throne.

	Kosovo Rebels Call for Cease-Fire

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians pressed for a formal  
cease-fire for Kosovo while Serbs sought a pledge to keep 
Yugoslavia's borders unchanged at today's session of peace talks. 
At the same time, international mediators wanted to drop what they 
called these ``side issues'' and move on to details of a peace 
settlement for Kosovo, where more than 2,000 people have died and 
about 300,000 have been driven from their homes in a year of 
fighting. The Serbs and Albanians remain so estranged that they are 
not meeting face-to-face.

	Mrs. Dole Nears Decision on 2000  
</P>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Former American Red Cross President  
Elizabeth Dole must leap one ``last major hurdle'' before deciding 
whether to seek the presidency, according to advisers who expect 
her to soon enter the 2000 race. The advisers say Dole will likely 
clear that bar as she tests the waters during a two-day trip to New 
Hampshire. She plans to trace the broad themes of a likely 
presidential campaign, without formally entering the race or 
addressing such hot-button issues as abortion and affirmative 
action. Meanwhile, conservative activist Gary Bauer formally filed 
papers with the FEC today to set up a presidential exploratory 
committee.

	Prosecutors: Pilot Made Bad Choice  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot was hotdogging when his  
jet sliced through a ski gondola cable in Italy, killing 20 people, 
a prosecutor said in opening statements today at Capt. Richard 
Ashby's court-martial. In addition to flying his plane too low and 
too fast, Ashby broke regulations by putting the aircraft through a 
barrel roll, the prosecutor said. Ashby's attorney told the jury: 
``It was just an accident. It was an accident waiting to happen.'' 
The pilot is charged with 20 counts of manslaughter in the Feb. 3, 
1998, accident.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first test of a human AIDS vaccine in  
Africa has begun in Uganda, says the U.S. National Institutes of 
Health, which is funding the study. The Uganda study tests a 
vaccine made by Pasteur Merieux Connaught that uses a canarypox 
virus to carry three HIV genes. Today's announcement was pegged as 
an important step toward developing a vaccine for countries hardest 
hit by the epidemic. In Uganda alone, it has killed nearly a 
half-million people and left 1 million children orphaned.

<HEADLINE> Air Force To Spend $54M on TV Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Worried about falling short of its recruiting  
goal for the first time in 20 years, the Air Force said Monday it 
will spend $54 million on television ads to try to boost 
enlistment. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign pushes the Air Force's overall advertising budget  
to $76 million and marks the first time it will use paid ads in 
recruiting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the awareness that television can generate right now,  
so it can begin to have an impact this year,'' said Brig. Gen. 
Peter U. Sutton, commander of the Air Force Recruiting Service, 
headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base here. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV spots will begin airing in March, during the NCAA  
basketball tournament, and will consist of public service 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force also plans to launch a national ad blitz in  
October to coincide with the new fall programming schedule. Those 
ads will feature commercials developed by a private ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has previously relied on print ads and public  
service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force is having trouble with recruitment despite the  
introduction last fall of new enlistment bonuses of up to $9,000 
for 115 qualifying career specialties. The armed service is 6 
percent short of its recruitment goal of 33,800 this fiscal year, 
officials said.

                           *John Cordwell    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Architect John Cordwell, whose Carl Sandburg  
Village urban renewal project helped revitalize Chicago's near 
North Side during the 1960's, died Thursday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordwell survived a German prisoner of war camp to become one of  
the city's most influential urban planners. He participated in the 
failed Great Escape from a German stalag in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force and was in  
a plane that was downed over German-occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Cordwell moved to Chicago in 1950 and served from  
1952 to 1956 as a director of planning for the Chicago Plan 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	There, Cordwell championed the incorporation of public transit  
into the expressway projects of the 1950s. He insisted that a rapid 
transit line be built down the middle of what is now the Kennedy 
Expressway to connect downtown with O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordwell later formed his own architectural firm and was one of  
the designers of Carl Sandburg Village, a 2,600-unit middle-class 
urban renewal project that opened in 1963.

                           *Gwen Guthrie    	
</P>
<P>
	ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Gwen Guthrie, a singer and songwriter who  
recorded several dance and R&AMP;B hits during the 1980s, died 
Wednesday of uterine cancer. She was 42. 
</P>
<P>
	She got her break in the mid-1970s when she was hired as a  
background vocalist for Aretha Franklin and later worked with 
Roberta Flack and Luther Vandross. She became a popular recording 
session singer, performing on albums by Kenny Loggins and Steely 
Dan, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest solo success came in 1986 with ``Ain't Nothin' Goin'  
on But the Rent.'' Words from that song -- ``no romance without 
finance'' -- became a popular catch-phrase. She was also among the 
first recording artists to raise money for the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthrie's self-titled debut album was released in 1982,  
featuring the song ``Should Have Been You,'' which helped establish 
her as one of the top club music performers of the period.

<P>
                             *Indrani    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Indrani, a dancer and teacher who familiarized  
Americans with India's classical dance styles and helped revive 
them, died Friday of a stroke. She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani, who appeared before heads of state worldwide, made her  
New York debut in 1960. She taught her dancing, noted for its 
combination of refinement and dramatic vibrancy, at American 
colleges and festivals and toured extensively. She had been on the 
Juilliard School faculty since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Indrani became the first dancer presented on a national  
tour by the Asia Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani studied with leading Indian gurus to master the  
differing styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and 
Orissi. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, she became the first professional dancer to  
perform Orissi, inspired by east Indian temple sculptures, onstage. 
She was instrumental in its revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani's role in resuscitating forgotten classical dance forms  
mirrored that of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer 
known for reviving classical dance in India in the 1930s.

                            *John Kolbe    	
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- John Kolbe, a political columnist and reporter  
for two Phoenix newspapers for 26 years, died Monday of colon 
cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe, the dean of Arizona political writers, spent most of his  
career with The Phoenix Gazette, an afternoon newspaper that shut 
down in 1997. He then then joined the Gazette's sister, The Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe's columns generally reflected his strongly held  
conservative beliefs. His brother, Jim Kolbe, is a Republican 
congressman from Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolbe began his journalism career as a reporter and editor for  
newspapers in Rockford, Ill., then joined the gubernatorial 
campaign of Republican Richard B. Ogilvie in 1968. When Ogilvie was 
elected, Kolbe served four years as a speech writer and press aide. 
He was hired by the Phoenix newspapers' owner, in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Mary; a son and daughter; two  
step-children; two brothers and two grandchildren.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Muneyuki Matsushita, president of one of Japan's  
oldest and largest daily newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun, died 
Tuesday. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been hospitalized with influenza that developed into  
pneumonia and also suffered from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Muneyuki Matsushita, whose career at the daily paper spanned  
more than 40 years, joined the newspaper as a reporter in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	He later held positions including chief political news editor,  
editor-in-chief and senior managing director, becoming president of 
the paper in June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1879, the Asahi Shimbun is Japan's second largest  
newspaper with a circulation of over 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsushita is survived by his wife, Yoko, and three children.

                         *Dame Iris Murdoch    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Dame Iris Murdoch, one of Britain's most admired  
modern novelists, died Monday at 79. The cause of death was not 
announced, but she had suffered from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Philosophical speculation, religion, magic and metaphysics run  
through many of her 26 novels. One of her most famous -- ``A Severed 
Head,'' published in 1961 -- was a black farce about infidelity, 
incest and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first book was nonfiction -- ``Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''  
in 1953 -- and she wrote on philosophy throughout her career. 
``Existentialists and Mystics,'' a collection of her essays and 
articles, was published in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's first published novel was ``Under the Net'' in 1954,  
and it won immediate praise. One of her most admired novels was 
1973's ``The Black Prince,'' which won the James Tait Black 
Memorial Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, ``The Sea, The Sea,'' won the Booker Prize, considered  
Britain's highest literary honor. Her last novel, ``Jackson's 
Dilemma,'' was published in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, the equivalent of a knighthood for women.

                           *Marius Schoon    	
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Marius Schoon, a prominent  
apartheid opponent who spent 12 years in prison and lost his wife 
and daughter to a police letter bomb, died Sunday of lung cancer. 
He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the public eye late last year when the ex-police  
agent who arranged the slayings of his family applied for amnesty 
and Schoon attended the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoon was among a handful of white South Africans who sought to  
tear down a system that assured them privileged positions, and who 
paid a heavy price for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoon, a schoolteacher, was jailed from 1964 to 1976 for  
planting a bomb at a police station. No one was hurt in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Williamson admitted arranging the letter bomb that killed  
Jeanette Schoon, 39, and the couple's 6-year-old daughter Katryn in 
1984. The couple were in Angola teaching at the time. Schoon and 
his son Fritz were not home when the letter bomb arrived.

</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Giuseppe Tatarella, a leader of Italy's far right  
National Alliance, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatarella, head of the National Alliance's parliamentary group,  
was pivotal in the party's decision to shed its fascist past in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatarella said in an interview published Monday in Milan's Il  
Giornale that he was never a fascist. He said he joined the old 
fascist party, the Italian Social Movement, because ``it was the 
most anti-Communist party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer, Tatarella was deputy premier in the 1994 government  
headed by center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before he died, Tatarella was hospitalized in Turin for  
a liver transplant, but his heart failed before he could have the 
surgery.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Comet Chaser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the next seven years, the  
mission of the Stardust spacecraft is to chase a comet, for the 
grand goal of collecting less than a thimble's worth of comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	While the size of the catch may seem minute, if successfully  
captured, the tiny sample could provide scientists with fascinating 
information about the origins of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comets can tell us about the history of the early solar system  
and the early history perhaps of our own Earth,'' explained the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory's Martha Hanner, an astronomer taking part in 
the historic Stardust mission. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust spacecraft began its 3 billion-mile journey  
Sunday, soaring into a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta 
rocket. It is the first attempt to gather material from beyond the 
moon and return it to Earth. A fleeting radar problem delayed the 
flight one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most exciting to get this beautiful spacecraft on its  
way,'' said Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, a 
University of Washington astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an  
extraterrestrial pickup and delivery mission. The last time the 
agency went after samples in outer space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the 
last of the manned lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to get to where we're going... but then  
we've got to turn around and come home again,'' said Carl Pilcher, 
NASA's science director for solar system exploration. ``This 
certainly adds a new level of complexity and difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists feel it's worth the extra effort and risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Comets are frozen time capsules; the icy, rocky bodies are  
thought to be pieces of the original building blocks of the solar 
system and may well contain compounds from which life formed. 
Abundant in water and carbon-based molecules, comets continually 
bombarded Earth some 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust is to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004,  
passing within some 90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball. The 
comet is named for its discoverer, retired astronomy professor Paul 
Wild, pronounced Vilt, who traveled from Switzerland to be on hand 
for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny comet fragments -- no bigger than a grain of salt --  
hopefully will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered with 
a transparent, ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most 
vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of a 
large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl of 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going as close as we can without getting killed,'' said  
Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the comet samples -- along with interstellar  
dust gathered en route to the comet -- will reach Earth in January 
2006. The return capsule will separate from Stardust at an altitude 
of 69,000 miles and parachute into the Utah desert; Stardust will 
remain in orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, comet discoverer Wild will be 80 years old. He hopes to  
be around for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it all works very well, of course, that will be gorgeous,''  
Wild said. ``But there are many possibilities of failure or partial 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even less than a thimble full of comet dust would be plenty for  
the kind of detailed analysis that's planned, scientists say. Even 
the fanciest science instruments on a spacecraft cannot begin to 
compare with the electron microscopes in laboratories on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first U.S. mission devoted solely to a comet. NASA  
plans three more over the next four years, two of which will 
attempt landings.

<HEADLINE> BMW Shares Jump on Takeover Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Shares of German automaker BMW AG jumped nearly 9  
percent in Frankfurt on Monday amid speculation that the company 
known for its high-performance sports and luxury cars was 
positioning itself for a possible takeover or merger. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW said it is not holding any merger talks, but analysts  
speculate that a management shake-up, following reports of large 
losses at its Rover division in Britain, is a sign that BMW is 
ready to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW management is leaving a very strong signal, but we have to  
figure out what that signal is,'' said analyst Nicholas J. Colas of 
Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared to be betting on a takeover, sending BMW  
stock up the equivalent of $71 to close at $820.50 Monday in 
Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the European 
market. In the United States, it made significant sales gains last 
year on the strength of some new and redesigned models, including 
the Z3 roadster and coupe made in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's merger of Chrysler Corp. and Germany's Daimler-Benz  
AG forced automakers to reassess the global economic factors 
shaping the industry. Only large, global automakers with greater 
economies of scale are expected to survive in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, Ford announced plans to buy the car business of  
Sweden's Volvo AB to add to its other foreign brands: Jaguar, Aston 
Martin and Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW doesn't want to be left behind in this. They don't want to  
be the person who doesn't have a date to the prom,'' said Lincoln 
Merrihew, an analyst with DRI/McGraw-Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgian newspaper last week quoted the head of General Motors  
Corp.'s European operations, Michael Burns, as expressing a 
possible interest in BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in  
San Francisco, GM officials said Sunday that Burns was misquoted 
and that the No. 1 automaker already had broad global reach and 
didn't need to take on another company. GM's still trying to 
improve sales and profits at its Swedish Saab AB unit, in which it 
bought a 50 percent stake several years ago. It also owns the big 
Adam Opel AG in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeover rumors about BMW were reignited Monday after reports  
that Volkswagen AG Chairman Ferdinand Piech had asked his company's 
technicians to test which Rover models could be built on available 
VW platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW said it was not interested in a merger.  
</P>
<P>
	``Management is not holding any takeover talks,'' said spokesman  
Juerg Dinner. ``We want to remain independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner said independence also is favored by the Quandt family,  
BMW's major shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger speculation also was fueled by Friday's ouster of BMW  
Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder and the subsequent resignation of 
management board member Wolfgang Reitzle, who had been passed over 
to replace Pischetsrieder. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, Robert J. Eaton, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler  
AG, said at the car dealers' convention in San Francisco that he 
expected three bidders for BMW to emerge this week. He said 
DaimlerChrysler would not be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pischetsrieder, an engineer who held the top job since 1993, was  
replaced by BMW's former head of engineering and production, 
Joachim Milberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reorganization at BMW is to make it more  
attractive to potential merger partners,'' Merrihew said. ``Rover 
may have left a sour taste in their mouth in terms of them buying a 
smaller company. They may be looking to merge, or technically to be 
bought themselves. They're sure looking for partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since its 1994  
Rover takeover, which was orchestrated by Pischetsrieder. Analysts 
expect Rover to post a pretax loss of about $590 million for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinner denied reports the company would alter its strategy at  
Rover. ``There will be no change of direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrihew suggested VW, Honda or Toyota would be good fits with  
BMW. Honda spokesman Andy Boyd said the Japanese automaker was 
determined to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no interest in a tie-up with BMW,'' Boyd said.

<HEADLINE> Kids Learn in English, Spanish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sprawled on a brightly colored rug, the  
English immersion students are reading about a bird with a broken 
wing, with their pint-size forefingers slowly tracing words that 
four months ago were a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, teacher Eva Rodriguez-Chavez moves to a big writing pad  
propped on an easel for a quick review. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the animals helped bird get to his --'' she says, writing  
out the words in avocado-green felt-tip. 
</P>
<P>
	``N-E-S-T!'' the children spell triumphantly.  
</P>
<P>
	Three hundred and fifty miles away in San Jose, another  
first-grade reading lesson is being taught, this time in a class 
where parents have authorized bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Anais marches to the front of the class, flips open  
a book about a boy who tries to get out of taking a bath. She reads 
it straight through. 
</P>
<P>
	``Una vez invento algo increible (once he came up with something  
incredible),'' she reads fluently, holding up a picture of the 
reluctant bather to the giggles of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	No question, students in both classes are learning.  
</P>
<P>
	But the question still under debate: Who's learning better?  
</P>
<P>
	Bilingual education supporters argue that children like Anais,  
who start in their own language, get the concept of learning faster 
and do better in all subjects when they switch over to English. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say too many of these children never do make the  
switch. They say children will only succeed by learning English 
first -- and fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have to lose a few months of academic progress, it's  
better in kindergarten or the first grade than in the fifth 
grade,'' says Ron Unz, a Silicon Valley millionaire who led the 
campaign against bilingual education in California. 
</P>
<P>
	That campaign -- in the form of Proposition 227, a ballot measure  
requiring that all students be taught in English -- dealt bilingual 
education a blow. But it's not dead yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools broadly interpreted the instruction that classes be  
``nearly all'' in English. And parents got an unexpectedly big say 
in the matter through a loophole allowing them to ask for 
reinstatement of bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
	All the parents of children in Ms. Sandra Villarreal's class  
made such requests, endorsing a program that aims to produce 
children who can read and write in Spanish and English by fifth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the parents in Ms. Rodriguez-Chavez' class  
plumped for immersion, meaning she squeezes in a little one-on-one 
Spanish instruction for that one student but teaches the rest in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Ms. Rodriguez-Chavez expected the switch would mean a  
year of hammering away at the basics -- ``This is a book. That is a 
table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she's been able to teach reading, math and some  
science. 
</P>
<P>
	There are anecdotal reports of similar progress in other  
immersion classes -- ``The initiative... is working out much better 
than opponents predicted,'' says Unz. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Rodriguez-Chavez credits her successes to the fact that  
``in every classroom there's a group who will excel no matter 
what.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's worried about the others.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that this is not the best way to be teaching, but it's  
the law,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Eyes gleaming with mischief, the children in Ms. Villarreal's  
class huff and puff with gusto as they follow the adventures of the 
Three Little Pigs in English. 
</P>
<P>
	They seem to grasp the story well, but answer review questions --  
asked in English -- mostly in Spanish, possibly because they usually 
have a different English teacher and are used to speaking to Ms. 
Villarreal in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they are not yet learning to read or write in their  
second language, some show a fair command of spoken English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't do it! Don't do it!'' yells Uvaldo as the wolf is  
waiting to exhale outside the house of straw. 
</P>
<P>
	In both classes, students generally speak to each other in  
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is the occasional outburst of English, such as the  
heated debate in Ms. Rodriguez-Chavez' class between science 
partners Jasson and Kenny over whether a lion is a mammal. 
</P>
<P>
	Reptile, said Kenny, claiming expert knowledge from a visit to  
the circus where ``those lions didn't give milk to their young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That drew a scornful look from Jasson, who tapped his stocky  
chest and declared, ``They was MANS -- that's why!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At day's end, children in both classes stream out to waiting  
parents, most of whom speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those waiting outside Ms. Rodriguez-Chavez' class was  
Maria Elena Lugo, there to pick up daughter Evelyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lugo said her daughter was in English immersion at the  
prompting of her husband. ``He said it's better to learn in 
English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What does she think of the class so far?  
</P>
<P>
	``Esta muy bien (it's very good),'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Worker Fired for Going on Jury Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An executive assistant at a Fortune 500 computer  
company was fired when she left work to serve jury duty, angering a 
judge who had her boss arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Sutton said she was looking forward to her first time  
on a jury, and reminded her boss, senior vice president of finance 
Warren Edwards, several times. Still, he gave her a late-breaking 
project the night before, and though she came in early to finish 
work he demanded she stay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was going to be late and would get into trouble.  
I was in tears and told Mr. Edwards that I needed to go to jury 
duty,'' Ms. Sutton, 29, told The Dallas Morning News today. ``He 
said for me to pack up my stuff, consider this my last day, that I 
was fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Affiliated Computer Services acknowledged the  
firing on Dec. 15 but said it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge John M. Marshall was so angry when he heard Ms.  
Sutton's story, he issued an arrest warrant for Edwards. County 
deputies went to his office, took him into custody and brought him 
before the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear to him that this was not one of his smarter  
management decisions,'' Marshall said. ``I seriously thought about 
citing him for contempt of court on the spot. He would not have had 
a happy time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was not charged. He did not return telephone calls for  
an interview with the News. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation that just got out of hand,'' said Lora  
Villarreal, a senior vice president at ACS, which specializes in 
operating computers for other corporations. ``She became nervous 
and panicked. In the heat of the moment, he was frustrated and 
fired her. It was a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sutton sued her former company, and wants her job back or  
six months pay. She refused the company's offer of another job. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas law prohibits companies from firing employees for jury  
service, but judges say the statute is weak. The most a company 
would be out is six months pay to the fired juror. 
</P>
<P>
	In most states, firing a worker for jury service is a criminal  
offense.

<HEADLINE> American Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Hundreds of American Airlines passengers were  
forced to make other travel plans after the airline canceled more 
than 200 flights amid a continuing dispute with its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 flights were canceled today, increasing the total to  
more than 300 since Friday as pilots continued an apparent work 
slowdown believed to be in reaction to sluggish negotiations on a 
work agreement over a recently acquired carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to the union and company officials were not  
returned today, but answering services referred to separate 
information hot lines with recorded statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``American does expect to start the day Monday with a number of  
flight cancellations,'' airline spokesman Tim Smith said in one 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline canceled about 10 percent of its scheduled flights  
Sunday after a high number of unexpected pilot absences, he said. 
The cancellation of about 240 of its 2,250 flights on Sunday 
followed the loss of 90 flights on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``American continues to be very disappointed in this situation  
and sincerely regrets the inconvenience that it causes for our 
customers,'' Smith said. ``We have been making efforts to 
reaccommodate passengers who have been affected by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American was booking passengers on additional flights or other  
carriers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots contend that AMR Corp., parent of American, has  
disregarded the contract since purchasing Reno Air six weeks ago 
for $124 million. American must pay lower-paid Reno pilots at 
American Airlines' rates, the pilots say. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Allied Pilots Association did not call for the  
action at American, union president Rich LaVoy said the labor group 
was frustrated by a lack of progress on the issue and was eager to 
resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the possibility of other acquisitions looming on the  
horizon, APA simply cannot afford to agree to something that will 
come back to haunt all of us if AMR buys other airlines larger and 
more senior than Reno Air,'' LaVoy said in a separate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although federal law bars a strike over such an issue, pilots  
can refuse to volunteer for overtime, which can cause flight delays 
and cancellations.

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Movie Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's antitrust division  
has begun a preliminary inquiry into some practices in the 
distribution of movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking into certain possibly anti-competitive  
practices in the distribution of motion pictures,'' said Justice 
spokeswoman Jennifer Rose. She declined to name any companies whose 
practices are under review. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe, at a very preliminary stage, focuses on possible  
violations of a 1948 consent decree, known as the Paramount decree, 
that forced movie studios to sell their movie theaters and put 
other restrictions on their relationships, according to a source, 
who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on cross-ownership was lifted during the Reagan  
administration but other restrictions still apply, including a ban 
on so-called block booking, a practice in which studios force 
theater chains to take a second movie, often less popular, in order 
to get the rights to show a very popular film. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that the department on  
Thursday delivered civil investigative demands -- the civil 
equivalent of a criminal subpoena -- to the major film distributors 
in Hollywood, including Walt Disney Co.; Viacom Inc.'s Paramount 
Pictures; Sony Corp.; News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox; Seagram Co.'s 
Universal Studios Inc.; Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.; and 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's largest theater chains, Regal Cinemas Inc.  
and Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp., also acknowledged that they 
had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Journal 
reported. But other large theater chains, such as AMC Entertainment 
Inc. and privately held United Artists, said they hadn't been 
contacted.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Tony Martin Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Eight days after playing in the Super Bowl, Atlanta  
Falcons receiver Tony Martin was charged in federal court Monday 
with money laundering and conspiracy stemming from his longtime 
friendship with a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, the Falcons' leading receiver, was brought to court in  
manacles and released on $250,000 bond. He will be arraigned Feb. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from his relationship with Rickey Brownlee, a  
convicted drug dealer known as ``the mayor of Opa-locka.'' The two 
met some 15 years ago while Martin, now 33, was a student at Miami 
Northwestern High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's lead attorney, Roy Black, released a statement saying  
the receiver ``vigorously denies the allegation. Tony never 
intended to commit any crime. He will aggressively litigate this 
case in federal court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnnie Cochran, who represented O.J. Simpson at his murder  
trial, will serve on Martin's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had been under investigation for months. But his name  
just appeared Monday on the third superseding indictment in the 
case, which also involves cocaine and heroin trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is not accused of involvement in Brownlee's drug  
business. Prosecutors said he wrote checks to lease luxury cars and 
pay legal fees for his friend because Brownlee's lawyers wouldn't 
take cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons coach Dan Reeves had no comment on the case, according  
to team spokesman Charlie Taylor. Martin caught five passes in the 
Falcons' 34-19 loss to Denver in the NFL title game on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working with the NFL and the Martins to see what's going  
to come of it,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league was aware of the case  
but had no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee, who spent seven years in prison for 1980s drug  
convictions, was charged a year ago with seven counts of heroin and 
cocaine trafficking. He allegedly gave cash to Martin for deposits 
on the cars and the attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest, Brownlee was driving a Mercedes that  
was leased in Martin's name, the U.S. attorney's office has said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his financial records were subpoenaed, Martin stopped  
payment on a $175,000 check to Brownlee's attorneys and showed a 
copy of the subpoena to Brownlee's associates, according to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Martin was being punished for maintaining ties to the  
people he grew up with in Liberty City, an inner-city neighborhood 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite attaining financial success, Tony has never forgotten  
his roots,'' Black said in his statement. ``He has remained loyal 
and loving to his family and friends, who provided emotional 
support and encouragement as he confronted many obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``When neighborhood friend Rickey Brownlee was arrested last  
year on federal charges, Tony Martin did not turn a blind eye to 
him. Rather, Tony agreed to help pay attorney's fees for Brownlee's 
defense. That financial transaction is the mainstay of the 
government's money laundering allegation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said his client ``never imagined that the providing  
financial assistance to a neighborhood friend could be construed as 
a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a Jan. 6 interview, Martin insisted he was no longer a target  
of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just speculation,'' he said at the time. ``It wasn't  
even true. Really, it was just garbage. I knew in my mind that I 
didn't have anything to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin also returned thousands in cash in an effort to conceal  
the scheme, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious charge,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron  
DeWaard said in asking for a $1 million bond. ``Given Mr. Martin 
makes almost $2 million a year, there needs to be a bond with some 
bite in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black argued against the high bond by pointing out the receiver  
is a public figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see any circumstance in which he would not respond to  
the indictment and would forfeit his income,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who surrendered voluntarily Monday morning, sat in the  
jury box with other prisoners. His father, Harold, also was present 
and both signed the bond. 
</P>
<P>
	After his appearance, Martin was fingerprinted and photographed.  
U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Garber ordered him to check in with 
pretrial services once a week by phone and inform that office 
before traveling. He must remain in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, acquired by the Falcons from San Diego in a trade last  
June, led Atlanta with 66 catches for 1,181 yards and six 
touchdowns this season. He added nine receptions for 192 yards in 
the playoffs as the Falcons reached their first Super Bowl. Martin 
teamed with Terance Mathis to give the Falcons the NFL's 
second-most productive pair of receivers in terms of yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his NFL career with the Miami Dolphins but came to  
prominence in San Diego, where he averaged 72 catches and 1,046 
yards in four seasons with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is the second Falcons player to face legal trouble in  
Miami in recent weeks. Pro Bowl safety Eugene Robinson was arrested 
the night before the Super Bowl on charges of soliciting oral sex 
from an undercover police officer.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose today for the first time in six  
trading days and the dollar gained against the yen as investors 
were relieved by a fall in bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 94.41 points,  
or 0.68 percent, to close at 13,992.49, after losing more than 100 
points earlier in the day. On Friday, the average fell 188.77 
points, or 1.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.50 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 1.44  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 113.20 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 112.72 yen 
to 113.66 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the rebound in the stock market to the drop  
in long-term bond yields, which also triggered the selling of the 
yen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of relief spread in the market following the fall in  
interest rates and the weaker yen,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general 
manager at Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has slipped  
back to 2.160 percent from Friday's finish of 2.365 percent, 
driving up its price to 97.19 yen from 95.67 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields fell after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa urged  
Japan's central bank to consider taking steps to curb rising 
long-term yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa said Friday the Bank of Japan should consider  
conducting twist operations, in which sales of short-term 
securities are offset by purchases of long-term bonds. The 
operation would help bring down long-term bond yields by reducing 
the supply of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, a BOJ policy board member indicated he was  
against further monetary easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent rises in bond yields have weighed on share prices,  
because higher capital costs are expected to hurt corporate 
earnings, put a damper on housing mortgages, and threaten to stall 
an economic recovery further. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's long-term interest rates began rising in December, when  
the government announced plans to issue a large volume of bonds in 
the next fiscal year starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,090.63. The 
TOPIX closed down 6.13 points, or 0.56 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 261.19 million  
shares, down from Friday's 365.63 million. Advances outnumbered 
declines 527 to 516, with 226 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The fall in bond yields helped to pushed down the yen against  
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Contradictory comments by Japanese officials on whether the Bank  
of Japan should expand its purchases of government bonds has made 
many currency traders reluctant to move in either direction, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currency trading, the euro traded at 127.66 yen,  
up from 126.88 yen late Friday in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> ACC Chief Urges Auburn Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The commissioner of the Atlantic Coast  
Conference wants his nine schools to boycott Auburn in every sport 
as punishment for canceling a Sept. 2 football game against Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Auburn athletic director David Housel, ACC  
commissioner John Swofford called it ``absolutely reprehensible 
that a university the stature of Auburn would ever consider 
canceling a contracted football game that has been scheduled for 
national television less than seven months prior to kickoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles are scrambling to find a new opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the way Auburn University is going to conduct its  
business, I feel it is my obligation as conference commissioner to 
ask all of our member institutions to seriously evaluate whether it 
makes sense to schedule Auburn in any sport,'' Swofford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel obtained a copy of Swofford's letter.  
</P>
<P>
	At least one school, Clemson, has future football games  
scheduled with Auburn, a member of the Southeastern Conference. The 
schools hold contracts for four games from 2005 through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson spokesman Tim Bourret said Monday he did not know  
whether the Auburn-Clemson games were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	FSU is scheduled to return a basketball game to Auburn next  
year, and Seminoles coach Steve Robinson indicated last week he 
planned to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford, who express-mailed the letter to Housel before Auburn  
made a final decision on canceling the game, said the ACC will 
demand an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league will lose if 
the Seminoles are unable to find an opponent suitable for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just cannot conduct business this way,'' Swofford wrote.  
``It damages the entire enterprise of intercollegiate athletics. It 
is simply wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said they had received the letter before making a  
decision but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Monday, FSU athletic director Dave Hart made the first  
of a series of phone calls to conferences and schools across the 
country, searching for an opponent. Pickings are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from eight major conferences -- SEC, Big Ten, Big 12,  
Pac-10, Big East, Mid-American, WAC and Conference USA -- said all 
their teams' schedules were completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult,'' said Hart, adding that FSU's Thursday  
night slot on ESPN was all but dead. ``Because of the calendar ... 
it goes without saying we're very short on time. We're up against 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Pete Sampras Returns to Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Will Pete Sampras be rusty or refreshed  
after a 10-week layoff, his longest absence from tennis since he 
was a high school junior? He'll find out soon. 
</P>
<P>
	After going more than two months without playing in a single  
tournament, Sampras returns to the game he dominates in this week's 
Sybase Open. The top-seeded Sampras faces 84th-ranked Galo Blanco 
of Spain on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt like I needed this break to start the year  
off mentally, physically as fresh as possible,'' Sampras said. ``So 
I am definitely chomping at the bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhausted after playing a grueling series of tournaments in late  
1998 to protect his No. 1 ranking, Sampras passed up the Australian 
Open in January -- the first Grand Slam tournament he has skipped 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He is just one short of tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand  
Slam tournament men's singles titles, and Sampras has said in 
recent years his main motivation is to win more Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also focused on finishing last year as the No. 1 player  
in the world, giving him a record six straight years at the top. In 
order to protect that ranking, he had to play seven straight weeks 
in October and November -- a process that left him weary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have gone down to Australia. I just wish  
it started in February,'' he said. ``I wanted to give myself a good 
offseason this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was gone, Sampras certainly was not forgotten at the  
Australian Open. When Yevgeny Kafelnikov won the title, he 
immediately pointed out that his job was made much easier by the 
absence of the world's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete, it's really a great, wonderful feeling,'' Kafelnikov  
said after raising the silver trophy. ``Thanks for letting me do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is beginning his 258th week at No. 1, a dozen short of  
the record held by Ivan Lendl. Opponents wonder whether he'll be as 
sharp as usual at the start of the $350,000 Sybase tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's definitely a shot that he'll be rusty,'' said  
sixth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill, who would face Sampras in the 
semifinals. ``Pete definitely plays better when he has a few events 
under his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill has been on the tennis circuit for only two years, and  
he understands the exhaustion that forced Sampras to the sidelines 
for the past 10 weeks. And he thinks Sampras' relentless pursuit of 
the year-end No. 1 ranking was worth the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's his most impressive accomplishment,'' Gambill  
said. ``He's been head and shoulders above everyone else for six 
straight years, and that's really impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a two-time Sybase champion, has a relatively easy draw  
into the semifinals of the tournament. But once there, he may have 
to face Gambill or third-seeded Mark Philippoussis, a U.S. Open 
finalist last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, coming off an uninspired fourth-round loss at the  
Australian Open, is the defending champion of the Sybase Open and 
the No. 2 seed this year. He faces a first-round match against Todd 
Woodbridge tonight and could face fourth-seeded Michael Chang in 
the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Wellesley Chef Brings Flare to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- When Chef Ming Tsai was preparing to  
open his restaurant last year, he wanted to make sure spirits from 
the funeral home across the street didn't interfere with business. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the restaurant free of bad karma, Tsai consulted a  
master of Feng Shui, the Chinese discipline that governs one's 
harmony with the surroundings. The master told him to ward off the 
spirits by displaying a mystical lion with a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the advice and, so far, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	Not only are customers streaming through the door of Blue  
Ginger, but he has a television show, ``East Meets West With Ming 
Tsai,'' his first cookbook is in the works, and a knife bearing his 
name is on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	A network producer discovered Tsai's culinary agility at a New  
Mexico restaurant where the chef was working. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said I had the presence that looked good on camera,'' Tsai  
recalled. Tsai's natural talents were enhanced by a coach who gave 
him some tips for cooking on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese-American chef now films 20 shows in two weeks at the  
Food Network's New York studios, hustling back to his restaurant on 
weekends. He plans to tape about 80 shows annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food Network airs his show weekdays at 3 p.m., 8 p.m. and  
11:30 p.m., on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., and Sundays at 
5:30 p.m. All times are EST. Eight back-to-back episodes, dubbed 
``Ming-A-Thon,'' will air next Monday (Feb. 15) from 8 to 11:30 
p.m. in celebration of the Chinese New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the show's Web site can be accessed at  
www.foodtv.com. The site features a show schedule, recipes and 
places to buy unusual ingredients used in some of Tsai's dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant, which opened last February, is located in an  
upscale suburb 14 miles west of Boston. Tsai and his wife, Polly, 
chose the Boston area after considering places where Tsai had 
mastered his craft, including Atlanta, Chicago, London and Paris. 
The abundance of ingredients available in Boston's Chinatown 
convinced Tsai to choose Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in an open kitchen adjacent to the dining room, the  
34-year-old chef prepares dishes including his own recipes, among 
them aromatic braised lamb, Indonesian curry pasta with crispy 
coconut shrimp and Asian vegetables, and sake-miso marinated 
Chilean bass served with vegetarian soba noodle sushi. 
</P>
<P>
	The style of cuisine, known as East-West fusion, is a hit. The  
restaurant takes reservations four weeks in advance for Friday and 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple named the eatery Blue Ginger because blue is Tsai's  
favorite color. It also connotes water and the flow of water, an 
important part of Feng Shui's theory of the flow of energy. Blue 
ginger is also a medicinal stem found in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimalist design features black and white Italian granite  
floors, cherry wood furniture, and a sculptured water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teenager in Dayton, Ohio, Tsai nurtured his interest in  
cooking at his parent's Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at  
Yale University in 1986. But cookery won out, and he journeyed to 
the Cordon Bleu in Paris where he honed his skills, working as a 
chef in Parisian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsai said he hopes his TV show inspires viewers to master Asian  
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	```One of the goals is to demystify Asian ingredients and  
techniques,'' he said. ``A lot of people, when they hear Chinese or 
Thai or Japanese, they think, 'Oh that's too much chopping or too 
much prep work or the ingredients are too funky. We can't get those 
ingredients.' I think the exact opposite is true.''' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`MELROSE PLACE': All heck breaks loose tonight -- or suds up, at  
least -- in the episode ``The Younger Son Also Rises.'' Kyle (Rob 
Estes) and Ryan (John Haymes Newton) are surprised when their 
father, Mack McBride (guest star John Reilly), pays an unexpected 
visit that results in a family feud. Meanwhile, Jane (Josie 
Bissett) discovers that Michael (Thomas Calabro) is being sued for 
sexual harassment and confronts his accuser, Nurse Audrey (guest 
star Stephanie Cameron). Can you wait? ``Melrose'' airs at 8 p.m. 
EST on Fox.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Technology Advancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A flurry of industry alliances is expected to  
hasten the day when consumers can use their mobile phones and 
portable computers to check their e-mail, navigate the Internet and 
access data from their desktop PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola Corp., the big mobile-phone maker, and Cisco Systems  
Inc., the dominant maker of computer-networking equipment, said 
Monday they will create a set of common technical standards to 
enable equipment used by different wireless systems to easily work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The standards, due out in May, should make it easier for  
operators of wireless networks to offer services such as e-mail and 
voice mail without worries about compatibility. The companies said 
they will spend a total of $1 billion over five years in the 
effort, which should result in new products in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the first day of the wireless industry's annual trade  
show in New Orleans also featured the announcements of a wireless 
alliance between Microsoft Corp. and British Telecommunications, 
and a separate Motorola collaboration with mobile service provider 
Nextel Communications and Web software makers Netscape 
Communications and Unwired Planet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen so many companies talking to so many other  
companies,'' said Andrew Seybold, an industry expert who publishes 
a Boulder Creek, Calif., newsletter on mobile computing. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased availability of go-anywhere Web access through  
``smart phones,'' laptops and handheld computers could help boost 
Internet usage from about a fifth of the U.S. population to more 
than a third by 2002, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2.5 million American households are expected to have  
Internet-ready phones by that time, estimates Jupiter 
Communications LLC, a New York-based research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Some manufacturers already sell phones that let people exchange  
e-mail and offer limited online access. 
</P>
<P>
	But they don't always work well, especially for people traveling  
long distances, and they can be expensive. Nokia's 9000 series 
mobile phone, which features a big screen that flips up, sells for 
$700 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	However, competition is pushing down prices.  
</P>
<P>
	Innovative Global Solution Inc., for example, unveiled a smart  
phone expected to cost less than $300. The NeoPoint 1000 lets 
people hook into the Internet, use a modem, send faxes and exchange 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday, Microsoft and British Telecom agreed to develop  
and market wireless Internet and corporate data services for mobile 
phone users outside North America. Trials will begin in Britain 
this spring and services should become more widely available by 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which is supplying operating software for the  
service, hopes to head off competition from Symbian, a rival 
wireless group that includes Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson. Symbian 
uses an operating system from Psion PLC of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	For British Telecom, the use of Internet technology to become a  
full-service provider of data and video services is a key part of 
its $10 billion planned alliance with AT&AMP;T Corp.

<HEADLINE> Browns Study Available Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) ---- Dwight Clark and the Browns are finally  
feeling better about the NFL's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, the 150 players whom Cleveland can choose in  
Tuesday's draft didn't look very appealing to Clark, the club's 
director of football operations, who knew little or nothing about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But after spending endless hours breaking down game films,  
making phone calls, and dissecting the list of the league's most 
unwanted, Clark is convinced he can find Cleveland some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I initially looked at the list, it didn't blow me away,''  
Clark said. ``But some of the players I had not been that familiar 
with. Ultimately, you start digging in and finding more information 
about them. That's when you start getting excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excited? About the expansion draft?  
</P>
<P>
	It may be hard for the rest of the league to believe, but  
Cleveland is pumped. After a three-year hiatus, the NFL is back in 
football-mad northern Ohio. And to trumpet the Browns' rebirth, the 
league decided to hold the expansion draft in the birthplace of pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	All 4,000 tickets made available for the event at the Canton  
Civic Center were quickly scooped up by Browns fans, who haven't 
had a chance to get together and cheer for their beloved team in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dawg Pound will be out in full force, woofing for each of  
the Browns' selections during the 2 1/2-hour draft to be carried live 
by ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	So what players have the Browns most excited? Those with small  
contracts and big potential. Cleveland inherits a player's 
contract, so dollar figures are as important as rushing average and 
sack totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for guys with an up side,'' said coach Chris  
Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some big-name players available -- Denver's Darrien  
Gordon and Neil Smith, Green Bay's Robert Brooks and Reggie White, 
the Jets' Glenn Foley, Oakland's Desmond Howard, and Washington's 
Gus Frerotte -- but all come with some kind of baggage. They're 
either overpaid, underachieving, injured, or in White's case, 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at some of the names, and from that side of the table  
you say, 'that guys a no-brainer, they have to take him,''' said 
Clark. ``But when you look a little closer you start to understand 
why a guy might be on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer and Clark have prepared for the big day by holding mock  
drafts. They've trimmed the list of 150 -- five from each team -- to 
about 45-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went into the equation,'' Clark said. ``First, we  
looked at talent level of the player. Then we looked at financial 
implications, their character, their age and how they were 
medically. All that went into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who will build their team primarily through free  
agency and April's college draft, are expected to load up on 
offensive lineman. There are several good ones available, including 
Detroit center-guard Jim Pyne, New England guard Todd Rucci, 
Chicago tackle Andy Heck, Miami tackle Jeff Buckey, Baltimore guard 
Ben Cavil and Minnesota tackle Scott Rehberg. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the list of players, the NFL gave the Browns a  
list of rules. Among the most important are: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland will have three minutes to make a selection, and can  
take 30 to 42 players. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Browns must use 38 percent of their salary cap (expected  
to be $57.5 million) on players they pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- After the Browns select a player, that player's team will have  
two minutes to decide if it wants to pull back one of the four 
remaining players it has left unprotected. However, teams can 
choose to leave all of its players available. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Browns can trade a player they select, but not back to  
that player's previous team. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are similar to the ones Jacksonville and Carolina had  
to follow in the '95 expansion draft. Still, Browns president 
Carmen Policy thinks the NFL's guidelines may be constricting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have an expansion draft with slightly different  
rules,'' he said. ``The draft does give us the opportunity to get 
veteran players who otherwise would be unattainable. But I think 
you pay a penalty in terms of the numbers of players we're required 
to take and-or the amount of cap space we must make available.''

<HEADLINE> NBA TV Ratings Surprisingly High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Not even the loss of Michael Jordan nor a  
three-month delay in starting the season could keep fans away from 
their televisions on the NBA's opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's Sunday afternoon doubleheader averaged a 5.8 overnight  
rating -- up 2 percent from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The network's opener last season, a doubleheader on Christmas  
Day, posted a 5.7 overnight rating. Each ratings point represents 
994,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good start, but everybody here and in the NBA knows  
that it's just that -- a start,'' said NBC spokesman Ed Markey. ``We 
know we still have a lot of work to do to regain the fans and keep 
the interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's first game, which came after the nasty 6 1/2-month lockout,  
was a regional telecast in which 41 of the 44 overnight markets saw 
the Miami-New York game. It posted a 4.6 rating while the 
Indiana-Detroit game recorded a 9.5 mark. The reason why the Pacers 
game was so high is primarily because it was only watched in the 
two host cities and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating for the second game of Sunday's telecast that matched  
Shaquille O'Neal's Lakers against Karl Malone's Jazz was a 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were probably a lot of factors that contributed to our  
strong ratings,'' Markey added. ``Fans were itching to see the NBA, 
they had a curiosity to see different players on new teams, and 
there are more teams whose fans feel they have a legitimate shot at 
a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Sports had similar success with its two games Friday  
night on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	The first game, New York at Orlando, posted a 2.5 rating while  
the Rockets-Lakers matchup received a 3.1 for an overall mark of 
2.8. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a 65 percent jump from Turner's average last season.  
</P>
<P>
	``People were predicting some dire results for NBA ratings,''  
said Kevin O'Malley, Turner's senior vice president of programming. 
``It's hard to predict going forward, but this is definitely a 
great start for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net affiliates also had their share of success. The  
Pacers opener jumped from a 2.6 rating last season to a 5.5 this 
year, the Lakers opener was up 38 percent and the Spurs debut was 
up 19 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gibson's `Payback' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Action-deprived men stormed movie theaters  
for Mel Gibson's revenge flick ``Payback,'' dumping ``She's All 
That'' to No. 2 and destroying the debut of another teen love 
story, ``Simply Irresistible,'' final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playback,'' with Gibson as a crook settling scores after his  
double-crossing wife shoots him, had the best opening of the year 
with $21.2 million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	With the end of TV football fever, Gibson's mostly male, older  
fans returned to theaters in droves. The demographics mirrored 
those for the ``Lethal Weapon'' series. Indeed, Paramount held back 
``Payback'' over the summer so it wouldn't clash with ``Lethal 
Weapon 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's All That'' collected $11.7 million for second place  
while ``Patch Adams'' cruised along with $4.4 million for third. 
``Varsity Blues,'' sharing ``She's All That'' youth audience, 
grossed $3.8 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	However, another movie seeking teen approval flopped.  
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' with TV's Sarah Michelle Gellar,  
debuted with a disappointing $2.23 million for ninth place, stung 
by bad reviews and fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' which DreamWorks re-released to cash in  
on its Golden Globe wins and the buzz surrounding Tuesday's 
announcement of Oscar nominations, was at No. 5 with $3.6 million. 
Another film with Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' was 
sixth with $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky coming-of-age story ``Rushmore,'' with Bill Murray,  
did strong older-audience business in limited release, grossing 
$1.8 million on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of 
just under $18,000.

</P>
<P>
	1. ``Payback,'' Paramount, $21.2 million, 2,720 locations,

<HEADLINE>  Cecil Fielder Rejoins Blue Jays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Cecil Fielder is starting over again with the  
Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, who began his major league career with Toronto in 1985,  
signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays on Monday and was 
invited to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old designated hitter-first baseman will earn  
$500,000 if he makes the team, along with an additional $1.5 
million available in performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very fortunate to get this opportunity to come back to  
Toronto and play,'' Fielder said from Florida during a conference 
call. ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to make the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (signing minor league deal) doesn't bother me. That's  
just the situation that is at hand. If I was that concerned with 
the contract, I wouldn't be going to camp,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder split last season between the Anaheim Angels and  
Cleveland Indians, hitting a combined .233 with 17 homers and 68 
RBIs in 117 games. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year major league veteran, he has a .255 career average  
with 319 homers and 1,008 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder left Toronto in 1989 to sign with Japan's Hanshin  
Tigers. He returned to the majors a year later, spending seven 
years with Detroit (1990-96) and hitting 51 home runs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder was traded to the New York Yankees in the summer of 1996  
and made $7.2 million with them in 1997. He signed a free-agent 
contract with Anaheim in 1998 for $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder, 35, rejoins a team in dire need of a productive DH to  
replace Jose Canseco, who hit a career-high 46 home runs with 107 
RBIs. He signed as a free agent with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put this into perspective,'' Blue Jays general manager  
Gord Ash said. ``This is a minor league contract with no guaranteed 
money, so it's a free look in essence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil has a ratio which translates into 100 RBIs over 600  
at-bats. There are not many players that have that kind of ratio. 
This is an opportunity. There's no commitment and we'll just see 
what develops,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fielder's weight has always been an issue throughout his major  
league career. But the 6-foot-3, 261-pound Fielder says production 
-- not what he tips the scales at -- will dictate whether he sticks 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter if I'm light or heavy, if I don't hit the ball,  
that's all that matters,'' he said., ``If the way you looked made 
baseball players, there would be a whole bunch of guys still 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays also re-adjusted their ticket prices Monday after  
reducing seating capacity at SkyDome for baseball games. The club 
will provide about 45,000 seats, about 6,000 less than capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	While the club cut the cost of some seats, the overall average  
ticket price increased 14.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Knievel OK After Liver Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Evel Knievel has survived another brush with  
death, leaving the hospital 10 days after a successful liver 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old daredevil quietly left Tampa General Hospital on  
Saturday for his home in nearby Clearwater. He hopes to talk with 
reporters this week, spokeswoman Stacey Packer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring complications, he should be able to do about anything he  
used to in about five weeks, said Dr. Hector Ramos, one of his 
transplant surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	Knievel needed a liver transplant because of hepatitis C. The  
chances of reinfection are high, but the disease isn't likely to 
destroy the organ this time, Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Dead Woman Didn't Have Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, Neb. (AP) -- An elderly man who fatally shot his  
74-year-old wife to save her from cancer doctors had diagnosed as 
terminal was told in court today that autopsy results found no 
trace of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernal ``Bob'' Ohlrich, 76, grew upset and visibly frustrated as  
the county attorney discussed the autopsy findings. He said that 
doctors him that the cancer had spread from his wife's colon to 
lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told by doctors that she should call her children home  
because she's not going to make it overnight,'' said Ohlrich, who 
cried during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich pleaded no contest to manslaughter today under a plea  
agreement in which charges of first-degree murder and use of a 
weapon to commit a felony were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich still could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in  
prison but that did not seem likely. Thayer County Attorney Daniel 
Warner said he would seek some prison time but did not know how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said he agreed to the plea deal also because it  
would be pointless to give the elderly man a lengthy prison 
sentence and because justice was served. 
</P>
<P>
	A sentencing date was not immediately set.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not dispute that Phyllis Ohlrich was in a lot of  
pain, or testimony from Ohlrich and neighbors that she said she 
wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ohlrich had an operation for colon cancer in May 1998 and  
underwent chemotherapy that was discontinued that summer. Warner 
said she injured her back and entered the hospital on Sept. 21, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich was accused of walking into the hospital room early Oct.  
27 and shooting his wife and mother of their four children in the 
head. He walked to the nurses station, laid a pistol on the counter 
and told the nurse to go see his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohlrich admitted to the shooting and asked to be locked up. His  
attorney, Joe Murray of Hebron, had said the shooting was an act of 
love rather than of malice.

<HEADLINE> Blues' Fuhr Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues goalie Grant Fuhr will be  
sidelined 4-to-6 weeks after a second operation on his right knee 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The arthroscopic surgery Monday repaired cartilage damage. Since  
Jan. 1, when Fuhr was pulled after allowing four goals on 11 shots 
at Nashville, he is 1-4 with a 3.28 goals against average and an 
.832 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	For the season, Fuhr is 7-7-5, with a 2.69 goals against and an  
.876 save percentage, 53rd among 54 goalies who have played at 
least 10 games. Only Felix Potvin of the New York Islanders is 
worse at .863 in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr's start on Saturday, in which he gave up three third-period  
goals in a 4-3 loss to Anaheim, was his first in six games. Rookie 
Rich Parent started the previous five games -- his first five career 
starts -- as the Blues benched both Fuhr and backup Jamie McLennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr, who won five Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers in the  
1980s and 1990, announced recently that he will retire after next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether the knee is part of it, or not, Grant's play has not  
been as good this year as last year,'' coach Joel Quenneville said 
Sunday. ``He's been uncomfortable with the way he's been feeling. 
This has probably been on his mind for some time. He felt it was 
best now to get it checked out and fixed. Hopefully, this makes it 
all better, physically and mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Fuhr, 36, said that his knee had been  
affecting his play. 
</P>
<P>
	```I'm not very good right now, and simply put, the leg's not  
allowing me to be,'' he said. ``My leg is not liking me very much. 
Until we can get along, it's going to be a struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr also underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn  
cartilage last Feb. 28 and missed eight games. It's the same knee 
that required major reconstructive surgery after Toronto's Nick 
Kypreos landed on him in the 1996 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that injury was feared to be career-ending, Fuhr came  
back and played 73 games the following season. That was only six 
fewer than the previous season when he set an NHL iron man mark 
with 79 starts.

<HEADLINE> Damaged Ford Plant Back in Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. called in workers to  
resume production today at a complex that was damaged by an 
explosion and fire last week that killed two workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex makes Ford Mustangs as well as engines and a variety  
of other vehicle components used at 16 of the No. 2 automaker's 20 
North American assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamping, frame, glass, and engine plants, which were shut  
down after last Monday's explosion and fire, were phased back into 
production during the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials said they expected all six plants at the complex  
to run near capacity today. The complex employs about 10,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, three of the 14 men injured had their conditions  
upgraded from critical to serious, and five workers remained in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A state inspector said Thursday that the explosion was caused by  
a gas buildup inside a boiler at the power station.

<HEADLINE> Deliberations Next in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After listening quietly for weeks to testimony  
and argument, senators are ready to debate President Clinton's 
fitness to remain in office. But first they must decide whether to 
hold their historic deliberations in public or behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as deliberations begin, senators are struggling to draft a  
strong censure resolution condemning Clinton's behavior in trying 
to hide an extramarital affair. Proponents of censure hope to bring 
it to the Senate floor immediately after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the evidence submitted, including videotaped testimony  
from the woman at the center of the sex and cover-up case, former 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the Senate was on a path to end 
the first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years on Thursday 
or Friday with an expected acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	But before senators begin debating perjury and  
obstruction-of-justice charges today, they were deciding whether to 
change a Senate rule requiring closed deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of openness had the difficult task of capturing a  
two-thirds majority in the face of opposition from Majority Leader 
Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott said he would allow senators to enter 
statements in the official record to explain their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents feared that if the television cameras stayed on,  
senators would use the maximum time allowed under the rules -- 15 
minutes per senator, or a total of 25 hours -- for debate on the two 
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a heavy tilt toward not opening them up because I want  
to save some time for the censure resolution,'' said Sen. John 
Chafee, R-R.I. The Senate begins its annual February recess at the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	But in closing arguments Monday, the chief House prosecutor,  
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., derided the censure alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you really cleanse the office as provided in the  
Constitution or do you use Air Wick of a censure resolution?'' he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	White House counsel Charles Ruff, summing up for Clinton,  
ridiculed the prosecutors' case, saying it was built on ``shifting 
sand castles of speculation.'' He said prosecutors were ``more 
focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan ends, 
more uncaring about the future we face together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a bipartisan group of senators was writing and rewriting  
censure language, Democratic leader Tom Daschle moved to force a 
procedural vote designed to get a censure resolution before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedural motion may be the most that pro-censure senators  
can achieve for now, because censure opponents might have the 
muscle to block a resolution from reaching the Senate floor. But 
the test vote would at least give senators a chance to record votes 
to criticize the president's conduct in concealing an extramarital 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle also told reporters that Democrats would force the  
Senate to return to the issue later this year if Republicans didn't 
agree to permit a vote on censure. But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
said on Sunday that it was unlikely that senators -- eager to return 
to legislative issues -- would revisit the issue after the Senate 
begins its annual February recess next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle indicated that about five of the Senate's 45 Democrats  
opposed censure and that it would take 20 Republicans to gain the 
60 votes needed to overcome any filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg said he's one of the Democrats  
skeptical about a censure. ``I have been tilting against it,'' he 
said. ``What I've seen of the draft is too assertive in some 
places. I think it's too severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Language in the draft resolution called Clinton's conduct  
``shameless, reckless, and indefensible,'' but there was no 
guarantee the final version would use those words. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds majority to convict the president and  
remove him from office. Senators from both parties have 
acknowledged that neither the perjury nor the obstruction article 
would receive the required 67 votes, and some have doubted whether 
the perjury allegation would even receive a majority. Republicans 
control the Senate, 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde asked Senate leaders to approve three subpoenas for people  
who have cast doubt on sworn testimony that White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal gave in the trial last week. Daschle, D-S.D., said 
Democrats were prepared to object if any GOP senator sought 
approval for the request. ``We don't need additional witnesses,'' 
he said at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has denied feeding reporters a story -- attributed  
ultimately to Clinton -- to the effect that Ms. Lewinsky had told 
the president she was known as ``the stalker'' and that she had 
made a sexual demand on him.

<HEADLINE> Auto Dealer Profits Rise 27 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cost-cutting and a robust market for new  
cars and trucks helped the nation's franchised auto dealers boost 
profits 27 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average pretax profit was about $390,000, the National  
Automobile Dealers Association announced at its annual convention 
Monday. That compares with $306,980 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The average net profit on new vehicles doubled to $150 from $73  
a year earlier. Profits from service and parts sales also rose, as 
did earnings from used-car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were due largely to reduced expenses, especially lower  
interest costs for holding new cars in inventory, said association 
economist Tom Webb, forecasting a gain in profits of 5 percent to 6 
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb predicted U.S. sales of cars and light trucks would fall  
this year to about 15 million units, down from about 15.6 million 
in 1998. He noted that his forecast a year ago, like those of most

<HEADLINE> Missing Boys Safe at Idaho Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- As night fell in the Selkirk Mountains,  
and freezing wind whipped snowdrifts even deeper, three lost 
teen-agers settled on a survival strategy: cling together and pray. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much to do but keep yourself huddled together,''  
said Aaron Baudry-Peterson on Sunday, recalling the cold night 
stranded with two 15-year-old ski pals. ``So I sat there and I 
prayed all night long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trio, who were part of a Spokane, Wash., church group's  
Saturday outing to the Schweitzer Mountain ski resort, carved a 
snow cave where they passed their sleepless, cold night. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, they trekked seven miles through waist-deep snow,  
eventually stumbling upon the home of Bill Findley, a member of the 
sheriff's search and rescue team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were soaked clear through and shaking,'' Findley said.  
``Their hands were pure white.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baudry-Peterson, 15, Justin Haeger and the third youth, whose  
identity was not released, suffered no permanent injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio weren't alone in their ordeal. Two other boys, Canadian  
residents A.J. Kolla, 13, and his 15-year-old brother Mike, also 
were stranded on the mountain Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	They were spotted by volunteer searchers about 4:20 p.m. Sunday,  
walking along a snowmobile trail about two miles from the ski 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	They also appeared to escape serious injuries, said Bonner  
County Sheriff's Cpl. Bob Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came at us, hugging,'' said Dennis McIntire, a volunteer  
rescuer. ``We gave them nut rolls and Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Gillis, the ski resort's general manager, said that  
extreme weather conditions Saturday -- including wind gusts of up to 
50 mph and 18 inches of new snow -- likely caused the boys to get 
lost on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups of boys followed standard survival tactics by  
seeking shelter that shielded them from the wind and 20-degree 
nighttime temperatures, preserving their body heat, rescuers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great! They're home,'' said Karen Haeger, Justin's  
mother, upon the boys' safe return.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Has 1st Female Arbitrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball finally broke the sex barrier in salary  
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	In 409 hearings since 1974, all cases had been decided by males.  
Elizabeth Neumeier, a professional arbitrator from Gloucester, 
Mass., became the first female when Boston outfielder Midre 
Cummings argued his case Monday before a three-person panel in 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Neumeier, born in 1950, is a graduate of New York University and  
has a law degree from Boston University. She was director of the 
legal department of the Association of Flight Attendants from 
1975-79 and has heard disputes involving the steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Neumeier, however, isn't the first female to adjudicate a  
baseball dispute. Sonia Sotomayor, then a U.S. District Judge in 
Manhattan, issued an injunction that caused players to end their 
1994-95 strike after 232 days. Sotomayor has since been promoted to 
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings asked for a raise from $250,000 to $725,000, while the  
Red Sox, using a pair of Harvard professors to argue their case, 
said he should be paid $450,000. Neumeier was joined on the panel 
by a pair of veteran arbitrators: Gil Vernon, hearing his 14th case 
since 1984, and Anthony Sinicropi, hearing his eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings, 27, hit .283 last year with five homers and 15 RBIs in  
120 at-bats. A decision is expected Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of hearings this year, Montreal infielder Shane  
Andrews asked for a raise from $450,000 to $2.3 million, with the 
Expos arguing for $1.25 million. That case will be decided by 
arbitrators Richard Bloch, Roger Kaplan and Jerome Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews, 27, batted .238 last season with 25 homers and 69 RBIs.  
</P>
<P>
	Three players agreed to one-year contracts Monday, leaving 19  
players remaining in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Aaron Sele and the Texas Rangers agreed at  
$5,525,000, up from $2.85 million last year and the midpoint 
between his $6.25 million request and the team's $4.8 million 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay outfielder Quinton McCracken settled at $1.85 million,  
and Philadelphia second baseman Kevin Jordan settled at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Under baseball's labor agreement, 75 percent of cases this year  
were scheduled before three-person panels and 25 percent for 
individual arbitrators.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Flood Amman for Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- For a few moments, there was only silence.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Jordanians, some arriving as early as dawn, lined  
the street waiting, an icy wind stinging faces already red with 
grief. Helicopters beat overhead; a whispered prayer was muttered. 
</P>
<P>
	Then desperate cries of anguish erupted as the flag-draped  
coffin of King Hussein left his fog-shrouded palace to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come back to me!'' screamed a woman, slapping her face.  
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing Bedouin women stood in circles, crying, ``Go with peace,  
our beloved, go with peace.'' Some had to stop, overcome by sobs 
and gasping for air. Others shouted simply, ``My father, my 
father!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd surged, and police in camouflage pushed them back. Men  
cried, ``There is no god but God.'' Young children waved black 
flags and olive branches meant to symbolize their grief. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few short minutes, the crowds finally broke through police  
lines to desperately chase the coffin as it passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenes were repeated again and again in a moving, 90-minute  
procession that gave Jordanians the last glimpse of their king. 
</P>
<P>
	The country has never witnessed such an outpouring of grief as  
it did today, when a nation buried an adored monarch who had served 
as their only ruler across a half-century of war and then peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some spoke of losing their father, their son and their brother.  
Others told of knowing no other leader. Nearly all seemed desperate 
at losing a king that defined them as both a nation and a people. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is our history. He is the history of our country. He built  
it with his own hands,' said Mohammed al-Hiyari, a 27-year-old from 
the city of Salt, 18 miles from Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 800,000 people lined the nine-mile route that ran  
through the city from Bab el-Salaam, the king's palace, to Raghdan 
palace, where the king was to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets looked like rivers of black, mourners waving  
portraits of the king, black flags, even black handkerchiefs. Young 
boys crowded on bridges above tossed yellow rose petals on the 
carriage that carried the coffin. Others lost their footing as they 
tried to scramble down hills into the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the route, men in black headbands held a banner that read,  
``We are orphans after your passing, Hussein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the carriage neared the palace, the crowd rushed toward the  
coffin, stopping it briefly and separating it from its escort of 
red jeeps. Police in camouflage and carrying rifles pushed back the 
mourners -- without success. The frenzy stopped only when the 
carriage finally entered the palace's gate for the state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Abu Habash, a 16-year-old Jordanian, broke away from the  
crowd, walking aimlessly along the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``How will Jordan go on?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> World Confused by Clinton Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Perhaps the headline in the conservative Oslo  
daily Aftenposten says it best: ``Impeachment confuses the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editors and journalists around the world wonder why Americans  
are making such a big deal about a politician's private life -- even 
if it is their president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as completely crazy,'' says Helen Vogt, foreign  
editor of the Norwegian news agency NTB. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a big dash of boredom -- and that about sums up the world  
media view of the saga of President Clinton, now that talk of an 
affair in the White House has segued into talk along partisan lines 
in the Senate impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we knew Clinton would not be removed from office, we saw  
the trial as sort of symbolic spanking,'' says Gerard Dupuy, 
editorial writer for the left-leaning daily Liberation in Paris, 
where Clinton news long ago dropped off the front page. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going to a football match and knowing it's fixed  
because you know what the result will be,'' says David Richardson, 
foreign editor of Press Association, a news agency that serves 
Britain's newspapers. His clients have rarely inquired about 
Clinton developments ``once we got over the novelty of a president 
being put on trial,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, many journalists add, though the story has largely  
dropped off the world's front pages, a lesson is being reinforced 
for the readers still paying attention: This is how a democracy 
works. 
</P>
<P>
	Press restrictions in many countries would ban the reporting of  
most, if not all, of the details in the Clinton case -- and not just 
the salacious ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proceedings show that even the president can be brought to  
justice,'' says Mohammed Mashmoushi, deputy editor in chief of the 
leftist Lebanese newspaper As-Safir. ``They confirm that democracy 
in the U.S. is still strong, even though democracy can be exploited 
for political purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ezio Mauro, editor of La Repubblica, a Rome-based liberal daily,  
says Italian readers admire a democracy that can impeach its 
president without ``belittling'' itself. ``(Still) they are 
surprised that such a powerful man may have to resign for a private 
matter,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proceedings show positively that Americans are really  
trying to find truth and ways to resolve the problem,'' says Choi 
Maeng-ho, international news editor of The Dong-A Ilbo, a 
mass-circulation national daily in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Other journalists argue, however, that the impeachment  
proceedings have tarnished the United States' image and exposed its 
citizens -- and particularly its politicians -- as hopelessly 
judgmental and naive. 
</P>
<P>
	For a sex scandal to shake a society's foundations, says Tapio  
Sadeoja, foreign editor of Finland's largest evening tabloid, 
Ilta-Sanomat, is ``just so incomprehensible to Europeans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spaniards don't think the case will affect democracy in  
America, but it will reinforce their perception that American 
politicians are puritanical about sex and have no scruples when it 
comes to going after their enemies,'' says Antonio Cano, foreign 
editor of Spain's left-leaning El Pais newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Emeka Izeze, editor of the Lagos Guardian, Nigeria's most  
prominent newspaper, ``For one year, the Americans have attempted 
to force us to believe that the most important thing happening is 
the sexual misdemeanor of a man who happens to be their 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, never mind Americans' tut-tutting over the sex stuff:  
Such matters as perjury or obstruction of justice aren't even 
considered serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are interested in politics see the shades, such as  
Republicans' interests behind the proceedings, but an average 
reader only sees the developments as something absurd,'' says Igor 
Golembiovsky, editor of the liberal New Izvestia daily in Moscow. 
He says the proceedings have ``undermined a general respect for the 
U.S. democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vibeke Sperling, head of the foreign desk at the leading  
Copenhagen daily Politiken, says Clinton's fight for his political 
life over an internal matter has inadvertently strengthened some of 
the leaders the United States tries to police, such as Iraq's 
Saddam Hussein and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the world wishes they (Americans) would just get it  
over with and behind them,'' says Mike Osborne of the Australian 
Associated Press news agency.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan Mourns King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- In a final homage to a much-loved monarch,  
the flag-draped coffin of King Hussein was borne today through the 
streets of his capital while hundreds of thousands of compatriots 
wept and pelted the motorcade with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800,000 Jordanians -- many shouting ``God is great!''  
and using their red-checked keffiyehs, or head scarves, to wipe 
tears away -- lined the streets of the procession route under 
lead-gray skies as the coffin passed by atop a flower-bedecked 
jeep. The wail of Koranic verses hung in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral of the king, who died Sunday at 63 of cancer after  
nearly a half century on the Hashemite throne, was also one of the 
most extraordinary diplomatic and political gatherings in recent 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, bitter enemies came together -- at least temporarily  
-- in their wish to honor the Middle East's longest-serving monarch. 
Syrian President Hafez Assad, for example, was making an 
unprecedented appearance at the same event as Israel's Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton arrived with a large American contingent that  
included former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush. They joined 
Britain's Prince Charles, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and 
hundreds of other dignitaries. Ailing Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin cut short his visit, receiving unspecified medical aid 
before flying home, Jordanian officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an honor guard carried the coffin from the door of the Bab es  
Salaam or Door of Peace palace -- named for the peace the king 
forged with Israel -- Hussein's tearful widow, American-born Queen 
Noor, could be glimpsed in the doorway, surrounded by weeping royal 
women in black robes. Her blond hair was covered with a headscarf 
of white, the color of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our eyes cannot contain our tears any more,'' said an  
announcer on Jordanian television, his voice cracking with emotion, 
as the motorcade made its slow way through the hilly streets of 
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	All along the procession route, people pelted the coffin with  
flowers and waved their hands in farewell as it passed. They packed 
small bridges overhanging the route. 
</P>
<P>
	``King Hussein will not die -- he will always remain in our  
hearts,'' said Mohammed Karim Zabous, 50, from the town of Jerash. 
</P>
<P>
	At several points in the half-hour journey riot police and  
soldiers had to hold back the crowd as people surged forward. 
</P>
<P>
	At Raghdan Palace, King Abdullah and all the royal princes,  
flanked by an honor guard, formally received the coffin, carried by 
pallbearers in black armbands. There, leaders spent more than an 
hour filing past it to pay respects. Clinton paused a long moment 
and bowed his head, looking somber. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the casket, accompanied by a bagpipe-playing honor guard,  
was placed on a gun carriage for another journey: to the mosque 
where prayers were to be held over it. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the paying of respects, a riderless white stallion -- one  
of the king's favorite horses -- was led into the palace compound 
with a pair of empty boots in the stirrups, facing backward. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's procession, Jordanians piled flowers under  
posters of the late king, flew black flags from doorposts and car 
antennas and flocked to mosques for early morning prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The country was to remain virtually shut down until Saturday as  
a period of official mourning was observed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 800,000 people who turned out in the capital,  
1.2 million more attended rites held elsewhere in the country -- a 
remarkable turnout for a country of less than 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever we say, we can't express what we feel. He was my  
father in what he did and how he loved us -- we can't forget him,'' 
said Osama Mohammed Safi, 17, who was wearing a black headband. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral brought the country's largest military mobilization  
since bread riots in 1997. Soldiers perched on rooftops along the 
procession route, and the hilltop complex housing the royal 
compound resembled a heavily guarded military base, with jeeps and 
trucks outfitted with machine guns and soldiers from all three 
elite military branches. 
</P>
<P>
	If overwhelming in scale, the rites were also haunting in their  
simplicity, with ceremonial elements unchanged over the centuries. 
The king's body was to be washed in accordance with Islamic 
practice, scented with musk, and buried in a humble white shroud. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in keeping with traditional Muslim religious practices,  
women did not take part in the formal funeral devotions -- not even 
Hussein's American-born wife, Queen Noor. Women were to pay tribute 
in separate ceremonies Tuesday at the palace of King Hussein's late 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting female dignitaries including first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton were to be received there today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein had lingered unconscious on a respirator for two days  
after returning home to Jordan last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The swearing in of Abdullah, 37, came just four hours after  
Hussein died, culminating a series of steps meant to ensure a swift 
and seamless passage of power and bolster Jordan's role as an 
island of stability in the volatile Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Untested as a political leader, Abdullah assured the country he  
would try to ensure his father's legacies lived on. 
</P>
<P>
	The new king's first official decree named his half-brother,  
19-year-old Prince Hamzeh -- Queen Noor's eldest son -- as crown 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is the son of Hussein's British-born second wife,  
Princess Muna, the former Toni Gardiner. 
</P>
<P>
	In 46 years as Jordan's king, Hussein weathered coup attempts  
and assassination bids. In the early years of his reign he waged 
war against Israel in the early years of his reign, but eventually 
became a champion of Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Nov. 14, 1935, Hussein was a descendent of Hashem,  
great-grandfather of the seventh century Prophet Mohammed of Islam. 
He was crowned king on May 2, 1953, after his father, Talal, 
abdicated because of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he led his nation on the path of peace, Hussein  
relished his role as commander in chief. An accomplished pilot who 
often took the controls of the royal jet or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's later years were plagued by health problems, although  
he maintained a vigorous appearance well into his cancer treatment. 
He had undergone surgery for a cancerous kidney in 1992, and last 
year he had six months of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkins lymphoma at 
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Hussein left his hospital bed to help mediate the  
Wye River peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, winning 
accolades from all sides for his deft diplomacy.

	Hussein had lingered unconscious on a respirator for two days  
after returning home to Jordan last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The swearing in of Abdullah, 37, came just four hours after  
Hussein died, culminating a series of steps meant to ensure a swift 
and seamless passage of power and bolster Jordan's role as an 
island of stability in the volatile Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Untested as a political leader, Abdullah assured the country he  
would try to ensure his father's legacies lived on. 
</P>
<P>
	The new king's first official decree named his half-brother,  
19-year-old Prince Hamzeh -- Queen Noor's eldest son -- as crown 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is the son of Hussein's British-born second wife,  
Princess Muna, the former Toni Gardiner. 
</P>
<P>
	In 46 years as Jordan's king, Hussein weathered coup attempts  
and assassination bids. In the early years of his reign he waged 
war against Israel in the early years of his reign, but eventually 
became a champion of Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Nov. 14, 1935, Hussein was a descendent of Hashem,  
great-grandfather of the seventh century Prophet Mohammed of Islam. 
He was crowned king on May 2, 1953, after his father, Talal, 
abdicated because of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he led his nation on the path of peace, Hussein  
relished his role as commander in chief. An accomplished pilot who 
often took the controls of the royal jet or helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's later years were plagued by health problems, although  
he maintained a vigorous appearance well into his cancer treatment. 
He had undergone surgery for a cancerous kidney in 1992, and last 
year he had six months of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkins lymphoma at 
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Hussein left his hospital bed to help mediate the  
Wye River peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians, winning 
accolades from all sides for his deft diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bill Interest Rates Rise / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in 10 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.420 percent, up from 4.400 percent last 
week. An additional $7.51 billion was sold in six-month bills, also 
at a rate of 4.420 percent, up from 4.390 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates were the highest since Dec. 28, when the three-month  
bills sold for 4.520 percent and the six-month rate was 4.525. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.531 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,888.30, and 4.585 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,776.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Survivors Describe Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Trapped on his back under 3 feet of snow, with  
a thin stream of air passing through a tiny hole he'd carved out, 
Derek Lerch spent hours screaming for help for himself and his 
three hiking companions. 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Harry Eichelberger, was buried close to him by the  
avalanche that struck them near California's Donner Pass in the 
Sierra Nevada, and the two men shared the air vent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dying wasn't a burden after a while,'' Eichelberger recalled  
Sunday. ``It seemed easier than being down there, unable to see 
anything, not being able to breathe, shivering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger, Lerch and a third friend survived Saturday's  
avalanche. A fourth, 21-year-old Malcolm Russell Hart of Dover, 
N.H., died. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy snows and avalanches over the weekend killed three men out  
skiing and snowboarding in the central Colorado Rockies, about 130 
miles southwest of Denver. In Utah, a massive slide took the life 
of a man on snowshoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger and three fellow students at the University of  
California, Berkeley, were out sledding when they were caught by a 
storm. A series of storms in the area had dumped 2 to 4 feet of 
snow on the higher Sierra peaks. Wind gusts of more than 100 mph 
were reported over the Sierra crest during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the other two were dead for sure because we  
couldn't hear them,'' said Lerch, 21, of Chico. ``The worst part is 
when I realized I couldn't get out. The snow was just too heavy. I 
was certain I would die. I screamed for help all night long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger, 21, of Chicago, finally mustered his last strength  
to dig through the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``He clawed little by little bit with his fingers,'' Lerch said.  
``Harry was the hero. He was the one who made it out. If he didn't, 
we all would still be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lerch, Eichelberger, and Marisa Nelson, 20, of Chico, were  
released Sunday after being treated for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in a different avalanche Saturday were Andrew P. Vork,  
19, of Parker, Colo.; Casey James McKenny, 19, of Marquette, Mich., 
and Matthew Alan Noddin, 22, of Portland, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Hiel, 22, died in a Utah avalance.

<HEADLINE> World Confused by Clinton Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Perhaps the headline in the conservative Oslo  
daily Aftenposten says it best: ``Impeachment confuses the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editors and journalists around the world wonder why Americans  
are making such a big deal about a politician's private life -- even 
if it is their president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as completely crazy,'' says Helen Vogt, foreign  
editor of the Norwegian news agency NTB. 
</P>
<P>
	Add a big dash of boredom -- and that about sums up the world  
media view of the saga of President Clinton, now that talk of an 
affair in the White House has segued into talk along partisan lines 
in the Senate impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we knew Clinton would not be removed from office, we saw  
the trial as sort of symbolic spanking,'' says Gerard Dupuy, 
editorial writer for the left-leaning daily Liberation in Paris, 
where Clinton news long ago dropped off the front page. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going to a football match and knowing it's fixed  
because you know what the result will be,'' says David Richardson, 
foreign editor of Press Association, a news agency that serves 
Britain's newspapers. His clients have rarely inquired about 
Clinton developments ``once we got over the novelty of a president 
being put on trial,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, many journalists add, though the story has largely  
dropped off the world's front pages, a lesson is being reinforced 
for the readers still paying attention: This is how a democracy 
works. 
</P>
<P>
	Press restrictions in many countries would ban the reporting of  
most, if not all, of the details in the Clinton case -- and not just 
the salacious ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proceedings show that even the president can be brought to  
justice,'' says Mohammed Mashmoushi, deputy editor in chief of the 
leftist Lebanese newspaper As-Safir. ``They confirm that democracy 
in the U.S. is still strong, even though democracy can be exploited 
for political purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ezio Mauro, editor of La Repubblica, a Rome-based liberal daily,  
says Italian readers admire a democracy that can impeach its 
president without ``belittling'' itself. ``(Still) they are 
surprised that such a powerful man may have to resign for a private 
matter,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proceedings show positively that Americans are really  
trying to find truth and ways to resolve the problem,'' says Choi 
Maeng-ho, international news editor of The Dong-A Ilbo, a 
mass-circulation national daily in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Other journalists argue, however, that the impeachment  
proceedings have tarnished the United States' image and exposed its 
citizens -- and particularly its politicians -- as hopelessly 
judgmental and naive. 
</P>
<P>
	For a sex scandal to shake a society's foundations, says Tapio  
Sadeoja, foreign editor of Finland's largest evening tabloid, 
Ilta-Sanomat, is ``just so incomprehensible to Europeans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spaniards don't think the case will affect democracy in  
America, but it will reinforce their perception that American 
politicians are puritanical about sex and have no scruples when it 
comes to going after their enemies,'' says Antonio Cano, foreign 
editor of Spain's left-leaning El Pais newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Emeka Izeze, editor of the Lagos Guardian, Nigeria's most  
prominent newspaper, ``For one year, the Americans have attempted 
to force us to believe that the most important thing happening is 
the sexual misdemeanor of a man who happens to be their 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, never mind Americans' tut-tutting over the sex stuff:  
Such matters as perjury or obstruction of justice aren't even 
considered serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are interested in politics see the shades, such as  
Republicans' interests behind the proceedings, but an average 
reader only sees the developments as something absurd,'' says Igor 
Golembiovsky, editor of the liberal New Izvestia daily in Moscow. 
He says the proceedings have ``undermined a general respect for the 
U.S. democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vibeke Sperling, head of the foreign desk at the leading  
Copenhagen daily Politiken, says Clinton's fight for his political 
life over an internal matter has inadvertently strengthened some of 
the leaders the United States tries to police, such as Iraq's 
Saddam Hussein and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the world wishes they (Americans) would just get it  
over with and behind them,'' says Mike Osborne of the Australian 
Associated Press news agency.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Expects Less Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The government on Monday lowered its  
projected 1999 economic growth rate to 4.74 percent, the lowest 
since Taiwan was hit by an oil crisis in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The new prediction is down from the government's last forecast  
of 5.24 percent; officials blamed the slowing growth on the 
lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis on exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports plunged 9.4 percent last year to $110.6 billion -- the  
largest drop in 43 years, according to the Directorate General of 
Budget, Accounting and Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also lowered its figure for last year's growth  
rate to 4.83 percent from the previous forecast of 5.11 percent and 
the 1997 rate of 6.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that despite the slowdown growth remains  
robust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared with the sluggish global economies, our economy has  
retained a relatively healthy, medium growth,'' said Wei Duan, 
director of the government agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's growth rate last year still ranks 15th in the world,  
only next to China's 7 percent among its Asian neighbors, Wei said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the figures showed fourth quarter growth rate fell to 3.71  
percent, down from the first quarter's 5.86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei said slowing private investment has taken a toll, noting  
that new investment in machinery, vehicles and other factory 
equipment shrank by 3.8 percent last quarter from an increase of 39 
percent in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei said the economy has also been hurt as banks tightened  
credit in the aftermath of a rash of corporate defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei said a more robust economy can be expected later this year  
as other Asian economies move toward recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists warn long-term economic growth will depend on  
whether the government can enforce strict measures to deter 
improper business deals. It was revealed recently that many 
Taiwanese companies have close ties with top politicians that they 
used to gain unsecured loans and lucrative business contracts.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Wife's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT AIRY, Md. (AP) -- A man who told police his wife  
disappeared three weeks ago while shopping was charged with her 
murder after her body was found in a car at an airport parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Holt, 44, a scientific editor for the Journal of the  
National Cancer Institute, was charged Sunday. After he was 
questioned by state police, he confessed to strangling his 
43-year-old wife, Nancy, in the garage of their home on Jan. 18, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He then took police to her body, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	Holt said he drove to Baltimore-Washington International Airport  
and parked the car in a long-term lot, then took an airport cab 
back home, said state police spokesman Capt. Greg Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his confession, Holt had maintained that he had no idea  
where his wife was, Shipley said. He had told police she had been 
missing since midday on Jan. 18 when she went shopping and later 
was to go to work at the federal Health Care Financing 
Administration in Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Browns Study Available Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) ---- Dwight Clark and the Browns are finally  
feeling better about the NFL's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, the 150 players whom Cleveland can choose in  
Tuesday's draft didn't look very appealing to Clark, the club's 
director of football operations, who knew little or nothing about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But after spending endless hours breaking down game films,  
making phone calls, and dissecting the list of the league's most 
unwanted, Clark is convinced he can find Cleveland some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I initially looked at the list, it didn't blow me away,''  
Clark said. ``But some of the players I had not been that familiar 
with. Ultimately, you start digging in and finding more information 
about them. That's when you start getting excited about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excited? About the expansion draft?  
</P>
<P>
	It may be hard for the rest of the league to believe, but  
Cleveland is pumped. After a three-year hiatus, the NFL is back in 
football-mad northern Ohio. And to trumpet the Browns' rebirth, the 
league decided to hold the expansion draft in the birthplace of pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	All 4,000 tickets made available for the event at the Canton  
Civic Center were quickly scooped up by Browns fans, who haven't 
had a chance to get together and cheer for their beloved team in a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dawg Pound will be out in full force, woofing for each of  
the Browns' selections during the 2 1/2-hour draft to be carried live 
by ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	So what players have the Browns most excited? Those with small  
contracts and big potential. Cleveland inherits a player's 
contract, so dollar figures are as important as rushing average and 
sack totals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for guys with an up side,'' said coach Chris  
Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some big-name players available -- Denver's Darrien  
Gordon and Neil Smith, Green Bay's Robert Brooks and Reggie White, 
the Jets' Glenn Foley, Oakland's Desmond Howard, and Washington's 
Gus Frerotte -- but all come with some kind of baggage. They're 
either overpaid, underachieving, injured, or in White's case, 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at some of the names, and from that side of the table  
you say, 'that guys a no-brainer, they have to take him,''' said 
Clark. ``But when you look a little closer you start to understand 
why a guy might be on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer and Clark have prepared for the big day by holding mock  
drafts. They've trimmed the list of 150 -- five from each team -- to 
about 45-50. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went into the equation,'' Clark said. ``First, we  
looked at talent level of the player. Then we looked at financial 
implications, their character, their age and how they were 
medically. All that went into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who will build their team primarily through free  
agency and April's college draft, are expected to load up on 
offensive lineman. There are several good ones available, including 
Detroit center-guard Jim Pyne, New England guard Todd Rucci, 
Chicago tackle Andy Heck, Miami tackle Jeff Buckey, Baltimore guard 
Ben Cavil and Minnesota tackle Scott Rehberg. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the list of players, the NFL gave the Browns a  
list of rules. Among the most important are: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cleveland will have three minutes to make a selection, and can  
take 30 to 42 players. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Browns must use 38 percent of their salary cap (expected  
to be $57.5 million) on players they pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- After the Browns select a player, that player's team will have  
two minutes to decide if it wants to pull back one of the four 
remaining players it has left unprotected. However, teams can 
choose to leave all of its players available. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Browns can trade a player they select, but not back to  
that player's previous team. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules are similar to the ones Jacksonville and Carolina had  
to follow in the '95 expansion draft. Still, Browns president 
Carmen Policy thinks the NFL's guidelines may be constricting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have an expansion draft with slightly different  
rules,'' he said. ``The draft does give us the opportunity to get 
veteran players who otherwise would be unattainable. But I think 
you pay a penalty in terms of the numbers of players we're required 
to take and-or the amount of cap space we must make available.''

<HEADLINE> Sele, Rangers Agree to 1-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Aaron Sele avoided salary arbitration  
with the Texas Rangers, agreeing Monday to a one-year contract 
worth $5,525,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sele, a 28-year-old right-hander, was 19-11 with a 4.23 ERA in  
33 starts last year, when he made $2.85 million. The settlement was 
halfway between the $6.25 million he had asked for in arbitration 
and the $4.8 million Texas had offered. A hearing had been 
scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Sele can earn a pair of $50,000  
bonuses: $50,000 for making the AL All-Star team and $50,000 for 
pitching 115 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas wound up settling with all five of its players who filed  
for arbitration last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Rick Helling agreed to a $10.5 million, three-year  
contract, and right-hander Tim Crabtree agreed to a two-year deal 
with $1,695,000. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Lee Stevens ($2 million) and backup catcher Gregg  
Zaun ($425,000) agreed to one-year contracts.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday,  
but bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the key

points earlier in the day. On Friday, the average fell 188.77 
points, or 1.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders attributed the rebound to the drop in long-term bond  
yields, which also triggered the selling of the yen against the 
dollar.

	The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has slipped  
back to 2.160 percent from Friday's finish of 2.365 percent,

<P>
	Last Thursday, Malaysia lifted the one-year freeze on  
repatriating proceeds from the sale of equities by foreigners and 
replaced it with an exit tax. The size of the tax will depend on

<P>
	Brokers said Hong Kong share prices fell because of concerns  
that the recent strength of the U.S. economy might lead to an 
interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	They said if the United States raises interest rates, it is less  
likely that Hong Kong banks will continue to trim interest rates to 
help the economy. Interest rates in Hong Kong tend to follow those 
in the United States because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the

<HEADLINE> Stock-Holding by Japan Banks Rapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government should force banks to  
surrender their stocks in corporations to prevent steep drops in 
the stock market from harming the financial system, a think-tank 
proposed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks traditionally have vast shareholdings in companies across  
a number of industries, making their accounts vulnerable to an 
overall drop in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if stock prices fell 20 percent, Japan's 17 largest  
banks would lose around 6 trillion yen ($52.9 billion) of their 30 
trillion yen ($264.3 billion) in shares, fueling worries about 
Japan's financial system, Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, banks need to be banned in principle from holding  
stock, and a body should be established to absorb shares forcibly 
taken from banks, Daiwa Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body, which would be backed by funds from the Bank of Japan  
and the government, should hold stocks for one or two years before 
selling them to individual and foreign investors, as well as to 
Japanese institutional investors who manage public and private 
pension funds, Daiwa Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daiwa proposal calls for exceptions to the ban on  
stockholdings for shares held by securities units of banks and for 
shares managed in trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, any measures would have to take in account shares held  
indirectly through holding companies and other means and regulate 
them or ban them accordingly, Daiwa said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is  
studying whether to form a body to buy stocks sold as 
cross-shareholdings are unwound. The LDP members are considering 
proposals made by various groups, including Daiwa Research and the 
Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures taken by the LDP shouldn't be aimed at boosting  
Japanese share prices in the near term, but must be conducted as 
part of long-term structural changes in the stock market, said 
Susumu Okano, a Daiwa researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	But Okano, who explained the institute's proposal to the LDP  
members last week, said he doesn't think the party will come up 
with a concrete proposal soon.

	Clinton Trial Resumes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors in closing arguments today  
urged the Senate to remove President Clinton from office because 
``the rule of law should apply to everyone.'' Rep. James 
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., asked senators not to be swayed by 
presidential lawyers' arguments or by attacks on prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr's investigation, and to recognize that Clinton himself was 
responsible for bringing the impeachment crisis upon the nation. 
White House lawyers will follow with their own arguments before 
senators began their deliberations on the charges.

	King Hussein Laid to Rest

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan was buried today  
amid an outpouring of grief from his people and tributes from the 
amassed dignitaries. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined the 
streets of Jordan's capital for a glimpse at the coffin of the 
Middle East's longest-serving leader. Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 
46 years, died yesterday of cancer at age 63. His son, Abdullah, 
has assumed the throne. President Clinton and former Presidents 
Bush, Carter and Ford paused silently behind the king's coffin in 
the Palace of Peace as the visiting dignitaries paid their 
respects. The funeral brought together some bitter enemies, 
including Syrian President Assad and Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu.

	Albanians Call for Cease Fire  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serb and ethnic Albanian officials  
traded demands today for a peace deal to end the crisis in the 
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. The Albanians called for a formal 
cease-fire and the Serbs seeking an Albanian pledge to keep 
Yugoslavia's borders unchanged. But international mediators wanted 
to drop what the ``side issues'' and move on to details of a peace 
settlement. An official for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army called 
for the cease-fire and said it should be guaranteed by the United 
States and the five other European countries that make up the 
Kosovo Contact Group: Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
The Serb push to maintain Yugoslavia's borders means the Albanians 
would have to give up their demand for independence.

	Feds Investigate Movie Distribution  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's antitrust division  
has begun a preliminary inquiry into some practices in the 
distribution of movies. The probe focuses on possible violations of 
a 1948 consent decree that forced movie studios to sell their movie 
theaters and put other restrictions on their relationships, said a 
source. The investigation likely will center on a practice called 
block booking, in which studios force theater chains to take a 
second movie, often less popular, in order to get the rights to 
show a very popular film.

	German Charged With Helping Iraqis  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A German engineer accused of helping Iraq with a  
program to produce enriched uranium for nuclear weapons has been 
charged with treason and violating export laws. Karl-Heinz Schaab 
was convicted in 1993 of violating export laws and sentenced to 11 
months probation for selling Iraq blueprints for a gas centrifuge 
used for producing weapons-grade uranium in 1989. But new evidence 
gathered by U.N. inspectors indicates the plans Schaab sold were 
not for the outdated ``subcritical'' centrifuge as originally 
thought, but for a far more advanced and modern type.

30 flights were canceled today, increasing the total to more than

<HEADLINE> The NBA Gets Off on the Wrong Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is why people say if you can make it there, you can make it  
anywhere: 
</P>
<P>
	While the NBA's opening weekend left little doubt that players  
will be scraping off rust -- and pounds -- for some time to come, the 
Madison Square Garden faithful are already in midseason form. And 
they wasted precious little time letting the Knicks know how they 
feel about the team's most controversial addition. 
</P>
<P>
	We're not talking about Latrell Sprewell, whose debut Sunday in  
New York was probably his worst game ever as a pro. Nor Marv 
Albert, who didn't choke anyone, but who was back in the building 
doing play-by-play on the radio less than 18 months after pleading 
guilty to biting a former lover. 
</P>
<P>
	No. Instead, the New Yorkers rained Bronx cheers down on the  
Knicks City Dancers, whose sin apparently was adding a half-dozen 
men to its previously all-female dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
	This shortened season could wind up proving just how much of a  
virtue patience truly is. Even though the home team wound up losing 
83-79 to hated Miami and its evil genius-coach, Pat Riley, Knicks 
fans can take comfort knowing that their male dancers are good 
enough to start for some other NBA teams -- the Los Angeles 
Clippers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving that some things never change, the Clips fell to 0-2  
Sunday night after getting beat by the Bulls. This was not as easy 
as it sounds. Not only was Chicago without Michael Jordan, Scottie 
Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, etc., the holdovers 
and throw-ins general manager Jerry Krause rented uniforms to 
barely got any practice time together. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorable start to their title defense, the Bulls didn't  
have enough players signed the day training camp opened to hold a 
decent scrimmage. Not that they needed to practice. In its first of 
two exhibition games, Chicago came back from 18 points down against 
Indiana, everybody's preseason favorite, to close within six in the 
final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls wound up getting beat, but the crowd at the United  
Center was so impressed by the hustle it gave a standing ovation to 
the five players who were on the court during that surge. Afraid 
that people might not give him enough credit for the rebuilding 
effort, Krause promptly cut every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Where he goes from here is anyone's guess. But if the Bulls keep  
winning, look for the Toni Kukoc-to-Phoenix-for-the-gorilla trade 
rumor to become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	So what else can we actually glean from the opening round of  
games? A few things: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Desperate as the league is for entertainment and some teams  
are for warm bodies, Rodman is still having a hard time finding 
work. Mr. Bad-As-I-Wanna-Be hasn't found a coach yet who thinks the 
same way. Rodman says he wants to play, but more than ever his 
sincerity is open to question. Could be because he said he wanted 
to be married to Carmen Electra, too, and we all know how that is 
turning out. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Compressing the schedule so that teams play two or three games  
in as many nights sounded like a good way to jack up intensity 
right from the start. Put into practice, it could turn out to be 
too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloppy play and combustible temperaments are not a good fit.  
Some players' legs are wobbly, others have stomachs hanging over 
the waistband of their shorts. But the nerves of more than a few 
are already stretched tighter than piano wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and New Jersey played each other on consecutive nights.  
Saturday night, they combined for 72 fouls and Hawks center Dikembe 
Mutombo broke the nose of Nets forward Jayson Williams with his 
elbow. Though it appeared accidental, Mutombo had done the same 
thing to Cleveland's Vitaly Potapenko in Atlanta's opener Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was this interesting coincidence: Mutombo, a  
client of agent David Falk, was one of more active -- not to mention 
hawkish -- members of the players' union bargaining team. Williams 
was one of the union's most identifiable dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it was New Jersey's Kendall Gill and Atlanta's Steve Smith  
who wanted to mix it up. After they had words during the game, the 
two had to be separated by officials on the court and by Georgia 
State Police officers in a corridor outside the locker room 
afterward. Gill denied that he and Smith were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man,'' he said. ``we were just dancing.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Gill and the rest of the players would do well to remember  
that in a few NBA towns, the natives are restless for entertainment 
and prepared, if need be, to take matters into their own hands. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jason Schwartzman To Debut in Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's tough being an ``unknown'' trying to make  
it as an actor in Hollywood. And it probably doesn't help to be 
just 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jason Schwartzman, who plays a nerdy 10th-grader in  
``Rushmore,'' did have a few things on his side. 
</P>
<P>
	Try a mother who is an actress, a father who was a producer --  
and an uncle named Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartzman, who makes his acting debut in the film, tells  
Sunday's Daily News that it was mostly chance that got him the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	At a party at Coppola's Napa Valley, Calif., vineyard, a casting  
director from ``Rushmore'' was describing the teen-age character to 
Schwartzman's cousin, Sofia Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sofia says, 'Oh my God, that sounds like my cousin Jason,'''  
Schwartzman says. Next thing Schwartzman knew, he was being 
introduced to the director, and had his first role. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the film for the young actor was working with an  
idol -- Bill Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to watch him in his element -- working and creating  
-- was incredible,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> House Prosecutors: Remove Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urging senators, ``Don't be fooled by the  
president's excuses,'' House prosecutors today brought their 
impeachment case to a close with a final plea that President 
Clinton be removed from office. The chief White House lawyer 
accused lawmakers of hurting the country by ``wanting to win too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff said ``we know the pain the  
president has caused'' America with his effort to conceal his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. But he urged senators to conclude that 
Clinton's transgressions didn't rise to the level of impeachable 
offenses as the House charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have heard the managers' vision. ... But I believe their  
vision to be too dark, a vision too little attuned to the needs of 
the people, too little sensitive to the needs of our democracy,'' 
Ruff argued in his most direct attack on the 13 Republican House 
lawmakers who have prosecuted Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential lawyer said the House impeachment case was  
``more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan 
ends'' than on the high standards the Founding Fathers had set for 
removing a president from office. He said the House managers 
suffered from ``wanting to win too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his final words, Ruff appealed to the memory of the Founding  
Fathers and to future generations who will look back on the 
impeachment proceedings for guidance. He then reiterated the phrase 
he began the defense with a month ago: ``William Jefferson Clinton 
is not guilty of the charges that have been brought against him. 
... He must not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors argued in their closing arguments that the  
evidence supported the charges of obstruction of justice and 
perjury lodged against Clinton and that failure to remove him from 
office would harm the institution of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional  
consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing the president 
to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come,'' Rep. 
F. James Sensenbrenner argued. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the prosecutors' last chance to sway a Senate seemingly  
on track to acquit the president on the two articles of impeachment 
passed by the House last December. After today's closing arguments, 
senators were to begin deliberating the charges -- most likely 
behind closed doors -- and vote by week's end. Republicans concede 
they are far short of the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors made one last effort to extend the trial this  
afternoon, asking Senate leaders to issue subpoenas for two 
reporters and a third person who have challenged the sworn 
testimony of White House aide Sidney Blumenthal in the impeachment 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new evidence indicates that Sidney Blumenthal may have  
testified falsely before the Senate,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief 
prosecutor, wrote Senate leaders. Blumenthal has denied giving 
false testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators seemed committed to ending the trial this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Sensenbrenner said Clinton alone was responsible for instigating  
only the second presidential impeachment in American history. The 
Wisconsin Republican said that while Clinton had apologized for his 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, his apologies had been ``carefully 
crafted for the president to continue to evade and, yes, avoid 
responsibility for his deceiving the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is still the truth and a lie is still a lie, and the  
rule of law should apply to everyone,'' Sensenbrenner argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, don't be fooled by the president's excuses and spin  
control,'' he pleaded. ``For the sake of our country and for future 
generations, please find the president guilty of perjury and 
obstruction of justice when you cast your votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the odds were firmly against the prosecutors, and some  
Democrats suggested that the vote on the perjury charge might not 
even attract a majority. Two-thirds, or 67 senators, must vote to 
convict Clinton to remove him for office. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of the country for the funeral of Jordan's  
King Hussein, accompanied by two senators who normally would have 
been at the trial -- Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' Leahy conceded. He predicted  
the articles of impeachment would come Thursday and senators could 
use Friday to debate alternate punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Tom Daschle estimated today that a follow-up  
resolution to censure Clinton would need support from about 20 
Republicans to clear an expected GOP filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said of the censure effort that could follow votes on  
the articles of impeachment this week, ``We're trying to make a 
historic statement of record'' on Clinton's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans are expected to vote for the impeachment  
articles, but if those votes fail -- as expected -- many of the GOP 
senators feel that a follow-up vote to censure would be too little 
punishment and a bad constitutional precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties have been working on a censure  
statement, but the resolution would be debated only after the 
Senate voted to acquit or convict Clinton on the impeachment 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators are so strongly opposed to a censure  
that they would be expected to mount a filibuster, which could be 
stopped only with 60 votes in the 100-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In facing their uphill fight, House prosecutors today  
acknowledged the president's lawyers had made an aggressive 
defense. ``They produced smoke so thick that it continues to cloud 
this debate,'' Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chabot said the evidence, including the videotaped testimony  
of Ms. Lewinsky played at the trial over the weekend, supported the 
charges. ``These truths cannot be ignored, distorted or swept under 
the rug,'' the lawmaker argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff today replayed snippets from Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in  
which the former intern asserted she filed a false affidavit, not 
at the behest of the president but because she wanted to avoid 
testifying in the politically charged Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott opened the trial session by  
trying to introduce two affidavits, including one from a 
journalist, that conflict with a portion of the testimony of White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal presented Saturday. Several senators 
have suggested the Justice Department should investigate the 
conflicts, but Daschle blocked Lott from placing the affidavits 
into the trial record.

</P>
<P>
	NASA said Eros was found to be slightly smaller than predicted,  
with at least two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge and a 
density comparable to the Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
	Eros was by named Gustav Witt, director of the Urania  
Observatory in Berlin, Germany, who discovered the asteroid on Aug. 
13, 1898. In general, asteroids are named by their discoverers and 
Witt chose the name of the Greek god of love. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was able to take 222 photos of the asteroid and  
make other observations when it passed 2,375 miles from Eros. The 
two will rendezvous again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eros was first observed from Earth more than 100 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The satellite flyby produced evidence of variations in surface  
color and reflected light that suggest the asteroid has a diverse 
surface makeup. Closer observations are needed to determine its 
precise composition. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite measured Eros at 21 miles long by eight miles wide  
and eight miles deep, slightly smaller than originally estimated 
from ground-based radar observations. It had been estimated at 25.3 
miles by nine miles by eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The asteroid rotates once every 5.27 hours and has no visible  
moons. Its density is approximately 1.55 ounces per cubic inch, 
close to the average density of Earth's crust.

<HEADLINE> Reno Air Pilots Also Unhappy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The recent purchase of Reno Air by  
American Airlines' parent, AMR Corp., has resulted in disgruntled 
unions representing both pilot groups. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' pilots have been bickering with AMR, saying  
the company should more quickly integrate Reno pilots onto its 
roster, thereby moving people up on the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno pilots, on the other hand, have their own gripes. They are  
particularly unhappy that American pilots plan to ``staple'' them 
onto the bottom of the seniority list, leaving them with fewer 
scheduling choices. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reno pilots have had no input into negotiations, American  
pilots have made the airline feel their displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 flights have been canceled since talks bogged  
down between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association late 
last Friday. About 20 percent of American's 2,250 flights were 
canceled Monday, with Miami and New York the hardest-hit regions. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR chief executive Donald Carty said at a news conference  
Monday that the airline is considering asking a court for an 
injunction against the pilots' job action, but a decision has not 
yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	APA is urging its members to consider whether emotions from the  
bickering would affect their ability to safely pilot a jet -- 
apparently prompting the unusually large number of cockpit crew 
members who say they are ``unfit to fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have said is we want you to use common sense and your  
best judgment,'' said Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied 
Pilots Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, a number of American pilots are refusing to take  
on extra flights. While American pilots are barred by federal law 
from striking over the issue, they are allowed to refuse overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	While APA says it wants the airline to immediately upgrade the  
lower-paid Reno pilots to American's pay scales, the union that 
represents Reno Air pilots, the Air Line Pilots Association, 
opposes plans that would cause its members to lose seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been shut out of these talks and have been permitted  
no input whatsoever,'' said Reno pilots spokesman Bob Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said that Reno pilots are left with little recourse and  
are considering a lawsuit of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to do whatever it takes. All we're asking for  
is fair and equitable treatment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday night none of the groups were in negotiations and  
none were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Carty said he believes the disagreement between American pilots  
and the company is not truly about the Reno acquisition, but rather 
trying to get language into the contract to set precedent for any 
future deals the airline may make. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots say they see this issue as one of job security.  
They do not want to allow American to buy smaller airlines and use 
those lower-paid pilots in place of American crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	The current stalemate is the latest in a series of disputes  
between the company and the pilots, who staged a brief strike over 
their contract two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, more than 450 flights were canceled as pilots  
refused to work overtime to protest a passenger-sharing deal with 
Canadian Airlines Corp. And more than 1,000 flights were canceled 
during a dispute eight years ago in which American sought a court 
injunction against the pilots, whom the airline accused of staging 
an illegal sick-out.

<HEADLINE>  Bowler Gets 10 Wickets in Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A perfect game in baseball. A 59 in  
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are rare events. But what Anil Kumble did in front of  
70,000 screaming cricket fans was rarer still. 
</P>
<P>
	In 122 years of international cricket only one other bowler has  
taken all 10 wickets in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	That it came during one of the sport's great rivalries -- India  
vs. Pakistan -- made it all the more startling. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble turned in the perfect 10 in India's 212-run victory, a  
performance that made him the hottest topic Monday at shops and bus 
stops, and grabbed headlines on newspapers, radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble allowed Pakistan 74 runs Sunday. That matched the feat of  
England's Jim Laker against Australia in 1956, when Laker gave up 
just 53 runs. By comparison, there have been 13 perfect games in 
the major leagues and three rounds of 59 in PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan knocked out as Kumble makes a killing,'' read one  
newspaper headline. Others had ``Kumble takes haul of fame,'' 
``Kumble makes history with perfect 10,'' and ``10 out of 10: 
Pakistan Kumbled at Kotla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Age said simply: ``Words fail this headline.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe tomorrow, when I read the newspapers, I will realize  
what happened,'' Kumble had said after teammate V.V.S. Laxman 
caught Wasim Akram's final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many television stations replayed the entire match Monday, while  
others showed Kumble's bowling over and over. And all over New 
Delhi, children rose early to play cricket before going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kumble is my hero!'' said Chanchal Misra, a 12-year-old trying  
to copy Kumble's bowling action on his street. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble's performance is hard to measure against other sports,  
but it could be seen as cricket's equivalent of a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	In test cricket, the highest level of international play, each  
team bats with 10 wickets -- or outs -- at stake in each of two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A match takes five days to play and a single innings can last  
for more than 10 hours. No bowler -- cricket's pitcher -- can go the 
whole way, so wickets usually are spread among three or four 
players on each team. 
</P>
<P>
	India used four bowlers, but Kumble swept Pakistan himself. A  
leg-spinner, whose throw curves away from a batter, Kumble retired 
three Pakistani opponents without allowing a run and needed just 
three throws to take his third and fourth wickets. Overall, he 
threw 159 times, retiring the final four batters with just 16 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is undoubtedly one of the best bowling performances I've  
ever seen,'' India captain Mohammed Azharuddin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory helped India split the two-test series, the first  
played in this country against Pakistan in 12 years. Pakistan won 
the first test in Madras earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In this cricket-mad subcontinent, political rivalries have kept  
the Indian and Pakistani teams apart -- their armies have fought 
three wars since the independent nations were carved out of one 
British colony 51 years ago.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Statements on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors at President Clinton's  
impeachment trial asked Senate leaders today to issue subpoenas for 
three people who have challenged the testimony of White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new evidence indicates that Sidney Blumenthal may have  
testified falsely before the Senate,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, the chief 
prosecutor, wrote Senate leaders. He said the possible falsehood 
included Blumenthal's claim that he had ``never told any reporters 
the false story that the president relayed to him that Monica 
Lewinsky was ``a stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has denied giving false testimony when he was  
questioned under oath last week by lawyers involved in Clinton's 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife have both  
signed sworn affidavits saying that Blumenthal, at a lunch in March 
1998, had referred to Ms. Lewinsky in those terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A third person, reporter Scott Armstrong, said in an affidavit  
released today that Hitchens told him of the conversation with 
Blumenthal, including the ``stalker'' reference. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's letter came as senators in both parties called for a  
Justice Department probe into Blumenthal's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	It also came after Democratic Leader Tom Daschle blocked a move  
by Majority Leader Trent Lott to place the affidavits of Hitchens 
and his wife, Carol Blue, into the Senate record. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Justice Department, spokesman Myron Marlin said, ``We've  
received no formal referral from Congress and at this point only 
know what we've read in the newspapers. It is not common to open an 
investigation of alleged perjury before Congress without first 
receiving a formal referral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the department's criminal division were informally  
looking over the news reports to see if there was even something 
they would consider investigating, according to one official who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal has denied feeding the news media President Clinton's  
account last January that Monica Lewinsky had told the president 
she was known as ``the stalker'' and that she made a sexual demand 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	In affidavits to House managers, Hitchens and his wife said  
Blumenthal told them March 19 that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the apparent conflict between the Hitchens' affidavits  
and Blumenthal's testimony, ``I know it is going to be referred to 
the Justice Department, and that's where it should be,'' said Sen. 
Carl Levin, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have contended that Clinton passed on false,  
derogatory information about Ms. Lewinsky so that Blumenthal would 
repeat the comments to a grand jury and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday that ``when I  
saw'' Blumenthal ``for the first time since the scandal broke, 
that's what he said to me and to my wife and has said to many other 
people, that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said, ``I would  
hope that he isn't lying. I think if he is, it's serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were just as adamant, with Sen. Olympia Snowe of  
Maine saying ``certainly the truth should be uncovered with respect 
to whether or not Sidney Blumenthal told the truth under oath.'' 
Added Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas: ``We will insist that we have an 
expedited consideration by the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Hitchens, Blumenthal issued a statement Sunday  
that focused on a part of his testimony in which he said he spoke 
of Ms. Lewinsky to ``friends.'' That category, he said, included 
Hitchens, a freelance writer for Vanity Fair and The Nation 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never a source for any story about Monica Lewinsky's  
personal life,'' Blumenthal said in the statement issued through 
his lawyer, William McDaniel. ``I did not reveal what the president 
told me to any reporter. As I testified to the Senate, I talked 
every day about the stories in the news concerning Miss Lewinsky to 
my friends and family, just as everyone else is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I do not recall the luncheon with my then-friend of 15  
years Christopher Hitchens and his wife, the notion that I was 
trying to plant a story with this rabid anti-Clinton friend is 
absurd. My wife and I are saddened that Christopher has chosen to 
end our friendship in this meaningless way,'' the statement added.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mayor Announces Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some good news from the mayor of the nation's  
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia government recorded a $445 million  
budget surplus in fiscal year 1998, wiping out an accumulated 
deficit of $332 million created by years of overspending, Mayor 
Anthony Williams said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This city, I believe, has gone farther and faster in a  
financial recovery, you can argue, than any other American city 
similarly situated,'' Williams said, touting the second annual 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who replaced Marion Barry in January and was the  
city's former chief financial officer, attributed the surplus to 
good fiscal management and an overall sound economy. He credited 
belt tightening at most city agencies and applauded nonprofit 
agencies and other ``recipients of services who took a big whack to 
see that this would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The district hovered near bankruptcy in 1995, prompting Congress  
to install the presidentially appointed District of Columbia 
Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to 
oversee city finances. The panel is to remain in place until the 
city balances four consecutive budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal year 1997, the surplus was $186 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the trend, Williams said, ``No one would say we're out  
of the woods yet.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Look Towards End of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They fiddled with pens. They clasped and  
unclasped hands. They fidgeted in their seats and stood to stretch. 
Mostly, senators eagerly looked forward to finishing the 
impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told reporters that senators were  
yearning for the three-day President's Day break this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood is, `This is it, folks,''' Harkin said during a  
recess in Monday's closing arguments. ``This is the final day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All but two of the 100 senators attended Monday's session, the  
last chance for White House attorneys and the self-styled ``13 
angry men'' from the House to plead their cases. Sens. Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., were away, attending the 
funeral of Jordan's King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	With the outcome all but certain to be acquittal for Clinton, it  
was like watching a baseball team playing out the string with no 
chance to win the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball analogy was aptly noted by White House counsel  
Charles Ruff, who paraphrased New York Yankee Hall of Famer Yogi 
Berra to capture the day's mood: 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone well beyond Yogi Berra land to deja vu all over  
again and all over again and all over again,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	But like the 13 House managers, Ruff felt compelled to make a  
lengthy presentation restating much of what had already been said 
over the trial's four weeks. Paraphrasing a Chicago Cubs Hall of 
Famer, Ruff noted the ``special pleasure'' of reviewing the case 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Or as Ernie Banks might have said, `It's such a nice day,  
let's play two,''' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Things perked up most when Ruff played six excerpts of Monica  
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony, one clip of Vernon Jordan's and 
one of Clinton's. And the attorney distributed a 14-page packet of 
written exhibits that most senators were observed thumbing through 
during his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the managers began their remarks with apologies for  
forcing the senators to sit through more arguments. ``You've all 
paid extraordinary attention, and for that I thank you,'' said Rep. 
Chris Cannon, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the senators appeared to make a serious  
effort at paying attention on this last day of arguments even 
though there was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
	Several, notably Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.,  
and Orrin Hatch R-Utah, sat listening carefully to the lawyers, 
hands folded, expressionless. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and John McCain,  
R-Ariz., frequently rubbed their eyes or shifted uncomfortably in 
their chairs. Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., repeatedly got up to 
stand against a pale blue wall. Still others, like Republican 
Olympia Snowe of Maine, spent their time reading and busily 
scribbling notes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who mentioned media  
accounts calling the managers the ``13 angry men,'' but he said 
they were angry not at Clinton but at the president's alleged 
violations of the Constitution. Yet some of the managers seemed 
resigned to the case's probable fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our role comes to a screeching halt today,'' said Rep. George  
Gekas, R-Pa. ``There is no question of winning or losing. This is a 
case to follow the constitutional process and live with the 
result.''

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Gives Magazine Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Observing the 10th anniversary of the Iranian  
``fatwa'' condemning him for blasphemous writings, British author 
Salman Rushie says the death threat has given him a stronger 
commitment to literary freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	``A writer's injuries are his strengths, and from his wounds  
will flow his sweetest, most startling dreams,'' Rushdie wrote in a 
brief essay in the Feb. 15 issue of the New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The title, ``My Unfunny Valentine,'' refers to the date -- Feb.  
14, 1989 -- on which Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told Muslims 
worldwide it was their duty to kill Rushdie for having insulted 
Islam in his 1988 novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a $2.5 million price on his head, Rushdie spent most of the  
next 10 years in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life can be harsh, and for a decade St. Valentine's Day has  
reminded me of that harshness,'' he says. ``But these dark 
anniversaries of the appalling valentine I was sent in 1989 have 
also been times to reflect on the countervailing value of love... 
At the center of my life, of my new work, of my future plans, I now 
find nothing else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian government has since distanced itself from the death  
decree.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Strong Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro Monday as the  
new European currency gained strength on reports that Germany's 
unemployment figures had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's strength against the yen also helped the dollar rise  
against the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 114.43  
Japanese yen, up from 113.20 late Friday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1318, up from $1.1260.	   Investors bought euros and shed dollars and yen amid reports 
that government figures showed ``a sharp decline in the level of 
unemployment'' in Germany, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign 
Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave the euro support against the dollar and the yen,''  
Gilmore said. Before the euro rose, however, the European currency 
hit $1.1218, its lowest level against the dollar since it began 
trading on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar also gained strength against the yen as Japanese  
officials squabbled about rising yields on long-term government 
bonds that have helped the yen strengthen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa urged Japan's  
central bank to consider curbing rising long-term bond rates. But 
on Monday, a Bank of Japan policy board member indicated he was 
against further monetary easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields subsequently fell Monday, helping the dollar rise  
against the yen and allowing Tokyo stocks to ascend for the first 
time in six sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A feeling of relief spread in the market following the fall in  
interest rates and the weaker yen,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general 
manager at Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4151 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4220, and 1.4811 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4893. The British 
pound rose to $1.6399 from $1.6329. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7280 German 
marks, down from 1.7370; 5.7971 French francs, down from 5.8241; 
and 1,709.40 Italian lire, down from 1,718.21.

<HEADLINE> Seaver Returns to Shea Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Back at Shea Stadium for the first time in 11  
years, Tom Seaver could have a tougher time in the booth than he 
ever had on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, the only New York Mets player to have his number retired  
by the team, was introduced Monday as the club's TV analyst -- 
replacing fan favorite Tim McCarver. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who called Mets games for the past 16 years, is also  
Fox's lead baseball analyst and is widely regarded as one of the 
best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timmy leaving has stirred the pot and rightfully so,'' Seaver  
said. ``He was a darned good broadcaster. It was a big deal because 
the guy's very well-respected in his industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver will broadcast about 50 games for WPIX, the team's new TV  
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver made his first visit back to Shea on Monday since ``Tom  
Seaver Day'' in 1988. He played more than 11 seasons for the Mets, 
winning three Cy Young Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never invited,'' Seaver said about his longtime absence.  
``The relationship I had here has been rocky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver was upset with the organization and former chairman M.  
Donald Grant after being traded in 1977 during a contract dispute. 
Grant died last year and Seaver has been in discussions the past 
four months about returning to the organization in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be forever etched in New York City and forever etched  
with the Mets,'' Seaver said after being presented with his retired 
No. 41 jersey. ``It's been a long road to get here and to try and 
help this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting won't be Seaver's lone contribution to his former  
team. He'll also be an employee of the team, working with the 
marketing department and also helping instruct some of the younger 
pitchers in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver doesn't see any difficulty remaining objective  
broadcasting games even though he'll work for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel capable of handling both roles?,'' Seaver said.  
``Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is so obvious that you can't hide mistakes and you  
can't hide when you do things well. ... the one thing that I will 
be critical of is guys that have a lack of effort and 
preparation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets denied that McCarver was let go because he was too  
critical of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom's a smart guy and it's not my problem any more,'' McCarver  
said when asked if Seaver's task in the booth would be difficult. 
``He's a smart guy and is a friend of mine and I wish him well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcaster for the New York Yankees from 1989-93, Seaver has  
also worked for ABC and NBC. He will likely be teamed with Gary 
Thorne and sometimes Ralph Kiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver said that he wasn't interested in taking the broadcast  
position with the Mets unless he was able to help the younger 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told (general manager) Steve Phillips that if I do come  
back, I want to be involved in the pitching. It's something I love 
and I think it would be a detriment to the organization if I wasn't 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for the young players, good for me and very  
good for baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Copper Futures Post Big Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Copper futures posted their biggest gains in four months Monday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid hopes that a strong U.S. 
economy and signs of recovery in Asia will boost demand for the 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, energy futures slumped as above-normal  
temperatures continued to dim the demand picture, while cocoa 
slumped to a two-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures jumped 3 percent in heavy follow-through buying  
to a rally that began late last week amid signs of surprisingly 
resilience in the domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said the latest good news came Friday, when  
the Labor Department announced employers added more jobs than 
expected in January. Analysts said more jobs would mean more 
spending and more demand for copper in areas such as electronics 
and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting prices were signs that at least some Asian  
nations are starting to see a partial recovery from the economic 
turbulence that rocked the region last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper for March delivery rose 1.85 cents to 68.45 cents a  
pound, its highest level since early December. Prices have risen 
more than 7 percent in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products slumped on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, dragged lower by forecasts for above-normal temperatures 
in the Northeast and Midwest with the heating oil season quickly 
coming to a close. Those two regions account for most of the 
nation's demand for heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	March crude fell 13 cents to $11.67 a barrel; March heating oil  
fell 0.52 cent to 30.28 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline 
fell 0.21 cent to 34.78 cents a gallon. Natural gas futures inched 
higher in listless trading, rising 1.8 cents to $1.818 for each 
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa fell to its lowest price in more than two years on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York. Cocoa, used in making 
chocolate and other candies, usually is in peak demand in the 
summer time, as manufacturers gear up for making Halloween and 
Easter confections. March cocoa fell $20 to $1,286 a metric ton, 
the lowest since early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Regains Top Spot in Rankings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Martina Hingis regained the world's No. 1  
tennis ranking 17 weeks after she lost it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis earned the top spot during her victory at the Pan Pacific  
Open in Tokyo on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her semifinal win over No. 3 Jana Novotna on Saturday assured  
the 18-year-old Hingis of moving up from No. 2 after top-ranked 
Lindsay Davenport was beaten by Amanda Coetzer in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	In rankings released by the WTA on Monday, Hingis had 5,722  
points. Davenport was No. 2 with 5,547, followed by Novotna, Monica 
Seles, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Venus Williams, Steffi Graf, Mary 
Pierce, Patty Schnyder and Nathalie Tauziat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis was No. 1 from March 31, 1997, to Oct. 11, 1998, becoming  
the youngest ever top-ranked player since the computer rankings 
began in 1975. When Hingis first became No. 1, she was 16 years, 6 
months, 1 day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis has won 14 of 15 matches this year, including the  
season's first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open, and her 
last 12 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, she lost her No. 1 ranking when she went six months  
without winning a title. During that same span, Davenport won six 
titles, including her first Grand Slam singles championship at the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 16 when I first got the No. 1 ranking,'' Hingis said.  
``I just hope I can now hold onto it longer, maybe as long as I 
play tennis.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Nears Decision on 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole, at the brink of  
launching a presidential campaign, said Monday night that the 
presidency has been tarnished under Bill Clinton and America needs 
a leader ``with the integrity to inspire trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run, this will be an important reason why: Because the  
United States of America deserves a government worthy of her 
people,'' the former American Red Cross president told 1,200 people 
at a local Chamber of Commerce event. 
</P>
<P>
	Inching closer to running, Mrs. Dole confirmed Monday night that  
she has raised money from supporters. Advisers said checks made out 
to ``Elizabeth Dole exploratory committee'' are being deposited to 
defray expenses, but she has not officially filed with the Federal 
Election Commission and they did not know how much Mrs. Dole has 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people calling to volunteer and there is  
some money coming in,'' she told reporters before her address. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate heard closing arguments in Clinton's impeachment  
trial, Mrs. Dole was in this first-in-the-nation primary state 
telling voters that ``confidence in our leaders is shaky.'' She 
declared: ``If our leaders are not worthy, we have the power to 
elect leaders who are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she did not mention the president by name, advisers said  
the speech drew a clear contrast between Clinton's character and 
what Mrs. Dole thinks Americans should expect of their next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Bob Dole, warned voters of a ``sleaze factor in the  
White House'' late in his failed 1996 campaign. ``The White House 
should be a place of public trust, not public suspicion,'' Dole 
said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading her text word-for-word, Mrs. Dole's delivery was often  
flat but she recieved polite applause at least 16 times during the 
45-minute speech -- and good reviews afterward. Her comments about 
schools and values, not the veiled references to Clinton, drew the 
most praise as listeners predicted she would run as a GOP moderate. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got a better reception than Bob Dole ever did,'' said  
Chris Stawasz. ``I think she is not necessarily a good speaker, but 
I like what she said,'' said Ghee Fry, an independent voter from 
Amherst, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Her two-day trip, which ends with a private breakfast Tuesday,  
was designed to allow Mrs. Dole to trace the broad themes of a 
likely presidential campaign -- integrity, education, drug abuse and 
national security -- without formally entering the race or 
addressing such hot-button issues as abortion and affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	She is almost certain to become a candidate, said advisers, who  
spoke on condition of anonymity. She plans to travel to Iowa next 
week, hire campaign staff as early as this week and form an 
exploratory committee in the near future, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech gave the first hint of her plans to position herself  
as a moderating figure in the GOP, calling for civility in politics 
and compassion in government. ``Reagan conservatism wore a smile 
and it was contagious,'' said Mrs. Dole, who served in Ronald 
Reagan's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it's no longer enough to ask, as Reagan did: Are you  
better off than you were four years ago? ``What we should be asking 
is -- Are WE better?'' Are families stronger, schools better, taxes 
lower and the country safer? she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conservatives should never hesitate to speak out against the  
unregulated unadulterated pursuit of cash, if it leads to the 
coarsening of our culture, to the pollution of the airwaves or the 
pollution of the air,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential GOP rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has labeled  
his brand of politics ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, served in the Cabinets of Presidents Reagan and  
Bush after starting in politics in the Democratic administration of 
President Johnson. A key player in her husband's presidential 
races, Mrs. Dole fought for and secured full campaign staffs and 
proved to be a tireless, disciplined and dynamic campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush tied down to Austin, Texas, for a legislative session,  
Mrs. Dole has emerged as the hottest commodity in the fledgling 
2000 campaign. She hopes to be a rare Republican figure who 
combines high name recognition and the potential to bridge the gap 
between religious and economic conservatives, with the added bonus 
of being a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The core of her speech was a simple promise: If she ran and won,  
she would bring honor to the White House. It is a theme embraced by 
nearly every GOP candidate and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, 
a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a good and great nation, and we must demand a  
government with the integrity to inspire trust and the 
straightforward strength to keep us free,'' she said. ``At a time 
when the presidency has been tarnished ... our confidence in our 
leaders is shaky. But we can rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls in the last month suggest that she and Bush, the son of  
former President Bush, would be front-runners for the GOP 
presidential nomination. Both hold slight polling edges over Vice 
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement is tempered by some hard realities. Despite  
serving as secretary of labor and transportation, Mrs. Dole has 
never sought elective office and she has never laid out her own set 
of public policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her record at Red Cross has already been called into question,  
with some critics complaining that she politicized the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And she has already disappointed some New Hampshire Republicans  
by inviting business leaders, including Democratic donors, to 
Tuesday's breakfast and not party regulars.

<HEADLINE> Text of Rep. Hyde's Closing Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of closing remarks by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., on Monday in  
the impeachment trial of President Clinton, as transcribed by 
Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Chief Justice, learned counsel, and the Senate, we are  
blessedly coming to the end of this melancholy procedure, but 
before we gather up our papers and return to the obscurity from 
whence we came, permit please a few final remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	First of all, I want to thank the chief justice not only for his  
patience and his perseverance, but for the aura of dignity that he 
has lent to these proceedings, and it has been a great thrill 
really to be here in his company as well as in the company of you 
distinguished senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, I want to compliment the president's counsel. They  
have conducted themselves in the most professional way. They have 
made the most of a poor case, in my opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excuse me. There's an old Italian saying, and it has nothing to  
do with the lawyers, but to your case. Says: You may dress the 
shepherd in silk; he will still smell of the goat. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of you are great lawyers and it's been an adventure  
being with you. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, the legal profession, like politics, is ridiculed  
pretty much, and every lawyer feels that and understands the 
importance of the rule of law -- to establish justice, to maintain 
the rights of mankind, to defend the helpless and the oppressed, to 
protect innocents, to punish guilt. These are duties which 
challenge the best powers of man's intellect and the noblest 
qualities of the human heart. We are here to defend that bulwark of 
our liberty, the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the House managers, I want to tell you and our  
extraordinary staff how proud I am of your service. For myself, I 
cannot find the words to adequately express how I feel. I must use 
the inaudible language of the heart. I've gone through it all by 
your side, the media condemnations, the patronizing editorials, the 
hate mail, the insults hurled in public, the attempts at 
intimidation, the death threats, and even the disapproval of our 
colleagues, which cuts the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, all a congressman ever gets to take with him when he  
leaves this building is the esteem of his colleagues and his 
constituents. We've risked that for a principle and for our duty as 
we've seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	In speaking to my managers of whom I am terminally proud, I can  
borrow the words of Shakespeare's Henry V, as he addressed his 
little army of longbowmen at the Battle of Agincourt, and he said: 
``We few -- we happy few; we band of brothers. For he who sheds his 
blood with me shall be my brother. And gentlemen in England abed 
will curse the fact that they are not here, and hold their manhood 
cheap when any speaks who fought with us on St. Crispin's Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the juror judges, you distinguished senators, it's always  
a victory for democracy when its elected representatives do their 
duty no matter how difficult and unpleasant, and we thank you for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Please don't misconstrue our fervor for our cause to any lack of  
respect or appreciation for your high office. But our most 
formidable opponent has not been opposing counsel nor any political 
party. It's been the cynicism -- the widespread conviction that all 
politics and all politicians are by definition corrupt and venal. 
That cynicism is an acid eating away at the vital organs of 
American public life. It is a clear and present danger because it 
blinds us to the nobility and the fragility of being a 
self-governing people. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the several questions that needs an answer is whether  
your vote on conviction lessens or enlarges that cynicism. Nothing 
begets cynicism like the double standard -- one rule for the popular 
and the powerful and another for the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most interesting things in this trial was the  
testimony of the president's good friend, the former Senator from 
Arkansas. He did his persuasive best to maintain the confusion that 
this is all about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course it's useful for the defense to misdirect our focus  
toward everyone concedes our private acts and it's none of our 
business, but if you care to read the articles of impeachment, you 
won't find any complaints about private, sexual misconduct. You 
will find charges of perjury and obstruction of justice which are 
public acts and federal crimes, especially when committed by the 
one person duty bound to faithfully execute the laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Infidelity is private and non-criminal. Perjury and obstruction  
are public and criminal. The deliberate focus on what is not an 
issue here is the defense lawyer's tactic and nothing more. This 
entire saga has been a theater of distraction and misdirection. 
Time on the defense tactics when the law and facts get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	One phrase you have not heard the defense pronounce is the  
``sanctity of the oath,'' but this case deeply involves the 
efficacy, the meaning and the enforceability of the oath. The 
president's defenders stay away from the word ``lie'' preferring 
``mislead'' or ``deceived,'' but they shrink from the phrase 
``sanctity of the oath,'' fearing it as one might a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a visibility factor in the president's public acts, and  
those which betray a trust or reveal contempt for the law are hard 
to sweep under the rug, or under the bed for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	They reverberate -- they ricochet all over the land and provide  
the worst possible example for our young people. As that third 
grader from Chicago wrote to me: ``If you can't believe the 
president, who can you believe?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of young people, in 1946 a British playwright, Terence  
Rattigan wrote a play based on a true experience that happened in 
England in 1910. The play was called ``The Winslow Boy.'' And the 
story, as I say a true story, involved a young 13-year-old lad who 
was kicked out of the royal naval college for having forged 
somebody else's signature on a postal money order. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he claimed he was innocent, but he was summarily  
dismissed and his family of very modest means couldn't afford legal 
counsel, and it was a very desperate situation. Sir Edward Carson 
(phonetic), the best lawyer of his time -- barrister I suppose -- got 
interested in the case and took it on pro bono, and lost all the 
way through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he had no other place to go, but he dug up an ancient  
remedy in England called ``petition of right.'' You ask the king 
for relief. And so Carson wrote out five pages of reasons why a 
petition of right should be granted. And lo and behold, it got past 
the attorney general and got to the king. The king read it, agreed 
with it, and wrote across the front of the petition: ``Let right be 
done -- Edward VII.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And I have always been moved by that phrase. I saw the movie, I  
saw the play, and I have the book, and I am still moved by that 
phase ``let right be done.'' I hope when you finally vote that will 
move you, too. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some interesting parallels to our cause here today.  
This Senate chamber is our version of the House of Lords, and while 
we managers cannot claim to represent that 13-year-old Winslow boy, 
we speak for a lot of young people who look to us to set an 
example. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Seligman last Saturday said we want to win too badly. This  
surprised me, because none of the managers has committed perjury, 
nor obstructed justice, nor claimed false privileges. None has 
hidden evidence under anyone's bed, nor encouraged false testimony 
before the grand jury. That's what you do if you want to win too 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe it was Saul Bellow who once said, ``A great deal of  
intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for 
illusion is great.'' And those words characterize the defense in 
this case -- the need for illusion is great. 
</P>
<P>
	I doubt there are many people on the planet who doubt the  
president has repeatedly lied under oath and has obstructed 
justice. The defense spent a lot of time picking lint. There is a 
saying in Equity, I believe, that equity will not stoop to pick up 
pins. But that was their case. So the real issue doesn't concern 
the facts, the stubborn facts, as the defense is fond of saying, 
but what to do about them. 
</P>
<P>
	I am still dumbfounded about the drafts of the censures that are  
circulating. We aren't half as tough on the president in our 
impeachment articles as this draft is that was printed in the New 
York Times. And inappropriate relationship with a subordinate 
employee in the White House which was shameless, reckless and 
indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
	I have a problem with that. It seems they're talking about  
private acts of consensual sexual misconduct, which are really none 
of our business. But that's the lead-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they say the president deliberately misled and deceived the  
American people and officials in all branches of the United States 
government. This is not a Republican document. This is coming from 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	The president gave false or misleading testimony and impeded  
discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings. Isn't that another 
way of saying obstruction of justice and perjury? The president's 
conduct demeans the office of the president as well as the 
president himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Future generations of Americans must know that such behavior is  
not only unacceptable, but bears grave consequences, including loss 
of integrity, trust, and respect -- but not loss of job. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct has brought shame  
and dishonor to himself and to the office of the president; whereas 
he has violated the trust of the American people, see Hamilton 
Federalist Number 65, and he should be condemned in the strongest 
terms. Well, the next-to-the-strongest terms -- the strongest terms 
would remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, do you really cleanse the office as provided in the  
Constitution? Or do you use the air-wick of a censure resolution? 
Because any censure resolution, to be meaningful, has to punish the 
president -- if only his reputation. And how do you deal with the 
laws of bill of attainder? How do you deal with the separation of 
powers? What kind of a precedent are you setting? 
</P>
<P>
	We all claim to revere the Constitution, but a censure is  
something that is a device, a way of avoiding the harsh 
constitutional option, and it's the only one you have, either up or 
down on impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	That of course is your judgment and I am offering my views for  
what they're worth. Once in a while I do worry about the future. I 
wonder if after this culture war is over that we're engaged in, if 
an America will survive that's worth fighting to defend. People 
won't risk their lives for the UN or over the Dow Jones averages, 
but I wonder in future generations whether there'll be enough 
vitality left in duty honoring country to excite our children and 
grandchildren to defend America. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no denying the fact what you decide, it will have a  
profound effect on our culture as well as on our politics. A 
failure to convict will make a statement that lying under oath, 
while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious. 
Perhaps we can explain this to those currently in prison for 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but  
only if you are the president. Wherever and whenever you avert your 
eyes from a wrong, from an injustice, you become a part of the 
problem. On the subject of civil rights, it's my belief this issue 
doesn't belong to anyone. It belongs to everyone. It certainly 
belongs to those who have suffered invidious discrimination and one 
would have to be catatonic not to know that the struggle to keep 
alive equal protection of the law never ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The mortal enemy of equal justice is the double standard and if  
we permit a double standard, even for the president, we do no favor 
to the cause of human rights. It's been said that America has 
nothing to fear from this president on the subject of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	I doubt Paula Jones would subscribe to that endorsement. If you  
agree that perjury and obstruction of justice have been committed, 
and yet you vote down the conviction, you're expending and 
expanding the boundaries of permissible presidential conduct. 
You're saying a perjurer and an obstructer of justice can be 
president in the face of no less than three precedents for 
conviction of federal judges for perjury. You shred those 
precedents and you raise the most serious questions of whether the 
president is in fact subject to the law, or whether we are 
beginning a restoration of the divine rights of kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues we're concerned with have consequences far into the  
future, because the real damage is not to the individuals involved, 
but to the American system of justice and especially the principle 
that no one is above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Gibbon wrote his magisterial ``Decline and Fall of the  
Roman Empire'' in the late 18th century. In fact, the first volume 
was issued in 1776. In his work, he discusses an emperor named 
Septimus Severus who died in 211 A.D. after ruling 18 years. And 
here's what Gibbon wrote about the emperor: ``Severus promised only 
to betray; he flattered only to ruin; and however he might 
occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties, his conscience, 
obsequious to his interest, always released him from the 
inconvenient obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I guess those who believe history repeats itself are really onto  
something. Horace Mann said: ``You should be ashamed to die unless 
you have achieved some victory for humanity.'' To the House 
managers, I say your devotion to duty and the Constitution has set 
an example that is a victory for humanity. Charles de Gaulle once 
said France would not be true to herself if she wasn't engaged in 
some great enterprise. That's true of us all. We spend our short 
lives as consumers, space occupiers, clock watchers, spectators -- 
or in the service of some great enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe being a senator, being a congressman, and struggling  
with all our might for equal justice for all is a great enterprise. 
It's our great enterprise. And to my House managers, your great 
enterprise was not to speak truth to power, but to shout it. 
</P>
<P>
	And now let us all take our place in history on the side of  
honor, and oh yes, let right be done. 
</P>
<P>
	I yield back my time.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Give Pickens Franchise Tag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Bengals on Monday designated  
wide receiver Carl Pickens, the team's all-time leading receiver, 
as the franchise player to protect against losing him to 
unrestricted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven losing seasons, Pickens would consider sitting out  
the 1999 season if the Bengals try to keep him from joining another 
team, his agent, Steve Zucker, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But in accordance with the NFL's labor agreement with the  
players' union, the Bengals tendered Pickens a one-year contract 
offer at a salary equaling the 1998 average of the league's five 
highest-paid wide receivers. That would be in the range of $4 
million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving Pickens the franchise player designation recognizes his  
achievements and protects the Bengals, team president Mike Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a club's right, agreed to by the players' union, and it  
protects us against the chance of losing one top player to 
unrestricted free agency,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	A franchise player has the options of accepting the tender  
offer, negotiating a different agreement with the club or 
negotiating with other teams. The Bengals would have the right to 
keep Pickens by matching another club's offer for him. If the 
Bengals decline to match the offer, the team signing him would have 
to compensate Cincinnati with its first-round draft choice 
opportunities in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, a second-round draft choice in 1992 from Tennessee,  
turns 30 in March.

<HEADLINE> Poor Economy Hurting Fur Trappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- Raymond Whitaker is an old-time trapper,  
from the top of his otter hat to the trim of his coyote coat. 
</P>
<P>
	But when he dropped off a stack of fox and beaver pelts for sale  
recently, his first words to the trader could have come from a 
buttoned-down international banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``How's the ruble?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The 75-year-old trapper already knew the answer: not good.  
Whitaker has seen the devalued Russian currency cut deeply into the 
worldwide demand for fur -- sending raw fur prices tumbling in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Trader David Hicks was able to give only paltry prices for  
Whitaker's pelts that day. Likewise, Hicks is fielding fewer calls 
from brokers seeking fur. He figures to get bottom dollar for the 
assorted fox, fisher, muskrat and raccoon pelts stocked in his 
rural shop hard on the Vermont border. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the toughest years I've seen,'' Hicks said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's a common lament in the fur trade, where prices fetched for  
animals trapped in New York's backwoods are sensitive to economic 
wobbles worldwide. Financial turmoil in Russia and Asia hurts the 
fur business here because it puts crimps in the international 
pipelines for furs. For example, pelts of animals trapped stateside 
are routinely routed through Canada, Greece and South Korea before 
ending up as far afield as China. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruble's devaluation this past year has particularly hurt  
since Russians account for the lion's share of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were kind of the driving force in the fur market,'' said  
trapper Toby Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	With demand slumping, trappers are routinely fetching as low as  
$2 for muskrat skins that went for $6 just a few years ago; raccoon 
skins have dropped from about $11 to as low as $5 to $8 in the same 
period. A female fisher at one time could bring $250, now they can 
go for under $20. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of ranch-raised mink, sort of the gold standard of  
fur, is reportedly off about 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Depressed prices are not limited to New York -- Minnesota,  
Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are all bigger trapping states 
with the same problems. But fur is big business in New York state, 
from swanky retail stores in Manhattan to solitary trappers 
prowling upstate forests. 
</P>
<P>
	There are about 8,600 licensed trappers in New York state.  
Raccoons, muskrat and beaver are their prime quarry, although mink, 
coyote and foxes are also taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Trappers still follow age-old scouting techniques, although they  
now have any number of modern traps available, from those that 
restrain animals to other spring-loaded devices that bring quick 
death. Following centuries-old procedures, trappers carefully skin 
the animal with a minimum of cuts and, depending on the species, 
might turn the hides inside out to protect the precious fur. 
</P>
<P>
	Trappers will sell their wares at auction or to traders like  
Hicks, who this year keeps a small menagerie in his shop loft of 
foxes on hangers and inside-out raccoons stacked on the floor along 
with beaver, fisher and muskrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually this time of year, this place is full,'' he said,  
walking through the chilly loft. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of trappers, like Whitaker, are hobbyists making  
some money on the side. Professional trappers like Edwards 
generally have other means of income, such as logging. Many 
trappers also do ``nuisance work,'' killing unwanted moles, gophers 
and the like. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Hicks rounds out his trading business with guns, skins and  
ginseng -- a root thought to have medicinal properties that trappers 
sometimes collect on their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things where one year can be good and the  
next year can be in the toilet,'' Edwards explained. ``The fur 
business is nothing you can count on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fur is a commodity as prone to fluctuations as wheat or pork  
bellies. For instance, this year the demand for fur trim worldwide 
was up, but the warm spell in early winter across much of the 
country put a dent in coat sales. As Stephen Greene of the National 
Trappers Association puts it: ``We follow fashion trends and 
weather trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With demand down so much, some trappers are acting like wily  
stockholders in a bear market, stashing their skins in freezers and 
hoping to sell down the road at higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Few expect furs to regain the popularity they had in the late  
'70s. After all, dress codes are more casual these days, 
alternatives to fur abound from leather to Thinsulate and organized 
anti-fur campaigns have continued since the '80's. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not lost on fur traders that the strong domestic  
economy has helped fur sales in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan fur broker Zachary Rosenfeld said he received a  
substantial order last month from Russia, where fur is still a 
necessity despite hard times. Also, the recent deep freeze across 
the United States is being warmly welcomed by many in the fur 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as it got cold, I started getting busy,'' Rosenfeld  
said.

<HEADLINE> Man, Dog Survive 11 Days in Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEAVENWORTH, Wash. (AP) -- Boots sticking out of the snow led  
rescuers to a couple who had been missing 11 days since they got 
lost on a snowmobile trek. 
</P>
<P>
	George Back, 50, was hallucinating but alive Sunday when found  
beside his two yapping Norfolk terriers. Back's wife, Diane M. 
McManus, 44, was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were novices,'' said rescuer Darrell Brunner, co-owner of  
Brunner's Lodge on Fish Lake. ``They just got turned around and a 
big snowstorm came in and snowed 3 feet that night. If you don't 
know your way, it's easy to get turned around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back and his wife had rented two snowmobiles Jan. 27 near Fish  
Lake, about 80 miles east of Seattle. They tucked the dogs inside 
their snow suits for what they expected to be a two-hour outing, 
and then the storm hit. 
</P>
<P>
	An air and ground search for the couple was called off on Jan.  
29. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Todd, Brunner and their friends were on their own  
snowmobile trek about 10 miles from Cascade Hideway when they 
spotted Back's booted feet sticking out of a hole he had formed in 
the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in and out of it,'' Brunner said. ``He thought he had  
been there six months and was afraid we were going to leave him. 
</P>
<P>
	``And those little teeny dogs were no bigger than a rat, but I  
think they helped save his life. They stayed right with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say how he thought the dogs helped Back.  
</P>
<P>
	Back, of Kelso, was listed in serious condition this morning at  
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, about 80 miles to the west, 
with possible frostbite on both feet, said a nursing supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Duke Back Atop AP Men's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- It took Duke eight weeks to reclaim No. 1.  
It took Auburn 40 years to climb back to the top rungs in The 
Associated Press college basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers this week are No. 3, their highest ranking since one  
week at No. 2 in February 1959, and it has coach Cliff Ellis 
anything but giddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for the fans, but it's dangerous for us,'' Ellis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn enjoyed success during the 1980s with stars such as  
Charles Barkley and Chuck Person, but it never has been ranked No. 
1. Ellis, now in his fifth year at Auburn, has the Tigers (22-1) 
close to the top spot with stars such as Chris Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis is trying to quiet any frenzy over the No. 3 ranking.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of good teams in the country,'' he said. ``I  
think our team is one. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the year, you want to be as high as you can, but  
we have a ways to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, which finished 16-14 last season, was not expected to be  
a Top 10 team this year. But with the addition of Porter, a 
6-foot-7 forward who played at a junior college the past two 
seasons, the Tigers have lost only at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging young players like 6-7 freshman Mike McGadney, who  
became a starter when Porter was suspended for three games because 
of a team rule violation, give Ellis bench strength. That blends 
with the experience of players like 6-5 senior forward Bryant 
Smith, who led Auburn in scoring last season. 
</P>
<P>
	For perennially powerful Duke, (23-1) the No. 1 ranking is not  
uncommon. The Blue Devils were No. 1 in the preseason poll and for 
the first two weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut took over the top spot when Duke lost to Cincinnati  
in the championship game of the Great Alaska Shootout. But after 
eight weeks -- and 18 straight victories -- the Blue Devils were back 
atop the rankings after Connecticut (20-1) lost to Syracuse 59-42. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which beat Maryland by 18 points, then rallied to defeat  
Georgia Tech, received 59 first-place votes and 1,763 points from 
the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut got 12 No. 1 votes and 1,712 points. The Huskies'  
loss came with leading scorer Richard Hamilton and leading 
rebounder Jake Voskuhl both out with injuries. But Connecticut 
rebounded with a 70-59 victory at Stanford, this time without 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which lost 61-60 to DePaul in overtime on a  
controversial call by an official, dropped one spot to fourth. 
Michigan State, the only Top Ten team besides Duke and Auburn not 
to lose last week, jumped from eighth to No. 5 and was followed by 
Stanford, Maryland, Kentucky, UCLA and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky, which lost road games to Florida and Alabama, dropped  
three spots to No. 8. That's the Wildcats' lowest ranking of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's dropped two places to lead the Second Ten, followed  
by North Carolina, Ohio State, Utah, Wisconsin, Miami, Indiana, 
Syracuse, Iowa and College of Charleston, which also has an 18-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five ranked teams were Purdue, Minnesota, Florida,  
Kansas and New Mexico.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Comet Chaser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the next seven years, the  
mission of the Stardust spacecraft is to chase a comet, for the 
grand goal of collecting less than a thimble's worth of comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	While the size of the catch may seem minute, if successfully  
captured, the tiny sample could provide scientists with fascinating 
information about the origins of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comets can tell us about the history of the early solar system  
and the early history perhaps of our own Earth,'' explained the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory's Martha Hanner, an astronomer taking part in 
the historic Stardust mission. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust spacecraft began its 3 billion-mile journey  
Sunday, soaring into a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta 
rocket. It is the first attempt to gather material from beyond the 
moon and return it to Earth. A fleeting radar problem delayed the 
flight one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most exciting to get this beautiful spacecraft on its  
way,'' said Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, a 
University of Washington astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an  
extraterrestrial pickup and delivery mission. The last time the 
agency went after samples in outer space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the 
last of the manned lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to get to where we're going... but then  
we've got to turn around and come home again,'' said Carl Pilcher, 
NASA's science director for solar system exploration. ``This 
certainly adds a new level of complexity and difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists feel it's worth the extra effort and risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Comets are frozen time capsules; the icy, rocky bodies are  
thought to be pieces of the original building blocks of the solar 
system and may well contain compounds from which life formed. 
Abundant in water and carbon-based molecules, comets continually 
bombarded Earth some 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust is to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004,  
passing within some 90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball. The 
comet is named for its discoverer, retired astronomy professor Paul 
Wild, pronounced Vilt, who traveled from Switzerland to be on hand 
for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny comet fragments -- no bigger than a grain of salt --  
hopefully will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered with 
a transparent, ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most 
vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of a 
large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl of 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going as close as we can without getting killed,'' said  
Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the comet samples -- along with interstellar  
dust gathered en route to the comet -- will reach Earth in January 
2006. The return capsule will separate from Stardust at an altitude 
of 69,000 miles and parachute into the Utah desert; Stardust will 
remain in orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, comet discoverer Wild will be 80 years old. He hopes to  
be around for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it all works very well, of course, that will be gorgeous,''  
Wild said. ``But there are many possibilities of failure or partial 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even less than a thimble full of comet dust would be plenty for  
the kind of detailed analysis that's planned, scientists say. Even 
the fanciest science instruments on a spacecraft cannot begin to 
compare with the electron microscopes in laboratories on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first U.S. mission devoted solely to a comet. NASA  
plans three more over the next four years, two of which will 
attempt landings.

<HEADLINE> Giants Terminate Miller's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Linebacker Corey Miller, who missed  
all of last season with a neck injury, had his contract terminated 
by the New York Giants on Monday after failing a physical. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a five-year starter, spent the 1998 season on injured  
reserve after being diagnosed with a herniated disk in his neck 
after experiencing neck pain and arm weakness during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Miller chose not to have surgery after the  
problem was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an old guy as far as the NFL is concerned. I have to take  
a step back and see if it's worth doing all this and coming back,'' 
he said in August. ``If I can't play anymore, then I'm fine because 
I feel like I had a great career and I feel very blessed that they 
found it. I could have been out there and taken one shot and been 
paralyzed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ended his eight-year career with 242 tackles, 14 sacks, seven  
forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who played college ball at South Carolina, was chosen in  
the sixth round of the 1991 draft.

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Man's 4th Murder Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASTROP, Texas (AP) -- A judge today delayed by a week jury  
selection in the fourth murder trial of a man who spent 20 years in 
prison for the slaying of his neighbor before he was freed after 
courts found prosecutors hid evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Robert Jones said he pushed back jury  
selection so more tests can be done on recently discovered 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This court wants all the information available,'' Jones said.  
``There has been enough criticism of the system over this. We're 
going to make the system work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith County prosecutors sought the delay Friday in the trial of  
Kerry Max Cook after laboratory tests discovered a trace of semen 
on the 21-year-old victim's underwear. Further study could 
determine whether the DNA's origins can be traced. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Steve ``Rocket'' Rosen said Cook wasn't  
responsible for the semen. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 42, was convicted twice for the beating and stabbing of  
secretary Linda Jo Edwards in 1977. He spent 13 years on death row, 
until a state appeals court threw out his conviction because a 
psychiatrist who testified didn't tell Cook their conversation 
could be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1992 retrial ended with a hung jury. A 1994 trial ended with a  
second conviction and death sentence, but an appeals court 
overturned the verdict in 1996. Cook was freed on bond while 
waiting for his fourth trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the state used testimony from a  
since-deceased witness who claimed Cook was in a sexual frenzy the 
night Ms. Edwards was slain. Cook's original lawyers were not told 
the witness had contradicted himself in earlier grand jury 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted again, Cook could be sent back to death row or  
receive a life sentence.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Set Feb. 7 Caucus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa Republicans on Monday scheduled  
their precinct caucuses next Feb. 7 -- two weeks earlier than 
planned -- and Democrats said they'll move to the same date. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift is aimed at fighting off a threat to the heavy  
attention the state gets in the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that presidential candidates and political  
observers will focus their attention and resources on the Iowa 
caucuses,'' Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Democratic Party spokesman John Del Cecato said Democrats  
have been coordinating plans with Republicans, with national 
Democratic Party officials and with officials in New Hampshire, 
which holds the leadoff primary election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens, we want to keep Iowa first,'' Del Cecato  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement is the latest twist in a quadrennial battle  
over the campaign calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	By tradition, Iowa's precinct caucuses are the first delegate  
selection event, followed eight days later by the New Hampshire 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last election cycle, Louisiana Republican officials held  
a delegate selection event prior to Iowa, but got little attention 
from candidates and there were questions about vote-counting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana GOP has decided to leapfrog again this year, and  
Robinson said Iowa Republicans would adjust. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is important in both Iowa and New Hampshire, because  
presidential candidates devote huge time and attention campaigning 
in those relatively small states, and both parties benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The caucuses ``are a real genuine test of a presidential  
candidate's ability to connect with the people of America,'' said 
Robinson. ``If you can survive in the crucible of hundreds of small 
towns and cafes and homes and connect and meet people face to face, 
that's a very important accomplishment for a candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Disappointed in Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eros isn't as grand as had been expected, NASA  
scientists studying the asteroid said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also known as asteroid 433, Eros was studied by the Near Earth  
Asteroid Rendezvous satellite in late December. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said Eros was found to be slightly smaller than predicted,  
with at least two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge and a 
density comparable to the Earth's crust. 
</P>
<P>
	Eros was by named Gustav Witt, director of the Urania  
Observatory in Berlin, Germany, who discovered the asteroid on Aug. 
13, 1898. In general, asteroids are named by their discoverers and 
Witt chose the name of the Greek god of love. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was able to take 222 photos of the asteroid and  
make other observations when it passed 2,375 miles from Eros. The 
two will rendezvous again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eros was first observed from Earth more than 100 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	The satellite flyby produced evidence of variations in surface  
color and reflected light that suggest the asteroid has a diverse 
surface makeup. Closer observations are needed to determine its 
precise composition. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite measured Eros at 21 miles long by eight miles wide  
and eight miles deep, slightly smaller than originally estimated 
from ground-based radar observations. It had been estimated at 25.3 
miles by nine miles by eight miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The asteroid rotates once every 5.27 hours and has no visible  
moons. Its density is approximately 1.55 ounces per cubic inch, 
close to the average density of Earth's crust.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche on 12-Game Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bob Hartley walked into the Colorado Avalanche  
media room Monday to an unusually large crowd that nearly stopped 
him dead in his hockey skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is John Elway coming back?'' a smiling Hartley said, referring  
to the future Hall of Fame quarterback who spends six months a year 
training with the Denver Broncos about a mile from the Avalanche's 
practice rink. 
</P>
<P>
	While Elway ponders retirement, the Avalanche have spurred talk  
of a hockey resurrection, winning 12 straight games to quietly 
creep within reach of the Pittsburgh Penguins' NHL-record 17 
consecutive victories in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-long streak has put Colorado back among the league's  
elite and helped erase the memory of an 0-4 start that had people 
writing off the Avs just three seasons removed from their Stanley 
Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time we look back at our start, no one ever thought we'd  
get on a little role like we have lately,'' forward Adam Deadmarsh 
said. ``I think everyone around the room was a little frustrated 
with that and felt we could do a little better. I don't know what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no shortage of theories behind Colorado's run of  
success, which started Jan. 10 with a come-from-behind 3-2 overtime 
victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading the list of possibilities is the return of early season  
holdout Sandis Ozolinsh, who could appropriately be referred to as 
12-0zolinsh. Since the offensive-minded defenseman entered the 
lineup, the Avalanche have not lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he wants credit for the streak, Ozolinsh just shakes  
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not really. Not anymore,'' he said. ``Now it's getting more  
serious. The first three games, yeah. Four games, yeah. Not when 
it's 12 games. It's getting kind of old. After each game, everybody 
wants to rub my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long before Ozolinsh became a good-luck charm, Hartley made a  
serendipitous lineup change that has helped the Avalanche (29-19-4) 
go from two games under .500 to their perch atop the Northwest 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired of watching his team struggle offensively, the rookie  
coach moved center Peter Forsberg to left wing on Dec. 2, putting 
him on the same line as fellow all-star Joe Sakic. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won its first five games after the switch, but went  
3-6-1 when injuries split the pair for three weeks. The dangerous 
duo has been healthy for all but one game of the current streak, 
and the Avalanche are 17-2-1 when both are playing side-by-side. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my business, we have to do experiments every day,'' Hartley  
said. ``At the time we decided to put Peter and Joe together, we 
wanted to create a spark. We wanted to create excitement in the 
dressing room. It's one of those combinations that could have 
failed all the way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having regained its scoring punch, Colorado signed goaltender  
Patrick Roy to a $15 million contract extension two weeks ago, and 
he has responded with 11 straight victories (backup Craig 
Billington won the first game of the streak). 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, who leads active goaltenders with 401 wins, has three  
shutouts and has allowed two or fewer goals eight times during his 
tear. In the 12-game streak, Colorado has outscored the opponent 
47-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm on the bench watching the top two lines, and the  
defense and Patrick, I am sitting there kind of saying, `What a 
show these guys are putting on,''' rookie center Chris Drury said. 
``It's been unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drury, who was named college's top player in 1997, has done his  
part as well. Skating on Colorado's third line with Stephane Yelle 
and Shean Donovan, Drury has two goals and seven assists in the 
last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that every game, there's a different line or a  
different guy coming out to really give us that big play or that 
big goal,'' Hartley said. ``It's a sign of a healthy club right 
now. The guys feel real confident. They're having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avs put their streak on the line Tuesday night against  
Calgary -- a dangerous team if Colorado has a letdown after four 
road victories against playoff-caliber Boston, Buffalo, Detroit and 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really didn't find ourselves until this road trip,'' Sakic  
said. ``We knew we won eight in a row, but we didn't play any of 
the elite teams. Winning those games was definitely a good 
confidence boost. We have to keep building on that.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Statements on Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House prosecutors made a last-ditch effort  
Monday to make an issue of presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal's 
truthfulnesss, but affidavits they tried to introduce at the 
impeachment trial may open the door for a criminal investigation 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department or prosecutor Kenneth Starr's office  
could wind up delving into Blumenthal's Senate testimony last week, 
in which he denied feeding the news media President Clinton's false 
account from January 1998 about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, journalist Christopher Hitchens and his wife  
signed affidavits stating that Blumenthal told them that the former 
White House intern was a stalker. Journalist Scott Armstrong signed 
an affidavit Monday saying he was told by Hitchens and his wife, 
Carol Blue, about their conversation with Blumenthal and the 
``stalker'' comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the possibility of a criminal probe of Blumenthal,  
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly declined to comment and Justice 
Department spokesman Myron Marlin said there's been no formal 
referral from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Starr's independent counsel predecessors, prosecutor  
Lawrence Walsh, won a guilty plea from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. 
Richard Secord for making a false statement in a congressional 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Secord lied in telling investigators on Capitol Hill he had not  
been aware any money from his business dealings in the Iran-Contra 
affair going to White House aide Oliver North. Secord used some of 
the Iran-Contra proceeds to pay for a $13,800 security fence at 
North's home. 
</P>
<P>
	House managers pressed the Senate to subpoena the three  
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president may have engaged in an intimidation campaign''  
against Ms. Lewinsky in January 1998 and Blumenthal ``may have 
testified falsely before the Senate,'' House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde wrote the Senate majority and minority leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Blumenthal, he was told by the president in January  
1998 that Ms. Lewinsky said her peers referred to her as ``the 
stalker'' and Clinton said he'd rebuffed a sexual demand she made 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Blumenthal told the Senate that ``I never told any of  
my colleagues about what the president told me. ... I didn't 
mention it to my friends, I didn't mention it to my family, besides 
my wife. ... And I certainly never mentioned it to any reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal told the Senate that ``I talked about Monica Lewinsky  
with all sorts of people, my mother, my friends, about what was in 
the news stories every day ... but when it came to talking about 
her personally, I drew a line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Sunday, Blumenthal said that he was never a  
source for any story about Monica Lewinsky's personal life and that 
``I did not reveal what the president told me to any reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said that ``as I testified to the Senate, I talked  
every day about the stories in the news concerning Miss Lewinsky to 
my friends and family, just as everyone else is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was an apparent inconsistency in the affidavits.  
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens said the conversation with Blumenthal occurred March  
19, 1998. Armstrong said his conversation with Hitchens and his 
wife occurred ``on or about March 18.'' In an interview, Hitchens 
said the credit card receipt is dated March 19, but that an 
appointment calendar showed the luncheon with Blumenthal occurred 
March 17. Hitchens said further investigation would pin down the 
date and that in any event, Blumenthal has not contest that it 
occurred, simply that Blumenthal does not remember what was said.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. May Investigate Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has advised Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr that it intends to investigate his handling 
of the Lewinsky affair, but the probe has not begun, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's internal watchdog agency, the Office of  
Professional Responsibility, recently wrote Starr of its plan to 
begin an investigation of several matters, but the office is 
awaiting Starr's response before starting the inquiry, according to 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	One topic for the impending investigation is the Jan. 16, 1998  
offer by Starr's deputies to former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it 
with her lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department rules prohibit government prosecutors from  
discussing immunity deals with defendants outside the presence of 
their lawyers. Starr's office is required to follow these rules 
unless doing so would undermine the purpose of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied any impropriety in his office's dealings with  
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The other topics of investigation could not be learned  
immediately. The letter to Starr was first reported in Monday's 
edition of Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the department inched to the brink of  
investigating Starr over the handling of the immunity deal and 
other matters, but he protested in a visit with top Justice 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Justice officials said they had dismissed some of the  
allegations raised against Starr but had written him a letter 
seeking his response to others. They insisted at that time that an 
investigation had not been opened yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno has authority to fire Starr if she  
finds ``good cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against Starr have come from legal observers,  
some Democratic members of Congress and President Clinton's lawyer 
David Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has let U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson handle  
the investigation of alleged grand jury leaks from Starr's staff, 
because Johnson, as chief judge here, oversees the grand jury. The 
judge named a special master to look into those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has picked a team of ex-Justice officials to oversee a  
probe of whether one of his key Whitewater witnesses, David Hale, 
received cash from people working for the conservative American 
Spectator magazine.

<HEADLINE> Production Resumes at Ford Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex was up  
and running Monday, a week after a fiery explosion that killed two 
people and shut down power at the massive complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants at the complex make Ford Mustangs as well as engines and  
a variety of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North 
American assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford expects all six plants at the complex to be running at  
normal levels by Tuesday, spokeswoman Mary Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen men remained hospitalized with injuries suffered in the  
Feb. 1 explosion. Eleven remained in critical condition, two in 
serious and one in fair. 
</P>
<P>
	A state inspector has said the explosion was caused by a gas  
buildup inside a boiler at the power station. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,100-acre Rouge facility was once the world's largest auto  
plant. At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant 
in Dearborn, about seven miles west of Detroit. About 10,000 people 
work there now.

<HEADLINE> Diet May Help Lower Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A low-fat, higher-protein diet rich in fruits and  
vegetables may be the best treatment for blacks suffering from 
hypertension, a new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers examined the effects of three dietary patterns on  
blood pressure in 459 adults with normal-but-high to high blood 
pressure. Sixty percent of the participants were black, 34 percent 
were white and 6 percent were of other races, according to an 
article in today's edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that blood pressure was lowered in people  
with blood pressure at the high end of normal, thus reducing the 
need for medication. 
</P>
<P>
	One researcher cautioned that people should not switch their  
diet or change the way they take medication without first 
consulting a physician. Still, she raved about the study's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about a diet with the potential of preventing  
and treating hypertension and doing it particularly well in people 
at risk, African Americans and people with high blood pressure,'' 
said Dr. Laura Svetkey, associate professor of medicine at Duke 
University Medical Center and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	High blood pressure is a major threat to heart function that  
affects about 50 million adults in the United States. It increases 
the risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers wanted a majority of black participants because  
previous studies showed blacks are about 40 percent more likely 
than whites to have high blood pressure. Blacks also tend to 
develop it earlier and more severely, according to authors of the 
study, named ``Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension,'' or DASH. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants were required to be free of all hypertension  
medications and were randomly assigned to one of the three 
experimental diets. 
</P>
<P>
	The diets included one with a nutrient composition typical of  
that consumed by most Americans; one that was rich in fruits and 
vegetables; and a third low-fat, low-cholesterol diet -- the 
so-called DASH diet -- containing fruits, vegetables and low-fat 
dairy foods, as well as an increase in protein. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the eight weeks, researchers found that  
participants who ate the DASH diet significantly lowered their 
blood pressure. Black participants benefited from a larger decrease 
than did whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was not aimed at reducing salt intake, inducing weight  
loss or moderating alcohol consumption -- all traditional ways that 
doctors have attempted to treat hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetkey also said the study -- made up of half women -- also  
offers more proof that such a diet helps lower blood pressure in 
women, whose hypertension problems have been studied less than 
men's.

<HEADLINE> Firm Offers Free PC for Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A company plans to give away 10,000  
Compaq personal computers to customers willing to divulge private 
details about how they'll use the device to buy goods or services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, www.Free-PC.com, plans to announce the offer today  
and expects up to 1 million computers will be given away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to provide Free-PC customers with the most useful  
and relevant ads, products and services,'' the Web site says. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that by using the application questionnaire and tracking  
which ads the customer clicks on, the company ``will be able to 
deliver to them just the kinds of ads that they will find 
interesting and helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to asking personal information such as name,  
address, sex, marital status and income, the questionnaire asks how 
the computer will be used -- such as for a home-based business, 
games or electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
	It also asks how many hours per week the computer will be used  
and whether the customer uses a computer at work. Other private 
information Free-PC wants to know include: what kind of car a user 
drives, what the user's interests are, and what types of 
publications the user subscribes to. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're offering a Faustian bargain here,'' Evan Hendricks,  
editor of the newsletter, Privacy Times. ``Everyone has to decide 
for themselves what's more important: a free computer or what 
people learn about their lives from that computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free-PC.com founder, Bill Gross, said the company will spend  
$500 on each computer it gives away, but expects to make the money 
back, and some. The company's chief executive, Don LaVigne, assures 
``we won't share anyone's personal information with anyone, 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights  
Clearinghouse in San Diego, said keeping one's privacy is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may come down with a serious medical problem and visit  
chat rooms and Web sites where you seek support,'' she said. ``Do 
you want that information ever getting into the hands of an 
insurance company or an employer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gross hopes his company's offer opens up access to those who  
can't afford a computer. Still, Privacy Times editor Hendricks sees 
it as problematic. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this turns out to be more of a draw for low-income people,  
it will drive home the point that privacy is viewed as a luxury 
that people with money can afford, and not as a right that everyone 
deserves,'' Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's the direction we want to take our country  
in the Information Age.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Nears Decision on 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Former American Red Cross President  
Elizabeth Dole, at the brink of a presidential campaign, said 
Monday in a veiled reference to President Clinton that the next 
White House occupant must have ``the integrity to inspire trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole was addressing a Chamber of Commerce crowd of 1,200 in  
a speech billed by advisers as ``the last major hurdle'' before she 
decides whether to seek the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a good and great nation,'' she said in a text prepared  
for delivery Monday night. ``And we must demand a government with 
the integrity to inspire trust and the straightforward strength to 
keep us free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she did not mention the president by name, a senior  
adviser said the speech was drawing contrast between Clinton's 
character and what Mrs. Dole thinks Americans should expect of 
their next president. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Bob Dole, warned voters of a ``sleaze factor in the  
White House'' late in his failed 1996 campaign. ``The White House 
should be a place of public trust, not public suspicion,'' Dole 
said then. 
</P>
<P>
	During her two-day trip to this first-in-the-nation primary  
state, which ends with a private breakfast Tuesday, Mrs. Dole plans 
to trace the broad themes of a likely presidential campaign -- 
integrity, education, drug abuse and national security -- without 
formally entering the race or addressing such hot-button issues as 
abortion and affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	She is almost certain to become a candidate, said the adviser,  
who spoke on condition of anonymity. She plans to travel to Iowa 
next week, hire campaign staff as early as this week and form an 
exploratory committee in the near future, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, served in the Cabinets of Presidents Reagan and  
Bush after starting in politics in the Democratic administration of 
President Johnson. A key player in her husband's presidential 
races, Mrs. Dole fought for and secured full campaign staffs and 
proved to be a tireless, disciplined and dynamic campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	With Texas Gov. George Bush tied down to Austin, Texas, for a  
legislative session, Mrs. Dole has emerged as the hottest commodity 
in the fledgling 2000 campaign. She may be a rare Republican figure 
who combines high name recognition and the potential to bridge the 
gap between religious and economic conservatives, with the added 
bonus of being a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz began Jan. 4, when she surprised the political world by  
stepping down as director of the American Red Cross to ``seriously 
consider'' running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened a small office at the Watergate complex, sought out  
consultants and called dozens of potential supporters in key 
presidential states. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls in the last month suggest that she and Bush, the son of  
former President Bush, would be front-runners for the GOP 
presidential nomination. Both hold slight polling edges over Vice 
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone lines have been burning up since the day she stepped  
down from the Red Cross,'' said state GOP chairman Steve Duprey. 
</P>
<P>
	She also is capable of raising the $20 million or so required to  
win the nomination, though Bush and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander would be vying for many of the same donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement is tempered by some hard realities. Despite  
serving as secretary of labor and transportation, Mrs. Dole has 
never sought elective office and she has never laid out her own set 
of public policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the initial excitement wears off, she's going to have to  
put together a serious campaign and make up for lost time,'' Duprey 
said. ``This is a honeymoon period, and it won't last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her record at Red Cross has already been called into question,  
with some critics complaining that she politicized the agency. And 
there is no certainty she will inherit the female vote, especially 
from the party's conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she has already disappointed some New Hampshire  
Republicans by inviting business leaders, including Democratic 
donors, to Tuesday's breakfast and not party regulars.

<HEADLINE> DNA Evidence Found After 22 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASTROP, Texas (AP) -- For nearly 22 years, investigators had  
genetic information that might identify a woman's killer, and they 
didn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a judge delayed a fourth trial for the victim's  
former neighbor while a newly found trace of semen is subjected to 
DNA analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	It's up to experts to determine whether the old, neglected  
sample found on the woman's blood-soaked underwear is salvageable 
and, if so, whether it came from Kerry Max Cook or someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, 42, has been convicted of the 1977 killing twice, but both  
verdicts were thrown out on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DNA deteriorates over time, experts say some  
information can be extracted from Linda Jo Edwards' underwear if 
the sample is large enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really depends on what it is, where it has been and under  
what conditions it has been kept all this time,'' said Kermit 
Channell II, forensic biology supervisor at the state Crime 
Laboratory in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything related to the crime, including Ms. Edwards'  
underwear, has passed through a two-decade chain of custody of 
investigators, court clerks and the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals. But it was only last week that prosecutors sent the 
underwear to be tested for semen. 
</P>
<P>
	No test was done at the time of the crime. The technology was  
not as developed. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Robert Jones scheduled a conference call for  
Thursday to decide whether there's enough of a sample to continue 
with DNA testing. If not, jury selection will begin next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insist Cook beat the 21-year-old Ms. Edwards in the  
head with a plaster statue, stabbed her repeatedly and sexually 
mutilated her in her East Texas apartment. Investigators found 
Cook's fingerprints on Ms. Edwards' sliding glass door. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook was first sentenced to death in 1978 and spent 13 years on  
death row until a state appeals court threw out the conviction 
because a psychiatrist who testified at trial didn't tell Cook 
their conversation could be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1992 retrial ended with a hung jury. In 1994 he was again  
convicted and sentenced to death. An appeals court overturned that 
verdict in 1996, citing prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook, who has been free since 1997, has spent nearly half his  
life behind bars for this case. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing Monday, his attorney, Steve Rosen, said the  
semen is not Cook's. 
</P>
<P>
	And he added indignantly: ``For 22 years, they have had, under  
lock and key, all the evidence of this atrocity. They have had 
ample time to test the panties and examine them.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in 1982 Murder Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The man whose videotaped confession to two  
killings freed another man from death row last week has surrendered 
to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon, 48, was formally charged Sunday with the 1982  
killings of two teen-agers. His estranged wife, Inez Jackson, also 
surrendered to Chicago police and was charged with obstruction of 
justice for keeping her husband's role in the slayings a secret, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	They both were scheduled to appear in bond court today.  
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, now 43, was freed Friday from Cook County Jail  
after 17 years behind bars. Last September, he was within two days 
of execution for the killings when the Illinois Supreme Court 
decided to review his case because of his low IQ. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses in the case against Porter have now allegedly recanted  
their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, of Milwaukee, plans to plead innocent to the charges,  
said his lawyer, Jack Rimland. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, Rimland said  
Simon's videotaped comments ``indicated he was acting in 
self-defense, based on my viewing of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Simon confessed Wednesday to the fatal shootings of  
Jerry Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, while being questioned on 
videotape by Chicago private investigator Paul Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciolino worked on the case with journalism students from  
Northwestern University, who also say they obtained a confession in 
a previously videotaped interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is the 10th inmate freed from death row in Illinois since  
the death penalty was reinstated in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Porter will not be dismissed until  
prosecutors review the videotapes of Simon and other evidence, said 
Asst. State's Atty. Thomas Gainer.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A fight between two rival prison gangs  
in a Brazilian prison left 13 inmates dead, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash occurred Sunday in Pirajui, 215 miles northwest of Sao  
Paulo, said Police Chief Antonio das Neves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 victims were beaten and stabbed to death, Neves said. The  
bodies were then wrapped in thin mattresses and set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Neves said police surrounded the prison and convinced inmates to  
turn in their weapons and return to their cells four hours after 
the fight started.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru will shift troops stationed along its  
now-calm border with Ecuador to the border with Colombia to prevent 
incursions by leftist rebels and drug traffickers from that nation, 
President Alberto Fujimori said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The soldiers stationed on the Peru-Ecuador border will simply  
be moved to the Putumayo River,'' which forms Peru's 1,120-mile 
border with Colombia, Fujimori told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori did not say how many troops would be moved.  
</P>
<P>
	Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty in October ending a  
border dispute that had erupted in war in 1941, 1981 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori has charged that Colombian guerrillas crossed into  
Peruvian territory 11 times in 1995 and 1996, and that members of 
one rebel band were detected protecting drug traffickers in Peru in 
1997 and 1998.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Teachers went on strike  
Monday to demand payment of bonuses promised two years ago, 
shutting down classes for 2 million public school students. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had failed to pay the incentive bonuses it had  
promised in negotiations with unions, said Olimpia Gonzalez, 
president of the Dominican Association of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Ligia Amada Melo de Cardona said the  
government had kept its promise but had withheld incentives from 
teachers who didn't qualify in order to pay others who did. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominican Liberation Party of President Leonel Fernandez  
accused the Dominican Revolutionary Party of being behind the 
strike. The Revolutionary Party denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-hour strike by 40,000 teachers coincided with a partial  
strike by the Dominican Medical Association. Doctors, demanding 
better pay and working conditions, refused to provide some services 
at six hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Gets Front-Row Daytona Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- That unfamiliar face on the front row  
for the Daytona 500 is Tony Stewart, a novice with 20 years of 
racing experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart nearly won the pole for NASCAR's most prestigious race  
and will be making his Winston Cup debut alongside two-time 
defending series champion Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people thought this kid might have some talent, but  
maybe they're surprised to see something like this in his first 
time out,'' said Bobby Labonte, Stewart's Joe Gibbs Racing teammate 
and a mentor to the 27-year-old driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any limit on Tony. He has some things to  
learn, but the guy is a racer. He's going to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and Gordon share a similar history. Both lived in  
Indiana in their teens, and both established themselves as young 
stars in the U.S. Auto Club's sprint and midget divisions before 
rising to the top echelons of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, three months younger than Stewart, made his move a  
little sooner. He came straight to NASCAR's Busch Series because 
that's where the opportunity was. He quickly switched to Winston 
Cup and was an almost immediate hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart stuck around the Midwest's short tracks longer than  
Gordon and made his first upward move in 1996. He joined the 
fledgling Indy Racing League, where he immediately became a star 
and was the 1997 champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, his experience in the IRL's Indianapolis 500 has given  
Stewart some solid preparation for the pressure of NASCAR's biggest 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is ironic is that my rookie season at the  
Indianapolis 500 I almost sat on the pole, also,'' Stewart said. 
``I was on the pole for 3 1/2 hours, and then Arie Luyendyk took it. I 
ended up starting on the front row of my first Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, to start on the front row of my first Daytona 500, well,  
I guess it will be a good trivia question on down the road. It just 
makes you feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a tentative first step into NASCAR's Busch Series two  
years ago, Stewart got together last year with Gibbs, the former 
Washington Redskins coach. 
</P>
<P>
	While maintaining a full IRL schedule in 1998, Stewart raced in  
22 Busch Series events and earned two poles, two runner-up finishes 
and a total of five top-fives. Gibbs decided Stewart was ready to 
join Labonte in Winston Cup this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Bobby work very well together, and we think this is  
going to be a very good relationship,'' Gibbs said. ``Hopefully, we 
can all win some races together down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His next hurdle comes Thursday, when he will start from the pole  
in the second of two 125-mile qualifying races that will determine 
most of the 43-car field for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to his time test, the run will be strictly a learning  
experience. Both front-row qualifiers Thursday have locked up 
starting positions for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to let me focus a lot more on learning and allow me  
to be less racy,'' Stewart said. ``I won't have to stick my nose in 
places where it might wind up with my car in the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Stewart will concentrate on starting his first big  
stock car race from the front of the pack. And, for Stewart, it's 
just another in a long line of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got lucky enough to draw the pole position for the IROC race  
here last year,'' he said. ``I wasn't real excited about it after I 
got to Turn 1 because I went from first to about fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll talk to Bobby and he'll make sure I know everything I  
need to know. I've started on the front row of the Busch races in 
the past and we ran in the top five the majority of the day in the 
Busch race here last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Stewart understands he still has plenty to learn.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to not only take this first race, but this first  
season, and it may take more than one season to learn what we need 
to learn,'' he said. ``But I need to gain as much knowledge as I 
can this first year to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be the guy that causes the 20-car pileup on  
Sunday, so you're going to see me be real patient.''

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies avoided  
arbitration with Kevin Jordan on Monday, agreed to a $500,000, 
one-year contract with the infielder about a half-hour before the

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Slip in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday morning in  
Tokyo following comments by Japan's officials seen as supportive of 
the U.S currency. Japanese stocks slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.58 yen in the morning, up 1.08 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its level of 114.43 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 63.02 points, or 0.45 percent, to  
end morning trading at 13,929.47 points. On Monday, the average 
closed up 94.41 points, or 0.68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground in Tokyo in line  
with a trend seen earlier in New York after Eisuke Sakakibara, vice 
minister for international affairs with Japan's Finance Ministry, 
said Monday an excessively strong yen is not good for Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks make yen buyers wary the Bank of Japan may  
intervene to stem the yen further appreciation against the U.S. 
currency, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said early Tuesday that it is  
up to the Bank of Japan to decide on monetary policy, a remark 
interpreted to mean that the government and the central bank could 
agree on some action to control interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Action by the Bank of Japan to cap rates would help boost the  
dollar because higher interest rates tend to favor the rise of that 
nation's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was a slide in the yield of the  
Japanese government bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 2.050  
percent from Monday's finish of 2.160 percent, driving its price up 
to 98.03 yen from 97.19 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past weeks, the dramatic rise in yields has increased  
demand for yen to buy Japanese government bonds and has prompted 
some fear Japanese investors may repatriate some of their U.S. 
Treasury holdings to purchase the higher-yielding domestic 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was at 129.84 yen, up from 127.66 yen late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, many investors have already held back to  
see what steps the Bank of Japan may take on the recent rise in 
long-term interest rates at its Friday's policy-board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 2.55 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,088.08 
points. The TOPIX closed up 5.99 points, or 0.55 percent, the day 
before.

	King Hussein Laid to Rest  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's beloved King Hussein was buried  
today, culminating a day of mourning by his people and tributes 
from numerous world leaders. Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 46 
years, died yesterday of cancer at age 63. His son, Abdullah, has 
assumed the throne. Nearly a million Jordanians packed the capital 
to view his coffin as it was borne through the streets. Hundreds of 
dignitaries were in attendance, including a large American 
contingent headed by President Clinton. Also paying homage to the 
Mideast's longest-serving ruler were Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Syrian President 
Hafez Assad, making an unprecedented appearance at the same event 
as Netanyahu. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraq Silent on Jordan King's Death  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's state-run media reported little  
today about the death of neighboring Jordan's king. As King Hussein 
was being mourned by hundreds of world leaders, Iraq gave no word 
of condolence and no congratulatory telegrams to the new King 
Abdullah. Iraqi newspapers and TV gave only cursory coverage to the 
news of the passing of the Mideast's longest serving leader. Jordan 
is Iraq's biggest Arab trading partner, supplying soap, tires, 
medical equipment, medicine, car parts and sanitary goods. In the 
Arab world, it is considered an insult to ignore a neighbor's death 
-- even if an enemy. 

</P>

	Clinton Trial Nears End  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today will hear House prosecutors  
make their final arguments that President Clinton committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice and should be removed from office. White 
House lawyers also planned to wrap up their case today, reiterating 
that while Clinton misled the nation in denying his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky, he committed no crime warranting expulsion. It is 
virtually certain the Senate will not get the necessary 67 votes to 
convict Clinton, and senators likely then will consider a censure 
resolution.

	Albanians Call for Cease Fire

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians today called for an  
immediate cease-fire between the warring factions in Kosovo, but 
international mediators sidestepped the appeal for what they said 
were more pressing issues. Officials said Serbs and Albanians have 
agreed in principle on 10 general points for negotiations which 
would keep Yugoslavia's borders intact but give the secessionist 
province wide autonomy. But a member of the Serb delegation 
described some details of the deal as ``horrifying for us because 
it would take Serbia out of Kosovo completely.''

	Worker Fired for Going on Jury Duty

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A judge has arrested a boss who fired his  
assistant for serving jury duty. Jennifer Sutton said she reminded 
her boss, Warren Edwards, several times that she would be serving 
jury duty, but he still gave her a late-breaking project and 
demanded she stay. Ms. Sutton said when she told Edwards she was 
leaving, he told her she was fired. The judge was so angry when he 
heard Ms. Sutton's story, he issued an arrest warrant for Edwards. 
Officials at Affiliated Computer Services acknowledged the firing 
was a mistake. Ms. Sutton sued her former company, and wants her 
job back or six months pay. She refused the company's offer of 
another job.

the Vikings' offensive coordinator and is familiar with Johnson. 
Johnson was Minnesota's starter at the beginning of the season, but 
broke a bone in his leg in the second game. Cunningham replaced him 
and flourished, earning Pro Bowl and All-Pro recognition.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 22.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as an early rally was  
deflated by analysts' predictions of a market correction. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, which have set the pace for the broader  
market in recent months, stemmed last week's losses but failed to 
regain much momentum. Gains by some of the industry's blue-chip 
companies were matched by steep losses by younger, more volatile 
Internet businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
at 9,281.59, down 22.65 from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's turnaround was sparked, at least in part, by a warning  
from one of Wall Street's most persistently bullish analysts. Ralph 
Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities, 
said a correction of 5 to 10 percent in the Dow is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill  
Lynch &AMP; Co, said he expects the Dow to drop to the 7,500-8,000 
range. In the absence of any government economic reports or major 
corporate earnings announcements, the analysts' cautious outlooks 
were enough to end the brief buying spree that occurred when the

<HEADLINE> Little Change Seen in Jordan Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials and Middle East scholars  
anticipate that Jordan's King Abdullah will pursue his late 
father's policies of moderation and that there will be little overt 
change in Jordan's policies toward its neighbors and the West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will carry my father's flag,'' Abdullah told Secretary of  
State Madeleine Albright shortly after Hussein named him successor 
to the throne. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling Abdullah's pledge at a meeting in late January,  
Albright said today on NBC that the new Jordanian king will 
``pursue the missions that his father had, both domestically and 
internationally. And we talked about both, and he knows he's got a 
lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Abdullah, 37, is an inexperienced leader -- one who was not  
even in the line of succession until two weeks ago. Few expect he 
will be able to serve up the same forceful leadership as the 
long-serving and widely respected King Hussein in pressing for a 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	American leaders joined in voicing sadness over Hussein's death  
Sunday and in expressing support for the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a magnificent man, and like so many, I loved and  
admired him,'' President Clinton said Sunday before flying to Amman 
for the monarch's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promised support for Abdullah, and the administration  
was moving quickly to shore up support for Jordan, which under 
Hussein has been a voice of moderation and usually an ally to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said on ABC's ``This Week'' that Abdullah, as crown  
prince, ``has already formed a lot of relationships with others of 
the younger rulers in the Middle East. ... And he clearly feels an 
affinity toward the United States and will work with us. We are 
going to work with him very carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the  
United States was committed to working with Abdullah in an effort 
to carry out last fall's Wye River Middle East peace accord, which 
Hussein helped frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the glue that held the process together,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., noted of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Israeli-Palestinian agreement is largely on hold,  
particularly in advance of approaching elections in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there's considerable anxiety, both within and  
without Jordan,'' said Michael Fischbach, a history professor at 
Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., and director of the 
Palestinian American Research Center. ``For many Jordanians, the 
idea of Jordan and its relative stability is associated in their 
minds with King Hussein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischbach, who has met Abdullah, said much of the anxiety  
centers on the new leader's inexperience. ``But he has an outgoing 
good personality,'' Fischbach added. ``He is well liked. He is well 
regarded in the military. And he has good relations with the other 
Arab nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein was a friend to the United States and forceful advocate  
for peace for most of the past five decades -- although he diverted 
from this path in 1991 when he declined to join Arab neighbors in 
the Gulf War coalition against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, his powerful 
neighbor to the west. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, the king left his sickbed to join Clinton to help  
nudge along the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially at peace with Israel since 1994, Hussein had tried to  
persuade both sides to come to terms on an overall settlement. His 
renouncing of any claim to the West Bank in 1988 and his peace 
treaty with Israel had given him influence with both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah was designated as heir to the throne only last month  
when his ailing father dismissed his brother from the line of 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
	The new leader must deal with growing sentiment in Jordan  
against Israel and Jordan's chronic economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the ingredients are there for (Abdullah) to rule  
successfully,'' said Yehuda Lukacs, a professor at George Mason 
University in Virginia who has written about Jordan and the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have the backing of the military, he does have the  
support of the Bedouin minority. He has a Palestinian wife. He has 
not made any statements that have angered any of the neighbors. The 
Israelis seem confident they can work with him. And he studied at 
Georgetown and knows the United States,'' said Lukacs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a land of 4 million people, has a predominantly  
Palestinian population. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schenker of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  
said he expects to see an early challenge of Abdullah from one of 
his Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is likely to be some testing,'' Schenker said. ``He's  
living in a dangerous part of the world and has some dangerous 
neighbors. It's interesting to see how Abdullah does with the likes 
of Saddam Hussein and (Syria's) Hafez Assad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Schenker, ``I would expect the same sort of policy  
regarding the peace process. I don't expect a drastic change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who was a longtime friend of  
King Hussein and served as his Washington counsel in 1993-94, 
agreed ``there is no question the same policy will endure under 
Abdullah. But here's a young man without much experience who faces 
terrible economic and political difficulties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is impoverished, with few natural resources and with  
oil-rich neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Owens said, ``someone else will have to fill the void'' as  
the Middle East's senior statesman and peacemaker, perhaps Egypt's 
Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Panel Probes Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Former President Kim Young-sam is  
expected to issue an apology for mishandling South Korea's economy 
and forcing the country to receive an international bailout in 
1997, aides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is one of several dozen former government officials, bankers  
and businessmen ordered to testify before a parliamentary committee 
investigating the causes of South Korea's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kim, 74, went hiking on Monday, the day he was ordered to  
testify. The parliamentary committee threatened to file charges 
against him. If convicted, he can face a prison term of up to one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has already publicly apologized twice for mishandling the  
economy during his five-year term. He has refused to testify at the 
parliamentary hearing, claiming it is intended to defame him. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea went to the International Monetary Fund to bail out  
its sinking economy in late 1997, less than three months before Kim 
was to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
	The tone of a news conference Tuesday by Kim is expected to be  
apologetic, said one aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. But 
Kim will deny allegations that he had received millions of dollars 
in illegal political funds to finance his 1992 presidential 
campaign, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim reportedly is upset by a statement by a convicted  
industrialist at the parliamentary hearing last week that he had 
given the former president $12.5 million in illegal campaign funds 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-long parliamentary hearing is being conducted only by  
ruling party legislators. The opposition has boycotted, saying the 
hearing is politically motivated.

<HEADLINE> Student Pleads To E-Mailing Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A college student pleaded guilty Monday to  
federal civil rights charges that he e-mailed hate messages to 
dozens of Hispanic professors, students and officials around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingman Quon, 22, pleaded to seven misdemeanor counts of  
interfering with federally protected activities. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of threatening to use force against his victims  
with the intent to intimidate or interfere with them because of 
their national origin or ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second federal civil rights prosecution involving  
e-mailed threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon could face up to seven years in prison at his April 26  
sentencing, although he is expected to receive a 2 1/2-year sentence 
under a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon, a Chinese-American, said outside court he ``snapped'' and  
sent the messages in March because he couldn't stand the pressures 
of being ``a high-achieving college student.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is a marketing major at California State Polytechnic  
University, Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
	Quon apologized for the messages and asked the victims to  
forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
	He sent the same racially derogatory e-mail to 42 professors at  
California State University, Los Angeles and 25 students at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> Delta-Woodside Makes Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Textile maker Delta Woodside Industries  
Inc., known for its Duck Head brand clothing, plans to spin off its 
two apparel businesses into separate companies and sell remaining 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan announced today is subject to shareholder approval and  
would make the Duck Head Apparel division and Delta Apparel 
divisions separate companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Duck Head Apparel makes men's and boy's casual pants, shorts,  
shirts and accessories and had sales of $92 million in its latest 
fiscal year. Delta Apparel makes T-shirts, polo-type shirts and 
sweatshirts and had sales of $108 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta Mills Inc. subsidiary and its operating division,  
Delta Mills Marketing Co., would remain part of Delta Woodside, 
which would then be sold. Delta Mills sells fabrics to apparel 
manufacturers and reported sales of $342 million in the most recent 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cash for the sale of the remaining Delta  
Woodside, shareholders would get shares in each of the new apparel 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the restructuring would let shareholders  
realize the value in Delta Mills, which is a profitable operation 
focused on making khaki, while ``each of the apparel divisions, as 
a separate public company, should have the necessary focus to 
generate improved results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plan, the Rainsford plant in Edgefield would be  
sold by Delta Mills to the Delta Apparel division. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled Greenville-based company has struggled against  
foreign competition. It has shed operations, such as its Stevcoknit 
Fabrics Co. and Nautilus International fitness equipment 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	It said in October it was looking for a buyer for the Duck Head  
line, but said in January that it was having trouble finding a 
buyer at the price it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Woodside shares were up 31 1/4 cents to $4.87 1/2 in early  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Pete Sampras Returns to Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Will Pete Sampras be rusty or refreshed  
after a 10-week layoff, his longest absence from tennis since he 
was a high school junior? He'll find out soon. 
</P>
<P>
	After going more than two months without playing in a single  
tournament, Sampras returns to the game he dominates in this week's 
Sybase Open. The top-seeded Sampras faces 84th-ranked Galo Blanco 
of Spain on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt like I needed this break to start the year  
off mentally, physically as fresh as possible,'' Sampras said. ``So 
I am definitely chomping at the bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhausted after playing a grueling series of tournaments in late  
1998 to protect his No. 1 ranking, Sampras passed up the Australian 
Open in January -- the first Grand Slam tournament he has skipped 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He is just one short of tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand  
Slam tournament men's singles titles, and Sampras has said in 
recent years his main motivation is to win more Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also focused on finishing last year as the No. 1 player  
in the world, giving him a record six straight years at the top. In 
order to protect that ranking, he had to play seven straight weeks 
in October and November -- a process that left him weary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have gone down to Australia. I just wish  
it started in February,'' he said. ``I wanted to give myself a good 
offseason this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was gone, Sampras certainly was not forgotten at the  
Australian Open. When Yevgeny Kafelnikov won the title, he 
immediately pointed out that his job was made much easier by the 
absence of the world's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete, it's really a great, wonderful feeling,'' Kafelnikov  
said after raising the silver trophy. ``Thanks for letting me do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is beginning his 258th week at No. 1, a dozen short of  
the record held by Ivan Lendl. Opponents wonder whether he'll be as 
sharp as usual at the start of the $350,000 Sybase tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's definitely a shot that he'll be rusty,'' said  
sixth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill, who would face Sampras in the 
semifinals. ``Pete definitely plays better when he has a few events 
under his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill has been on the tennis circuit for only two years, and  
he understands the exhaustion that forced Sampras to the sidelines 
for the past 10 weeks. And he thinks Sampras' relentless pursuit of 
the year-end No. 1 ranking was worth the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's his most impressive accomplishment,'' Gambill  
said. ``He's been head and shoulders above everyone else for six 
straight years, and that's really impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a two-time Sybase champion, has a relatively easy draw  
into the semifinals of the tournament. But once there, he may have 
to face Gambill or third-seeded Mark Philippoussis, a U.S. Open 
finalist last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, coming off an uninspired fourth-round loss at the  
Australian Open, is the defending champion of the Sybase Open and 
the No. 2 seed this year. He faces a first-round match against Todd 
Woodbridge tonight and could face fourth-seeded Michael Chang in 
the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea at War Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Just eight years ago, they were partners  
in overthrowing one of Africa's most notorious dictators. Today, 
former rebels Meles Zenawi and Isaias Afewerki head governments 
that have gone to war again -- this time against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly at least, Ethiopia and Eritrea say they are fighting  
over rights to tracts of remote, mostly uninhabited land along 
their common 620-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
	But in reality, the full-scale ground war that erupted Saturday  
-- the second in nine months -- is less about disputed borders than 
musty ideological differences, intractable trade problems and not 
least, the rivalry between one-time friends Meles and Isaias. 
</P>
<P>
	Meles, now Ethiopia's prime minister, was a top official in the  
Tigray People's Liberation Front, part of the rebel coalition that 
toppled Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	His ally and counterpart in the Eritrean People's Liberation  
Front was Isaias, now Eritrea's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its common enemy, the rebel alliance was fragile, with  
ties rupturing completely for three years in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Their differences -- over policy toward the Soviet Union,  
working-class leadership, a future independent Eritrea -- were 
ultimately set aside for the sake of ousting Mengistu. Still, they 
festered and flared again after Eritrea finally won independence in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade quickly emerged as a point of contention, with Ethiopia  
claiming trade ties were lopsided in favor of Eritrea. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopian businessmen protested the cost of access to the  
Eritrean port of Assab and complained they were being undersold by 
Eritrean traders taking advantage of lower customs duties to flood 
the Ethiopian market with cheaper goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government in the Eritrean capital of Asmara introduced  
its own currency and demanded it be used in both countries. 
Ethiopia refused, insisting instead on hard currency for most 
cross-border trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint commission was established to iron out differences, but  
after three meetings and little progress, the two countries went to 
war in May, ostensibly over undemarcated sections of the border -- a 
dispute that had simmered for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Saturday's outbreak of violence, the flash point was  
Badme, 450 miles north of the capital, Addis Ababa. Also identical 
were the accusations echoing from each capital accusing the other 
of instigating the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few weeks of air raids and artillery attacks that left  
up to 1,000 people dead, the conflict settled into sporadic 
skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the May-June clashes left Meles weaker than before.  
Hard-liners inside the TPLF accused the prime minister, who is 
half-Eritrean, of softness. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, he began demonstrating his mettle. Ethiopia began  
forcibly expelling residents of Eritrean descent and by October, 
Eritrean authorities claimed the number had exceeded 20,000. 
Ethiopian journalists who questioned the policy were jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	As outsider mediators led by the Organization of African Unity  
and the United States beat a path to Addis Ababa and Asmara, trying 
to settle the border dispute, each side beefed up its arsenal in 
expectation large-scale fighting would resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia reportedly stocked up with arms from China and Eritrea  
with weapons from the former Eastern bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	While both countries rearmed, they pledged their interest in  
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Meles recently declared his country had ``no deadline to launch  
war against Eritrea'' and Isaias said Eritrea would ``never fire 
the first bullet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no independent corroboration of which army began Saturday's  
fighting, it appears both leaders can claim they were right.

<HEADLINE> ACC Chief Urges Auburn Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The commissioner of the Atlantic Coast  
Conference wants his nine schools to boycott Auburn in every sport 
as punishment for canceling a Sept. 2 football game against Florida 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Auburn athletic director David Housel, ACC  
commissioner John Swofford called it ``absolutely reprehensible 
that a university the stature of Auburn would ever consider 
canceling a contracted football game that has been scheduled for 
national television less than seven months prior to kickoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles are scrambling to find a new opponent.  
</P>
<P>
	Housel, reached at his home late Monday night, said he ``would  
have no comment'' on the memo. Auburn is a member of the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC commissioner Roy Kramer said Monday night he was unaware of  
Swofford's memo and had no comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the way Auburn University is going to conduct its  
business, I feel it is my obligation as conference commissioner to 
ask all of our member institutions to seriously evaluate whether it 
makes sense to schedule Auburn in any sport,'' Swofford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel obtained a copy of Swofford's letter.  
</P>
<P>
	At least one school, Clemson, has future football games  
scheduled with Auburn. The schools hold contracts for four games 
from 2005 through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson associate athletic director Dwight Rainey said Sunday he  
didn't foresee the series being dropped, ``but there may be some 
slight changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey said Clemson coach Tommy Bowden was supposed to meet with  
Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville during a trip last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's brother, Terry, resigned as Auburn coach in the middle  
of last season. Last week, Auburn bought out its game next season 
with Florida State and its coach, Bobby Bowden, Tommy and Terry's 
father.

<P>
	``This is not a Tommy Bowden thing, it's a Clemson-Auburn  
thing,'' Rainey said in Monday's The Greenville News. ``Are we 
against playing Auburn? No, we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rainey said it may take six months to a year to resolve any  
Clemson concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	FSU is scheduled to return a basketball game to Auburn next  
year, and Seminoles coach Steve Robinson indicated last week he 
planned to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Swofford, who express-mailed the letter to Housel before Auburn  
made a final decision on canceling the game, said the ACC will 
demand an additional $850,000 -- the amount the league will lose if 
the Seminoles are unable to find an opponent suitable for ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just cannot conduct business this way,'' Swofford wrote.  
``It damages the entire enterprise of intercollegiate athletics. It 
is simply wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said they had received the letter before making a  
decision but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile Monday, FSU athletic director Dave Hart made the first  
of a series of phone calls to conferences and schools across the 
country, searching for an opponent. Pickings are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from eight major conferences -- SEC, Big Ten, Big 12,  
Pac-10, Big East, Mid-American, WAC and Conference USA -- said all 
their teams' schedules were completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult,'' said Hart, adding that FSU's Thursday  
night slot on ESPN was all but dead. ``Because of the calendar ... 
it goes without saying we're very short on time. We're up against 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Hopes for Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rod Stewart is hoping for a reconciliation  
with his wife of eight years, Rachel Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said in Monday's USA Today, ``it's all too early to  
tell. I'm not holding my breath. I'm moving on with my life, and 
she is moving on with hers. We'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in January, but the 54-year-old rocker  
insists: ``There is no animosity. There are no bad feelings. There 
is definitely no third party. We just needed a bit of space from 
each other. And her, especially, from me. She's lived under my wing 
for the last 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was a 21-year-old model when she married Stewart. They  
have two children ages 6 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Jacobson, Hunter's agent, did not immediately return a call  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> California To Execute Former Monk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) -- Lawyers failed on Monday to block the  
execution of a former Buddhist monk who killed two people during a 
1981 robbery but moved many with his remorse, humble manners and 
vivid art works. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaturun Siripongs exhausted his court appeals Monday night and  
was to be executed early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs, 43, was convicted of killing two people at an Asian  
market where he occasionally worked, manager Packovan Wattanaporn 
and clerk Quach Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
	He was caught trying to use Mrs. Wattanaporn's credit card and  
most of her stolen jewelry was traced to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs admitted taking part in the December 1981 robbery, but  
claimed an accomplice -- whom he never named -- committed the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs did, however, accept responsibility for his role in  
the crime, his lawyers said, offering daily penance ``for his 
deeds, for the shame he has brought his family and ancestors, and 
for the suffering he has brought to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his 16 years on death row, Siripongs won some unusual  
allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Guards described him as unfailingly polite and cooperative and  
former San Quentin State Prison Warden Daniel Vasquez, a strong 
supporter of the death penalty who presided over two executions, 
recommended clemency on the grounds that rewarding Siripongs' 
behavior would set a good example for other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs also drew praise for his art, with supporters putting  
on a one-man show in Oakland, displaying a diverse collection that 
included a solemn-faced child sucking a finger, a bowl of apples 
gleaming with a rich amber glow and a woman in Japanese dress 
tinted a delicate lavender. 
</P>
<P>
	Siripongs, who was born in Thailand, had his first brush with  
trouble in 1975, when he was shot in the head while robbing a 
department store. He was imprisoned but was released early for good 
behavior, going on to train briefly as a Buddhist monk.

<HEADLINE> Toymakers Free To Cut Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Unlike the child-to-doll talks of the past, when  
a kid speaks to My Best Friend, it won't be an imaginary 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Play-by-Play doll is capable of carrying on a limited  
conversation, thanks to voice-recognition technology. If she asks a 
question and a wrong answer is given, she will encourage the child 
to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	My Best Friend, on display at the American International Toy  
Fair beginning today, is just one example of the latest movement in 
the toy industry: It's technologically innovative and -- at about 
$40 -- inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to build a great toy, but it's hard to sell it at  
the right price,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at the 
investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``This year, we are seeing 
great use of technology at really affordable prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toymakers have stepped up their high-tech offerings in recent  
years to make playtime more entertaining and challenging for 
today's computer-literate kids. 
</P>
<P>
	But innovation hasn't always come cheap. In the past, these toys  
-- especially the most advanced -- have been expensive -- many selling 
in excess of $100, above what most value-conscious Americans will 
pay for a single toy. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering 1999, high-tech toy prices are going the way of  
computer prices: Better products for less. 
</P>
<P>
	``A (computer) chip you could buy in 1980 for $4,000 is now  
selling for under a $1,'' said Doug Glen, chief strategy officer at 
Mattel Inc., the world's biggest toymaker. ``None of us could do 
what we are doing now at a reasonable price just a few years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many toymakers also watched the success of Furby last year.  
Consumers were amazed with its ability to speak 800 words and 
phrases and actually interact with kids. Even though some shoppers 
spent thousands in a Christmas rush for the furry, Gizmo-like doll, 
the majority paid $30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of technology is to raise the bar on what is  
magical to kids,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy consultant. ``Furby 
managed to do just that and it was affordable -- a perfect 
combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toy fair offers a glimpse of what's to come, with many of  
the toys appearing on store shelves beginning in the second half of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Zowie Intertainment, has a line of three $50  
adventure CD-ROMs that are controlled by plastic playsets. In one 
of its titles, Redbeard's Pirate Quest, children navigate a ship on 
the computer screen by steering the wheel on the three-dimensional 
playset. Although the ship is connected to a computer port, the 
children manipulate characters on the screen by moving freestanding 
dolls around the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro has also come up with four new CD-ROM playsets, which  
retail for about $40 each. With the Playskool Store, for instance, 
kids place a template of a cash register over a computer keyboard 
and then interact at the checkout counter with on-screen shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Electronics' Sports Feel Tennis, $20, is a specially  
designed tennis racquet imbedded with a motion sensor that lets a 
player try a set of virtual tennis by timing her swing to the 
appropriate ball sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are looking for value when they buy toys, just like  
they do when they shop for everything else in their lives,'' said 
Bryne, the toy consultant. ``This year, they will find what they 
are looking for.''

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sign Pitcher Robinson Checo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Free agent Robinson Checo, who pitched last  
season for Boston, signed a one-year contract with the Detroit 
Tigers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Checo, 27, a right-hander, spent most of the past two seasons in  
the minors for Boston. He was 6-2 last season in Pawtucket with a 
4.56 ERA with 10 starts and one relief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-2 with a 9.30 ERA in two starts for Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	Checo, who pitched two seasons in Japan for Hiroshima, became a  
free agent after the Red Sox decided not to offer him a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers announced that infielder Alejandro Freire will not  
take part in spring training because of a shoulder injury sustained 
playing winter ball. Freire, 24, hit .275 with Double-A 
Jacksonville last season with 16 homers and 78 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Earns $80M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror Co. earned $80 million from  
continuing operations in the fourth quarter, handily beating Wall 
Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror reported net income of $246.3 million on revenue of  
$809.7 million in the three months ended Dec. 31. The earnings 
include an after-tax gain of $242 million from the sale of the 
medical publishing business Mosby Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the Mosby sale as well as assorted one-time charges  
against profits, the company earned 93 cents a share. A survey of 
Wall Street analysts by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of 
84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, the Los Angeles based company earned  
$77.4 million from continuing operations, excluding charges, or 79 
cents a share on revenue of $791.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Times Mirror's net income was $1.42 billion, or  
$16.06 per share, as a strong performances from the company's East 
Coast newspapers offset disappointing earnings from the flagship 
Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the Mosby sale and other charges, Times Mirror earned  
$253 million, or $2.66 share compared to 1997 earnings from 
continuing operations of $236.8 million, or $2.15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we met our earnings objectives and our Eastern  
newspapers had a particularly strong year, we did not achieve these 
results with the mix we expected,'' said Mark H. Willes, Times 
Mirror's chairman, president and chief executive officer and 
publisher of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1999, we expect continued earnings growth and to invest  
aggressively in the growth of our businesses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper publishing revenues rose 5.9 percent during 1998 to a  
record $2.3 billion, up from $2.2 billion during 1997. Advertising 
at Eastern newspapers, which include Newsday, The Baltimore Sun and 
The Hartford Courant, rose 6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report was released after trading had halted for  
day. Shares of Times Mirror rose 18 3/4 cents to $51.06 1/4 in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Work on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to move beyond impeachment, House  
Republicans are coalescing behind a four-point agenda but are torn 
over cutting taxes and whether to bust spending limits set just two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders used last week's three-day retreat for House GOP  
lawmakers in Williamsburg, Va., to galvanize support for 
buttressing Social Security, defense and education and cutting 
taxes. After losing five seats in last November's elections, 
Republicans said they need to aggressively emphasize their 
legislative goals if they are to retain House control in the 2000 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be talking about issues,'' Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,  
chairman of the House GOP's campaign arm, said Monday. ``We're 
perceived to be talking about one issue right now, impeachment, and 
that's not a popular issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton likely to  
end this week in acquittal, House GOP leaders hope to plunge 
quickly into budget and other legislative matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Williamsburg meetings found Republicans disagreeing over  
specifics, especially when it comes to the GOP's top-tier issue of 
cutting taxes, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blow to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,  
R-Ohio, many Republicans voiced opposition to his plan for cutting 
income-tax rates by 10 percent across the board. Some complained 
that the proposal would be an easy target for Democrats arguing 
that Republicans were helping the rich, since better off taxpayers 
would benefit most because they pay higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many conservatives prefer eliminating the so-called marriage  
penalty, under which millions of married people pay higher taxes 
than they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense that for an across-the-board reduction in  
rates, there's not a lot of support for that,'' said Rep. Jerry 
Weller, R-Ill., a sponsor of legislation to end the marriage 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Some moderates and conservatives prefer holding off on tax cuts  
and using the projected flood of annual budget surpluses to reduce 
the accumulated $5.6 trillion national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public understands this,'' said moderate Rep. Fred Upton,  
R-Mich. ``They don't want to see us spend the surplus away; they 
don't want to see it all on tax cuts either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across-the-board tax cuts have been endorsed by Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	But key segments of the GOP's base prefer other, more targeted  
alternatives. Small business and farmers would like elimination of 
estate taxes, while religious conservatives favor erasing the 
marriage penalty. Indeed, leaders of the Family Research Council 
and other pro-family groups planned a news conference for Tuesday 
touting elimination of the marriage penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said internal GOP polls showed across-the-board cuts were  
more popular than other alternatives. But he also acknowledged that 
private Republican polls track public surveys showing that tax cuts 
are a low priority when people are asked how budget surpluses 
should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a Pew poll two weeks ago, when people were asked  
what to do with the surplus, half favored using it for Social 
Security, a fifth favored using it for domestic spending, one in 
seven favored tax cuts and the rest preferred paying off the 
national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason is, we're not talking about it,'' Davis said. ``We  
need to have a message, to stay on it, hammer it home and produce 
legislatively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, a potential GOP presidential candidate, hopes his  
committee will vote on a 2000 budget by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute also rages over whether to exceed spending limits  
enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing pact with President Clinton. 
That agreement set a $536 billion limit for fiscal 2000, which 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for this year ended up nearly $30 billion above that  
amount. That combined with both parties' desires to boost defense 
and maybe education spending next year is putting pressure on 
lawmakers to exceed that cap -- a tough political spot for a GOP 
that for years has insisted on cutting spending and shrinking 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the issue that generates a lot of heat,'' acknowledged  
Rep. Robert Ehrlich, R-Md. ``It's where the budget hawks and 
defense hawks kind of run into one another.''

<HEADLINE> Goebel Eyes National Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As the first and only American in  
skating's elite quad squad, Timothy Goebel wants to jazz up his 
resume even more before he puts his skates away for good. 
</P>
<P>
	A national title would be nice. So would one from the world  
championships. And there's no question an Olympic gold medal would 
go very nicely in his medals case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd definitely like to be known for more than a quad  
someday,'' the first American to land the four-revolution jump in 
competition said Monday after practice for this week's U.S. Figure 
Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think it's really an honor to be the first to do  
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he was an up-and-comer, Goebel was somewhat of a surprise  
entry into the quad derby. The quad has been around for a while -- 
at least a dozen skaters have officially done it in competition 
since four-time world champion Kurt Browning landed the first in 
1988 -- but the U.S. men have struggled to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weiss came close to landing it at nationals the past two  
years, and many expected he'd be the first American to do it. But 
then came Goebel at the Junior Series Final last March in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in Lausanne, no one knew quite what to expect.  
He'd missed about three months of practice after injuring a hip. 
forcing him to withdraw from both the 1998 Junior World 
Championships and the U.S. nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been injured and missing the nationals and also missing  
the junior worlds, I knew that I really needed something to get 
back into the swing of things,'' Goebel said. ``I definitely think 
that did it for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was he the first American to land the quad in  
competition, he was the first skater to land a quadruple salchow. 
Every other recognized quad has been a toe loop. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need something to be noticed,'' said Carol Heiss Jenkins,  
his coach. ``For Timmy to be the first American to land a quad in 
competition and then be the first ever to land the quad salchow, it 
makes people notice him. All of the sudden it's, `What's his 
name?''' 
</P>
<P>
	But Goebel hasn't had much luck duplicating his success this  
season. He was 12th at the Cup of Russia, his worst finish in more 
than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was disastrous,'' he said. ``I got there and I never really  
got my feet under me. So when I went out to compete, I never felt 
comfortable with anything there and that's how I skated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So despite having his name in the record books and doing  
something no one else in the country has, the pressure's off Goebel 
this week. Weiss, who finished second to five-time U.S. champion 
Todd Eldredge the past two years, is favored to win. 
</P>
<P>
	And Goebel is just one of several other skaters who could wind  
up on the medals stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a perfectionist and I think he has expectations of  
himself,'' Heiss Jenkins said. ``But that's the only pressure he 
really has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel plans to do the quad salchow again in his free skate, but  
said he's been working more on the artistic side of his programs 
this year. His short program, to music from ``Zorba,'' is filled 
with intricate hand movements and steps that are sure to boost his 
artistic marks. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also been working with Alexander Zhulin, a silver medalist  
in ice dance at the Lillehammer Olympics and bronze medalist in 
Albertville, in addition to longtime choreographer Glyn Watts. The 
three have spent hours, both on the ice and off, trying to make the 
18-year-old more expressive and improve his artistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to skate well enough here to be known as someone  
who can be more than just a jumper,'' he said. ``As impressive as 
(the quad) is and as difficult as it is to do, if you land the quad 
and miss every other jump in the program, it's not going to do you 
a bit of good. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to go out and put out a full program. It's the  
whole package they're looking for, not one jump.''

<HEADLINE> NYC Protests Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a matter of seconds, four white police  
officers from the elite Street Crime Unit fired 41 shots at an 
unarmed man, a black West African immigrant who had no police 
record and spoke with a stutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a street peddler described as religious and  
hard-working, was hit 19 times and died instantly Thursday in the 
vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' lawyer says Diallo gestured with his hands,  
leading the police to think he was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officers themselves were the only witnesses, and now  
Amnesty International and the NAACP are demanding explanations, and 
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said federal prosecutors are reviewing 
the case for possible civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting has also brought renewed scrutiny to the Street  
Crime Unit, which has been criticized before for its aggressive 
tactics. The unit is assigned to seek out and stop crime before it 
happens. Its motto is ``We Own the Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mayor Rudolph Giuliani nor Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir will say anything substantial about the case, which is under 
investigation by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Outraged residents held a rally on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not anti-police,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ``We are  
anti-police brutality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. said Monday: ``When I went to  
the house and I saw how many holes were in the walls, it made me 
sick to my stomach,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the police force also cited the alleged torture of  
Haitian immigrant Abner Louima at a police station in 1997. Four 
white officers have been charged with attacking the black man, who 
was sodomized with the handle of a toilet plunger. 
</P>
<P>
	The plainclothes officers who shot Diallo had been looking for a  
rape-murder suspect when they encountered the 22-year-old immigrant 
at about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some similarities between this individual and the  
sketch we have,'' the police commissioner said. ``But beyond that -- 
what was in their minds, whether they thought this was that 
individual -- I really don't know, and it would be unfair to

</P>
<P>
	Two of the officers fired 16 bullets each, emptying their 9 mm,  
semiautomatic handguns in less than five seconds. The others fired 
their similar guns four and five times. They were standing about 15 
feet from Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly believed he was in possession of a gun,'' said  
the officers' attorney, Stephen Worth. Worth said Diallo moved his 
hands, and may not have understood the officers' commands. Family 
and friends said Diallo spoke English well but slowly, with a 
stutter. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were placed on administrative duty, a routine step  
in shooting investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Street Crime Unit officers fired on rapper ODB  
during a traffic stop, thinking he had a gun. No weapon was found 
and a grand jury refused to indict ODB on attempted murder charges. 
No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the Police Department itself, a group of officers called  
100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care has demanded the unit be 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something is wrong with our street crime behavior and the  
Street Crime Unit,'' said Lt. Eric Adams, president of the group. 
``And if it is not examined, we will continue to have episodes such 
as this. And I believe as long as the ethnicity of the victims does 
not change, you will not see a change in the policy of the police 
department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's friends and relatives described him as a devout Muslim,  
a hard-working man who did not smoke or drink and loved Michael 
Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to New York two years ago from the village of Lelouma,  
Guinea, and made his living selling scarves, hats, socks and 
videotapes in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never had any trouble back in our country with the  
police,'' said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo. ``Never! He should not 
have been killed here by police -- he was a hard-working, nice, 
honest man.''

<HEADLINE> Stroh Sells Its Beer Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Stroh Brewery Co. is selling its beer brands to  
Pabst Brewing Co. and Miller Brewing Co. to concentrate on its real 
estate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deals announced today, Pabst will acquire the Stroh's,  
Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, Schaefer, Old Style, Schmidt's, Lone Star, 
Special Export, McSorley's, Schlitz Malt Liquor, and Ranier brands. 
Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., is buying Stroh's Henry 
Weinhard's and Mickeys brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Pabst, based in San Antonio, is the nation's fifth-largest  
brewer. In addition to buying the biggest Stroh brands, it also is 
buying a brewery in Lehigh Valley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, based in Milwaukee, is the No. 2 brewer after industry  
leader, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Stroh, headquartered in Detroit, is the nation's fourth-largest  
brewer with about 2,800 employees nationwide. In addition to Lehigh 
Valley, its breweries are in Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Longview, 
Texas; Winston-Salem, N.C.; and La Crosse, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon to know how many employees will be affected, said  
Stroh spokeswoman Lacey Logan. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get closer to the close, we'll have a better  
understanding of how many people will be impacted, and when,'' she 
said. ``It's our understanding that both Pabst and Miller planned 
to offer full-time employment to full-time employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deals are expected to be completed in early April, and are  
subject to antitrust review by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I struggled with this decision,'' said John  
Stroh III, the company's president and chief executive officer and 
a fifth-generation member of the Stroh family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotionally, it was an extremely difficult one to make,  
knowing that it would impact our loyal employees, and recognizing 
that it would mean the end of our family's centuries-old brewing 
tradition that had become, in essence, an important part of our 
identity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh said no previous offers had been ``compelling enough to  
pursue'' in light of the family's brewing heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, in light of this attractive offer, and the long-term  
competitive outlook of the brewing industry, we concluded that it 
is the appropriate time to exit the beer business and focus on the 
family's other ventures,'' he said. Stroh has real estate interests 
throughout Detroit and across the country.

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Elderly Couple's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEAWOOD, Kan. (AP) -- A 79-year-old man was charged with murder  
Monday after he allegedly beat an elderly couple with a baseball 
bat in what authorities are describing as a love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Patrick Doyle was charged with killing 77-year-old  
Lawrence Kubik, who died Saturday of injuries suffered during the 
attack Thursday. Marguerite Bacher-Kubik, 77, was hospitalized in 
fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who were high school sweethearts, married others but  
were both widowed within the last few years. They married in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle lived nearby and was a friend of Mrs. Bacher-Kubik.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just kind of a strange deal, one of those weird  
love-triangle situations,'' prosecutor Paul Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle was being held on $2 million bond and could face a minimum  
of 25 years in prison. He also is charged with attempted murder and 
burglary. Doyle has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	He is accused of sneaking into the couple's home and beating  
Kubik with a baseball bat while he slept in his bedroom. Mrs. 
Bacher-Kubik was able to call 911 from a bathroom telephone before 
she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle and Mrs. Bacher-Kubik were friends, said Doyle's lawyer,  
James Anderson. After her first husband died in 1995, it wasn't 
unusual for neighbors to see Doyle picking dandelions from her 
front yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Mr. Doyle would never wish any harm to anyone,''  
Anderson said at Doyle's first court appearance Friday. ``I know 
that he is sorry that anything ever happened to Mr. Kubik.''

	Clinton Trial Deliberations Are Next  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators on Tuesday are expected to begin  
deliberating the fate of Bill Clinton's presidency. But prospects 
for opening those deliberations to the public faded when GOP 
Majority Leader Trent Lott backed privacy. Voting on whether to 
oust Clinton is expected Thursday or Friday. Final arguments in the 
case ended on Monday. House managers urged the conviction of the 
president of obstruction of justice and perjury as a way to 
``cleanse the office.'' However, Clinton's lawyer dismissed the 
case as Republican politics.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A Guatemalan court on Monday convicted  
three men of rape and robbery in a 1998 attack on visiting American 
students. The judge sentenced each defendant to 28 years in prison. 
Thirteen students and three faculty members from St. Mary's College 
of Maryland were robbed and five women were raped when the bus they 
were traveling in was pulled over at gunpoint near Santa Lucia.

and three ex-U.S. presidents. So were Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose presence 
at the same event was unprecedented. King Abdullah, who vows to

Yugoslavia's borders unchanged. More than 2,000 people have died 
and about 300,000 have been driven from their homes in a year of

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Lawyers Weigh Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson's lawyers considered Monday whether  
to let him serve his one-year sentence for assault or appeal and 
risk even more jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, who spent his third full day in protective custody at  
Montgomery County, Md., jail, was sentenced Friday for kicking one 
man and striking another after a fender bender in suburban 
Gaithersburg, Md., in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he neither contested the  
charges nor admitted guilt -- in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion remained in a private cell ``for  
his own protection'' and cannot ask for a bond hearing unless an 
appeal is filed, said prosecutor Douglas Gansler. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence by District Court Judge Stephen Johnson could mean  
the end of the career of the 32-year-old boxer, once on course to 
become one of the greatest heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers must decide within 30 days of the sentencing  
whether his career would be further jeopardized by an appeal. A 
Circuit Court judge could then decide not to accept the no-contest 
plea and order a trial by jury. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, Tyson would not only have another conviction on  
his record but would again be subject to Maryland sentencing 
guidelines that call for a jail term of three to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a conviction would worsen Tyson's standing in  
Indiana and Nevada. Indiana authorities must decide whether Tyson 
violated his probation for a 1992 rape conviction, and Nevada 
boxing authorities could revoke Tyson's boxing license for the 
second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk of an appeal was discussed by Tyson's lawyers on  
Monday, a source inside the office of lawyer Paul Kemp told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Kemp nor Tyson's other attorney, Robert Greenberg,  
returned calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler, who led the call for jail time for Tyson, said the  
boxer could be fighting again in 1999 under his sentence if he 
behaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a strong argument to be made that he's better off not  
appealing,'' Gansler said. ``If he were treated like any ordinary 
prisoner, like he has been, he would be in the jail about two to 
three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Tyson could be transferred to a pre-release center,  
a sort of halfway house where he could leave during the day to go 
to work and return at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be in the system about nine months,'' Gansler said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, Judge Patricia Gifford, who presided over Tyson's  
rape trial, is awaiting paperwork from Maryland before ruling on 
whether he violated probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Glaze, secretary for Gifford, said the papers are expected  
in a few days, and until then no action can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything new right now,'' she said. ``We're just  
still waiting.''

<HEADLINE> Escapee Gets 10 Days in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A man who fled a jail work detail in  
1974 and was a model citizen until the law finally caught up with 
him last fall was sentenced Monday to just 10 days behind bars for 
the escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been looking over your shoulder for long enough,''  
Circuit Judge Charles Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred Odell Martin III, 49, could have gotten five years in  
prison for the escape. He pleaded guilty last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who is from the Detroit suburb of Livonia, is already  
serving a one-year jail sentence for his original marijuana 
conviction. But he has been held for more than two months and could 
be released early for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some deterrence is needed, but not a great deal in your  
case,'' the judge told him. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 friends and relatives broke into applause in the  
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did wrong, but I've been good,'' Martin told the judge. His  
voice broke as he said, ``I am glad to be here today to be relieved 
of a burden I've carried too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Joan Ziglar had maintained that Martin should get  
time behind bars to send a message to other inmates that they can't 
walk away and expect leniency. However, she didn't recommend a 
specific sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was just about two days into his one-year sentence when  
he left a jail work-crew on Feb. 13, 1974, and fled to Michigan. 
Martin probably would have spent only about three months in jail on 
the conviction, for selling $10 worth of marijuana to a police 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he fled the work crew to take care of his wife, a  
recent immigrant from the Caribbean, and their baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia first sought his extradition in 1974, but then-Gov.  
William Milliken of Michigan effectively granted Martin legal 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Had he not been caught driving with expired license plates in  
Michigan last November, and if Virginia had not pressed for 
extradition, Martin would still be working at a mortgage company 
and living with his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his extradition, Martin was praised by a judge in  
Detroit as an ``exemplary'' citizen whose family was ``a credit to 
Michigan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge William Cahalan also said he had to honor Virginia's  
request because of recent court rulings preventing a governor from 
blocking an extradition.

<HEADLINE> Arbitration Sought in AmWest Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The National Mediation Board has given America  
West Airlines and its flight attendants a choice: submit to binding 
arbitration or face a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the board asked the two sides to enter into  
arbitration. If either side rejects it, the clock starts ticking 
for a 30-day cooling off period after which the flight attendants 
are free to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack would not comment beyond  
confirming the airline had received a letter from the mediation 
board asking that it enter arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Ramsey, vice president of the America West Association of  
Flight Attendants, said local and international union officials 
would begin deciding today whether to accept the arbitration offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has offered arbitration in the past, but the airline  
has not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	After 1 1/2 years of mediation, the union and the company remain  
$16.5 million apart on salary and per diem issues, Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 30-day cooling off period expires without a contract, the  
flight attendants have already authorized a series of random 
strikes called Creating Havoc Around Our System -- or CHAOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than a mass walk-off, the flight attendants would simply  
not show up for randomly selected flights. 
</P>
<P>
	America West's 2,100 flight attendants have been without a  
contract since voting to unionize in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants the average pay of the top 10 airlines -- an  
increase in the top pay scale from $21,972 to $32,724. The airline 
has said flight attendants are paid an average of $22,856 annually 
for 115 hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendants also want to receive the same per diem rates as  
the pilots, $1.80 per hour away from their base city. The 
attendants currently get no per diem. 
</P>
<P>
	America West Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1994  
and has since become profitable. America West Holdings Corp., the 
airline's parent company, earned $108.6 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, America West has been the subject of buyout talks.  
United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, has acknowledged it 
is talking to the carrier. Delta Air Lines has also been mentioned 
as a potential suitor.

<HEADLINE> The NBA Gets Off on the Wrong Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is why people say if you can make it there, you can make it  
anywhere: 
</P>
<P>
	While the NBA's opening weekend left little doubt that players  
will be scraping off rust -- and pounds -- for some time to come, the 
Madison Square Garden faithful are already in midseason form. And 
they wasted precious little time letting the Knicks know how they 
feel about the team's most controversial addition. 
</P>
<P>
	We're not talking about Latrell Sprewell, whose debut Sunday in  
New York was probably his worst game ever as a pro. Nor Marv 
Albert, who didn't choke anyone, but who was back in the building 
doing play-by-play on the radio less than 18 months after pleading 
guilty to biting a former lover. 
</P>
<P>
	No. Instead, the New Yorkers rained Bronx cheers down on the  
Knicks City Dancers, whose sin apparently was adding a half-dozen 
men to its previously all-female dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
	This shortened season could wind up proving just how much of a  
virtue patience truly is. Even though the home team wound up losing 
83-79 to hated Miami and its evil genius-coach, Pat Riley, Knicks 
fans can take comfort knowing that their male dancers are good 
enough to start for some other NBA teams -- the Los Angeles 
Clippers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
	Proving that some things never change, the Clips fell to 0-2  
Sunday night after getting beat by the Bulls. This was not as easy 
as it sounds. Not only was Chicago without Michael Jordan, Scottie 
Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, etc., the holdovers 
and throw-ins general manager Jerry Krause rented uniforms to 
barely got any practice time together. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorable start to their title defense, the Bulls didn't  
have enough players signed the day training camp opened to hold a 
decent scrimmage. Not that they needed to practice. In its first of 
two exhibition games, Chicago came back from 18 points down against 
Indiana, everybody's preseason favorite, to close within six in the 
final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls wound up getting beat, but the crowd at the United  
Center was so impressed by the hustle it gave a standing ovation to 
the five players who were on the court during that surge. Afraid 
that people might not give him enough credit for the rebuilding 
effort, Krause promptly cut every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Where he goes from here is anyone's guess. But if the Bulls keep  
winning, look for the Toni Kukoc-to-Phoenix-for-the-gorilla trade 
rumor to become reality. 
</P>
<P>
	So what else can we actually glean from the opening round of  
games? A few things: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Desperate as the league is for entertainment and some teams  
are for warm bodies, Rodman is still having a hard time finding 
work. Mr. Bad-As-I-Wanna-Be hasn't found a coach yet who thinks the 
same way. Rodman says he wants to play, but more than ever his 
sincerity is open to question. Could be because he said he wanted 
to be married to Carmen Electra, too, and we all know how that is 
turning out. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Compressing the schedule so that teams play two or three games  
in as many nights sounded like a good way to jack up intensity 
right from the start. Put into practice, it could turn out to be 
too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloppy play and combustible temperaments are not a good fit.  
Some players' legs are wobbly, others have stomachs hanging over 
the waistband of their shorts. But the nerves of more than a few 
are already stretched tighter than piano wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and New Jersey played each other on consecutive nights.  
Saturday night, they combined for 72 fouls and Hawks center Dikembe 
Mutombo broke the nose of Nets forward Jayson Williams with his 
elbow. Though it appeared accidental, Mutombo had done the same 
thing to Cleveland's Vitaly Potapenko in Atlanta's opener Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was this interesting coincidence: Mutombo, a  
client of agent David Falk, was one of more active -- not to mention 
hawkish -- members of the players' union bargaining team. Williams 
was one of the union's most identifiable dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, it was New Jersey's Kendall Gill and Atlanta's Steve Smith  
who wanted to mix it up. After they had words during the game, the 
two had to be separated by officials on the court and by Georgia 
State Police officers in a corridor outside the locker room 
afterward. Gill denied that he and Smith were fighting.

	``Man,'' he said. ``we were just dancing.''

that in a few NBA towns, the natives are restless for entertainment 
and prepared, if need be, to take matters into their own hands.

<HEADLINE> Reds Win Quezada Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds were the secret winners of  
the auction for negotiating rights for Alejandro Quezada, a 
21-year-old Dominican outfielder who played in Japan last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds agreed to pay $400,001 to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp if  
they sign Quezada, according to a pair of baseball sources who 
spoke on the condition they not be identified. They have until 
March 2 to work out a deal with Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada, who hit .311 in 61 at-bats in 34 games last season, is  
seeking a contract comparable to those of recent top first-round 
picks in the amateur draft, about $2.5 million, according to the 
sources. His agents, Michael Moline and Donald Bertucio, did not 
wish to discuss the matter publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a quality player,'' Reds assistant general manager Doc  
Rodgers said. ``We've seen him on videotape, our scouts have seen 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've looked ahead at the draft and where we're going to pick,  
and he might be superior at his position to someone we would be 
able to get,'' Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada was showcased to scouts, assistant general managers and  
some GMs in the Dominican Republic during the offseason. He is 
projected as a corner outfielder and most probably would start at 
Double-A or Triple-A this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants and Texas Rangers were  
also said to be interested, but it was not known what other teams 
bid. Only the Reds and Carp were notified of the winning bid; the 
other major league teams were kept in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the early talks we've had, he wants to play ball in the  
United States,'' Rodgers said. ``He's highly motivated to get a 
deal done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quezada is the first player made available under a new agreement  
signed last month by commissioner Bud Selig and the Japanese 
commissioner's office. Under the terms of the agreement, if a 
Japanese team is willing to make a player available, it notifies 
the major league commissioner's office, which then tells the 30 
major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams then bid, and the Japanese club has the option to  
accept or reject the winner, who then gets 30 days to sign the 
player. If the player doesn't sign, the major league team doesn't 
have to pay, and the Japanese team can't make the player available 
again until the following November. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, players under contract with Japanese teams who  
wanted to move to the majors had to be released by their club, had 
their rights sold to a major league team or become eligible for 
free agency.

<HEADLINE> After Westminster, Top Dogs Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Competing at the Westminster Kennel Club Show is  
the pinnacle of a show dog's career. Sometimes, it's the end of it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,500 dogs seeking honors Monday and Tuesday at the 123rd  
annual show already were recognized as champions -- it's a 
requirement before they're allowed to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder it's a tradition that Westminster best-in-show winners  
retire. After all, when you've been named best of the best, what's 
left to win? 
</P>
<P>
	Most go on to perpetuating the breed -- in other words, making  
puppies. Last year's best in show, the Norwich terrier Fairewood 
Frolic, was already expecting a litter when she stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
	For others, things aren't so clear cut.  
</P>
<P>
	Some dogs return to Westminster several times in hopes of  
winning the big prize. This year, three of the seven best-in-group 
winners from 1998 are taking another shot. 
</P>
<P>
	One, the standard poodle Lake Cove That's My Boy, was off to a  
good start Monday, handily winning his breed competition in the 
early afternoon and the non-sporting group title that night for the 
second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old dog has only been showing for 1 1/2 years, but  
already has had a stellar career. One of many Westminster winners 
owned by Mrs. Alan Robson, he's also already started a family and 
in fact competed against one of his sons Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done pretty incredible for a year and a half,'' handler  
Dennis McCoy said. ``He's sired best-in-show winners all over the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dog, called Treson or Tre at home, will face stiff  
competition for best-in-show from Monday's toy group winner, Loteki 
Supernatural Being. The all-time top-winning papillon not only won 
his group at the 1996 Westminster show, but finished second that 
year for best-in-show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other group winners included a Welsh terrier owned by comedian  
Bill Cosby with Jean Heath and Beth Bates. Sunspryte's Just In 
Thyme, 10 days away from her second birthday, was one of two Cosby 
dogs to finish the terrier group in the ribbons; Revelry's Awesome 
Blossom, a Lakeland terrier owned by Cosby and Heath, came in 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group winner was Mentmore's Windy Meadow, a  
3-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog owned by Cheryl Paterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting, herding and hound group winners will be named Tuesday  
night before Westminster ends with selection of the best dog in 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the end as well for the papillon, called Kirby, a  
grizzled veteran at 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his last hurrah,'' owner-handler John Oulton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Should Treson win, it would certainly be a help to his humans,  
who haven't decided yet whether to retire the dog or keep going. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided we're going to wait until after the show to discuss  
what tomorrow brings,'' McCoy said. ``Tuesday night, after it's all 
over, we'll sit down, have a drink and say `Where do we go from 
here?''' 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy's fate is more clear. He will soon leave dog handling  
behind, applying to become a group judge for either the toy or 
non-sporting breeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always said we'd like to retire when I was 50, and that was  
last year. But we had this dog,'' he said. ``What do you do? Onward 
you go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For other owners and handlers, the decisions aren't so  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Zebec's Viveca Glitz was resting easily after being named the  
best Italian greyhound, the pressure off even though she still had 
to go through the toy group competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner-handler Carl Sanders didn't expect her to win, and wasn't  
disappointed when she didn't: ``I'm happy to be here. (Winning) the 
breed means so much here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His little dog, called Vivey, has already won plenty. She was  
the top Italian greyhound in 1997 and came in second on the show 
circuit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she'll go home with Sanders to Houston and start a family.  
He plans to breed her in June. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll also live a more traditional dog's life.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's a wonderful bed dog,'' Sanders joked. ``She really is a  
best friend.''

<HEADLINE> U.S, Warns Terrorist-Harbor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is stepping up its  
drive against international terrorists with a threat to bomb 
government facilities in countries that shelter the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not just go in a strike against a terrorist facility;  
we may choose to retaliate against the facilities of the host 
country, if that host country is a knowing, cooperative 
sanctuary,'' says Richard Clarke, President Clinton's coordinator 
for counterterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The toughened stance, disclosed by Clarke, in an Associated  
Press interview last week, is a departure from the tactics employed 
last August when U.S. cruise missiles struck at alleged terrorist 
strongholds in Afghanistan and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration now contends it could broaden such an attack  
to include government buildings and assets in nations that 
knowingly harbor terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and other U.S. officials have repeatedly warned nations  
that protect terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries that persistently host terrorists have no right to  
be safe havens,'' the president said last Aug. 20, the day the 
United States launched scores of cruise missiles at suspected 
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	But before Clarke spoke, no administration official had made an  
explicit threat that host governments may find their own facilities 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Had this tactic been employed in the August strikes, the United  
States might have, for example, targeted Sudan's government 
buildings or the Afghan Taliban party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the scores of cruise missiles were targeted carefully  
to avoid government facilities and were aimed at the alleged 
terrorist assets of Osama bin Laden. The administration alleges 
that the exiled Saudi millionaire was behind the bombings last 
summer of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. official said the missiles struck a remote ``terrorist  
university'' in Afganistan. In Khartoum, Sudan, cruise missiles 
struck a privately owned pharmaceutical plant suspected of 
producing a precursor to the deadly nerve gas VX. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials emphasized at the time that the missile  
strikes were not aimed at the governments of Sudan and Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go after those governments' facilities, but those  
governments need to know that if they continue to be a sanctuary, 
that they are now at risk, not just the terrorist facilities in 
those countries,'' Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials caution that a president seeking to use force against  
a terrorist sanctuary government would face a high burden to show 
that the target government willingly tolerated a terrorist 
presence. The added risk of collateral damage or excessive 
casualties would add political and moral complications. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say they don't consider it a change in  
U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Clarke's comments appear to remove the distinction  
between cases where a nation believed actively involved in 
terrorism is struck, such as Iraq or Libya, and countries that 
merely allow terrorists to operate within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the administration distinguishes between nations that 
``willingly abetted sanctuary as opposed to those that provided 
sanctuary because they didn't control that piece of their 
backyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is known to have terrorist camps in the Philippines,  
for example. The difference, according to State Department 
spokesman James Foley, is that the Philippines and other friendly 
governments cooperate with the United States fighting terrorism. 
Sudan and Afghanistan have refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	In negotiations last week with the Taliban, U.S. envoy Rick  
Inderfurth did not raise the specter of strikes on Taliban assets 
while discussing bin Laden, who is believed to be in Afghanistan, 
said a State Department official who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tucker, author of a classified report on terrorism while  
at the Pentagon under Presidents Bush and Clinton, said the 
administration's policy on terrorist sanctuaries has roots in 
international law on an enemy that seeks sanctuary in a neutral 
country. This argument was used to justify the U.S. invasion of 
Cambodia in 1970 during the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Prairie View, Southern Reconcile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A meeting Monday between officials from  
Prairie View A&AMP;M and Southern universities reconciled tensions 
which had existed since the schools' marching bands fought during a 
football game last September. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting coincided with a gathering of all presidents of the  
Southwestern Athletic Conference's 10 member schools to discuss a 
proposed SWAC football championship game for next fall and the 
league's proposed television package. 
</P>
<P>
	``The matter of the Prairie View-Southern band incident is now  
closed,'' said William Harris, president of Alabama State 
University and president of the SWAC Council of Presidents. ``There 
are no animosities existing between the two schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bands from both schools were placed on a two-game suspension  
following the brawl Sept. 19 at Beaumont, Texas, but the Prairie 
View band sat out just one week before taking the field for an Oct. 
3 game against Grambling State. 
</P>
<P>
	A SWAC committee subsequently upheld the suspension of Prairie  
View, which said it could have faced an $80,000 contractual penalty 
if its band failed to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Prairie View inferred it might quit the conference.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we close the book on an incident that has occupied too  
much of our time,'' said Charles A. Hines, Prairie View's 
president. ``We support the SWAC and each university of the SWAC 
and we'll continue to do so in the future. Prairie View isn't 
considering leaving the conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Jackson, Southern's chancellor, concurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want to underscore the fact that this matter is finished  
and behind us. The good thing that has come about as a result of 
this matter is that we've discovered that we have a lot more in 
common than we thought we did before,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' Mims Signs Two-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Defensive lineman Chris Mims signed a two-year  
contract Monday to stay with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims, a reserve who can play end or tackle, had two sacks and  
six tackles in 1998 while playing just six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims rejoined the Chargers last year after spending one season  
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers drafted Mims in the first round in 1992 and  
released him on April 14, 1997.

<HEADLINE> China Postpones Airplane Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese airlines, hurt by slumping growth in  
traffic, will freeze the size of their fleets for two years and 
postpone deliveries of new planes, the Chinese government 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Monday is a setback for aircraft makers that  
looked to China's booming travel industry for growth as sales in 
other markets flatten. Airbus Industries of Europe said its sales 
in China will fall by about 17 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines will take delivery of 43 planes this year, but retire  
more than 40 older aircraft in an attempt to cut overcapacity, the 
China Daily newspaper reported. A Chinese aviation official said 
airlines had been told not to buy or lease aircraft next year or in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Though robust by Asian standards, passenger traffic growth of  
6.3 percent last year was down dramatically from 30 percent growth 
rates seen in previous years, according to the China Daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus and its U.S. rival, Boeing, have wooed buyers in China  
eagerly, at one point sending their boards of directors to meet 
senior leaders in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus said Monday it expects to deliver 21 aircraft worth a  
total of $1 billion this year, down from $1.2 billion in Chinese 
sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know exactly how many airlines will try to  
renegotiate this year, but the number now requesting postponement 
is small,'' said Airbus spokesman Jonathan Dong. 
</P>
<P>
	China Eastern Airlines, based in Shanghai, will postpone  
delivery of two aircraft worth a total of $90 million, while a 
number of smaller deals are delayed, Dong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus doesn't expect the slowdown to last and is forecasting  
$130 billion in sales between 1998 and 2017, or about $6.5 billion 
a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``China still represents the highest global growth in terms of  
traffic over the next 20 years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Boeing weren't available for comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. manufacturer signed $3 billion in contracts during a  
visit to the United States by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	To help ailing airlines, aviation authorities also say they will  
cut the number of air routes to fill more seats and boost profits.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo Courts 2010 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Ravaged by war and bearing  
little resemblance to the city that staged the 1984 Olympics, 
Sarajevo wants to hold the Winter Games in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bosnian Olympic Committee announced its intentions Monday,  
the 15th anniversary of the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	All the facilities built for those games were destroyed by  
shells and gunfire that rained on the city from 1992 until the end 
of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A broadcast Monday recorded the words of IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch at the 1984 closing ceremony: ``See you again, 
dear Sarajevo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was a statement from Bogic Bogicevic, the head of  
the Bosnian Olympic Committee: ``The candidacy for the Olympic 
Games 2010 will be officially announced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site of the 2006 Winter Olympics will be determined in June  
and the 2010 Games in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for it,'' said Sadik Hadzisadikovic, 64. ``All of these  
ruins would be repaired. It could again be a tourist's paradise,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the only foreign visitors to Bosnia are those who come to  
help rebuild the land. And they are the ones who visit the former 
Olympic sites on both sides of the boundary that divided Sarajevo 
under the 1995 peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The partitioning of Bosnia -- the Bosnian Serb republic and the  
Muslim-Croat federation -- left many Sarajevan skiers deprived of 
their favorite mountain Jahorina, now under Bosnian Serb control. 
</P>
<P>
	They crowd the only two ski lifts, recently rebuilt, on Mounts  
Igman and Bjelasnica that are under Muslim-Croat control. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the slope carved in the forest, yellow tape on both sides  
marks areas not checked for mines. At the first substation of the 
Igman ski lift, there is a sign warning, ``Don't step down. 
Mines!!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The start of the bobsled run on Mt. Trebevic is now in the  
Bosnian Serb entity and the finish in federation territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's pride, the Zetra sports arena for figure skating and  
speed skating, is being rebuilt and scheduled to reopen at the end 
of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena will get its copper roof back. But next to the hall,  
in a soccer field, is a surrounding sea of graves. The nearby 
graveyard expanded during the war.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Closing Arguements-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Monday's closing arguments in the impeachment  
trial against President Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``When this trial began four long weeks ago, we said that what  
was on trial was the truth and the rule of law. That has not 
changed despite the lengthy legal arguments you have heard. The 
truth is still the truth, and a lie is still a lie, and the rule of 
law should apply to everyone, no matter what excuses are made by 
the president's defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news media characterizes the managers as 13 angry men.  
They are right in that we are angry, but they are dead wrong about 
what we are angry about. We have not spent long hours poring 
through the evidence, sacrificed time with our families, and 
subjected ourselves to intense political criticism to further a 
political vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done so because of our love for this country and  
respect for the office of the presidency, regardless of who may 
hold it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done so because of our devotion to the rule of law and  
our fear that if the president does not suffer the legal and 
constitutional consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing 
the president to stand above the law will be felt for generations 
to come'' -- Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial was not caused by Kenneth Starr, who only did his  
duty under a law which President Clinton himself signed. It was not 
caused by the House Judiciary Committee's review of the independent 
counsel's mountain of evidence, nor was it caused by the House of 
Representatives approving two articles of impeachment, nor by the 
Senate conducting a trial mandated by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what some may say, this constitutional crisis  
was caused by William Jefferson Clinton and by no one else. 
President Clinton's actions and his actions alone have caused the 
national agenda for the past year to be almost exclusively 
concentrated on those actions and what consequences the president 
and the president alone must suffer for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial is not about the president's affair with Monica  
Lewinsky. It is about the perjury and obstruction of justice he 
committed during the course of a civil rights lawsuit filed against 
him and the subsequent independent counsel investigation authorized 
by Attorney General Janet Reno.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's defenders and spin doctors would have you  
believe that the president told all these lies under oath to 
protect himself and his family from personal embarrassment. And 
even if he did tell a lie, it was not that bad a lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators, please remember that the president's grand jury  
appearance was over six months after the news media broke the story 
about the president's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. By Aug. 17, few 
people doubted that he had an affair with her. There was little 
left to hide, and he lied after practically everyone who was asked, 
including many of you, advised the president to tell the truth to 
the grand jury.'' -- Sensenbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``His lies to the grand jury were not to protect his family or  
the dignity of his office, but to protect himself from criminal 
liability for his perjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones 
case.'' -- Sensenbrenner 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To conclude that perjury and obstruction of justice are  
acceptable if committed by a popular president during times of 
peace and prosperity sets a dangerous precedent which sets America 
on the road back to an imperial presidency above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``To justify the president's criminal behavior by demonizing  
those who seek to hold him accountable ignores the fact that 
President Clinton's actions and those actions alone precipitated 
the investigations which have brought us here today. 
</P>
<P>
	``To keep a president in office whose gross misconduct and  
criminal actions are a well-established fact will weaken the 
authority of the presidency, undermine the rule of law, and cheapen 
those words which have made American different from most other 
nations on the Earth: equal justice under law.'' -- Sensenbrenner.

<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever your decision is, it cannot be undone. The outcome  
will be right by definition. But how well you do the work of 
divining that outcome will affect the way that we as a nation deal 
with the divisions among us. 
</P>
<P>
	``To proceed in a manner that will be trusted and viewed as  
legitimate by the American people, you must deal with the 
differences between this proceeding and prior impeachment trials.

justice impartially according to the Constitution and the law.'' -- 
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah.

<P>
	``So I'm here today to ask you to set aside some of your natural  
inclinations for the good of the country. I would implore you, 
senators, both Republican and Democrat, to set aside partisanship, 
politics, polls and personalities and exchange them for loftier 
inclinations, those of procedure, policy and precedent. These are 
the only guidelines this body should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the Senate deliberates this case, I would ask that a few  
key facts never be forgotten: That the president committed perjury 
when he lied under oath and he obstructed justice. ... 
</P>

	``If the Senate follows our nation's precedents of punishing  
perjurers, and if the Senate follows its own precedents of 
convicting perjurers, then there is only one clear conclusion in 
this matter: conviction.'' -- Cannon.

<HEADLINE> White House Outlines Anti-Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Releasing the Clinton administration's plan to  
cut the drug problem in half by 2007, Vice President Al Gore today 
said that the strategy had to provide hope to youngsters and 
treatment for prisoners even as it cracked down on traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must start by recognizing that our nation's drug problem  
was not born in isolation and does not exist in a vacuum,'' Gore 
said. ``It is an interconnected problem and so our solutions must 
also be interconnected. We must mount an all out effort to banish 
crime, drugs and disorder and hopelessness from our streets once 
and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore released the five-part plan, which he said repaired  
programs that are not working and gave a boost to those that do, 
during a ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building next to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed some success in the fight against drugs, noting that  
drug use by adults is at half what it was in 1979 and that drug use 
by young people has started to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when drug dealers still roam our streets and rob our  
children of their dreams, and drug related crime still ravages so 
many of our neighborhoods, we know that we have barely begun,'' 
Gore said. ``We must do so much more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide effort includes nearly $18 billion to be spent  
this year by the federal government. White House drug policy 
director Barry McCaffrey wants the nation's children to be the 
focal point for the drive against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``seeks to involve parents, coaches, mentors,  
teachers, clergy and other role models in a broad prevention 
campaign,'' McCaffrey said in the four-volume strategy sent to 
Capitol Hill today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to Congress, President Clinton said that among the  
positive signs are a growing view among young people that drugs are 
risky and a continuing decline in cocaine production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies demonstrate that when our children understand the  
dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use drop,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The five parts of the administration plan are educating  
children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking the cycle of 
drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from drugs and 
reducing the drug supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and  
availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and 50 percent by 2007. 
Achieving the goal would mean just 3 percent of the U.S. population 
aged 12 and over would be using illegal drugs. The current figure 
is estimated at 6.4 percent. In 1979, the rate was near 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional goals for the period ending in 2007 are to reduce by  
30 percent the rate of crime associated with drug trafficking and 
use, and cutting the health and social costs associated with drugs 
by 25 percent. As of 1995, the social costs of drug use were 
estimated at $110 billion, a 64 percent increase over 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A major piece of the drug-control effort is an advertising  
campaign that generates more than $195 million a year in matching 
contributions from media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A cornerstone of the strategy is accountability for the wide  
array of current anti-drug programs, with boosts for those that 
work and the ability to identify swiftly and repair those that 
aren't producing results. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Congress had been critical because there were no  
specific measurements for success,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman 
for McCaffrey. ``There was some real heat in the government'' 
resisting demands for accountability, but ``no longer do we only 
measure the people working the issue and the dollars spent on it. 
Now you've got to prove bang for the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While head of the U.S. Southern Command as an Army general,  
McCaffrey saw first hand in South America how some U.S. approaches 
to drug control succeed where others fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade or more, some $700 million was spent on  
counter-narcotics aid in Bolivia, with no significant reduction in 
cocaine cultivation, said Pancho Kinney, deputy director for 
strategy in McCaffrey's office. 
</P>
<P>
	When another approach was used starting in 1995, success was  
immediate and has continued, Kinney added. Under the strategy, the 
U.S. military passes along information about drug-carrying 
aircraft, which then would be intercepted by air forces of Colombia 
and Peru.

	King Hussein Laid to Rest  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan was buried today  
amid an outpouring of grief from his people and tributes from the 
amassed dignitaries. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined the 
streets of Jordan's capital for a glimpse at the coffin of the 
Middle East's longest-serving leader. Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 
46 years, died yesterday of cancer at age 63. His son, Abdullah, 
has assumed the throne. Among the world leaders in attendance were 
President Clinton and former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush, as 
well as Russian President Boris Yeltsin, British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair and the leaders of Israel, Syria, France, Germany, Italy 
and Spain. 

</P>
<P>
	Weizman, PLO Guerrilla Shake Hands  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- King Hussein's funeral brought together sworn  
enemies today, including a PLO guerrilla leader who approached 
Israel's president, praised him as a man of peace, and shook his 
hand. Israeli President Ezer Weizman told Nayef Hawatmeh that the 
time had come to make peace with Syria and Lebanon. But Weizman's 
role is largely symbolic and he has been criticized for 
overstepping his authority. Also, Syrian President Hafez Assad 
attended the funeral, marking the first time he was at the same 
event as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Trial Nears End  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today will hear House prosecutors  
make their final arguments that President Clinton committed perjury 
and obstruction of justice and should be removed from office. White 
House lawyers also planned to wrap up their case today, reiterating 
that while Clinton misled the nation in denying his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky, he committed no crime warranting expulsion. It is 
virtually certain the Senate will not get the necessary 67 votes to 
convict Clinton, and senators likely then will consider a censure 
resolution.

	Albanians Call for Cease Fire

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians today called for an  
immediate cease-fire between the warring factions in Kosovo, but 
international mediators sidestepped the appeal for what they said 
were more pressing issues. Officials said Serbs and Albanians have 
agreed in principle on 10 general points for negotiations which 
would keep Yugoslavia's borders intact but give the secessionist 
province wide autonomy. But a member of the Serb delegation 
described some details of the deal as ``horrifying for us because 
it would take Serbia out of Kosovo completely.''

	Hundreds Protest Shooting in N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 1,000 people gathered yesterday outside  
the home of a West African immigrant who died when police fired 41 
shots at him. Amadou Diallo, who immigrated from Guinea two years 
ago and worked as a street peddler, died after being hit 19 times 
by four police officers last week. The officers were looking for a 
rapist and thought Diallo had a gun, but no gun was found. The U.S. 
Attorney's office has begun investigating the case.

details about how they'll use the device to buy goods or services. 
The company, www.Free-PC.com, expects up to 1 million computers 
will be given away. The company will ask personal information such 
as name, address, sex, marital status and income and how the 
computer will be used -- such as for a home-based business, games or 
electronic mail. Free-PC.com's founder said the company will spend 
$500 on each computer it gives away.

leading scorer Cliff Ronning to a two-year contract extension worth 
about $3.6 million. Ronning came to the Predators from Phoenix in 
October and his 38 points have kept the expansion team in the 
playoff hunt. Nashville is only three points out of the final 
playoff spot in the Western Conference.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 13.13 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors sought out some old favorites Monday,  
pushing blue-chip stocks higher in a lackluster session that left 
major market indexes mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling as much as 90 points in morning trading, the Dow  
Jones industrial average ended just 13.13 points lower, at 
9,291.11. The results mirrored Friday's trading, when the index 
lost 0.96 point. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's modest losses indicate that many investors are placing  
their money elsewhere, most likely in the technology stocks, which 
have set the pace for the broader market in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the interest in the market is being focused on just a few  
names,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime 
Charter. ``Technology is stealing the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday, the technology-dominated Nasdaq Stock Market posted the  
strongest gains of all the market indexes. The Nasdaq composite 
index gained 31.30 to close at 2,404.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Its gains were fueled by industry giants including Dell  
Computer, which rose 3 5/8 to close at 104 1/16, and Intel Corp., 
which rose 4 7/16 to 132. Microsoft Corp. gained 5 1/4 to close at 
165 1/4 following reports that the company is reorganizing its 
corporate structure to focus more on customer needs. The software 
giant also announced a venture with British Telecommunications PLC 
to develop wireless Internet and corporate data services for mobile 
phone users. 
</P>
<P>
	While the most established high-tech companies were flourishing,  
however, many industry upstarts tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Nasdaq reached a new record high only to lose  
ground when computer-chip makers and online brokerages released bad 
news. Monday, the chip makers regained some ground, but the 
Internet brokerages slid again as Ameritrade became the latest to 
experience technical breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, said the  
scattered weakness in the technology sector does not indicate the 
group has ended its spectacular rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to take a vibrant group like that and bring it down  
in a matter of days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading Monday, the Dow appeared poised for some gains.  
At midmorning, however, the market turned lower, due in part to 
warnings from Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential  
Securities, said a downward move of 5 percent to 10 percent in the 
Dow is likely. Separately, Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at 
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co, said he expects the Dow to drop to the 
7,500-8,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Acampora is perhaps best known for his prediction that the  
Dow would hit 10,000 in 1998, his note of caution was enough to end 
the morning's brief buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some blue-chip stocks overlooked in recent weeks posted  
substantial gains Monday. Chevron rose 2 7/8 to 81 3/4, and Exxon gained 
1 to close at 72 11/16. AT&AMP;T Corp. rose 2 1/2 to 91 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled a low 703.67 million shares as of 4 p.m.,  
compared to 866.46 million in the previous session. Declining 
issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated volume came to 858.95 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.37 to 1,243.77, the NYSE  
composite index slipped 0.65 point to 586.64, and the American 
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.36 points to 702.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.39 to 411.33.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.68 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed 0.9 percent lower, Britain's FT-SE 100 
closed 0.3 percent lower, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Andrew Jackson wrote a letter, it was  
easy to see troops march, hear cannon roar. His was presidential 
decision-making with no fuzzy edges. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing from the White House on Dec. 17, 1832, the president  
told his secretary of war it was high time to stomp out the 
incendiary doctrine that individual states had the right to declare 
federal laws null and void. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be prepared to act with promptness, and crush the  
monster in its cradle before it matures to manhood,'' Jackson wrote 
Lewis Cass. ``We must be prepared for the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's letter -- mustering troops in five days' time,  
collecting shipping, calling for inventories of muskets, ammunition 
and artillery -- is included in ``Letters of a Nation,'' a new 
collection of American writings spanning four centuries published 
by Broadway Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembled by Andrew Carroll, director of the American Poetry and  
Literacy Project, the letters have many moods. Some of the writers 
are celebrated, many are newly discovered. Among them are 
presidents from George Washington to Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson successfully faced down adversaries in South Carolina,  
which had threatened the Union over the nullification issue. 
Congress backed him. The crisis subsided without bloodshed. Civil 
war was postponed for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jackson brimmed with fire, Washington was reluctant when  
called to war. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing from Philadelphia on June 18, 1775, he told his wife  
that to his ``inexpressible concern'' he had been given command of 
``the whole army raised for defense of the American cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing Martha Washington, the austere general used her  
pet name. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may believe me, my dear Patsy, in the most solemn manner  
that, so far from seeking this appointment, I have used every 
endeavor in my power to avoid it ... But as it has been a kind of 
destiny that has thrown me upon this service, I shall hope that my 
undertaking is designed to achieve some good purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 years later, Clinton saw no good purpose in the war  
his generation was asked to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long letter on Dec. 3, 1969 to the officer commanding his  
local Reserve Officer Training Corps program, the future president 
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``No government really rooted in limited, parliamentary  
democracy should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill 
and die in a war they may oppose, a war which even possibly may be 
wrong, a war which, in any case, does not involve immediately the 
peace and freedom of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here are other presidents addressing the issues of war and peace  
in their times: 
</P>
<P>
	--Abraham Lincoln, in an open letter to the New York Tribune,  
explaining his ``official'' position on slavery and winning the 
Civil War: 
</P>
<P>
	``My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and  
it is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the 
Union without freeing any slave I would do it. If I could save it 
by freeing all the slaves I would do it: and if I could save it by 
freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. ... I 
intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all 
men everywhere could be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Ulysses S. Grant, to his wife, Julia, on April 25, 1865, just  
days after receiving the surrender of the Confederate army under 
Gen. Robert E. Lee: 
</P>
<P>
	``People who talk now of further retaliation and punishment,  
except of the political leaders, either do not conceive of the 
suffering endured already or they are heartless and unfeeling and 
wish to stay at home, out of the danger ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Franklin D. Roosevelt to Prime Minister Winston Churchill on  
Jan. 8, 1942, one day after Pearl Harbor. The salutation refers to 
Churchill's former position as first lord of the admiralty: 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Former Naval Person, London: ``Today all of us are in  
the same boat with you and the people of the Empire and it is a 
ship which will not and cannot be sunk. F.D.R.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Harry S. Truman, to Chicago newspaper columnist Irv Kupcinet,  
on Aug. 5, 1963: ``I knew what I was doing when I stopped the war 
that would have killed half a million youngsters on both sides if 
those bombs had not been dropped. I have no regrets and, under the 
same circumstances, I would do it again -- and this letter is not 
confidential.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: Pilot Made Bad Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot was hotdogging when his  
jet sliced through a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps, killing 
20 people, a prosecutor said in opening statements Monday at the 
aviator's court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to flying his radar-jamming plane too low and too  
fast ``whenever he had the opportunity'' that day, Capt. Richard 
Ashby broke regulations by putting the aircraft through a barrel 
roll, Lt. Col. Carol Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, and  
other offenses, and could be sentenced to more than 200 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was at the controls of an  
EA-6B Prowler on Feb. 3, 1998, when its wing cut the cable. The 
gondola plummeted to the ground, killing all 20 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever he had the opportunity to fly too low and too fast,  
he did it,'' Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce said the Marine Corps had banned flights below 1,000 feet  
in Italy after a 1996 accident. The cable that Ashby's jet struck 
was 370 feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the prosecutor said, one of the two back-seat  
officers in the jet will testify that Ashby performed a 360-degree 
barrel roll as the jet swooped through a mountain valley. 
</P>
<P>
	A jet loses altitude fast during such a roll, the first  
prosecution witness testified later. 
</P>
<P>
	``At low altitude ... it becomes very dangerous,'' said Maj.  
David Wilkinson, an aircraft weapons system officer from Marine 
Corps headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorney Capt. Jon Shelburne told the jury in his  
opening statement: ``It was just an accident. It was an accident 
waiting to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Demattio, a former policeman from Cavalese, Italy,  
testified through an interpreter that he was walking his dogs on a 
trail near the cable system when he saw the jet coming down the 
valley ``very, very fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was this loud noise, and I looked up and screamed,  
`What, are they crazy to be flying so low over a residential area?' 
I started screaming, `The cable! The cable!''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demattio ran to the crushed gondola car, but ``when I saw the  
destruction, I knew there was nothing to do'' and no one answered 
his calls looking for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot's lawyers have said that he didn't know the cable was  
there because it wasn't on the map he was issued, and that an 
optical illusion may have made him think he was flying higher than 
he was.

<HEADLINE> Kids Act Out Real-Life Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEND, Ore. (AP) -- Under the glow of the stage lights, the skinny  
teen-ager in camouflage fatigues exults in the action-hero rush he 
felt when he gunned down his parents at home and shot his 
classmates in the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new play ``Bang, Bang, You're Dead'' sounds a lot like

	``A lot of people think we're trying to put our tragedy on  
stage,'' cast member Betsy Reinhart said after a preview 
performance here Saturday. ``That's not what we're doing. We're 
trying to spread a message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playwright William Mastrosimone plans to donate his work to  
schools across the nation in hopes its in-your-face study of a 
killing spree will force young people to confront their culture of 
violence and do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote this from the pit of my stomach,'' said Mastrosimone,  
a screenwriter from Enumclaw, Wash., whose award-winning credits 
include the play ``Extremities,'' the movie ``The Beast'' and the 
TV miniseries ``Sinatra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bang, Bang, You're Dead'' was written right after the May 20  
Springfield attack, when 15-year-old freshman Kip Kinkel allegedly 
shot his parents at home and opened fire on the Thurston High 
cafeteria, killing two classmates and wounding 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Elements of real-life school shootings in Paducah, Ky., and  
Jonesboro Ark., are also rolled into the plot along with a chilling 
detail straight from the playwright's home: A few days after the 
Springfield shooting, Mastrosimone's son came home and described 
how a junior high classmate had written on the blackboard, 
``Everybody in this class is dead meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My kids went to school the next morning, and as they walked  
down the driveway, I stood in the kitchen window with my wife, 
watching them,'' Mastrosimone recalled. ``Neither of us could say 
what we were thinking, which was, `Will we ever see them again?''' 
</P>
<P>
	That very night, a shaken Mastrosimone sat down and wrote the  
first draft of ``Bang, Bang, You're Dead.'' He sent the idea to 
Thurston High drama teacher Mike Fisher, who discussed the idea 
with his students. They overwhelmingly wanted to do the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was never, ever to make us feel any better,'' Fisher  
said. ``This was about getting a meaningful play out to high 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-act play is staged with few props -- just a few  
flashlights and a coffin-sized box -- to make it easy for kids to 
put it on themselves, whether at school or in their own garages. 
</P>
<P>
	It opens in a jail cell, where 15-year-old Josh sits with his  
head in his hands after killing his mother, father and five 
students. From the darkness emerge five spirits dressed in black, 
flashlights held under their chins. One by one, they demand an 
answer to the question: ``Why'd you kill me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first they get flippant answers, such as, ``Because there was  
nothing good on TV,'' and bravado: ``I'm Bruce, Sly, Arnold and 
Jean-Claude all in the same pair of pants.'' Pressed mercilessly by 
his victims, Josh finally reveals he is wracked by the pain of his 
classmates laughing at him. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead reminisce about what they miss from life -- simple joys  
like ordering pizza and sleeping late, and more complex feelings 
like falling in love and someday seeing their own children graduate 
from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh wonders why he can't just hit reset, like on his computer  
games, then collapses in the realization that he can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Cast member Nichole Buckholtz, who was shot in the leg in the  
Springfield rampage, said the play sends a powerful message that 
``violence is not everything it's cracked up to be. Whether you're 
the shooter or the victim, you go through hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play will never be performed for the public at Thurston --  
there is too much pain there still -- but once the final version of 
the script is done in the coming weeks, there will be a premiere in 
neighboring Eugene and Mastrosimone will post the script on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	After the preview in Bend, the 350 teens, teachers and parents  
who watched hugged and wiped away tears, then gave the cast a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God, thank you for writing this play,'' high school  
senior Nikki Greenleaf of Bend told Mastrosimone. ``I bawled my 
eyes out. It's like, `My God, I'm not the only one that feels this 
way.' I'm amazed that a grown-up could get inside a kid like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't,'' replied Mastrosimone, giving full credit to the  
students of Thurston. ``I'm just the secretary.''

<HEADLINE> Clerks Face Trial in Penthouse Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Two store clerks who sold copies of  
Penthouse magazine should stand trial on charges they violated 
state obscenity laws, a judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Sarah Smith said Affinity News employee William Lee  
Gregory, 29, and Whittier News Stand clerk Darrell Louis Penn, 32, 
should answer charges alleging the sale of obscene material. 
</P>
<P>
	They face up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000  
on the obscenity counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney John W. Coyle III called the case a dangerous  
precedent, pointing out that the magazine is sold worldwide but is 
being prosecuted only in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Constitution is in great danger in Tulsa,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested at work in November after selling copies  
of Penthouse to undercover police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege the photos in the November and December  
issues of the magazine violate Oklahoma obscenity laws because they 
depict sexual intercourse and oral sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Statutes make it illegal to buy, sell, barter or deliver any  
picture, drawing, video or photographs depicting acts ``of sexual 
intercourse or unnatural copulation.''

<HEADLINE> Octuplet Dad Avoids Jail in Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The father of the Houston octuplets pleaded no  
contest Monday to assaulting his mother-in-law and avoided jail in 
a deal that will remove the charge from his record if he stays out 
of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Iyke Louis Udobi, 41, and his family did not comment after  
leaving the courtroom. Udobi received two years deferred 
adjudication, which is similar to probation except the misdemeanor 
assault can be wiped off Udobi's record if he stays clean for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Udobi was arrested and briefly jailed Sept. 21 for allegedly  
striking Janet Chukwu, 63, the mother of his wife, Nkem Chukwu. He 
had no prior criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkem Chukwu in December delivered eight babies. The weakest girl  
died a week after birth, but the other five girls and two boys are 
steadily improving at Texas Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkem Chukwu was not injured during the fracas, during which  
prosecutors say Udobi struck his mother-in-law with a chair. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the births, the family insisted that  
they had put the matter behind them. The three still live in the 
same southwest Houston home.

<HEADLINE>  NASA Launches Comet Chaser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the next seven years, the  
mission of the Stardust spacecraft is to chase a comet, for the 
grand goal of collecting less than a thimble's worth of comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	While the size of the catch may seem minute, if successfully  
captured, the tiny sample could provide scientists with fascinating 
information about the origins of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comets can tell us about the history of the early solar system  
and the early history perhaps of our own Earth,'' explained the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory's Martha Hanner, an astronomer taking part in 
the historic Stardust mission. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust spacecraft began its 3 billion-mile journey  
Sunday, soaring into a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta 
rocket. It is the first attempt to gather material from beyond the 
moon and return it to Earth. A fleeting radar problem delayed the 
flight one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most exciting to get this beautiful spacecraft on its  
way,'' said Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, a 
University of Washington astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an  
extraterrestrial pickup and delivery mission. The last time the 
agency went after samples in outer space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the 
last of the manned lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to get to where we're going... but then  
we've got to turn around and come home again,'' said Carl Pilcher, 
NASA's science director for solar system exploration. ``This 
certainly adds a new level of complexity and difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists feel it's worth the extra effort and risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Comets are frozen time capsules; the icy, rocky bodies are  
thought to be pieces of the original building blocks of the solar 
system and may well contain compounds from which life formed. 
Abundant in water and carbon-based molecules, comets continually 
bombarded Earth some 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust is to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004,  
passing within some 90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball. The 
comet is named for its discoverer, retired astronomy professor Paul 
Wild, pronounced Vilt, who traveled from Switzerland to be on hand 
for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny comet fragments -- no bigger than a grain of salt --  
hopefully will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered with 
a transparent, ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most 
vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of a 
large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl of 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going as close as we can without getting killed,'' said  
Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the comet samples -- along with interstellar  
dust gathered en route to the comet -- will reach Earth in January 
2006. The return capsule will separate from Stardust at an altitude 
of 69,000 miles and parachute into the Utah desert; Stardust will 
remain in orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, comet discoverer Wild will be 80 years old. He hopes to  
be around for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it all works very well, of course, that will be gorgeous,''  
Wild said. ``But there are many possibilities of failure or partial 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even less than a thimble full of comet dust would be plenty for  
the kind of detailed analysis that's planned, scientists say. Even 
the fanciest science instruments on a spacecraft cannot begin to 
compare with the electron microscopes in laboratories on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first U.S. mission devoted solely to a comet. NASA  
plans three more over the next four years, two of which will 
attempt landings.

<HEADLINE>  Little League Champs Meet Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ace of the staff was scratched, so the  
Toms River East Little League champions settled for the White 
House's No. 2 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Ocean County, N.J., kids were disappointed at meeting  
Vice President Al Gore instead of President Clinton on Monday, they 
didn't let on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all right,'' said Todd Frazier, who pitched the Americans  
to victory in August over Kashima, Japan. ``Just making it to the 
White House is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attended the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein, so he  
sent in Gore off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a thrilling accomplishment,'' the vice president said of  
the boys' exploits. ``You'll remember this all your lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recited the Little League pledge, which ends, ``I will  
always do my best.'' Then he added, ``Well, this past August, you 
did your best, and your best turned out to be the very best in the 
entire world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House tour was the latest, and possibly last, of many  
honors the boys have accumulated since winning the title. They 
appeared on Rosie O'Donnell's TV show, were feted by 40,000 at a 
parade in their hometown, went on the field with the Yankees, and 
met Yogi Berra, among other honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting their busy public schedule since the victory, Gore said,  
``Probably this is sort of old hat for you guys.'' He said he might 
ask for the players' autographs. Moments later he got an 
autographed hat and an autographed drawing of the Little League 
World Series field in Williamsport, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Cooksey Earns Place in Daytona Lore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- In ``Days of Thunder,'' the Tom  
Cruise movie on stock car racing, a crew chief whose youthful 
driver has hit just about everything on the track, radios his 
protege with the field slowed by caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit the pace car!'' screams an agitated Harry Hogg -- played by  
Robert Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cruise character, hotshot rookie Cole Trickle, didn't  
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cooksey did.  
</P>
<P>
	And because of it, he has earned a place in Daytona lore.  
</P>
<P>
	``This might be the first time in the history of racing that the  
pace car's been wiped out in an accident,'' he said Sunday. ``It 
was a pretty good lick, right square in the rear end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Square enough to send ARCA pace car driver Jack Wallace from  
Daytona International Speedway to the hospital -- for a pain in the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not a description of Cooksey, a 33-year-old driver  
from Centralia, Ill., who until that bizarre moment in the 59th lap 
of the FirstPlus Financial 200 hadn't hit anything at speeds 
approaching 190 mph. He said a mix-up while the pace car slowed the 
field left him nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
	'' ... He just slowed down or stopped,'' Cooksey said. ``I tried  
to stop, but I couldn't miss him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry that it happened. I hate to see people who are not  
racing to be involved in a wreck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A passenger in the pace car, NASCAR pace car driver Buster  
Auton, escaped uninjured. X-rays on Wallace proved negative, and he 
was released from Halifax Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 60,000 that saw the pace car mishap, very nearly  
witnessed history in the event, the first sanctioned stock car race 
this year at DIS. Shawna Robinson closed with a rush in an attempt 
to become the first female stock car driver to win on the high 
banks of Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	When she came up a few car-lengths short, there was a groan from  
a crowd enlivened by women applauding and waving over the final 16 
laps as Robinson completed her powerful run from fifth to second. 
</P>
<P>
	``We absolutely could have won, no question about it,'' Robinson  
said. ``We just didn't have enough laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Journeyman Bobby Gerhart, a winner for the first time in 14  
years of ARCA racing, didn't think it mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could put the car high, I could put the car low, I could run  
on the apron,'' he said. ``I don't think she could have passed 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, from Des Moines, Iowa, never got the chance. After she  
smoked off all the other contenders to move right up to Gerhart's 
bumper, a final caution ended the suspense with two laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got around the third-place car and got up to Bobby  
Hamilton Jr., I knew there was no question I could win,'' she said. 
``We ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the yellow came out, they said, ``Go get him,' but I had  
already backed off so much that I lost so much momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she lost the drag race back to the line, Robinson  
matched the best finish by a woman in Daytona's 41 years. Robinson 
also wound up third when Karen Schulz finished second in NASCAR 
Dash series race in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Firm Offers Free PC for Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- As many as 1 million new computers are  
waiting for would-be Web surfers willing to trade information about 
their interests, income and browsing habits for a free desktop and 
Internet connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling e-commerce company Free-PC.com has pledged to give  
the computers away in a bid to expand the number of people who use 
the Web to buy and sell. The company, formed late last year as an 
offshoot of Pasadena-based idealab!, plans to give away 10,000 
computers initially. The number could go as high as 1 million is 
demand is strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a cost barrier for people to buy a computer and to get  
Internet access, yet with the explosion of e-commerce, the Internet 
is the accepted medium to deliver advertising and content,'' said 
Don LaVigne, chief executive officer of Free-PC.com, on Monday. 
``We're simply getting the marketers and merchants to subsidize 
indirectly the access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recipients must be willing to let the company monitor the sites  
they visit and ads they check out, and users also must put up with 
advertisements that will appear on-screen whenever the computer is 
turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	If the user doesn't log on to the Internet often enough, new ads  
will be automatically transmitted to the computer terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates warned applicants they should consider  
whether a new computer is worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those people that care about their privacy, or might care  
about their privacy in the future, I urge them to think long and 
hard because you have to provide information about your history to 
this company,'' said Evan Hendricks, editor of the newsletter 
Privacy Times. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, plenty of people seemed willing. Soon after the  
giveaway was announced, access to the company's Web site was 
clogged. Phone lines were busy, and some people even showed up at 
the company's offices looking for free computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept is similar to one used by companies that give away  
cellular phones or cable-TV boxes to get customers to buy the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The first computers won't be given out until sometime after  
March. Recipients will be chosen based on their compatibility with 
advertisers, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Success of Free-PC.com hinges on the notion the company will  
earn enough money from ads to underwrite the $500 cost of each 
computer. Participants will get a Compaq Presario Internet PC 
equipped with a 333 MHz processor, 32 megabytes of RAM, a 
4-gigabyte hard drive and 33.6-kilobyte modem. The deal also 
includes free Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a computer would be good for typical household uses,  
including word processing, spread sheets and many software games. 
Ads will be embedded on the computer's hard drive and updated while 
the user is logged onto the Internet, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be a great thing for newbies but they will soon  
realize -- like us techies -- that they are giving an awful lot 
away,'' said Liza Diott, 26, an employee at WebMetro, an Internet 
salon in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The application asks consumers how much money they make, what  
kinds of cars they own, what hobbies and interests they pursue and 
to which magazines they subscribe. Once a person is accepted, the 
company also will track which Internet sites they visit and ads 
they click onto. 
</P>
<P>
	``What guarantee is there that the data that's gathered, which  
could be significant, will not be used sometime in the future for 
law enforcement investigations, insurance purposes, employment, 
decision making?'' asked Beth Givens, director of the Privacy 
Rights Clearing House. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVigne said Free-PC.com will use the information only to build  
a demographic profile to determine which ads should appear on the 
user's screen. Companies that advertise through Free-PC will never 
see personal information, he vowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal to advertisers is the ads will target people already  
interested in their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``People give their personal information for a lot of things.  
They don't like giving it if they don't get anything in return. All 
we're saying is we're going to give you something in return,'' 
LaVigne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tradeoff isn't a bad deal, so long as customers understand  
how the company is using their information, said Solveig Singleton, 
director of information studies at the Cato Institute in 
Washington, a libertarian think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a model we are going to see a lot more of in  
the future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Weiss Favored To Win US Skate Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Whether it's skating to the heavy guitar  
riffs of Santana or wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt when everyone else 
is sporting sequins, Michael Weiss always manages to stand out. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as he seeks his first title at this week's U.S. Figure  
Skating Championships, it's the newest woman in his life who's 
setting Weiss apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest concerns initially was that being a father  
would distract me. That really hasn't been the case,'' Weiss said 
of Annie Mae, his 4 1/2-month-old daughter with wife Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, your life changes a lot. You're home a little bit  
more, your priorities change,'' he said. ``But there's also that 
new inspiration, that new excitement you have in your life that 
maybe you didn't really realize you were missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their hectic schedules and often nomadic lives, it's rare  
enough for competitive skaters to be married. Some manage, like 
former U.S. pairs champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand and five-time 
U.S. ice dance champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow. 
</P>
<P>
	Add in a child, though, and it really gets tricky. Just look at  
Weiss' entourage. If the competition lasts more than a couple of 
days, his wife and daughter come along, as does either his mother 
or mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	While other skaters rest, see the sights or hang out when  
they've got a break, Weiss heads back to the hotel to spend time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to spend a lot of time with (Annie Mae) during the  
day,'' he said. ``It's almost a good distraction for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Weiss could use a few distractions. After two years of  
finishing second to five-time champion Todd Eldredge at nationals, 
Weiss is favored to win this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Eldredge is keeping his eligible status -- allowing him to  
compete at the national championships, world championships and 
Olympics -- he's doing only a few open events this season and isn't 
competing at nationals. That leaves Tim Goebel, the first American 
to land a quad in competition, Dan Hollander and Derrick Delmore as 
Weiss' main competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I feel like I have pressure,'' Weiss said.  
``Competing against Todd and watching him handle the national 
champion title and watching the way he does things has been great 
experience. The last two national championships, I've competed well 
and competed strongly, and I'm ready to take over the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss isn't the same skater who burst onto the scene two years  
ago at nationals with the quad that wasn't. Sure, he still likes to 
push the limits of skating -- his short program is to a medley of 
Van Halen tunes -- and he's still working on the quad. 
</P>
<P>
	But at 22, and after watching Eldredge stay on top for so long,  
Weiss is refining his style. Last year's long program to ``Immortal 
Beloved'' was designed to showcase his artistry and expression. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he chose music from ``Mulan'' for his long program.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really got into the character of the program,'' he said. ``I  
really wanted a long program that I could get into, not necessarily 
the jumps or spins, but really get into the character of the 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a seventh-place finish at the Nagano Olympics and  
second-place finishes at Skate America and Trophy Lalique, people 
are recognizing there's a lot more to Weiss than big jumps and a 
little rebellious streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm focusing a lot more on being consistent and skating a good  
program,'' he said. ``Last year, I was in a different situation. 
This year, I have a little more reputation behind me, a little more 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are going well for me this year, and I plan on just  
trying to get my job done this year at nationals.''

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Announcer Sues Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- John Bothe is the race caller at the  
nation's premier harness track. He is also a recovering compulsive 
gambler, meaning his workplace is filled with danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe, known as ``The Voice of the Meadowlands,'' says his  
employer has given him new duties at work that jeopardize his 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he filed suit, contending his compulsive gambling is  
a disability and his employer is discriminating against him. The 
lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind in New Jersey, and 
one of only a few nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe says he has not placed a bet for nearly seven years  
despite work that daily puts him within feet of wagering windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard at the beginning,'' said Bothe, who  
remembered calling fellow members of Gamblers Anonymous between 
races for support. ``I had the full support of the Meadowlands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He began working at the track in 1979. But last December he was  
told he would have to handicap races on a daily closed-circuit 
television show for track patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe says picking horses would rekindle the gambling fever that  
nearly ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The track operator, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition  
Authority, would not comment on pending litigation, spokesman John 
Samerjan said. The authority also operates Giants Stadium and the 
Continental Arena at the sports complex in East Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe, 43, of Madison, still attends weekly Gamblers Anonymous  
meetings. He also works a second job -- reading the weather on 
WCBS-AM news radio -- to pay more than $100,000 in debts accumulated 
during two decades of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	His therapist and colleagues in Gamblers Anonymous all advised  
him against accepting the new duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `For your life's sake, you cannot do that,''' Bothe  
said. ``I'm a compulsive gambler. A sick one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track officials responded by threatening a loss in salary and  
benefits, including a plan that would cut his pay from $73,000 to 
$52,000, according to the lawsuit, filed in state Superior Court in 
Morris County. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated me like such a valued employee, and now I'm not  
so valuable,'' Bothe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe has not had a pay cut yet, but the Meadowlands has  
retaliated by diminishing his status, the lawsuit claims. He 
contends he is ostracized and snubbed at staff meetings, and his 
recorded messages welcoming track patrons have been discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothe's lawyer, Noel Crowley, said the Meadowlands is making  
Bothe's life difficult in an apparent attempt to make him quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowley maintains that compulsive gambling is treatable but not  
curable. Therefore, he says, it qualifies as a handicap under the 
state's Law Against Discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks this is the first time such a discrimination claim has  
been made, as does Steven Suflas, first vice chairman of the labor 
and employment law section of New Jersey State Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Courts and juries have considered alcoholism a disability,  
Suflas said, but Bothe would have to present medical evidence that 
he is disabled and show he can perform the essential functions of 
his job with reasonable accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it appears the Meadowlands has accommodated Bothe, the  
issue may be whether their recent actions constitute discrimination 
or acceptable management prerogative, Suflas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of lawsuits have been filed around the nation by  
troubled gamblers, and most have prevailed, said Arnie Wexler, a 
recovering compulsive gambler who runs workshops around the nation 
on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bothe decided quit gambling on April 12, 1992, he sought  
Wexler, then executive director of the Council on Compulsive 
Gambling of New Jersey. Wexler says Bothe can work in a gambling 
environment, but not if he has to discuss odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big difference between working there, announcing the  
races, and sitting there doping out the races,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Nears Decision on 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Former American Red Cross President  
Elizabeth Dole must leap one ``last major hurdle'' before deciding 
whether to seek the presidency, say advisers who expect her to 
clear the bar during a two-day New Hampshire trip and soon enter 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity for her to visit with longtime  
supporters and voters of New Hampshire, and to test the waters,'' 
spokeswoman Joyce Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last major hurdle.''  
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of her brief trip was Monday night's address to  
the local Chamber of Commerce. With interest rising, the Chamber 
moved the event to a larger room to accommodate a crowd of 1,200. 
Mrs. Dole also scheduled a Tuesday breakfast with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to use the trip to trace the broad themes of a likely  
presidential campaign, without formally entering the race or 
addressing such hot-button issues as abortion and affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Monday that Mrs. Dole -- who is married to 1996 Republican 
presidential nominee Bob Dole -- is almost certain to become a 
candidate. She plans to travel to Iowa next week, hire campaign 
staff as early as this week and form an exploratory committee in 
the near future, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, served in the Cabinets of Presidents Reagan and  
Bush after starting in politics in the Democratic administration of 
President Johnson. A key player in her husband's presidential 
races, Mrs. Dole fought for and secured full campaign staffs and 
proved to be a tireless, disciplined and dynamic campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
	With Texas Gov. George Bush tied down to Austin, Texas, for a  
legislative session, Mrs. Dole has emerged as the hottest commodity 
in the fledgling 2000 campaign. She may be a rare Republican figure 
who combines high name recognition and the potential to bridge the 
gap between religious and economic conservatives, with the added 
bonus of being a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz began Jan. 4, when she surprised the political world by  
stepping down as director of the American Red Cross to ``seriously 
consider'' running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened a small office at the Watergate complex, sought out  
consultants and called dozens of potential supporters in key 
presidential states. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls in the last month suggest that she and Bush, the son of  
former President Bush, would be frontrunners for the GOP 
presidential nomination. Both hold slight polling edges over Vice 
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone lines have been burning up since the day she stepped  
down from the Red Cross,'' said state GOP chairman Steve Duprey. 
</P>
<P>
	She also is capable of raising the $20 million or so required to  
win the nomination, though Bush and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander would be vying for many of the same donors. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement is tempered by some hard realities. Despite  
serving as secretary of labor and transportation, Mrs. Dole has 
never sought elective office and she has never laid out her own set 
of public policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the initial excitement wears off, she's going to have to  
put together a serious campaign and make up for lost time,'' Duprey 
said. ``This is a honeymoon period, and it won't last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her record at Red Cross has already been called into question,  
with some critics complaining that she politicized the agency. And 
there is no certainty she will inherit the female vote, especially 
from the party's conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she has already disappointed some New Hampshire  
Republicans by inviting business leaders, including Democratic 
donors, to Tuesday's breakfast and not party regulars.

<HEADLINE> Vols No. 1 in AP Women's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee led a top six that stayed the same, but everyone else  
moved around Monday in The Associated Press women's basketball 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion and Rutgers broke into the Top Ten and Oregon rode  
a 27-point victory over UCLA back into the poll at No. 23 after a 
one-week appearance in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee held the No. 1 spot for the fifth straight week,  
receiving 41 of 42 first-place votes from a national media panel. 
The Lady Vols (22-1) routed Mississippi and Mississippi State last 
week before holding on for a 66-60 victory at Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Purdue (21-1) received the other first-place vote and was  
followed by Louisiana Tech (18-2), Connecticut (20-3), Colorado 
State (24-1) and Notre Dame (19-2). Except for Purdue's 70-64 
victory over Michigan, those five teams won all of their games by 
double-digit margins in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee received 1,049 points in the voting, Purdue had 1,004,  
Louisiana Tech 971 and Connecticut 900. Colorado State's 858 points 
were the most the Rams have ever received in the voting. 
Second-year coach Tom Collen's team has the best record in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which has won 15 straight and 19 of 20, climbed two places  
to seventh. Old Dominion was eighth, Rutgers ninth and Georgia 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech advanced three spots to No. 11 to match its  
highest ranking of the season. Then it was UCLA, Texas Tech, North 
Carolina and Penn State, followed by Iowa State, Auburn, Virginia, 
Clemson and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Florida International and  
Alabama held the final five spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion made the Top Ten for the first time since it was  
10th in the Dec. 7 poll. Since losing to Tennessee on Jan. 19, the 
Lady Monarchs have won seven straight by an average margin of 30 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers (20-4), which spent one week in the Top Ten in November,  
has won 14 of its last 16. The only losses in that span were by 14 
points to Tennessee and one point to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon made the poll at No. 25 on Jan. 18, then dropped out the  
following week after a four-point loss at Arizona. The Ducks (18-4) 
have won their last four, including a 106-79 victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA fell five places because of that loss, the biggest drop  
within the poll. The Bruins' No. 12 ranking is their lowest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, which first broke into the poll last week, made the biggest  
jump, going from 24th to 20th. Boston College, which had been 20th, 
dropped out after losing to Notre Dame and Rutgers.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Man Turns Jumbo Jet Into Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Ore. (AP) -- It's definitely the most eye-catching home  
on the hillside: a blue and white jetliner that logged millions of 
miles over the last three decades, but saved its most interesting 
journey for last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 727 is set to become the new residence of Bruce  
Campbell, a quirky 49-year-old electrical engineer who bought the 
aircraft last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was towed 12 miles from a field near the airport in  
Hillsboro, a suburb west of Portland, through downtown and onto a 
state highway before arriving in this tiny general store of a town 
just before dawn Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome. It's spine-tingling,'' Campbell said as the jet  
was towed through Laurel, its fuselage a startling disruption to 
the backdrop of fog-covered hills and quiet farms. ``It's 
fascinating how wonderful that marriage is: a natural environment 
and slick, cool, high technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But by Sunday night, the plane was still stuck on his neighbor's  
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was to pull the plane, resting on wheeled dollies, into  
a gravel-strewn gully behind the barn belonging to Campbell's 
neighbors, Paul and Chris Denfeld. There it would stay for a few 
weeks, until the rain let up and Campbell could figure out a way to 
get the plane up a muddy slope to his 10-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out, the asphalt driveway was much too narrow, so three  
massive trucks were used to inch it along atop railroad ties on 
either side of the pathway. About 20 hired workers spent a day and 
a half in a driving rain to move the plane only a few hundred feet 
up the driveway to the Denfelds' house. 
</P>
<P>
	Work was stopped until more gravel could be hauled in to support  
the 32-ton plane, which will remain for a few days next to a goat 
pen in full view of visitors to the 500-acre walnut and hazelnut 
orchards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not real thrilled about it being in sight of the house,''  
Chris Denfeld said. ``But we're into this now, so we just have to 
learn to laugh about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, who currently lives in a dilapidated trailer, had  
dreamed of living inside a jetliner since childhood. He got his 
wish last Halloween when he purchased the 1969 plane for $100,000. 
It was decommissioned by Greece's Olympic Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell will outfit the plane with sewer and water, a bedroom,  
bathroom and workshop for his computer gadgets. After he 
re-attaches the wings and tail, a deck could also be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	But first came the move, a complex undertaking that will end up  
costing Campbell about $25,000. For months, he worked to obtain the 
permits needed to effectively bring the community to a standstill 
for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the trouble farther up the hill, the operation had the  
upbeat atmosphere of an old-fashioned barn-raising. And Campbell 
was thrilled just to have his new toy closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take years to fully understand what happened  
here,'' he said. ``I'm going to owe lots and lots of people spare 
kidneys.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Closing Arguments-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Monday's closing arguments in the impeachment  
trial against President Clinton, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	``No military officer, no cabinet official, no judge, no CEO of  
a major corporation, no president of a university, no principal of 
a public school in this nation would remain in office, no matter 
how popular they were, if they had committed the crimes of perjury 
and obstruction of justice as charged here. To vote to acquit puts 
the president on a pedestal that says as long as he's popular, 
we're going to treat him differently with regard to keeping his job 
than any other person in any other position of public trust in the 
United State of America.'' -- McCollum 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not a king, he is our president.  
You have the power and the duty to remove him from office for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I implore you to muster the courage of your convictions, to  
muster the courage the founding fathers believed that the Senate 
would always have in times like these. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton has committed high crimes and  
misdemeanors. Convict him and remove him.'' -- McCollum 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the heart and soul of the president's defense: Tax  
fraud and a host of undefined other crimes, like the lying under 
oath and obstruction of justice in this case, are just not serious 
enough for impeachment and removal. That's the answer, that's the 
defense. It's just not serious enough. All the grand legal 
arguments, all the fine legal distinctions come down to the simple, 
this marvelously simple proposition: It's just not serious 
enough.'' -- Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The desire to avoid embarrassment is not a mitigating factor.  
Likewise, the nature of the precipitating misconduct, a sexual 
affair, does not mitigate the seriousness of the president's 
crimes. If you accept the argument that it's just about sex, you 
will render the law of sexual harassment virtually meaningless.'' -- 
Canady 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecutors went down to the White House and William  
Jefferson Clinton sat there as president of the United States in 
the White House and he lied to a federal grand jury. He sat there 
in the White House and he put on his most sincere face, he swore to 
God to tell the truth and then he lied. He planned to lie and he 
executed his plan because he believed it was in his personal and 
political interest to lie. Never mind the oath of office. Never 
mind the constitutional duty. Never mind that he solemnly swore to 
God to tell the truth.'' -- Canady 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Those wise statesmen who established our form of government  
would have understood the seriousness of the harm President Clinton 
has done to the cause of justice and constitutional government. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have understood that a president who does such  
things should not remain in office with his crimes.'' -- Canady 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about the personalities of these people or the  
personalities here of the politics involved or the polls, but it's 
about the facts. And ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, there are 
conclusive facts here that support a conviction. The president and 
his attorneys, as I said the other day, have made a good defense 
and have tried to paint a picture to the facts, I think, that that 
simply do not match with logic or common sense.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, 
R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The law, like the facts are a very stubborn thing.'' -- Bryant  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If the law has been broken, if perjury has been committed, if  
obstruction of justice has been committed by this president, it is 
my belief that the fact that the economy is good should not prevent 
this Senate from acting and removing the president.'' -- Bryant 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of this matter is that this is not a case that is  
based upon circumstantial evidence. On each element of obstruction, 
there is direct testimony linking the president to a consistent 
pattern of conduct designed to withhold information, conceal 
evidence and tamper with witnesses to avoid obedience and 
directives of a federal court.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I appear before this body as an advocate. I am not paid for  
this special responsibility, but I am here because I believe the 
Constitution requires me to make this case. The facts prove 
overwhelmingly that the president committed obstruction of justice 
and perjury. Despite this belief, whatever conclusion you reach 
will not be criticized by me. And I will respect this institution 
regardless of the outcome.'' -- Hutchinson 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Congress and this is the Senate, and it is your  
responsibility to determine the facts and to let justice roll down 
like mighty waters.'' -- Hutchinson 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The personal popularity of any president pales when weighed  
against the fundamental concept that forever distinguishes us from 
every nation on the planet: No person is above the law.'' -- Rep. 
James Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No oath, no presidency. It is the oath of office and not  
public opinion polls that give life and legitimacy to a presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is true no matter how popular an elected president may be  
or how broad his margin of victory. The founders did not intend the 
oath to be an afterthought or a technicality. They viewed it as an 
absolute requirement before the highest office in the land was 
entrusted to any person. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence shows the president repeatedly violated his oath  
of office. Now the focus shifts to your oath of office.'' -- Rogan 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence clearly shows that the president engaged in  
repeated and lengthy patterns of felonious conduct. Conduct for 
which ordinary citizens can be and have been jailed and lost their 
liberty. This simply can not be wished or censured away.'' -- Rogan

<HEADLINE> U.S. Study Picks Slovenia for NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of the nine central European countries that  
have applied to join NATO, Slovenia is the most qualified to become 
the next member, a congressional survey concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Congressional Research Service, made public  
Monday by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., also suggested Lithuania and 
Slovakia may be next in line behind Slovenia. The research arm of 
Congress looked into the readiness to join NATO of all nine 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these reports is clear and convincing evidence that, at the  
Washington summit this April, NATO should invite, at a minimum, 
Slovenia to accession negotiations,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization meet  
here in April to celebrate NATO's 50th anniversary and also to 
formally admit to the alliance three former Warsaw Pact nations, 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, who is president of the North Atlantic Assembly, made up  
of lawmakers from NATO countries, has urged for some time that 
Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic, be the next nation invited to 
join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria,  
Estonia, Latvia, and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia have 
all applied for NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia meets or surpasses standards that had been set by  
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the congressional report 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia has a democratic political system and has held fair and  
free elections since winning independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, 
the report said. It has an independent judiciary and a government 
that ``respects the human rights of its citizens'' and has made 
strong progress toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia's army is being restructured and is willing to commit a  
unit to international peacekeeping efforts, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithuania and Slovakia meet most of the criteria for NATO  
membership, although not all, the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Lithuania, the report noted concerns on the part of some  
NATO members over offering NATO membership to any of the Baltic 
states once claimed by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some officials at the Department of Defense and at NATO  
believe that Lithuania's geographic position precludes its defense 
by conventional forces,'' the report said, also noting that a 
nuclear guarantee for Lithuania also seemed unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional study found that the former Yugoslav republic  
of Macedonia ``is a young state that has remained under the shadow 
of violence and instability in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It noted a spotty record in holding democratic elections,  
problems in inter-ethnic relations and continuing economic 
difficulties. ``Numerous problems stand in the way of Macedonia 
realistically qualifying for NATO membership in the near future,'' 
the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Also not ready for NATO membership anytime soon, the report  
suggested, are Albania, Estonia, Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Olympic Panel Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Authorities will launch an  
investigation into possible bribery in the Swedish Olympic 
Committee's use of money from the city's Olympics bid committee to 
fund an agreement with six African countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The public prosecutor's office made the announcement Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported  
that the $220,000 for the agreement, under which African athletes 
would train in Sweden, was provided by the group that was pushing 
Stockholm's candidacy for the 2004 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed only days before the International  
Olympic Committee voted on which city would be the host for the 
games. IOC members from the six countries were seen as holding key 
votes, the newspaper said. The IOC voted for the games to be held 
in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members from three of the countries -- Kenya, Swaziland and  
Ivory Coast -- have been implicated in the IOC bribery scandals. The 
other countries in the agreement were Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreements under which prosperous countries offer training to  
athletes from less-developed countries are not unusual, but the 
timing of this agreement and the fact that the money came via the 
Olympics bid committee have caused concern in a country generally 
highly sensitive to questions of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Christer van der Kwast, the head of the prosecutors' office  
division of special investigations, said the initial step will not 
be a formal investigation but ``a preliminary examination to see if 
there is cause to suppose that a crime has occurred,'' the Swedish 
news agency TT reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long the preliminary stage would take, but  
the involved parties promised cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the prosecutor wants to conduct an examination of the  
Swedish Olympic Committee's doings, he is very welcome,'' committee 
chairman Carl-Gustaf Anderberg was quoted as saying by TT. 
</P>
<P>
	And Goeran Laangsved, board chairman of the former bid  
committee, said, ``What's important is that all parties can work 
together so that we can get to the bottom of all this.''

<HEADLINE> White House Outlines Anti-Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Releasing the Clinton administration's plan to  
cut the drug problem in half by 2007, Vice President Al Gore today 
said that the strategy had to provide hope to youngsters and 
treatment for prisoners even as it cracked down on traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must start by recognizing that our nation's drug problem  
was not born in isolation and does not exist in a vacuum,'' Gore 
said. ``It is an interconnected problem and so our solutions must 
also be interconnected. We must mount an all out effort to banish 
crime, drugs and disorder and hopelessness from our streets once 
and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore released the five-part plan, which he said repaired  
programs that are not working and gave a boost to those that do, 
during a ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building next to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed some success in the fight against drugs, noting that  
drug use by adults is at half what it was in 1979 and that drug use 
by young people has started to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when drug dealers still roam our streets and rob our  
children of their dreams, and drug related crime still ravages so 
many of our neighborhoods, we know that we have barely begun,'' 
Gore said. ``We must do so much more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide effort includes nearly $18 billion to be spent  
this year by the federal government. White House drug policy 
director Barry McCaffrey wants the nation's children to be the 
focal point for the drive against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``seeks to involve parents, coaches, mentors,  
teachers, clergy and other role models in a broad prevention 
campaign,'' McCaffrey said in the four-volume strategy sent to 
Capitol Hill today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to Congress, President Clinton said that among the  
positive signs are a growing view among young people that drugs are 
risky and a continuing decline in cocaine production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies demonstrate that when our children understand the  
dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use drop,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The five parts of the administration plan are educating  
children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking the cycle of 
drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from drugs and 
reducing the drug supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and  
availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and 50 percent by 2007. 
Achieving the goal would mean just 3 percent of the U.S. population 
aged 12 and over would be using illegal drugs. The current figure 
is estimated at 6.4 percent. In 1979, the rate was near 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional goals for the period ending in 2007 are to reduce by  
30 percent the rate of crime associated with drug trafficking and 
use, and cutting the health and social costs associated with drugs 
by 25 percent. As of 1995, the social costs of drug use were 
estimated at $110 billion, a 64 percent increase over 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A major piece of the drug-control effort is an advertising  
campaign that generates more than $195 million a year in matching 
contributions from media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A cornerstone of the strategy is accountability for the wide  
array of current anti-drug programs, with boosts for those that 
work and the ability to identify swiftly and repair those that 
aren't producing results. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Congress had been critical because there were no  
specific measurements for success,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman 
for McCaffrey. ``There was some real heat in the government'' 
resisting demands for accountability, but ``no longer do we only 
measure the people working the issue and the dollars spent on it. 
Now you've got to prove bang for the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While head of the U.S. Southern Command as an Army general,  
McCaffrey saw first hand in South America how some U.S. approaches 
to drug control succeed where others fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade or more, some $700 million was spent on  
counter-narcotics aid in Bolivia, with no significant reduction in 
cocaine cultivation, said Pancho Kinney, deputy director for 
strategy in McCaffrey's office. 
</P>
<P>
	When another approach was used starting in 1995, success was  
immediate and has continued, Kinney added. Under the strategy, the 
U.S. military passes along information about drug-carrying 
aircraft, which then would be intercepted by air forces of Colombia 
and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Movie Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Justice Department inquiry into the way  
movies are distributed to theaters caught Hollywood off guard, as 
executives and analysts wondered Monday what suddenly triggered the 
most aggressive government review in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's wide-ranging request for materials dating back  
to January 1996 was spelled out in a 10-page document distributed 
Thursday and Friday to the major studios and two large theater 
chains. The document focuses on the issue of whether all theaters 
get a fair chance to show the films they want. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears to be the Justice Department's closest inspection of  
movie distribution practices since a crackdown in the late 1940s, 
when studios -- accused of monopolistic practices -- were forced to 
sell their theater chains. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one in Hollywood knows what prompted this request.  
Indeed, since the Reagan administration, there has been a relaxing 
of the rules, leading to the return of studio-owned theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not as if there's recently been a dramatic change in the  
nature of power in Hollywood to suggest that this is caused by 
circumstances that are new and different,'' industry analyst 
Stewart Halpern said. ``But apparently the government sees 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice spokeswoman Jennifer Rose said only: ``We are looking  
into certain possibly anti-competitive practices in the 
distribution of motion pictures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those receiving investigative demands, civil equivalents  
of criminal subpoenas, were: Walt Disney Co.; Viacom Inc.'s 
Paramount Pictures; Sony Corp.; News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox; 
Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios Inc.; Time Warner Inc.'s Warner 
Bros.; and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.; and two of the nation's 
largest theater chains, Regal Cinemas Inc. and Loews Cineplex 
Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Studio sources who have read the Justice Department request said  
two issues were cited. 
</P>
<P>
	One was the practice of ``block booking,'' in which studios  
force theater chains to take other movies, often less popular, in 
order to get the rights to show a very popular one. The other was 
the practice of ``clearances'' that give a theater exclusive rights 
to a film in a particular area.

<HEADLINE> Comic Book Creator Has McGwire Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The man who spent more than $3 million to buy  
Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball finally identified himself 
Monday, and quickly admitted he was a ``psycho fan'' and a ``sports 
geek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn comic books, held an  
offbeat news conference, saying his purchase ``was a mixture of 
business, charity and self-indulgence to the Nth degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports make you forget death, taxes and politics, and all the  
other garbage that goes on in life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Canadian, who now lives in Tempe, Ariz., is a  
minority investor in the NHL's Edmonton Oilers. He has a company 
that makes action figures, said the timing of his announcement was 
tied to the yearly Toy Fair in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who paid $3,005,000 for No. 70, had not seen the ball  
until Monday, when he came to New York fresh from a stay at the 
Baltimore Orioles' fantasy camp in Florida. Behind him was a banner 
with ``Todd McFarlane Productions'' spelled out 103 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The balls were displayed in front of him in nine cases atop nine  
columns -- white and gray for No. 70, black for the others -- with 
four burgundy velvet ropes separating them from the crowd and five 
men in blue security uniforms standing to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would like to allow the Hall of Fame to show  
McGwire's 70th home run ball at times, would make it available to 
charities to raise money, and would let individual major league 
teams display it. 
</P>
<P>
	The price?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be able to take 20 swings in every major league  
ballpark,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who owns autographs from Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig,  
said purchasing the ball was cheaper than buying a sports team. He 
mentioned the proposed $800 million sale of the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it, I'm up 799 million bucks,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't worried about someone breaking the record  
McGwire set last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets too close, I saw what Tonya Harding did a few years  
ago, so there are options,'' he said, referring how Harding's 
entourage hired someone to attack rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, McFarlane bought nine home run balls hit by McGwire and  
Sammy Sosa, including McGwire's first, 63rd, 67th, 68th and 69th, 
and Sosa's 33rd (his record 20th in June), 61st and 66th. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane bought the ball at auction Jan. 12, paying $2.7  
million to Philip Ozersky, a research scientist at Washington 
University who caught the ball Sept. 27 at Busch Stadium in St. 
Louis. Guernsey's auction house got an additional $305,000 as its 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's final home run of the season, No. 66, cost McFarlane  
$172,500. All the others he bought at the auction cost under 
$20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane, who rooted for the San Diego Padres growing up  
because he felt sorry for the players in the mustard-colored 
uniforms, is a fan of the Arizona Diamondbacks and went to about a 
dozen games last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As an anonymous telephone bidder, he outbid Irwin Sternberg, the  
president of the neckwear firm Stonehenge Ltd., for No. 70. 
Sternberg stopped at $2.6 million; McFarlane said $2.9 million was 
as high as he was willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew my life savings on this,'' McFarlane said. ``I'm not  
Donald Trump. I don't have a lot of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group of balls will be called ``The McFarlane Collection.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Given that I name all my corporations after myself, I'll name  
it after myself,'' he said. ``Better than `The Guy Who Has More 
Money Than Brains Collection.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his wife understood the reasons for his purchase but  
wouldn't have gone ahead on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women don't have these same wants and needs of silliness that  
men have,'' he said. ``What's the equivalent of the 70th home run 
ball to women?'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlane said that if he owned a team, he would take batting  
practice every day. And he would make some changes to his team's 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd make sure the fences were hydraulic,'' he said, ``so when  
I came up they could move in 30 feet.''

                           *Norman Bluhm    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST WALLINGFORD, Vt. (AP) -- Norman Bluhm, an abstract  
expressionist painter, died Wednesday at the age of 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluhm's large-scale works, exhibited since the 1970s, were often  
symmetrical compositions that packed swelling forms. The result 
suggested an ebullient, sometimes violence-tinged eroticism, and 
drew on a wide range of art historical references. Bluhm named many 
of these paintings after goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
	His work is in many public collections, including those of the  
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney 
Museum of American Art. A 40-year retrospective of his paintings is 
scheduled to open March 7 at the Butler Institute of American Art 
in Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluhm was an Army Air Force veteran of World War II. He said  
later that the war, in which his younger brother was killed and he 
was wounded, had lasting psychological repercussions, giving 
abstract expressionism's life and death ethos a personal edge for 
him.

	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Herman Herst, a stamp collector, dealer,  
auctioneer and author who created his own postal service and had 
his dog deliver mail, died Jan. 31. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-born Herst won scores of philatelic honors in  
Britain and the United States, including the American Philatelic 
Society's Luff Award. He was the only American ever elected to the 
board of the Philatelic Traders Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Herst, who once belonged to 81 stamp clubs, wrote 18 books and  
thousands of columns about stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, after discovering an 1862 law that allowed for  
supplemental postal service, Herst opened a private mail service in 
Shrub Oak, N.Y. His children and his German shepherd, Alfie, 
delivered mail for 2 cents a letter. A privately issued stamp 
depicting Alfie became a collectible. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Herst left New York for Florida, where he quickly  
became the state's leading philatelist.

</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Through a half-century of turmoil, Hussein  
bin Talal of Jordan grew from boy king to elder statesman, a symbol 
of endurance and a voice for peace in a landscape of crisis and 
war. He died Sunday of cancer at the age of 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowned at age 17 as monarch of a poor desert realm, King  
Hussein grew to command the attention of the world, as he did when 
he interceded, gray and stricken from cancer, at a crucial moment 
in the 1998 Middle East peace talks at the Wye Plantation to help 
break an Israeli-Palestinian deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been 50 years since Israel's founding set off the first  
of the wars between Arabs and Jews, flooding his country with 
Palestinian refugees, and 45 years since the teen-age prince took 
on what he later called ``the hazardous profession'' of king, to 
rule a nation even younger than himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years that followed, Hussein steered his kingdom into  
coexistence with the Jewish state, working to ensure Jordan's 
survival. But his ties to Israel and the West, and his often uneasy 
relations with the Palestinians who make up half the kingdom's 
population, plunged him into crisis after crisis with his fellow 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lonely and arduous reign, over a tiny nation the size  
of Indiana, sandwiched between such powerful states as Iraq, 
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived wars with Israel and a civil war, escaped repeated  
coup and assassination attempts, and twice battled cancer to become 
one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, one whose reign 
stretched from Stalin to Yeltsin, from Churchill to Blair, from 
Eisenhower to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein was born Nov. 14, 1935, a descendent of Hashem,  
great-grandfather of Mohammed, the 7th-century prophet of Islam. He 
studied in Amman and Cairo, and at Britain's Harrow prep school and 
Sandhurst Military Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	His rule began after his father, King Talal, abdicated because  
of mental illness.

<P>
                             *Indrani    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Indrani, a dancer and teacher who familiarized  
Americans with India's classical dance styles, many of which she 
helped to revive, died of a stroke Friday. She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani, who appeared before heads of state worldwide, made her  
New York debut in 1960. She taught her dancing, noted for its 
combination of refinement and dramatic vibrancy, at American 
colleges and festivals and toured extensively. She had been on the 
Juilliard School faculty since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Indrani became the first dancer presented on a national  
tour by the Asia Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani studied with leading Indian gurus to master the  
differing styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and 
Orissi. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, she became the first professional dancer to  
perform Orissi, inspired by east Indian temple sculptures, onstage. 
She was instrumental in its revival. 
</P>
<P>
	Indrani's role in resuscitating forgotten classical dance forms  
mirrored that of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer 
known for reviving classical dance in India in the 1930s.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wassily Leontief, an academic who won a Nobel  
prize in 1973 for his economic analyses of America's production 
machinery, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Leontief's so-called input-output analytical method became a  
permanent part of production planning and forecasting in various 
industrialized nations and in private corporations around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at Harvard for 44 years before joining New York  
University, where he taught into his 90s and directed the Institute 
for Economic Analysis from 1975 until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Leontief was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and left to attend  
the University of Berlin, where he completed his doctorate in 1929. 
He then spent a year as an economist advising the Government of 
China before coming to the United States.

</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Ben Margolis, an activist lawyer whose  
clients included the blacklisted Hollywood 10 and suspects in the 
racially-tinged Sleepy Lagoon murder case, died Jan. 27 in Oregon. 
He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis already was a noted civil rights lawyer in 1947 when he  
was approached by a group of directors and screenwriters accused of 
being Communist Party members. They wanted advice on appearing 
before the House Un-American Activities Committee, created to root 
out supposedly subversive elements. 
</P>
<P>
	Margolis told them that, when asked if they were or had ever  
been members of the Communist Party, ``the only possible answer was 
no answer. ... The answer was: `None of your business.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The tactic failed to keep the Hollywood 10 out of trouble. Each  
spent up to a year in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years earlier, Margolis helped win a reversal of the  
convictions of a dozen Mexican-Americans in the ``Sleepy Lagoon'' 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which inspired the Luis Valdez play ``Zoot Suit,''  
involved the 1942 beating death of a 21-year-old man near a Los 
Angeles-area reservoir dubbed ``Sleepy Lagoon.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fred Partido, a former reporter, editor and  
writer for WBBM-AM, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Partido, who retired in 1992 after 24 years with WBBM, was a  
writer for the all-news radio station before becoming a reporter. 
He also was the host of ``Speaking of Spanish,'' a feature 
spotlighting issues in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
	Partido was a local Golden Gloves finalist and later served  
three years with the Air Force in Germany. After his discharge, he 
earned a journalism degree at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include two daughters and a grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Final Arguments Due at Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate prepared for closing arguments  
in the impeachment trial, Democratic leader Tom Daschle estimated 
today that a follow-up resolution to censure President Clinton 
would need support from about 20 Republicans to clear an expected 
GOP filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said of the censure effort that could follow votes on  
the articles of impeachment this week, ``We're trying to make a 
historic statement of record'' on Clinton's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans are expected to vote for the impeachment  
articles, but if those votes fail -- as expected -- many of the GOP 
senators feel that a follow-up vote to censure would be too little 
punishment and a bad constitutional precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's estimate indicated that at least five of the 45  
Democrats want to end the impeachment matter with an acquittal -- 
and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties have been working on a censure  
statement, but the resolution would be debated only after the 
Senate voted -- as early as Thursday -- to acquit or convict Clinton 
on the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators are so strongly opposed to a censure  
that they would be expected to mount a filibuster, which could be 
stopped only with 60 votes in the 100-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said that ``it's in everybody's interest'' to consider a  
censure immediately after the trial ends and before the Senate 
takes a holiday recess next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For today's arguments, House prosecutors were packaging the  
now-familiar evidence into conclusions that Clinton should be 
removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers also planned to wrap up their case today,  
reiterating that while Clinton misled the nation in denying his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky, he committed no crime warranting 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	With 67 votes, a two-thirds majority of senators, needed for  
conviction, it was a foregone conclusion the president's side would 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few elements of suspense left was whether those  
supporting conviction would even reach the symbolic level of a 
simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats interviewed on the Sunday talk shows predicted that  
both counts would fail to win a majority. Republicans said the 
perjury charge might fall short but that a majority would vote to 
convict on the obstruction charge. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day of final arguments today, the 100 senators move into  
deliberations, probably behind closed doors, with the vote on the 
two articles expected Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with acquittal on both charges, the Senate would still be  
left with the question of whether to censure Clinton for his affair 
with the former White House intern and his attempts to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was in Jordan to attend the funeral of King Hussein, as  
were two senators who will sit in judgment of him, Ted Stevens, 
R-Alaska, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. The lawmakers will not miss any 
votes today and Senate leaders decided to go ahead with the trial 
as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy, commenting to reporters aboard Clinton's plane on the  
flight to Jordan, said missing today's impeachment session was no 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Leahy, who was one of the  
Senate's overseers for last week's depositions. He suggested there 
was little point in a long day of closing arguments going over 
ground already covered repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he believed a final vote on the articles of  
impeachment would come Thursday and senators could use Friday to 
debate a possible censure motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's arguments, House managers were all but  
acknowledging defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the legacy of this trial was the fact that the  
Democrats took the hard line of ignoring the criminal activity of 
one of their own rather than viewing the evidence objectively,'' 
another prosecutor, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said on ``Fox 
News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One conservative Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama,  
said on ABC's ``This Week'' that he had concerns that both counts 
against Clinton were ``porous in nature,'' and guessed that 10 to 
15 of the 55 GOP senators might vote to acquit on the perjury 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democrats could vote to acquit on both counts. Possibly  
the only two doubtfuls are Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, the 
only Democrat to vote against an earlier Democratic motion to 
dismiss the charges, and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a staunch 
defender of the Constitution and Senate traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd introduced the motion to dismiss, but he told ABC there was  
``no doubt'' that Clinton's actions rose to the impeachable level 
of high crimes and misdemeanors as set out in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrd added there were other factors in deciding how to vote.  
``In these remaining two years (of Clinton's presidency), I can 
turn my back on this. I can close this as a chapter. I think we all 
ought to do that and think of the healing of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attempt to come up with a resolution censuring the president  
if he escapes removal from office was being led by Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah. But they faced 
tough opposition from senators of both parties who regarded censure 
as either unconstitutional or an unneeded afterthought.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Ex-Presidents at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A sorrowful trip to the Middle East brought  
together an extraordinary assembly of four American presidents who 
flew through the night on Air Force One to today's funeral of King 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and predecessors Jimmy Carter, George Bush and  
Gerald Ford -- two Democrats, two Republicans -- turned the plane 
into an airborne seminar, comparing notes on the leading 
international problems they faced in the Oval Office: the Middle 
East, Russia, North Korea and Kosovo, the latest trouble spot in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In a senior staff cabin, Clinton joined talks with the three  
former presidents for nearly two hours. The only missing member of 
the world's most exclusive club was Ronald Reagan, who turned 88 
Saturday. He has Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	After the discussions, Ford and Bush slept on pulldown bunks in  
a medical annex on the jumbo jet. Carter wound up on an air 
mattress and sleeping bag in senior staff quarters. Clinton claimed 
the spacious presidential suite at the front of the plane, although 
he had offered the other presidents room there on pullout couches. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no indications the group discussed Clinton's  
impeachment trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	State funerals have brought former American presidents together  
on earlier occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan sent Ford, Carter and Richard Nixon to the funeral of  
Egypt's assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981. When Nixon died 
in 1994, Clinton and all the former presidents attended. Presidents 
past and present also came together at the dedications of the 
Reagan and Bush presidential libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. delegation to the king's funeral was intended to send a  
message. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an ``extremely strong statement to the people of Jordan  
that America stands with them during this difficult period,'' said 
Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the United States has full confidence in King  
Hussein's successor, his 37-year-old son, King Abdullah, and wants 
to help the new monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah is ``the front edge of a new generation of leadership  
in the Middle East'' that will come to power over the next 10 
years, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein had ``obviously been the transcendent voice'' for peace  
in the Middle East over the past several years, Berger told 
reporters on the plane. ``Obviously we will miss that presence and 
that voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Berger said the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace accord was ``in  
place and I believe it's durable and believe the new king is 
committed to it. We've lost other towering figures in this peace 
process: Sadat, (Israeli) Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin, but the 
process has gone forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said peace in the Middle East would remain one of  
Clinton's highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who ruled Jordan for 46 years, was a voice of  
moderation. In 1994, he broke with most of the Arab world and 
followed Egypt in signing a peace agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton flew to Jordan at the time to witness the signing of  
that agreement and pay tribute to Hussein's bold move. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 world leaders were gathering here for the funeral,  
creating a traffic jam of presidential aircraft as Air Force One 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's only formally scheduled meetings were with  
Abdullah and Queen Noor, Hussein's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton circulated through a four-story guest palace, where  
he met briefly with various world leaders: Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin; Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles; 
French President Jacques Chirac; Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister 
Wim Kok of the Netherlands; Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; 
President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey; President Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt; Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority; and 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	He also stopped to speak for a few moments with President Hafez  
Assad of Syria and the leaders of Oman, Bahrain and Yemen. He 
talked with the crown prince of Kuwait, King Juan Carlos of Spain 
and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also flew with Clinton, as did  
the parents of the American-born Queen Noor and four members of 
Congress: Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 
and Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., and David Bonior, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy told reporters he was relieved to be away from the Senate  
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired of that trial,'' said Leahy, who also was  
involving in taking depositions last week from former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White 
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said that when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Saturday that closing arguments were to begin today, senators 
looked in amazement at each other because they thought that was the 
point of Saturday's long presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy said he believed that a final vote on the articles of  
impeachment would come Thursday and that senators could use Friday 
to debate a censure motion against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens did not talk to reporters on the plane.

<HEADLINE> Have Your Net and Privacy Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Privacy is one of those things you don't appreciate until you  
lose it. And the Internet and our electronic, computer-driven 
society are changing the matter of privacy in fundamental ways. 
</P>
<P>
	If you haven't thought much about who might be monitoring you as  
your surf the Net, e-mail a friend or electronically pay your taxes 
or file a medical claim, you'll be interested in the book, ``I Love 
the Internet, But I Want My Privacy, Too!'' (Prima Publishing, 
Rocklin, Calif., $16.95 paperback). 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peterson's well-written 226-page volume is a thoughtful  
exploration of some of the real privacy concerns that arise from 
playing with those electrons. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's say you got cold feet at the altar and ran from the church  
before saying ``I do.'' You moved to another state and told no one, 
least of all your almost-bride's relatives and friends. Are you 
safe? If your telephone number is listed -- and sometimes, even if 
it isn't -- your name, address and phone number are only a few mouse 
clicks away, And so is a map with directions to your house! 
</P>
<P>
	And you might not have realized it, but someone is picking your  
pocket, often on a daily basis. Oh, the amounts are small but if 
you pay for Internet access, you are essentially paying for connect 
time, and someone sending spam (unsolicited e-mail) is stealing 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	As Peterson points out, spam constitutes fraud. It's  
fundamentally different from postal junk mail, which costs the 
sender postage and which you can often identify unopened before 
placing it in the wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
	The book points out that few Net surfers realize their online  
activities are often tracked by the sites they visit and that this 
information is used and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	While most are aware that chat rooms can have a dark side, the  
book cautions you to assume nothing from an online handle. Sure, 
``Amy14'' in a chat room could be a 14-year-old girl, but it could 
also be a 60-year-old man or a convicted murderer. There's simply 
no way to tell, and you should take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	The book also deals with the issue of children on the Internet.  
While much noise has been made about children having access to 
adult material on the Net, the book also raises the question of 
marketing approaches aimed at kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Included are a list of online privacy resources, and places to  
report and combat spam, pedophiles, con artists and such. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson makes the point that the technology being used to  
invade privacy can also be used to protect it. Since the Internet 
and computers are probably here to stay, and since we all do things 
we don't want the world to see, it's an important issue and one the 
book explores well.

<HEADLINE>  Bowler Gets 10 Wickets in Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A perfect game in baseball. A 59 in  
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are rare events. But what Anil Kumble did in front of  
70,000 screaming cricket fans was rarer still. 
</P>
<P>
	In 122 years of international cricket only one other bowler has  
taken all 10 wickets in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	That it came during one of the sport's great rivalries -- India  
vs. Pakistan -- made it all the more startling. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble turned in the perfect 10 in India's 212-run victory, a  
performance that made him the hottest topic Monday at shops and bus 
stops, and grabbed headlines on newspapers, radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble allowed Pakistan 74 runs Sunday. That matched the feat of  
England's Jim Laker against Australia in 1956, when Laker gave up 
just 53 runs. By comparison, there have been 13 perfect games in 
the major leagues and three rounds of 59 in PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan knocked out as Kumble makes a killing,'' read one  
newspaper headline. Others had ``Kumble takes haul of fame,'' 
``Kumble makes history with perfect 10,'' and ``10 out of 10: 
Pakistan Kumbled at Kotla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Age said simply: ``Words fail this headline.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe tomorrow, when I read the newspapers, I will realize  
what happened,'' Kumble had said after teammate V.V.S. Laxman 
caught Wasim Akram's final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many television stations replayed the entire match Monday, while  
others showed Kumble's bowling over and over. And all over New 
Delhi, children rose early to play cricket before going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kumble is my hero!'' said Chanchal Misra, a 12-year-old trying  
to copy Kumble's bowling action on his street. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble's performance is hard to measure against other sports,  
but it could be seen as cricket's equivalent of a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	In test cricket, the highest level of international play, each  
team bats with 10 wickets -- or outs -- at stake in each of two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A match takes five days to play and a single innings can last  
for more than 10 hours. No bowler -- cricket's pitcher -- can go the 
whole way, so wickets usually are spread among three or four 
players on each team. 
</P>
<P>
	India used four bowlers, but Kumble swept Pakistan himself. A  
leg-spinner, whose throw curves away from a batter, Kumble retired 
three Pakistani opponents without allowing a run and needed just 
three throws to take his third and fourth wickets. Overall, he 
threw 159 times, retiring the final four batters with just 16 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is undoubtedly one of the best bowling performances I've  
ever seen,'' India captain Mohammed Azharuddin said.

<HEADLINE>  Bowler Gets 10 Wickets in Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A perfect game in baseball. A 59 in  
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are rare events. But what Anil Kumble did in front of  
70,000 screaming cricket fans was rarer still. 
</P>
<P>
	In 122 years of international cricket only one other bowler has  
taken all 10 wickets in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	That it came during one of the sport's great rivalries -- India  
vs. Pakistan -- made it all the more startling. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble turned in the perfect 10 in India's 212-run victory, a  
performance that made him the hottest topic Monday at shops and bus 
stops, and grabbed headlines on newspapers, radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble allowed Pakistan 74 runs Sunday. That matched the feat of  
England's Jim Laker against Australia in 1956, when Laker gave up 
just 53 runs. By comparison, there have been 13 perfect games in 
the major leagues and three rounds of 59 in PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan knocked out as Kumble makes a killing,'' read one  
newspaper headline. Others had ``Kumble takes haul of fame,'' 
``Kumble makes history with perfect 10,'' and ``10 out of 10: 
Pakistan Kumbled at Kotla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Age said simply: ``Words fail this headline.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe tomorrow, when I read the newspapers, I will realize  
what happened,'' Kumble had said after teammate V.V.S. Laxman 
caught Wasim Akram's final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many television stations replayed the entire match Monday, while  
others showed Kumble's bowling over and over. And all over New 
Delhi, children rose early to play cricket before going to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kumble is my hero!'' said Chanchal Misra, a 12-year-old trying  
to copy Kumble's bowling action on his street. 
</P>
<P>
	Kumble's performance is hard to measure against other sports,  
but it could be seen as cricket's equivalent of a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	In test cricket, the highest level of international play, each  
team bats with 10 wickets -- or outs -- at stake in each of two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	A match takes five days to play and a single innings can last  
for more than 10 hours. No bowler -- cricket's pitcher -- can go the 
whole way, so wickets usually are spread among three or four 
players on each team. 
</P>
<P>
	India used four bowlers, but Kumble swept Pakistan himself. A  
leg-spinner, whose throw curves away from a batter, Kumble retired 
three Pakistani opponents without allowing a run and needed just 
three throws to take his third and fourth wickets. Overall, he 
threw 159 times, retiring the final four batters with just 16 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is undoubtedly one of the best bowling performances I've  
ever seen,'' India captain Mohammed Azharuddin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory helped India split the two-test series, the first  
played in this country against Pakistan in 12 years. Pakistan won 
the first test in Madras earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In this cricket-mad subcontinent, political rivalries have kept  
the Indian and Pakistani teams apart -- their armies have fought 
three wars since the independent nations were carved out of one 
British colony 51 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Wellesley Chef Brings Flare to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- When Chef Ming Tsai was preparing to  
open his restaurant last year, he wanted to make sure spirits from 
the funeral home across the street didn't interfere with business. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the restaurant free of bad karma, Tsai consulted a  
master of Feng Shui, the Chinese discipline that governs one's 
harmony with the surroundings. The master told him to ward off the 
spirits by displaying a mystical lion with a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the advice and, so far, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	Not only are customers streaming through the door of Blue  
Ginger, but he has a television show, ``East Meets West With Ming 
Tsai,'' his first cookbook is in the works, and a knife bearing his 
name is on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	A network producer discovered Tsai's culinary agility at a New  
Mexico restaurant where the chef was working. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said I had the presence that looked good on camera,'' Tsai  
recalled. Tsai's natural talents were enhanced by a coach who gave 
him some tips for cooking on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese-American chef now films 20 shows in two weeks at the  
Food Network's New York studios, hustling back to his restaurant on 
weekends. He plans to tape about 80 shows annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food Network airs his show weekdays at 3 p.m., 8 p.m. and  
11:30 p.m., on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., and Sundays at 
5:30 p.m. All times are EST. Eight back-to-back episodes, dubbed 
``Ming-A-Thon,'' will air next Monday (Feb. 15) from 8 to 11:30 
p.m. in celebration of the Chinese New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the show's Web site can be accessed at  
www.foodtv.com. The site features a show schedule, recipes and 
places to buy unusual ingredients used in some of Tsai's dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant, which opened last February, is located in an  
upscale suburb 14 miles west of Boston. Tsai and his wife, Polly, 
chose the Boston area after considering places where Tsai had 
mastered his craft, including Atlanta, Chicago, London and Paris. 
The abundance of ingredients available in Boston's Chinatown 
convinced Tsai to choose Wellesley. 
</P>
<P>
	Working in an open kitchen adjacent to the dining room, the  
34-year-old chef prepares dishes including his own recipes, among 
them aromatic braised lamb, Indonesian curry pasta with crispy 
coconut shrimp and Asian vegetables, and sake-miso marinated 
Chilean bass served with vegetarian soba noodle sushi. 
</P>
<P>
	The style of cuisine, known as East-West fusion, is a hit. The  
restaurant takes reservations four weeks in advance for Friday and 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple named the eatery Blue Ginger because blue is Tsai's  
favorite color. It also connotes water and the flow of water, an 
important part of Feng Shui's theory of the flow of energy. Blue 
ginger is also a medicinal stem found in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimalist design features black and white Italian granite  
floors, cherry wood furniture, and a sculptured water fountain. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teenager in Dayton, Ohio, Tsai nurtured his interest in  
cooking at his parent's Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering at  
Yale University in 1986. But cookery won out, and he journeyed to 
the Cordon Bleu in Paris where he honed his skills, working as a 
chef in Parisian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsai said he hopes his TV show inspires viewers to master Asian  
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
	```One of the goals is to demystify Asian ingredients and  
techniques,'' he said. ``A lot of people, when they hear Chinese or 
Thai or Japanese, they think, 'Oh that's too much chopping or too 
much prep work or the ingredients are too funky. We can't get those 
ingredients.' I think the exact opposite is true.'''
