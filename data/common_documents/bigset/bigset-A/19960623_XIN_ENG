<HEADLINE> EU Expected to Launch Fight Against Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders are
expected to launch a number of initiatives aimed at combating high
unemployment in member states, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, hosting the EU summit here today, said the summit will
approve some measures on regional funds, vocational training and
the funding of major communication networks.
</P>
<P>
This, however, might not conform to the grand Jobs Pact
presented by President of the European Commission Jacques Santer,
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The measures would only provide "partial tools" for resolving
the problem of unemployment, said Prodi, but a "very productive"
debate had made EU leaders know that no one has a single magic
recipe for creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini denied press
reports that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had rejected Santer's
pact out of hand.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the different approaches to the job creation
problem were simply a matter of emphasis and balance.
</P>
<P>
Germany stresses national and regional solutions to the
conundrum while Britain opposes the pan-European concerted action
to create jobs through costly projects, anathema to its
market-driven policies.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Russian and Chechen
rebel negotiators on implementing a ceasefire deal ended
fruitlessly today, the Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks, involving deputies to chief negotiators Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov and Chechen commander Aslan Maskhadov, concluded
without agreement on a fresh meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to work out details of the truce and
an exchange of prisoners in accordance with agreements reached in
May between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yandarbiyev in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
They met late last month in an effort to end the Chechen
conflict. The war has claimed more than 30,000 lives in the
breakaway republic since December 1994 when Yeltsin's troops
stormed in to put down the republic's independence bid.
</P>
<P>
The truce has generally held despite sporadic attacks and
mutual accusations of violations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Economy Strained by Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
facing a daunting task to check the snowballing foreign debt,
which, for the last few years, has been straining the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing 1995-96 fiscal year appears to be another
difficult year as Pakistan's disbursed and outstanding debt has
reached some 24 billion US dollars, or an astonishing 35.7 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the net transfer of foreign credit in the current
fiscal year, which is closing at the end of this month, has fallen
to a further 16 percent of the gross disbursement, after
adjustment of debt service amounting to 2.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In absolute terms, Pakistan received approximately 2.49 billion
dollars as gross disbursement, out of which the net transfer
amounted to only 388 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This means that most of what Pakistan borrows is used to
service its ever growing debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of net transfer has been halved since 1992-93
fiscal year when the debt service amounted to 1.65 billion
dollars, leaving a balance of 789 million dollars as net transfer.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the debt service figure of 2.1 billion
dollars, which represents as much as 25 percent of export receipts
and 3.4 percent of the GDP, does not include interest on
short-term borrowings and charges of the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
However, as percentage of total export earnings is concerned,
the outstanding debt has declined from 298.7 million dollars in
1993-94 fiscal year to 251 million dollars in the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from overseas Pakistanis, which once played a
significant role in bridging the balance of payments gap, are
shrinking fast, going down from three billion dollars a decade ago
to less than two billion dollars now.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the debt servicing liability is
expected to increase further in the coming year, claiming about 70
percent of total revenue.
</P>
<P>
Thus Pakistan will have to borrow more to overcome shortfall in
budget, and meet the development and current expenditure.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Pakistan's foreign debt will exceed the 35
billion dollar mark during the forthcoming fiscal year, in which
foreign assistance of 7.65 billion dollars will be obtained from
international donors.
</P>
<P>
The urgency to reduce the debt burden is clearly underscored by
the fact that the balance of deficit, which stood at 3.5 billion
dollars in the current account last year, is to rise to 4.1
billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is now making its best endeavors to
stabilize the macro economy and promote reforms in a bid to
achieve a better economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish a market-oriented economy in the country,
the government has been successful in attracting direct foreign
investment which is surely to overpass the one billion dollar mark
in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is expected to contribute to the lightening
of the debt burden if the bulk of it is to be used in
export-oriented industries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Pakistan, with immense economic
possibilities and as a potential large-scale export base for
Central Asian states, needs a long-term foreign exchange
projection if it is not to sink into a sea of debt.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Grant UN Inspectors Unrestricted Access to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N.
special commission on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction weapons
(UNSCOM), said here today that Iraq has agreed to grant U.N.
weapons inspectors unrestricted access to the sites suspected of
housing banned weapons material.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry
building today with the ministry's Undersecretary Riyadh al-Qaisy,
Ekeus said he and the Iraqi government has reached agreement on an
"immediate, unconditional, unrestricted" access to the suspected
sites the U.N. inspectors want to go.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said Iraq and the U.N. have signed a joint statement and
reached a joint program of action on the work of U.N. inspectors
in Iraq, both of which will be assessed by the U.N. Security
Council when he submits them to the Security Council Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic that there will be a positive
reaction from the Security Council about the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus said he was very much satisfied with the work done and
cooperation given by the Iraqi side in destroying al-Hakam
biological weapons manufacturing site last week.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the present standoff between Iraq and the U.N. is
over, the UNSCOM chief said he is convinced that there is no
standoff after these talks, and the decision on the political
assessment of the outcome of his talks in Baghdad is up to the
Security Council to make, adding that he will give positive
recommendation to the council.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question whether the UNSCOM will give a
beforehand notice to the Iraqi side about the inspection site, he
said, "As a rule, we do no give advance notice, sometimes we give
it if it is technically necessary."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Undersecretary Qaisy said during the talks both sides
expressed their commitments to full cooperation to accelerate
settlement of the remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
He said the joint program of action has been reached "to enable
the (special) commission to report to the Security Council as soon
as possible, and Iraq has met its obligations under U.N. Security
Council resolution 687."
</P>
<P>
Qaisy said his talks with Ekeus were conducted in an atmosphere
of mutual understanding and with a sincere desire to reach
agreement and to work jointly for the completion of the mandate of
the special commission outlined in Security Council resolution 687
and other relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus arrived here Wednesday for four-day talks with Iraqi
senior senior officials in an effort to defuse the latest standoff
between Iraq and the U.N. and ask Iraq to accept unconditional
U.N. weapons inspection required by the recent U.N. resolution.

<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberian gunmen today staged
another cross-border raid on a village in Guinea, the second in a
week, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Guinean officials were quoted by the report as saying that
they had no exact details about the casualty toll in Yaragbara
village but witnesses said about a dozen people were seriously
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lofa county, just across the Guinean border, is controlled by
fighters loyal to Liberian faction leader Alhaji Kromah, a
vice-chairman of Liberia's Transitional Ruling Council of State.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Cote D'Ivoire, both hosting hundreds of thousands
of Liberian refugees, have been the targets of cross-border raids
by gunmen from different factions who often foraging for food or
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have strengthened border patrols and Guinea has
told Liberia's State Council that it will pursue attackers into
Liberian territory if needed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Liberian gunmen crossed into Guinea,
wounding many people and burning homes of a village.
</P>

The most serious cross-border attack occurred on March 15 when
a group of Kromah's soldiers opened fires on a Guinean border
village, killing 35 people.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Reiterates Rights to Harness Territorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Water
Resources Shiferaw Jarso today stressed the rights to harness
rivers in its territory and engage in activities to develop the
Nile Basin.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister was reacting to the agreement reached
between Egypt and Sudan in 1959 on the sharing of the annual
water flow of the Nile River, which excluded the necessity of
consulting the upper valley countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would not be implemented in countries like
Ethiopia, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying that
without exploiting Nile which accounts for half of the country's
water resource, it is virtually impossible for Ethiopia to
overcome famine and be self sufficient in food.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's stand to use the Nile equitably and in common has
the backing of international law, the minister argued.
</P>
<P>
He said that small scale irrigation projects are underway in
Tigray, Amhara and Oromiya regional states to use the Nile river.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ethiopia gets 110.15 billion cubic meters
of water from its rivers while the subterranean water resources
is estimated at 2.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The Nile Basin which covers 17 percent of the area of the
country accounts for 52.62 billion cubic meters of the total
water resources of the nation.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Calls for Confronting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan called here
today for confronting terrorism, saying that "terrorism destroys
both the aggressor and the victim in equal measure."
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we must confront the problem of cross-border
terrorism, through condemnation, pursuit, and through the
liquidation of all pockets of terrorism, wherever their dens may
be, whatever may be their principles, and whoever may be their
organizers or victims," he said at a closed session of the Arab
summit, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that every Arab state has the right to seek
protection in a united Arab stand; but we deny any state the
right to protect the forces of evil and terrorism," he said in an
address, made available to the press covering the two-day Arab
summit, which is focusing on Arab solidarity and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came after it was reported that Jordan has
accused Syria of supporting terrorism. There has been no comment
from Syria on such reports.
</P>
<P>
"If we want Arab solidarity to be true in word and deed, we
must recall the courageous and responsible initiative of the
president and leader of Egypt" in holding the Peacemakers Summit
in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in March, he said. Anti-terrorism was
one of the main topics of the Sharm el-Sheikh summit, which was
called after Palestinian extremists carried out a series of
suicide bombing attacks in Israel in February and March, leaving
59 innocent people dead.
</P>
<P>
"It emphasized the need to fight terrorism, regardless of the
identity of its perpetrators and victims, or its alleged
objectives," said King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa admitted at a press
conference today that the Arab summit, which drew 21 of the Arab
League's 22 members, touched upon the issue of terrorism.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Asks Arab Leaders Not to Panic at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan told Arab
leaders who are meeting here for the two-day Arab summit not to
panic at the most recent developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the victory of hardline Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu in the recent Israeli elections,
which has aroused wide-spread apprehension among Arab countries
that the peace process will stop or even backtrack.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, whose country made peace with Israel in 1994,
has been more optimistic than other Arab leaders about the new
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The most recent developments in the region must not lead us to
panic, which would reflect unduly our position," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must consolidate our policies individually and
collectively," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Arab leaders to work together to close
Arab ranks and to "build bridges of trust and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king also urged the Israeli government to commit
itself to the Middle East peace process based on the land-for-
peace principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
today pledged to enhance the union under the present government
structure and maintain policies that have served well the
country, including socialism and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
He said this shortly after he was elected chairman of the
Revolutionary Party (CCM) by the party's extra-ordinary national
conference in Dodoma, central Tanzania. The CCM veterans,
including former president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, also attended
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The election of President Mkapa to CCM top leadership,
following the decision of Ali Hassan Mwinyi to step down, now
gives him a free and powerful hand in both the presidency and the
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
In his long acceptance speech, Mkapa who was elected president
in November last year, vowed to enhance discipline, efficiency
and integrity in the government and the party.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to marshal the nation towards sustainable
economic growth and more self-reliance and to follow the
footsteps of his predecessors, former presidents Julius Nyerere
and Mwinyi, in consolidating national unity, peace and
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
CCM would cooperate with other political parties in Africa for
the purpose of enhancing African unity, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa, 57, was a sole aspirant for the party
chairmanship. A report reaching here from Dodoma said, according
to the results announced by the outgoing chairman Mwinyi, Mkapa
got 1,248 votes of 1,259 cast, a 99.13 percent victory in the
election that was were formality.
</P>
<P>
The elections were also attended by diplomats and leaders of
opposition political parties.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspector: Iraq Hands over Weapons Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the
U.N. special commission on dismantling Iraq's mass destruction
weapons (UNSCOM), said in Bahrain today that Iraq has handed over
the data on its non-conventional weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus told a press conference in Manama, capital of Bahrain
that Iraq handed to him what it says are "full, final and complete
declarations" on its chemical and biological weapons and surface-
to-surface missiles, according to reports reaching here from
Manama.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspector arrived in Manama this evening after a
four-day visit to Iraq, during which Iraq and the U.N. reached a
joint program of action on the work of U.N. inspectors in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Baghdad, Ekeus said Iraq agreed today to grant
U.N. weapons inspectors "immediate, unconditional, unrestricted"
access to the suspected sites U.N. inspectors want to go.
</P>
<P>
He said that "what we received just a few hours ago, what we
still haven't reviewed, are full, final and complete declarations
on Iraq's weapons programs."
</P>
<P>
"I was very concerned when I entered Iraq ... but coming out of
the country I feel we've gotten somewhere," he said. "They said
yes to all our demands and handed us the declarations which, of
course, we have to verify."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council set up the weapons monitoring system
in April, 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President: Terrorism, Biggest Danger to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine Zeroual
today called for regional mobilization against terrorism, saying
that terrorism poses a great danger to peace and security in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president, whose country has been haunted by
waves of terror, made the appeal at the closed-door session of
the Arab summit, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism also threatens the developments of many countries,"
he said in an address in Arabic, which was available to the press
covering the summit.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Arab nations to take unified and forceful
actions to fight against terrorism, stressing the need to dry up
its financial, material and weaponry sources.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president also reaffirmed his country's support
to the Middle East peace process based on the "land-for-peace"
principle and called on the Israeli government to commit itself
to the agreements it signed with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to Iraq's absence from the ongoing summit,
he said Algeria wishes to see a real Arab solidarity "without any
exception."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to the summit because Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia have not yet forgiven its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian officials said that the return of Iraq to
the Arab fold would probably be picked up for discussion at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa admitted today at a press
conference that the Arab summit, which drew 21 of the Arab
League's 22 members, touched upon the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa Bin Suleiman al-Khalifa
this afternoon tried to seek Arab support for its government in
confronting Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world should stand behind Bahrain in condemning what
it called "foreign interference in Bahrain's internal affairs,"
al-Khalifa said when addressing a closed-door session of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Bahrain charged Tehran with plotting to
overthrow its government, but the latter dismissed it
outright.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Is the Beef War Really Over? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged beef war between
Britain and the European Union (EU) is claimed over after four
weeks of conflict. But observers here believe it is just "the
beginning of an end".
</P>
<P>
The settlement reached at the EU summit in Florence, Italy, on
Friday provided for a phased lifting of the EU-imposed ban on
British beef exports and ended Britain's non-cooperation policy
with EU business.
</P>
<P>
When the beef ban came into force, Britain announced a
non-cooperation policy last month, which meant Britain would block
any EU decision by using its veto power.
</P>
<P>
Despite the anger of Britain's EU partners about the use of
more than 100 vetoes, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
said immediately after the phased ban lifting was announced that
the tactics had paid off.
</P>
<P>
"For the first eight weeks of this very sad dispute, very
little progress was made. In the last four weeks we have seen real
progress of a substantial kind, and I am delighted," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Swedish Prime Minister Goran Perrson, one of many EU
leaders to warn Britain, said: "I think Britain will pay a very,
very high price for what they have done."
</P>
<P>
Britain's Prime Minister John Major was blamed for being late
to put forward his BSE eradication plan. Otherwise a deal could
have been achieved much earlier, said Klaus van der Pas, the
spokesman for the European Commission President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Major rejected such a claim. "We must not be too concerned that
a few people are rather grumpy. We are a collection of
nation-states which are fighting for their own national interest,"
he said, "No one could have been done so quickly."
</P>
<P>
The British side claimed that it had won all the concession it
had demanded and that its policy of non-cooperation with the rest
of the EU was at an end.
</P>
<P>
However, European Commission officials were quoted as saying
that the deal was only "a sop" to John Major to persuade Tory MPs
that he had not left the EU summit empty-handed. When Klaus van
der Pas was asked if he was happy with the deal, he said: "Yes,
because it doesn't commit the Commission to anything at all."
</P>
<P>
Another EU official even said that it was "just a piece of
paper" with no practical effect.
</P>
<P>
The sharp contradicted opinions on the ban-lifting framework
implies little of the value of the deal and also shows how fragile
the deal is. A political analyst commented on the framework by
saying that "it is just the beginning of an end."
</P>
<P>
To Britain the heart of the new battle is whether sales of
British beef will soon be permitted to third countries, such as
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister who will take over
the rotating EU presidency on July 1, bluntly dashed Britain's
burning desire to export its beef to third countries, saying "it
is extremely unlikely.... before there has been a step-by-step
lifting of the ban to the EU."
</P>
<P>
AS the  British government wanted two concessions from its EU
partners, first, it pressed for what Foreign Secretary Rifkind
described as "bankable assurances" that bodies such as the EU's
veterinary Committee would rubber-stamp any Commission
recommendations to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
Second, it urged that the ban on beef exports to countries
outside the EU be lifted before the ban within EU.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, what happens now proved that neither of the two
concessions required by Britain has been met. Political analysts
here asked: Can it really be trumpted as a victory for reason and
common sense, or Britain's national interests?

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Final Communique Stresses Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders here today called for
serious implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242,
338 and 425 on Israel's full withdrawal from all occupied Arab
territories including Arab Jerusalem, and stressed the necessity
and importance of restructuring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
In their final communique after two days' meeting, the leaders
said the achievement of a just and overall peace in the region is
a goal and strategic option, which could be effected in the light
of international legitimacy, and requires Israel to honor its
commitments seriously.
</P>
<P>
They gave Israel a clear warning, saying if the Jewish state
deviates from the Madrid principles or retreats from its peace
promises, the Arab states will be forced to reconsider the steps
they took toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
They urged Israel to implement all agreements with the Arabs
and seriously commit itself to the basis on which the Middle East
peace process was built.
</P>
<P>
They called for efforts to enable the Palestinians to exercise
their right to self-determination and statehood and demanded full
Israeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders also stressed the exigency that all countries
of the region join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, calling
anew for the creation of a nuke-free Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They said that restructuring Arab solidarity is the right way
to achieve the goals of common Arab action.
</P>
<P>
They called for the activation of the Arab economic action
institutions and the implementation of their resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the Economic and Social Council and the Arab
League Council to work out and put into effect integrated
economic and social strategies and plans.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders stressed their keenness on activating the
role played by the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
They underlined commitment to the necessity of maintaining
Iraq's unity while requesting the Iraqi government to
conclusively refrain from its "provocative" policies against its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
They also voiced concern over the human and material damages
sustained by the Libyan people as a result of U.N. embargoes.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern over a Turkish-Israeli military pact
concluded early this year, hoping that Ankara would adopt a
policy compatible with its own and Arabs' interests.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders stressed coordinated efforts to combat
terrorism, but underscored peoples' right to resist occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit was attended by 21 countries of the 22-member
Arab League. Iraq was not invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
The summit adopted a resolution, agreeing in principle on
establishing the Arab Court of Justice, a Code of Conduct for
Arab Security and Cooperation, and setting up the Arab League
Mechanism for the Prevention, Management and Resolution of
Conflicts among Arab States.
</P>
<P>
It also took a decision to request the Economic and Social
Council of the Arab League to take the necessary steps for a
speedy establishment of a Greater Arab Free Trade Area in
accordance with a program of action and a timetable to be agreed
upon.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Urge West to Settle Row with Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders gathering at a two-day
summit here demanded today that the international sanctions
imposed on Libya be lifted and Tripoli's row with some Western
countries be solved as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued at the end of the summit, they
said, "The continuation of the sanctions could lead the Arab
states to consider possible ways to spare the Libyan people
further harm."
</P>
<P>
They did not elaborate on what actions they may take if the
sanctions remain in their place.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders said that a proper solution to Libya's crisis
with the U.S., Britain and France has been much delayed due to
the "inflexibility" of these Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The delay has worsened woes of the Libyan people, they said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis broke out in the wake of a Pan AM airliner blast
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, which killed 270. Two Libyan
nationals were suspected of conducting the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Washington demanded the two suspects be tried in the United
States or Britain, but Tripoli refused and preferred to hand them
over to a third country.
</P>
<P>
The row prompted the United Nations to pass resolutions
against Libya, including international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders believe that the mandatory measures have
caused the Libyan people human and material damage, offering to
play a role of intermediation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, the Organization of African Unity, the
Non-aligned Movement and the Organization of Islamic Conference
have been working between the disputing parties, but little
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders have proposed that the two suspects stand
"neutral and fair" trial in the Hague before Scottish judges with
all necessary guarantees provided.
</P>
<P>
They considered it as an appropriate solution to the standoff,
the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The three Western countries were thus invited to take a
positive attitude vis-a-vis this proposal with a view to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was among the Arab leaders
at the summit here, looked satisfied with the result.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters before the summit concluded this afternoon
that he had proposed to hold another Arab gathering in
Damascus. Response from other Arab countries were unknown.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today his country would fully support
the proposal for an emergency Islamic summit on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after closing a seminar at Bangi near
here on trade and marketing opportunities in agro-based
industries, Abdullah said it was important to hold such a summit
because the question of Jerusalem was a major international issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Palestine President Yasser Arafat's call at the
Arab Summit in Cairo for Islamic countries to hold an emergency
summit to discuss the question of Jerusalem, Abdullah said it was
important to send a clear message to the international community
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out
negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, which is also a holy city
to the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia was prepared to host the summit, but
adding that it was too early to decide.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC) Ministerial Committee on Palestine should hold an official
meeting to discuss all issues concerning Palestine, including the
question of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia said Friday that it will suspend its trade ties with
Israel if the new Israeli government fails to continue peace
process in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Expresses Support to Bahrain in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Summit, in the final
communique, expressed "full support" to Bahrain for its measures
taken to safeguard its stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued at the end of two-day Arab summit,
denounced what it called the Iranian interference in Bahrain's
internal affairs, calling on Tehran to respect Bahrain's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has accused Iran of plotting to topple its current
government. Iran has totally rejected the accusations.
</P>
<P>
On the dispute between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran
over the three islands at the mouth of the strategic Hormuz
Strait, the gate way to the oil-rich Gulf, the communique said
that the Arab leaders affirmed the sovereignty of the UAE over
the three islands of Abu Musa, and Greater and Lesser Tunbs,
which are also claimed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders "call on Iran to put an end to its
occupation of the three islands and halt its policy of imposing a
fait accompli over these islands by force," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique added that the Arab leaders urged "pursuing
peaceful means in settling the dispute on the basis of
international law including the reference of the matter to the
International Court of Justice."
</P>
<P>
Iran is expected to respond to the statement as it has long
expressed its willingness to seek an early solution to its
dispute with the UAE through bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The communique expressed the stances of the Arab states on a
wide range of issues including the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa read the communique at a
press conference following the end of the summit and said that
there would be plans for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We have to implement them since they are adopted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the first in six years, drew 21 of the Arab
League's 22 members.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament to Ratify Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A treaty between Nepal and India
on the development of a border river will be ratified by the
Nepali parliament during its forthcoming tenth regular session, a
senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Narahari Acharya told a
press conference here that the treaty with India on the Mahakali
river was signed earlier this year on the basis of national
consensus in Nepal and all efforts to reach it have become
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
The commitment expressed by the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (UML) is highly positive, he added.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of the opposition party, which holds 88 seats
in the 205-seat lower house, on the ratification of the treaty
would be conclusive as its ratification needs a two-third
majority of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the parliament session to be convened Wednesday, the
government is to present its policy program and budget report for
the 1996-97 fiscal year beginning July 16.
</P>
<P>
According to Acharya, the government's policy program would
focus on "self-reliance" and "delegation of authority to
villages".
</P>
<P>
Nearly two dozen bills such as ending dual land ownership,
women's property rights and control of terrorism would also be
introduced in the parliament session, he said.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Develops Plan to Link Its Economy to Hong Kong's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone in south China's Guangdong Province has worked out a plan to
link its economic development with nearby Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The plan won the approval of economists and experts of State
Council departments, in China's top governing body, and of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Guangdong Province, and Hong
Kong at a meeting held in Shenzhen on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that linking Shenzhen's economy with that of
Hong Kong will not only benefit the stability and prosperity of
Hong Kong but also exert a great influence on economic growth in
south China and even in China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The plan covers a wide range of subjects on economic
coordination that include transportation, port construction,
energy, and water supplies for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the plan is realistic and feasible because it
takes infrastructures as the basis and proceeds in an orderly
manner.
</P>
<P>
They urged Shenzhen to accelerate its pace of reforms in
finance and port management, and to gradually build an economy
that is compatible with international practices and that will
increase high-tech cooperation with Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Urge Iraq to Comply with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders urged here today Iraq
to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions while
vowing to maintain its unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued at the end of a two-day Arab
summit, the first in six years, they asked Baghdad to refrain from
"aggressive" policies against its neighbors and release all
Kuwaiti prisoners of war along with other detainees, as requested
by the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent its troops to Kuwait in August 1990, triggering a
devastating war by the U.S.-led allied forces against it. The
U.N. Security Council has since adopted a series of resolutions
including international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies also imposed a "no-fly zone" in
northern Iraq to protect the rebel Kurdish tribe, provoking fears
that the country might be partitioned.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders underlined the necessity of maintaining
Iraq's unity and voiced their opposition to "any policy or measure
that affects its territorial integrity, or threatens its borders
and national unity," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
However, they called on Baghdad to commit itself to the
restitution of property and payment of reparations so as to get
the sanctions lifted and to create "favorable conditions for a
resumption of its role in the Arab regional order."
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. have recently reached an "oil-for-food"
deal, which was aimed at easing sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders hailed the agreement in their communique,
calling it a "positive step."
</P>
<P>
Iraq was not invited to the summit in a bid to warm up the
atmosphere of Arab solidarity since the Gulf countries still
refused to forgive Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the participants said that accepting Iraq to
the Arab family would help bolster Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh told reporters this
morning that it would be better if Iraq should have been present
at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Yabloko Group Lists Terms for Backing Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The liberal Yabloko Bloc, whose
leader got 5.5 million votes in the first round, has decided
to back President Boris Yeltsin in the July 3 runoff only "under
certain conditions," the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko, led by liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, said at a
closed-door conference that it wants to get a promise from Yeltsin
to limit the president's power by making amendments to the Russian
Constitution and end the Chechnya crisis immediately.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko is ready to support Yeltsin to be reelected under such
conditions as "limitation by the head of state of his power by
making amendments to the Russian Constitution, an immediate end to
confrontation in Chechnya, continuation of the government
reshuffling and some adjustment of the economic course," said the
Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
However, Yabloko said because it is difficult for Yeltsin to
fulfill most of these demands before the crucial vote, the bloc
will be satisfied with only such a promise.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the presidential elections on June 16,
Yeltsin won 35.28 percent of the votes, followed by Communist
leader Zyuganov with 32.04 percent, retired general Alexander
Lebed with 14.52 percent and Yavlinsky with 7.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
As none of the candidates won over 50 percent of the votes, a
runoff was set for early next month, in which voters will choose
between Yeltsin and Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Lebed declared he would support Yeltsin in the
runoff. He was appointed by Yeltsin on the same day as the head of
the powerful Security Council and national security assistant of
the president.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Trio Concludes High-Altitude Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, China, June 23 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The trio of Chinese
women swimmers Lin Li, Chen Yan and Nian Yun have reapt juicy
merits from their high-altitude training and hoped to make big
splashes at the up-coming Olympic Games in Atlanta, coach Zhang
Xiong said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"These women swimmers have made remarkable progresses in their
respecitve disciplines recently, and are gearing up in high tune
for the Olympics," said Zhang prior to his return to Beijing after
a 20-day training program.
</P>
<P>
"After an absence of one year, Lin Li swam to her personal best
time and again in the training and is capable of scoring good
marks in Atlanta," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta will mark the third time for Lin Li to compete in the
Olympic Games, the sole Chinese swimmer who competes in three
consecutive Games.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Lin finished seventh in both the 200m individual
medley and the 200m breaststroke in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, she clocked 2 minutes 11.65 seconds to win
the 200-meter individual medley for the first Olympic record set
by a Chinese athlete, which surpassed the 11-year-old Olympic mark
set by her German peer.
</P>
<P>
Lin also bagged two silver medals in the 200m breaststoke and
400m medley in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
"In the training, both Chen Yan and Nian Yun had swum for five
hours one day, sometimes even completed a distance of 20,000
meters to their most, and also recorded encouraging leaps in their
events," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In the National Champions Cup in April, Chen Yan, 18, won her
double golds in the 100m and 200m backstrokes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Nian Yun, a 17-year-old budding star, will
compete in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle medleys in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The trio flew to Kunming on May 26 for their second
high-altitute training.

<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese have long valued blood
ties, and have pushed for kind parents and obedient children and
harmony and mutual respect between husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
Now however, the influence of the law can be found in even the
most intimate relations between family members.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, a dispute over the registration of a trademark
arose between Wang Zhexing and his son Wang Manwu, who live in
Shenyang City in Liaoning Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old father claimed that he was the owner of "Old
Wang Seasoning" because he was the inventor, and that the
trademark belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
The son, however, held the view that he had made key
improvements in the seasoning, and that the illustration on his
trademark did not harm his father's image at all.
</P>
<P>
According to the Trademark Law, it seemed Wang Manwu was the
owner of the seasoning. "My face was burning when I submitted my
defence to the State Trademark Administration. Anyway, I was
standing in front of the same father who had brought me up," Wang
Manwu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it was he who had patented "Old Wang
Seasoning" and he would not give in, even to his father.
</P>
<P>
While this dispute was still going on, a young university
student had taken her father, an inveterate gambler, to court.
</P>
<P>
"I have warned my father many times, but to no avail. I think I
can only rely on the law," 22-year-old Shi Limei, from Tieling
City of Liaoning Province, wrote in a statement to the court.
</P>
<P>
"I feel rather bad in doing this, but without some action there
will be bigger tragedies in our family," she explained in the
letter.

family problems by using the courts and the country's more than

In some big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, and Hangzhou, lawyers have been asked to come to
people's houses.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with their marriage process, more newlyweds have

individual pre-nuptual property holdings, and the country's 3,100
notarization offices handled more than three million civil cases
in 1995.

The bride's mother, however, could in no way understand her

said that notarization helps protect personal interest and keep
family relations stable, and that it seems to be more reliable
than mere promises between a husband and wife in maintaining
marital relations.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some legal scholars, including such well-known
figures as Prof. Yang Dawen, have proposed adding property
registration to the Marriage Law, which is to be revised soon.
</P>
<P>
One economist has pointed out that it seems to be an
encouraging sign that people are paying more attention to the law
in areas that involve personal sentiment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some social commentators say they believe that
families are the small cells of a society, and that a better sense
of the law by family members will no doubt ensure the safety of
families and the society as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges US to Press Israel as EU Did </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that Egypt hopes that the United States
will urge Israel to stick to the principle of land-for-peace as
the European Union did Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference held after the
Arab leaders ended their two-day summit this afternoon, Moussa
said he hopes the United States, the co-sponsor of the Middle
East peace process, would take a similar position that protects
the interests of all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued at their summit Saturday, the 15 EU
leaders said that the new Israeli government must return the
occupied Arab territories if it wants to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They urged Israel and its Arab neighbors to resume peace
negotiations on the whole range of disputes, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he believes the Americans would continue to support
the Middle East peace process on the set basis.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who is to start a shuttle visit to the region next
week, will bring a message from the U.S. government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wide-spread apprehension among Arab nations arose after
hardline Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was elected new Israeli
Prime Minister. Netanyahu's strong policy guidelines include
three noes: no independent Palestinian State, no return of the
Golan Heights to Syria and no talks on the future status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The United States has announced that it still backs the
"land-for-peace" formula but it is expected to push Tel Aviv
harder.
</P>
<P>
Many people remain skeptical about prompt American actions
before its presidential elections later this year.

<HEADLINE> Present Conditions Not Favorable for Kinkel's China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to postpone the
visit of German Vice Federal Chancellor and foreign minister Klaus
Kinkel to China on July 11, a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Present conditions are not favorable for Kinkel's visit to
China from July 11 to 14. Therefore, the Chinese side has decided
to postpone this visit," the spokesman revealed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the German government adopted an anti-China
resolution in relation to Tibet on June 20 in spite of repeated
and serious protests by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"This action of the federal parliament is an open violation of
international principles and gross interference in China's
internal affairs, severely hurting the feelings of the Chinese
people," the spokesman emphasized, "For this reason the Chinese
lodged a protest and expressed strong displeasure and indignation
to the German side."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to maintaining
friendly relations and cooperation with Germany, he said. "The
recent disruption in Sino-German relations was unilaterally caused
by Germany," the spokesman noted, adding that "the Chinese side
sincerely hopes the German side will take clear steps to promote
the sound development of Sino-German ties, protecting the
fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jingjiu (Beijing-Kowloon)
Railway is scheduled to go into full operation in September of
this year, the Ministry of Railways said here today.
</P>
<P>
Work on installation of necessary rail facilities is nearing
completion, and ministry personnel are assessing the results of
the project.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight percent of the buildings, nearly 4,000 km of
high-voltage wires, 53 power distribution centers, and more than
3,000 km of cable laying have been completed.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, trains started to run on the rail
line at a speed of 45 km per hour at the end of April, and the
figure will go up to 60 km per hour next month.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, a total of 8.7 million tons of cargo has been
moved on the railway.
</P>
<P>
China began work on the railway in 1993. It is the country's
most important north-south transport line. Track laying, which
totalled more than 2,500 km, was finished in November of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Hong Kong Students Study Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Hong Kong students
studying overseas has dropped almost 30 percent since 1991, as
shown by statistics provided by the Hong Kong Immigration
Department and relevant consulates.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 18,900 student visas issued in 1991, while
the figure of last year was about 13,300, down 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Traditional places selected by Hong Kong students, including
Britain, the United States and Canada, all reported declines over
the past few years. Australia was the only country to see an
increase, with the number of student visas rising 12 percent in
1995 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tertiary industry is believed to be one of the
reasons for the declining number of students going abroad. There
are seven tertiary institutions in the city, while a few years ago
there were only three. High cost of studying overseas might be
another consideration.
</P>
<P>
Some educators warned that if the trend continues, Hong Kong's
international competitiveness would be hampered. They believed
that local students with overseas experience would help Hong
Kong's development with their broad-based knowledge and open
views.

TAIYUAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A three-billion yuan road to the
future is set to open in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan-Jiuguan Expressway will ease a chronic bottleneck
for traffic in the country's largest coal base.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi produces 300 million tons of coal a year, and the new
road scheduled to opened to traffic on June 25 will help boost its
coal industry.
</P>
<P>
The 144-km-long expressway starts at Taiyuan, capital city of
Shanxi, and stretches to Jiuguan, a city where Shanxi borders with
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The route will carry millions tons of coal through high
mountains, in a bid to provide east China's coal-starved provinces
and cities with "black gold".
</P>
<P>
"The expressway is a bridge linking east China and west China,"
said Hu Fuguo, secretary of the provincial committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
As the first expressway in Shanxi's history, it took 50,000
workers two years and nine months to complete, involving a total
investment of three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the provincial government outlined its blueprint for
the area, vowing to considerably change the province's
backwardness and make it open wider to the outside world within
five years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years the province has invested 13 billion
yuan to repair roads, over three times the figure for the previous
ten years.
</P>
<P>
Proven coal deposits in Shanxi stand at 260 billion tons,
accounting for one-third of the country's total.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian official Nabil Shaath
today described the Arab summit as "very positive," saying that
its convening itself is a big success because it brought together
all Arab parties invited.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting has been very positive, we really have seen very
little tension, if at all, during the meetings of the Arab foreign
ministers and leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the summit, the first one in six years, as "a
campaign for peace."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two-day summit, which ended today, was aimed
at ensuring that the Middle East peace process continues on the
bases upon which it started at the Madrid peace conference in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said that U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338
and 425 should be implemented, calling on Israel to withdraw from
all occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Israel wants to change the bases for the
peace process, and change the principle of land-for-peace to that
of "peace-for-peace," the Arabs will "reconsider" their policies
toward it.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel aborts the peace process, the price will be high"
for both the Israelis and the Arabs to pay, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad prior to the summit,
saying that it "opened a new page in relations between the PLO
and Syria."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Ambassador to China
Sverre Johansen has said that President Jiang Zemin's upcoming
visit to his country will help relations and cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In an article on Norwegian-Chinese relations, the ambassador
expressed the belief that Jiang's first Norwegian visit will
provide a fine opportunity for the Chinese to learn more about
Norway and a new chance for the two countries to learn from each
other.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, with its vast economic scale and
fast-developing modernization, has strong political and economic
influence, and a stable and prosperous China will play a very
important role in the world.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reiterated that the Norwegian government
supports the "one China" policy and respects China's territorial
integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Norwegian-Chinese economic and trade
cooperation is mutually beneficial and complementary and in order
to make full use of the situation more Norwegian companies have
set up joint ventures and Norway-funded enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' similarities, including rich fish,
hydro-electric power, oil, and natural gas resources, have become
the basis of bilateral economic cooperation, the ambassador said,
pointing out that Norway is eager to cooperate with China in
environmental protection, energy, shipping, telecommunications,
and basic industries.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Norwegian government and business
circles have recently formulated a unified strategy for expanding
cooperation with China, whose aim is establishing long-term
economic and trade cooperation with China based on the political,
economic and cultural ties.
</P>

<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, president of the
Awami (people's) League (AL) in Bangladesh, was sworn in here this
afternoon as the country's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas administered the oath-taking.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the swearing-in of the prime minister, 11
ministers and 8 state ministers of the cabinet also took oath.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, 49, whose party has become the largest party in the
country's seventh parliament after the general elections held on
June 12 by winning 146 out of 300 seats, is expected to address
the nation over radio and television tonight after taking the oath
of office.
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon, President Biswas met with the AL chief and
extended an invitation to her to form the new government.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the president has invited me to form the government and
we have decided to form the government tomorrow (Sunday) as it is
the founding day of the Awami League," she, appearing relaxed,
said after the meeting. "It's people's victory."
</P>
<P>
Hasina, the eldest daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the father of the nation who was the first head of state
after Bangladesh won independence in 1971, was elected AL
president in 1981, six years after she escaped from an
assassination during which her father, mother and three brothers
were killed by some disgruntled army officers.
</P>
<P>
Elected as the leader of the opposition in the parliament,
Hasina led her AL and the opposition alliance in launching
prolonged campaigns against the military rule of the then H.M.
Ershad regime in the 1980s and the immediate government of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Announces Breakthrough in Mindanao Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced here today that the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) agreed to establish the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development after three days of
talks.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos made the announcement after the two sides ended
a mixed committee meeting in Davao city this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"This effectively resolves a most contentious political issue
bugging the peace negotiations and hopefully paves the way for a
final peace agreement in the near future," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The president welcomed the development "not only for the
benefit it will reap in terms of public and private investments,
but for its impact on the lives and livelihood of our masses in
the area, many of whom have been caught in a cruel cycle of
conflict and poverty."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the two sides also agreed to remove major
obstacles to peace in southern Philippines before the fourth round
of talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, next month.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing ceremony at 12:30 p.m., MNLF Chairman Nur
Misuari said there was a breakthrough at the last closed door
conference shortly before noon on how things could take off from
Tripoli Accord of 1976 in order to settle the 24-year Mindanao
conflict once and for all.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we are through here," he said in an ambush interview as
he emerged from the last conference at the insular Century Hotel.
"But there are still some problems hanging around our necks."
</P>
<P>
What stalled the meeting were the equally ticklish issues on
regional security force in southern Philippines and the
integration of MNLF fighters into the government forces. The
government had rejected the demand by MNLF to establish the
security force.
</P>
<P>
Dr. H. Hassan Wirajuda, chairman of the meeting from Indonesia,
said at the closing ceremony that the remaining issues will be
ironed out soon in Manila prior to the final round of talks in
Jakarta.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Daily necessities in the markets
here have remained stable compared with those in April, a rare
phenomenon since Mozambique practised a free market economy a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The price of grade 2 rice is now sold at 6,000 (half a U.S.
Dollar) to 6,500 Meticais while it fetched as high as 8,000 to
11,000 Meticais last September, local merchants told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
Good stocks have brought down the prices since mid-October, a
trader said.
</P>
<P>
prices of maize, edible oil, soap, sugar and peanuts have
witnessed the same phenomena since mid-October due to the same
reason, traders said.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of maize, the stable food of the Mozambicans, now
fetches 5,000 to 5,500 Meticais in the capital, while a liter of
edible oil is sold for M16,000, and a bar of soap for M6,500.
</P>
<P>
The city authorities have more than 10,000 tons of rice in
stock and over 5,600 tons donated by Japan will be due at port
Maputo at any time. What is more, the good harvest of the new
maize crop this year will soon be on the market.
</P>
<P>
All this will contribute to keeping the prices of goods
down at least in the near future.

market, and attract more overseas financial institutes, including
those of Hong Kong, to set up their branches or agencies in the
province.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Jiangsu will play host to over one million overseas
visitors annually, while some 11,000 citizens of Jiangsu are
expected to travel abroad for sightseeing at their own expense,
Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
A new airport, to be completed before Hong Kong's return to the
motherland on July 1, 1997, is currently under construction in
Nanjing, capital city of the province. It will provide an
additional convenient and efficient channel for people of both
sides.

<P>
NANJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The annual import and export value
of Nanjing, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is scheduled to
reach 34 billion U.S. dollars by end of the century.
</P>
<P>
And a quarter of it, around 8.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of
trade, will be conducted with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Silin, governor of the province, made the remark in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
Jiangsu's total import and export value will increase at an annual
rate of 19.4 percent in the forthcoming five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province is to establish an overseas trade and economic
network, with Hong Kong in a crucial position as it bridges the
province with Southeast Asia and the Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Jiangsu exported 2.8 billion U.S.dollars worth of goods
to Hong Kong, accounting for one-fourth of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as a result, became the province's second biggest
trade partner after Japan.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the number of Hong Kong-funded joint ventures in the
province reached 14,143, involving contractual overseas investment
topping 16.5 billion U.S.dollars.

<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders ended their two-day
summit here today, urging Israel to seriously honor its
commitments to the Mideast peace process and calling for
restructuring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who chaired the summit,
made a brief closing speech at this afternoon's session.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak restressed the importance of closing Arab ranks and
pushing ahead with the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The summit ended at 14:10 local time (1110 GMT) after the Arab
leaders held a 10-minute closing session.
</P>
<P>
After its opening session Saturday morning, the summit was
held in camera, and the leaders were believed to be locked in hot
debates over a final communique.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one countries of the 22-member Arab League attended the
summit. To avoid possible controversies, Iraq was not invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
The final communique was issued at the end of the summit. It
gives a clear warning to Israel that if the Jewish state deviates
from the Madrid principles on which the peace process was built,
the Arab states will be forced to reconsider the steps they took
toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
The document also dwells on the means of closing Arab
ranks, clearing the Arab atmosphere and effecting Arab
solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Physicists Invent New Microscope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli physicists have
developed a new microscope that could measure accurately the
conductivity of the tiniest material at lower cost, the Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important characteristics of a material is its
electrical conductivity. In the field of micro-electronics, it is
vital to gather accurate information on conductivity down to the
level of microns or even smaller measurements.
</P>
<P>
The new microscope, developed by Professor Dan Davidov and
Dr. Micharel Golosovsky of the Recah Institute of Physics of
Hebrew University, provides data in sizes of 10 microns and is
expected to get down to one micron, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The device was built with a crack through which unguided waves
only a few millimeters long are passed. These hit the material
(without destroying it) and return to the device, allowing exact
measurement of the conductivity, and a computer then processes
the data to turn it into pictures.
</P>
<P>
Davidov was quoted as saying that previous microscopes using
the near-field principle did not provide information about
conductivity, and the only industrial way to measure the
conductivity of material in integrated circuits and chips without
destroying them was by using electron microscopes that cost
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Davidov and his team, their invention is much
cheaper, easier to operate and does not require a vacuum for
operation, and a commercial firm has already expressed interest
in commercializing the microscope for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
The new microscope, which won Hebrew University's Kaye Prize
for Innovative Research, has been patented by Uissum, the
university's research-and-development arm.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Duke Amedeo of Savoy in Italy has
opened a mountain resource center here in Uganda, reported the
local daily "the new vision" today.
</P>
<P>
During the opening-ceremony on Tuesday, the Duke handed over a
collection of scientific photographs from Museo Nazionale Della
Montgna in 1906 by Prince Luigi of Savoy who is also Duke of
Ambruzzi.
</P>
<P>
The 90-year-old pictures are of animals and plants of Mount
Rwanzori, its summit Margherita with a height of 5,590 meters,
ranking first in Uganda and third in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some of them also show the royal houses of the Tooro Kingdom
in the mountain area and snow covered peaks. the pictures will be
permanently exhibited at the centers in the Geography Faculty of
Arts, Makerere University here.
</P>
<P>
The Duke later handed over copies of the same collection to
the Uganda Museum here.
</P>
<P>
Ms Joy Tukahirwa, chairperson of the recently held Rwenzori
scientific conference was quoted as saying that the center would
be used to collect data and artifacts on mountains in east
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Prince Luigi of Savoy in Italy was the first Italian to reach
the peaks of Mt. Rwenzori. The Prince who reached the peaks in
1906 also met the king of Tooro Kingdom in the Mt. Rwenzori area,
southwestern Uganda then.
</P>
<P>
He had climbed lofty mountains including Kiyanja peak (Mount
Baker), Semper Edward, Luigi Di Savioa and the Moore Peaks.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A picture book version of Karl
Marx's famous "Kapital" has been published by a Beijing-based
publisher, marking a shift of picture book aimed solely at
children to the adult market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has seen a rapid growth of
picture book publications, said an official at the Press and
Publication Administration, which was set up in 1987, facilitating
the functioning of the country's press and publications.
</P>
<P>
But the thriving picture book market has also become a major
concern of the nation, and caused disputes among experts in the
past years, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Picture books based on some classics were edited and published
mainly for children in the past, but now many picture books on
historical and academic works have started to be distributed on
the market, the official added.
</P>
<P>
It has helped spread basic knowledge of history and humanities,
but not all books can be pictorialized, and in no time can picture
books replace original works, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, picture books cost readers much more to buy. They
usually spend about 100 yuan on a single copy.

MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) agreed today to remove major
obstacles to peace in the southern Philippines before the fourth
round of talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, next month.
</P>
<P>
This was the outcome of the eighth mixed committee meeting that
ended today in Davao city. The talks started Friday after a
three-day delay caused by the later arrival of MNLF delegates.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing ceremony at 12:30 p.m., MNLF Chairman Nur
Misuari said there was a breakthrough at the last closed door
conference shortly before noon on how things could take off from
Tripoli Accord of 1976 in order to settle the 24-year Mindanao
conflict once and for all.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we are through here," he said in an ambush interview as
he emerged from the last conference at the insular Century Hotel.
"But there are still some problems hanging around our necks."
</P>
<P>
What stalled the meeting were the equally ticklish issues on
regional security force in southern Philippines and the
integration of MNLF fighters into the government forces. The
government had rejected the demand by MNLF to establish the
security force.
</P>
<P>
Dr. H. Hassan Wirajuda, chairman of the meeting from Indonesia,
said at the closing ceremony that the remaining issues will be
ironed out soon in Manila prior to the final round of talks in
Jakarta.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's jailed ex-president
H.M. Ershad, who was released briefly on a 4-hour parole, took
oath as a member of parliament here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who took power in 1982 and was forced to step down in
1989, has been serving prison terms in the Dhaka Central Jail on
corruption charges since December 1990. As chairman of the Jatiya
(national) Party (JP), he contested in five constituencies during
the just-completed seventh parliamentary elections and won all the
seats.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Shaikh Razzaque Ali administered the oath to Ershad
among 26 MPs-elect of the JP and 15 others from the Awami
(people's) League (AL) and the Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before the oath-taking, Ershad reiterated
that his party had already extended its "absolute and
unconditional" support to the AL, which has become the largest
party in the parliament after the general elections and is ready
to form a new government this afternoon, in the great interest of
the establishment of democracy and continuation of the
constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he feels being a free man, he said he was feeling
good but regretted that he could not do anything for the people
even after being elected a member of parliament. He hoped that
there would be no repeat of such injustice on anyone in future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his optimism about restoration of peace and
stability in the country with the installation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Friday, 132 MPs from the AL already took oath of office.
According to the arrangement by the Parliamentary Secretariat, MPs
from the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which was
defeated by the AL in the polls, should also be sworn in today.
But the BNP last night suddenly changed their mind and decided not
to join the function today.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Says US Sanction Naive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today dismissed the latest U.S. secondary sanction
approved by the House of Representative as a "naive" action.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the United States is still naive since it
is aimlessly pursuing threat, sanction and conspiracy similar to
those 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old president made the statement in an address to
Iranian high-ranking judiciary officials here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday voted 415-0 to
approve a measure that would sanction foreign oil firms investing
40 million U.S. dollars or more in Iran in a single year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the bill, Rafsanjani
criticized the United States for threating the Iranian
people, saying that Americans "can not bring the Islamic
revolution and the Republic to its knees by threats of using
force or compulsion."
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Rafsanjani called for a high degree of
political awareness of the high-ranking officials, saying "the
enemies of Islam are looking for opportunities to find flaws in
our work so as to bring Islam under question and deplore our
performance."
</P>
<P>
Directing his remarks on the judiciary officials, he said,
"many eyes in the world are focused on us and, therefore, in
handling cases in which the enemy is looking to find an excuse,
we must observe full political awareness."
</P>
<P>
He further warned the judges against favoritism and other
personal considerations in their practice and judgment.
</P>
<P>
"An environment should be created in the society that people
will never doubt fairness and impartiality of the officials in
charge," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Pleads for Peace in Kwazulu/Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's success in
achieving democracy would be overshadowed as long as there is
bloodshed in Kwazulu/Natal province, President Nelson Mandela has
said.
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Times" today quoted Mandela as saying until every
South African could enjoy the fruits of the democracy and make
choices free from fear and intimidation, the country would never
be able to crawl out of the dark shadows of hatred and conflict
into the full sunshine of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an election rally of over 10,000 ANC supporters in
Durban Saturday, Mandela repeated his calls for peace in
Kwazulu/Natal, saying peace initiatives embarked on by ANC and
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters provide a critical step
in building lasting peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections in strife torn Kwazulu/Natal on
June 26 will be a struggle between the African National Congress
(ANC) and the IFP.
</P>
<P>
"The way we conduct ourselves during this election period will
either promote or undermine the peace process," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, National Party leader F. W. De Klerk said at
an election rally that his party is prepared to help form "a new
political alignment" to challenge the ANC in the 1999 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
However, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi urged his supporters
at an election rally in Newcastle to resist central government,
but said the forthcoming local election in Kwazulu/Natal should
be free and fair.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Environment
Protection Agency (EPA) has received international recognition for
its work, winning the 1995-96 institutional award for excellence
from the International Association for Impact Assessment.
</P>
<P>
The award was decided at a meeting in Portugal this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this in a statement today, Federal Environment
Minister Robert Hill said that the award cited the EPA for
leadership in, and commitment to, environmental assessment.
</P>
<P>
"Recognition by leading peer professionals from across the
world is a significant acknowledgment of our contribution to the
development of environmental impact assessment internationally,"
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
However, the EPA is at the moment under threat of abolition,
which was mooted by the Finance Department as part of the
government's extensive cuts to public spending aimed at returning
the budget to balance within two financial years.
</P>
<P>
The government might reconsider the abolition proposal after
the EPA received the international award.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Enhancing Quality of Party Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency today
published a speech made by Chinese Party leader Jiang Zemin on the
improvement of the quality of party and government officials.
</P>
<P>
The speech, which is titled "Work Hard to Build a Contingent of
High-Quality Cadres" and has six parts, was made by the general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) in Beijing on June 21 at a forum marking the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
"We've got one basic piece of experience over the past 75
years, that is, any success of our cause led by the Party needs
not only the correct theories and lines, but also a contingent of
high quality cadres who can firmly implement the Party's theories
and lines," Jiang said in the opening of his speech.
</P>
<P>
In Part One of his speech, Jiang talked about the extreme
importance of and basic requirements for the building of a
contingent of high-quality cadres.
</P>
<P>
"Cadre becomes the decisive factor once a political line is
determined," he pointed out, adding that the Party has always
attached great importance to the building of the contingent of
cadres throughout its history.
</P>
<P>
It is all for a good contingent of cadres, who steadily
enhanced their quality by withstanding various tests, and led the
general public to firmly carry out the correct lines of the Party
in all historical periods, that the Party has overcome all sorts
of hardships and difficulties, preserved powerful cohesive force
and combat strength, and achieved one victory after another, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that whatever jobs they take, Party cadres,
especially the leading cadres, must all possess the same basic
political quality.
</P>
<P>
The most important, he said, is that they must have the lofty
ideals of communism, stick to a firm and correct political
orientation, be unswerving on the road to building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and carry out the Party's fundamental
theories, basic lines and policies in a firm and thorough-going
way.
</P>
<P>
What is more, he said, they should devote their efforts to
putting into practice the Party's sole purpose to serve the people
whole-heartedly, to maintaining close ties with the masses of
people, and to safeguarding the people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, cadres should emancipate the mind, seek truth from the
facts, be good at pioneering work and apply in their work the
materialist dialectic working methods and styles, Jiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fourthly, he added, they should be pace-setters in observing
the Party's disciplines and abiding by the laws, being clean and
honest, carrying forward the style of hardworking, and being
active in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, they should study and work hard to accumulate knowledge
and experience, and be qualified for their jobs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Part Two of his speech deals with the study of the cadres.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do in cultivating cadres is to launch a
sustained campaign to urge the cadres, especially leading cadres,
to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, as well as Marxism, Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that today's CPC is a large party with 57
million members, over 400,000 leading cadres above the county
level, several thousand senior cadres, and several hundred Central
Committee members, with the mission of leading a large country
with a population of 1.2 billion in the course of socialist
modernizations.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is of extreme significance for us to strengthen
the theoretical study and arm the whole party, especially the
leading cadres, with Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to achieve these goals needs painstaking efforts
by the whole party, and said that priority should be given to the
issue of uniting theory with practice.
</P>
<P>
"If we unite theory with practice well, we can carry out the
Party's lines and policies more conscientiously and more
comprehensively, and can eliminate interference from various
erroneous tendencies, and reduce or avoid in our work
one-sidedness, thinking in terms of absolutes, and vacillating now
to the left and now to the right," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
While studying the Marxist theories earnestly, he said, Party
cadres should also work hard to acquire knowledge of socialist
market economy, modern science and technology, laws, and other
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Laying much emphasis on the study of history, he expressed the
hope that leading cadres at all levels spend some time on history,
both of China and of the world.
</P>
<P>
In Part Three, Jiang spoke of cultivating cadres through
practice.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fundamental way of the Party to have its cadres
trained and cultivated in practical work," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said it has been proved by past experience that cadres
making faster progress are usually those who devote themselves to
the practical work and maintain close ties with the masses of
people.
</P>
<P>
To go deep into the realities and immerse themselves among the
masses will help the cadres improve their work and guarantee the
full implementation of the Party's lines and policies, as they can
have a better knowledge of the public opinions and feelings, Jiang
added.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Accused of Planned Samper's Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian military
accused four arrested guerrillas of being involved in a rebel plot
to assassinate President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the 13th Army Brigade said the rebels, urban
commandos belonging to a major guerrilla group in the nation, were
also planning attacks against many other public figures in
response to Samper's recent exoneration in Congress on drug
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
The four rebels, including two women, were arrested at a
safehouse in the southern part of the capital city along with a
large cache of weapons, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The seized weapons included a surface-to-air missile launcher
with nine projectiles that were to have been used in the attack on
Samper, presumably by downing the presidential jet, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The weapons cache also included over 70 high-power grenades,
eight mortar rounds and thousands of rounds of munitions for
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Targets for assassination apart from Samper were believed to
include several congressmen who voted to clear him of the
corruption charges, the military sources said.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the lower house of Colombia's
Congress voted to announce Samper innocent of any wrongdoing in
connection with charges that he used drug money to finance his
1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The rebels targeting Samper for assassination were caught
shortly before dawn on Saturday in the working-class district of
Ciudad Bolivar, the military sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
In Part Four of his speech, Jiang emphasized the selection and
use of cadres. He said that "to select and appoint officials well
in accordance with the Party's policies serves as a key link to
enhance the quality of officials."
</P>
<P>
The masses of people know best the merits and demerits of
officials, and they are best qualified to judge officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only through the integration between the leadership and the
masses, can officials be well selected for proper jobs. The masses
of people should be made to participate more in recommending and
appraising officials, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of well selecting officials, Jiang said in the
fifth part of his speech that the building of leading groups is
the key to the cultivation of the whole contingent of officials.
</P>
<P>
"Leading groups at various levels must be made strong to firmly
carry out the Party's basic line, serve the people whole-heartedly
and have the capability for leading the modernization drive,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the key to building well leading groups is
selecting right heads for such leading groups, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on leading officials to enhance the unity of
leading groups. In the meanwhile, leading officials should be
assigned to posts in a new place or department after they hold
posts in a place or department for a period of time for the
benefit of their progress and improvement and preventing wrong
doings.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth part of his speech, Jiang urged young officials to
work hard at all knowledge necessary for the cause of the Party and
the people, including theory, history, economics, science and
technology, management and laws.
</P>
<P>
Young officials should treat the people and their work with
high enthusiasm and responsibility, and make outstanding
achievements at their working posts through hard work and in
pioneering spirit.
</P>
<P>
In particular, young officials must cultivate correct outlook
about the world, life and values, stick to correct political stand
and orientation, and withstand various tests.
</P>
<P>
"Communist Party committees at various levels must show cordial
care for young officials and be strict with them," Jiang said,
urging the committees to boldly press them with important tasks so
as to enhance their quality through practices.
</P>
<P>
"We whole-heartedly expect that young officials will become
mature as soon as possible to shoulder important trans-century
missions," Jiang said, adding that this is a fundamental guarantee
to carry forward the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Pacific coast is
threatened by a tropical storm which was upgraded to a hurricane,
according to a report of the National Hurricane Center of the
United States today.
</P>
<P>
The intense hurricane, which was 145 kilometers south-southwest
of the Mexican port of Ciudad Lazaro Cardenas on Saturday, is
expected to drift north-northwest during the night and hit land
sometime on Sunday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Ciudad Lazaro Cardenas is 300 kilometers southwest of Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, the hurricane would bring winds of 145
kilometers per hour and rain of up to 25 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
But the Mexico's southern mountains would weaken the hurricane
as it moves towards Mexico's inland, said the hurricane center.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ruling Party to Hold Extraordinary Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The executive bureau and the
central committee of the Greek ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) will hold an extraordinary meeting later today
following veteran statesman Andreas Papandreou's death early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis will summon his
cabinet for an emergency meeting this afternoon after his urgent
return from a European Union summit just concluded in Florence,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Simitis was expected to compete with Interior Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos to succeed Papandreou as the PASOK's leader at a
forthcoming party congress scheduled to be held next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But it was reported that the party's executive bureau would
consider postponing the congress for at least one week.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou founded the PASOK in 1974 and formed the first
socialist government after the PASOK won parliamentary elections
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He was re-elected as the prime minister in 1985 as the party's
foreign policy of keeping distance from the United States gained a
grand support of the Greek people.
</P>
<P>
After four years out of government, Papandreou made a comeback
to power in the 1993 elections and resigned last January due to
the health problems of heart and lung.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Continue Closed-Door Meetings at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders continued their
closed-door meetings here today to iron out their differences to
unify their stances on issues related to the Arab world,
foremost of which are Arab solidarity and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In their addresses delivered at the summit Saturday, Arab
leaders called for continuing the Arab-Israeli peace process
based on the principle of land-for-peace and relevant
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of participating states each have shown
their own special concerns.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi vowed that the Arabs would
stick to the principle of land-for-peace and called on Israel to
withdraw from all occupied Arab land, including south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Oman, which was the first Gulf Arab country to establish
trade relations with Israel, also said that the Arabs will not
accept any alteration to the basic principles of Israel's
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi
emphasized in remarks published by the Cairo press today that
Israel is not entitled to change the course of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, however, said that the election of
hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister should not
drive the Arabs to panic. He also emphasized that cross-border
terrorism should be confronted.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Liamine Zeroural, whose country
has been haunted by waves of terrorism in the past few years,
also stressed the importance of combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali indicated that
Tunisia was for the normalization process with Israel though some
Arab states have reportedly called for slowing down such a
process to press Israel to honor its commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir called on other Arab states
to support his government and pay more attention to the
situation in his war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He has called for an end to the international blockade on
Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi also has his own viewpoints. He
told reporters Saturday that he wasn't interested in peacemaking
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders have been apparently serious so far in bridging
their gaps at the summit, which drew 21 of the Arab League's 22
members.
</P>
<P>
On the opening day of the summit Saturday, according to local
reports, at least 25 meetings between Arab leaders were held on
the sidelines of the summit, the first in six years for Arab
countries after the end of the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the Arabs are still facing an uphill task in closing
their ranks and solving their inter-Arab rifts, observers
believe.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa canceled without giving
any explanation his scheduled press conference Saturday night
amid speculation that there were heated debates and it was
difficult to reach consensus on the final communique to be issued
at the end of the summit today.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Meets Jamaican Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, met here today with Edward Seaga,
Jamaican Labor Party leader and former prime minister, and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference National Committee, said that Seaga, as a
senior statesman and an old friend of the Chinese people, has
made positive contributions to the friendly relations and
cooperation between the two countries for many years.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is willing to continue to develop and strengthen its
friendly relations and cooperation with Jamaican Labor Party on
the basis of the four principles governing party-to-party
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Seaga on China's domestic situation, Li said that the
Chinese people, under the CPC leadership, have made tremendous
progress in the socialist construction since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949 despite some setbacks.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee in late 1978, Li said, China abandoned the erroneous
policy of "taking class struggle as the key link," and took
economic construction as the focal point.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in economic
construction, people's living standards and other fields,
especially since China adopted reform and opening-up policy, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
This shows that developing economy and improving people's
living standards should be a slogan to mobilize and organize
people before a party seizes power and that should be a central
task for the whole party after it seizes power, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Seaga said that the Jamaican people have consistently had
friendly feelings to the Chinese people, and admire the
achievements that China has made in its reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Jamaican Labor Party places high hopes for
expanding its friendly relations and cooperation with the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican government wishes to become the bridge of friendly
ties between China and North as well as Latin American countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Seaga arrived here June 20 at the invitation of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Saudi Aid Arrives in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of Saudi aid for
Yemeni flood victims arrived here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Ali Mohammed el Qofeidi told the
Yemeni news agency Sabaa that the aid came in line with Saudi King
Fahd's directives to relieve the suffering of the Yemenis affected
by the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
Qofeidi said that this is only part of the 73 tons of Saudi aid
to Yemen, which include tents, blankets, carpets, food and
medicines. The remainder of the aid would reach Yemen later.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ambassador said that the aid is an expression of the
profound brotherly ties between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Mohammed Mekki, Undersecretary of the Yemeni Health
Ministry, expressed thanks for Saudi Arabia, saying: "This is no
new initiative, as we have found our (Saudi) brothers by our side
in many situations, in addition to the fact that Saudi Arabia
plays a prominent role in boosting the process of development in
Yemen."
</P>
<P>
Mekki described Yemeni-Saudi relations as historical and
distinguished, hoping that the relations would further develop
and flourish in the future.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Still Work on Final Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders, gathering here for a
first summit in six years, are still working on a final
communique to be released later today at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or their representatives from all the Arab
League's 22 member countries except Iraq sat at closed-door
sessions Saturday afternoon to discuss the principal issues
outlined in the communique.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of viewpoints continues today probably until this
evening when the Arab leaders reach agreements on what to
announce to the world, to Israel in particular.
</P>
<P>
The document, drafted by a special committee, was first
presented to a ministerial meeting Friday prior to the opening of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
It deals mainly with two issues: Arab reconciliation and the
Middle East peace process, according to the draft communique made
available to the press covering the summit.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches made by some Arab leaders at Saturday
sessions, the high voice for forgetting the unpleasant past and
looking forward to the future was made heard.
</P>
<P>
However, some controversies failed to disappear completely from
 the summit. Countries like Sudan, Jordan, Algeria and Tunisia
expressed sympathy with the Iraqi people suffering from
U.N.-imposed sanctions, and urged for an early return of Baghdad
to the Arab fold.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the gulf countries, including mainly Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia, have remained quiet so far on the issue. They
seemed reluctant to forgive Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Combating Terrorism as a whole was also touched upon in the
draft communique as requested by Algeria, Jordan and probably
some other countries. The principle bears no dispute, but
according to press reports, Jordan and Syria were at odds over it
since the first accused the latter of providing shelter to some
extremist groups based in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was also mentioned by name in the draft communique
against the background of its recent signing of a military
cooperation accord with Israel and its dispute with Damascus over
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain tried to seek support in condemning Iran for what it
termed as "interference" in its internal affairs. but some
informed sources said that the issue was not on the summit's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The draft communique urged for a joint Arab action toward
Israel in the wake of swing to power of hardline Benjamin
Netanyahu as prime minister. Netanyahu has formed a
rightist-dominated government last week and its policy guidelines
provoked fears among the Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
The document underlined the need to stick to the "land for
peace" principle, which is embodied in U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425. However, the ruling Israeli Likud
has long rejected the formula.
</P>
<P>
It is almost certain that all the Arab countries would agree to
stress the issue. But it was noted that many of them were
reluctant to pinpoint Israel by name.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, the current chairman of the Arab League, has warned
Israel of a united Arab action if it goes astray from the peace
path. But it said it was for normalization of relations with Tel
Aviv provided that the interests of the Arab nation as a whole is
taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has not yet made his
speech. However, it is said that he would urge the Arab leaders to
reaffirm their support for an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government has rejected the idea of sharing
the holy city with the Palestinians, and refused to renew
the commitment to negotiate its final status as stipulated in
the Oslo Accord, a milestone in the Israeli-Palestinian
relations.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Former Greek Premier Papandreou Dies at 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek former prime minister Andreas
Papandreou died at home today of heart attack after a long period
of illness. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou resigned from his prime ministerial post in January
after months in hospital due to heart problem and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
He was hospitalized in November last year and was hooked to
life support machines for months, suffering several relapses that
took him close to death.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou was born on Febrary 5, 1919 on the Greek island of
Chios, where he spent his early childhood. He went to the Athens
University Law School between 1937-1940.
</P>
<P>
After the military junta in power at that time exiled his
father, George, who had served in the previous
government. Papandreou was arrested and also exiled due to his
alleged Trotskyist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
He went to the United States after the exile and returned to
Greece in 1959. In 1964, he won a seat in Parliament, in which his
father was made the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He was exiled again after eight months of imprisonment by the
right-wing military dictatorship who took power in April 1967.
</P>
<P>
After returning to Greece in 1974, Papandreou organized
Panhellenic Socialist Movement(PASOK), which gained a
parliamentary majority in the 1981 elections.
</P>
<P>
He headed the first socialist government until 1989, pursuing a
foreign policy of keeping distance from the United States.
</P>
<P>
After four years out of the government, Papandreou made a
political comeback in October 1993 and remained in office until
last January.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou had four children. His son George is Education
Minister in his current cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Hippo Teeth Trade Exposed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has since 1990 exported
raw hippo teeth of over 7,000 dead hippos, prompting a protest
from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Flora and Fauna (CITES) of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the local daily "the New Vision" today,
the exports of more than 10,000 kilograms of raw hippo teeth were
sanctioned by Commissioner for Wildlife in the Uganda Ministry of
Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities Moses Okua.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the ministry were quoted as saying that CITES is
threatening a protest action against Uganda because of the hippo
teeth exports.
</P>
<P>
The commercial exports contradict the ban on game hunting
which was revised indefinitely 10 years after coming into force
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The exports further violated the condition by CITES that the
commissioner was required first to seek advice from the National
Wildlife Committee (NWC), the CITES National Scientific
Authority before he could sanction the exports.
</P>
<P>
The argument is going on between the commissioner and the U.N.
institution.
</P>
<P>
However, the commissioner claimed the teeth exported were
stocks carried over from the years before the ban on hunting in
1979.
</P>
<P>
An official named only by Maku who exported the teeth was
quoted as saying that he had about 8,700 kg of hippo teeth by
1989 and had declared them to the game department when he
returned from exile in 1985.
</P>
<P>
He said he obtained most of the stocks in 1972 from departing
Asians and other foreigners then running curios, textiles
factories, mines and craft shops.
</P>
<P>
Maku said he was then running a company called Simco
Skincraft.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Apologizes Over "Comfort Women" Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto today publicly apologized to the so-called
"comfort women" over their being forced into sex slaves at the
Japanese army brothels during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"I extend my wholehearted apology and remorse (to the women
involved)," said Hashimoto at a joint press conference with South
Korean President Kim Young-sam on South Korea's southern resort
island of Cheju after their summit talks.
</P>
<P>
"The 'comfort women' issue is the one which most severely hurt
the prestige and dignity of women," he said.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited as "comfort women" for the Japanese army as it
invaded East and Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Peninsula had been under the Japanese colonial rule
from 1910 until Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said, "we are trying to work out a dream about future
while embracing the weight of the past, taking advantage of the
co-hosting of the World Cup (with South Korea)."
</P>
<P>
The co-hosting of the World Cup event tops the agenda in the
summit talks today. On May 31, the International Football
Federation decided in Zurich, Switzerland, that South Korea and
Japan will jointly host the 2002 World Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
"I have said on several occasions since my inauguration as the
prime minister that we cannot escape from the weight of the past
and the responsibility of the future," Hashimoto noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was a second-grade elementary school student at
the time when Japan was defeated in World War II and that he
learned since then the reality about unhappy things involving the
history of Japan and Korea.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, I could never imagine how enormous the suffering
(the Japanese colonial policy of) forcing Koreans to change their
names to Japanese ones brought to the minds of the Korean people
might have been, although I have never learned that kind of thing
at school," the Japanese prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim said that he and Hashimoto agreed to cooperate
closely to make the 2002 World Cup football finals a most
successful one in the World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
"To the end, we agreed that both governments maintain a close
liaison system," Kim added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he agreed with Kim that they will make efforts
to foster an atmosphere for an early conclusion of bilateral
fisheries agreement for orderly fishing in seas between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the agreement made at the Japan-South Korea
summit meeting during the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in
Thailand on March 2, we agreed to separate the territorial issue
from the issues of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a
fisheries agreement," Hashimoto added.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Tokyo ties have been hurt recently by the territorial
rights issue involving Tokto Island, called Takeshima in Japanese,
in the East Sea (Sea of Japan).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived in Cheju Saturday for a two-day working
visit to South Korea, left the resort island for home this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is Hashimoto's second trip to South Korea. In November
1990, he visited Seoul as finance minister.

<HEADLINE> India to Help Malaysia on Afghan Mediating Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia can count on India's
help if it wants to play a direct mediator's role to bring about
an end to the conflicting Afghanistan, India's outgoing Higher
Commissioner to Malaysia V.K. Nambiar said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's national news agency Bernama, Nambiar
told Bernama that India, with its strong traditional and cultural
links with Afghanistan, was also willing to help Malaysia in any
capacity to enable Kuala Lumpur to play a mediator's role.
</P>
<P>
Nambiar said as the United Nations had lost its credibility in
Afghanistan, thus it was proper for a third world country like
Malaysia to take the initiative to tackle problems faced by
another third world country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent call to Malaysia by Abdul Sattar
Murad, Charge d'Affaires of the Afghan embassy in Kuala Lumpur, to
take up a leading role by initiating a peace conference among the
warring factions in Afghanistan, Nambiar said: "I don't see any
reason why India cannot help Malaysia in this context."
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is a respected
figure in the international arena and this is a plus point for
Kuala Lumpur to take up such a role," he added.

<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam

<HEADLINE> Most Graduates from Beijing Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Education officials said that 86
percent of this year's graduates of Beijing natives from
universities and colleges have found jobs, "Beijing Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 2,900 graduates are waiting for jobs due to
their untimely specialities and too high expectations toward
employment, according to officials with the municipal personnel
department.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that female graduates awaiting jobs slightly
outnumbered male graduates.
</P>
<P>
Just like previous years, those learning fresh water fishery,
Russian and stomatology find it hard to get jobs.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate of graduates from colleges for
professional training continues to grow higher this year, because
work units in Beijing tend to recruit more university graduates.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, many graduates are enthusiastic about going
to work units with good working conditions, higher pay and
sound welfare.
</P>
<P>
But working posts in state-owned enterprises and schools
account for 73 percent of the total demand for graduates.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are some units where some graduates
do not want to go, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Former Greek PM Andreas Papandreou Dies At 77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Andreas Papandreou, the first
Socialist prime minister of Greece, died at his home on early
Sunday at age 77, local radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who was the leader of the country's ruling party
for several decades, died at 2:30 a.m. local time (23:30 GMT
Saturday) from heart failure, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no official announcement so far
regarding the former prime minister, local radio stations
interrupted regular programming to report the death.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's kidney failure and his long history of pneumonia
led to a series of secondary infections in late November last
year, forcing him to undergo dialysis every two days.
</P>
<P>
He was released on March 21 from a hospital, where he had been
treated for an almost fatal kidney failure for four months. He
resigned as prime minister in January.
</P>
<P>
Since the hospital release, he had been staying out from public
places and meeting only his closest friends at his pink villa in
the northern Athens suburb of Ekali.
</P>
<P>
As the founder of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement in 1974,
Panandreou led the party to victory in 1981 elections and headed
Greece's first Socialist government until 1989.
</P>
<P>
After four years out from the government office, he brought the
Socialists back to power in the 1993 elections.
</P>
<P>
His death, according to radio reports, prompted Prime Minister
Costas Simitis to return urgently from a European Union summit
just concluded in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Simitis was expected to compete with Interior Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos to succeed Papandreou as the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement's leader at a forthcoming party congress.
</P>
<P>
The congress, the fourth of the kind, is scheduled to begin
next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Three Gorges Environmental Protection Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China will close down all small
paper mills in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River before the
year 2009 when the world's biggest hydropower project -- the Three
Gorges Project-- is finished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile China plans to build over a dozen waste water
treatment plants in the cities of Chongqing, Fuling and Wanxian in
Sichuan province, which are in the reservoir area, a senior
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The moves are part of an ambitious program China has launched
to protect the ecology and environment in the Three Gorges area,
and minimize possible adverse effects that might result from the
building of the huge hydropower dam, said Guo Shuyan, Deputy
Director of the Three Gorges Project Construction Commission under
the State Council, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Under the massive scheme, Guo, also Vice-Minister of the State
Planning Commission, said China will tighten control of pollution,
establish a supervisory system on the eco-environment, build an
extensive forest belt in the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze, and develop ecological agriculture.
</P>
<P>
And protection of bio-diversity, strengthened environmental
protection in the dam site, and construction of ecology in the
resettled zones, are also high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
China plans to dam the Yangtze River next year and complete the
hydropower project in 2009. The project, construction of which
began at the end of 1994, will mean the submerging of 17,000
hectares of farmland. Meanwhile the resettlement of over one
million people will also cause temporary harm to the area's
extensive plantation acres.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shuyan said that the environmental protection program,
being implemented side by side with construction of the Three
Gorges Project, is proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said the closure of the small paper mills, estimated at over
30, is aimed at stemming black industrial waste from being
continually poured into the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In their place China will build one or two modernized paper
plants with state-of-the-art waste treatment facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing City, industrial metropolis of southwest China, is
one of the major sources of pollution of the Yangtze River, which
discharges about one billion tons of untreated waste water into
the river each year.
</P>
<P>
Currently the city is building a waste water treatment plant
with a designed daily processing capacity of 48,000 tons, in
cooperation with Denmark. This will be the first plant of its kind
in Chongqing city, and four more are already in the pipeline.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Three Gorges Environmental Protection Program (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is pushing ahead a technical renovation campaign to
enhance processing techniques and recycling standards in factories
discharging waste water, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is that no industrial waste water be discharged
before being cleaned and most of domestic sewage will be gathered
for concentrated treatment, by the time the Three Gorges Project
is completed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China is also adopting tough measures to
effectively stop voyaging vessels from littering and polluting the
Yangtze River by 1997, while stockpiles of rubbish along the banks
of the river will be cleared away before the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
To reduce soil erosion, China will grow 2.86 million ha of
forests on the middle and upper reaches of the mighty Yangtze
within five years. The central government alone will earmark 450
million yuan towards the plan.
</P>
<P>
China plans to conduct plant protection schemes that involve
rare species, plant community, ecological systems and landscapes
in two State-level forest parks in Yichang City of Hubei province,
where the dam of the Three Gorges Reservoir is sited. And a
landscape ecological protection zone is expected to be located in
the "Lesser Three Gorges", a world-famous scenic spot.
</P>
<P>
Close attention will also be paid to protecting aquatic animals
in the region, Guo Shuyan said, adding that three protection zones
and a dozen breeding stations have been planned.
</P>
<P>
The zones will cater for peculiar fish species on the upper
reaches of Yangtze River, for rare aquatic animals on the middle,
and for white Chinese sturgeon infants in the river mouth.
</P>
<P>
Guo said China is enforcing tight rules aimed at preventing
construction work from causing environmental pollution, while
advanced facilities are being installed to treat construction
waste. By the year 2000, over 90 percent of waste water from
construction is expected to be treated.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a powerful watchdog panel, the Three Gorges
Project Ecological and Environmental Protection Coordination
Group, composed of 16 government departments and localities, to
supervise and push forward the environmental protection program.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Three Gorges Project, Guo called it an
"environmentally-sound, ecological project on the whole," which
will help stave off floods that have threatened lives of tens of
millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the river,
with hydropower energy being a non-pollutant power source
beneficial for the people.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guoping, an environmentalist, told Xinhua that the quality
of water in the Three Gorges Reservoir is expected to be affected
"to some extent", due to discharge of waste water in the upper
reaches on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"However the reservoir will never become a 'basin of dead water
or a pool of stagnant water,'" said Wu, who once worked for eight
years as Director of Yangtze River Water Resources Protection
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said the Yangtze River's annual water volume at the dam site
stands at 451 billion tons and the reservoir is designed to hold
39.3 billion tons, while waste water discharged to the river runs
to 1.2 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
This means that the ratio of water and waste water in the
Yangtze River there is 400 to one, far below the international
standard of a polluted river of 20 to one.
</P>
<P>
"Running water is never stale," goes a Chinese saying. "The
flowing Yangtze River will never be still either, -- even when the
Three Gorges Dam is completed." Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Won't Press Central Bank to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi reiterated Saturday the independence of the country's
central bank, the Bank of Italy, and said that the decision to cut
interest rates would rest with it.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters his month-old center-left government would
"never press" Bank Governor Antonio Fazio to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"I am creating the conditions (for a cut) but the decision on
when to lower interest rates is exclusively up to the Bank of
Italy."
</P>
<P>
Prodi was speaking on the sidelines of the European Union
summit in Florence which ended Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview with public broadcaster RAI, Prodi said
conditions for lower rates had been created with the announcement
of a 16 trillion lira (9.6 billion U.S. dollars) supplementary
budget on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government, facing a 1996 budget shortfall running
into several billions of dollars, adopted the supplementary budget
to enable a possible lowering of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of Italy will decide, in ten days, 20 days, but the
conditions are right," Prodi said. "Inflation is under four
percent, the budget has been adjusted..."
</P>
<P>
Fazio has previously said the official discount rate, a key
bank lending rate, will not come down until inflation has
stabilized under four percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Uzbekistan
President Islam Karimov said today his country wished to start
more joint ventures with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy has so far neglected "the Uzbek trail," as it has only 19
joint ventures with Uzbekistan compared with 200 of the United
States and 170 of Germany, said Karimov.
</P>
<P>
However, he said foreign investment had exceeded 1 billion
U.S. dollars in his country less than five years after the former
Soviet republic gained its independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of local entrepreneurs on the sidelines of
the EU summit underway in Florence, Italy, Karimov also offered a
five-year tax exemption to foreign companies with investment in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uzbekistan and the 15-nation EU on Friday signed a
cooperation agreement on wide-ranging fields, which is similar to
accords already struck between the EU and other former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, new companies will be set up and
intellectual property and investment protected. The EU will also
offer technical assistance to Uzbekistan and help it join the

KATHMANDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A Bhutanese refugee group in
Nepal has asked for the return of the dead body of a refugee which
was taken by the Indian police last Wednesday, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC) organized a
funeral procession last Wednesday in India's West Bengal state
aiming to send back the body of Baburam Shangden, who died early
this month in an Indian prison, to Bhutan for last rites by
crossing the India-Bhutan border.
</P>
<P>
However, the procession was stopped by the Indian police and
the Bhutanese refugees left the dead body to the police when they
retreated the procession.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the dead body was still in an Indian
police post.
</P>
<P>
The Indian police have reported detained nearly 1,000 Bhutanese
refugees in the last few months when the refugees were trying to
cross the Indian territory to Bhutan in an AMCC-sponsored peace
march movement appealing for free repatriation of some 100,000
Bhutanese in eastern Nepali refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bhutanese refugees support group in India has

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A directory on tourism in Nepal
was published here recently in a bid to provide foreign visitors a
comprehensive information about the country and its tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
The directory, sponsored by the Federation of Nepalese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) Tourism Committee, contains basic
information about tourism in Nepal, including tourist
destinations, cultural heritage, visa rules and government
regulations regarding tourism activities.
</P>
<P>

foreign tourists this year, who would bring in some 100 million US
dollars worth of foreign exchange for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has decided to launch a "Visit Nepal
Year" campaign in 1998 to promote the tourism industry in the
country with an aim to attract half million tourists in that year.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Wrap Up Summit in Florence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15-nation
European Union wrapped up their two-day meeting here Saturday,
after bringing an end to a three-month-old beef war and making
pledges to fight chronic unemployment.
</P>
<P>
EU President, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and European
Commission President Jacques Santer called the weekend summit a
"positive" and "fruitful" one, saying that various sides were
satisfied and relieved with the results of conference.
</P>
<P>
Leaders attending the mid-year summit reached a deal on a
framework for lifting the ban on British beef exports, ending
bitter infighting that paralyzed the functioning of the union.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports after a
health scare over the possibility of a link between BSE, a cattle
disease also known as "mad cow" disease, and a similar fatal brain
disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
After EU ministers failed to agree on a partial lifting of the
ban, Britain retaliated with a policy of non-cooperation with the
EU, holding up about 100 pieces of European legislation.
</P>
<P>
But the stand-off was defused at the Italian summit, with a
framework agreed to gradually lift the ban, clearing the way for
Britain to lift its blocking of EU business.
</P>
<P>
With the "mad cow" crisis behind it, the EU was finally able to
gain British support and establish the European police agency
Europol.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the 15 heads of state or government of EU member
countries vowed to step up the fight against worsening
unemployment as economic growth slows down in European countries.
But they stopped short of supporting a job-creation plan put
forward by Santer.
</P>
<P>
Santer had asked for 1 billion ECUs (1.24 billion U.S. dollars)
from EU surpluses to finance the Trans-European Networks, a
program of trans-national infrastructure projects, mainly road and
rail, between 1997 and 1999. The projects were aimed at creating
jobs in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
But the request for money was referred to EU finance ministers
for further study and many believe the plan will be blocked.
</P>
<P>
On European integration, Santer said the summit injected a
stimulus to inter-governmental conference (IGC) negotiations,
focused on how far and how fast EU countries move towards further
integration. The leaders said they wanted a draft treaty on the
issue by December when they meet in Dublin for their end-of-year
conference.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to hold a special summit in Ireland,
which now takes over the EU's six-month's rotating presidency from
Italy, on October 19-20 to discuss social welfare, drug
trafficking, relations with Russia and Japan and preparations for
the World Trade Organization's ministerial meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, the leaders demanded that Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic be removed from his presidential candidacy
and that all those indicted for war crimes be banned from
participating in the Bosnian elections this fall.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's BNP MPs-elect Won't Take Oath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The parliament members-elect of the
ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party will not take oath today on
schedule, a senior party leader said last night.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting earlier on Friday, the party's MPs-elect decided
to take oath Sunday on schedule. The Parliament Secretariat had
set for June 21 and 23 as the dates for the oath taking ceremony
of the MPs-elect of different parties.
</P>
<P>
The MPs-elect from the Awami League (AL), the leading party in
the just-ended polls, have already taken oath Friday. The party
is now preparing for the swearing-in of its new government headed
by its chief Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the sudden change, the BNP leader said that many of
the MPs-elect of the party were not in Dhaka to take oath today
and "we have 90 days time to take oath."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BNP chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia confirmed that "We
are not taking oath as MPs Sunday. We will inform (the date) when
we will be sworn in."
</P>
<P>
The inability of BNP MPs-elect to take oath today has raised a
question as to whether they would attend the swearing-in ceremony
of the AL government this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
BNP top leaders said last night that they did not receive
invitations to the function.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the BNP Saturday held its standing committee
meeting, which accused the caretaker government of playing
partisan role in favor of a political party and criticized the
Election Commission for its complete failure to hold free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jatiya Party (JP) Saturday also decided to
boycott the swearing-in ceremony of the AL government if JP jailed
chairman H.M. Ershad is not invited there.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, the former president of the nation, has been serving
terms imprisonment since 1990 for corruption cases. He was
granted only a 4-hour parole to be released for the swearing-in
ceremony this morning as the MP-elect which he won in five
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Former Soviet Repubics Commemorate Nazi Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) -- People across Russia and other
ex-Soviet republics paid tribute on Saturday to the millions of
soldiers who died in World War II defending the Soviet Union
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin declared this year that June 22 should
be honored annually as a Day of Remembrance and Mourning to mark
the anniversary of the start of the Nazi invasion in 1941.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier outside
the Kremlin wall today before attending special services at two
different churches in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Later he flew to Brest, a city in western Belarus bordering
Poland border, once the Soviet Union's western border, which for
more than a month resisted the Nazi onslaught 55 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko met with Yeltsin at the
site of a destroyed fortress in Brest, now a war memorial.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he wanted to pay tribute to the memory of the
solders in Brest who were the first to hold out against the Nazi
attack.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the courage of the people of more than 30
nationalities in the Soviet Union for resisting the Nazis and
asked the people to keep and cherish today's peace.
</P>
<P>
He also used the occasion to repeat his opposition to the
U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) eastward
expansion to the borders of Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
He said that while loyalty to common values that made Russia,
other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
Europe and America establish close connections, prospects for
cooperation, particularly over NATO's plans, were not smooth,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the union treaty signed between Russia and Belarus
in April, the Russian president said the peoples of the two
countries need to unite and that unity is the guarantee for
solving the complicated problems facing the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that the process toward closer relations
between the two countries cannot be reversed, in a warning to
opposition within Belarus to the treaty.

China produces 160,000 tons of potash fertilizer every year.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving a total investment of 4.6 billion yuan
(about 554 million US dollars), will take three years to

<HEADLINE> Home Loan Banks Likely to Emerge in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Home savings banks are likely to
appear in China to help millions of salary earners realize their
dream of owning a house, according to today's "China Daily
Business Weekly."
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the housing reform in the mid-1980s,
about 5,000 housing financial co-operatives have emerged in China
to finance apartment construction.
</P>
<P>
The country has also introduced the commercial home mortgage
system from the US and the public reserve system from Singapore.
</P>
<P>
But the commercial mortgages have proved to be a help only to
the rich, and without the interference of financial institutions,
management of public reserve and co-operatives is difficult, said
the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest beneficiaries of housing savings banks will be the
people whose institutions have no power to buy houses, such as the
primary and high school teachers and employees of small
enterprises," Yi Cheng, a research fellow at the Research
Institute of Finance and Banking under the People's Bank of China,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mortgages of home savings banks feature long term, low
interest rate and large loan amount.
</P>
<P>
Two pilot housing savings banks were established in the late
1980s in Yantai, Shandong Province and Bengbu, Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
However, few people took out home loans from the two banks
since median rents have remained low.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xiaofan with the Ministry of Construction said new home
finance banks should be located in economically developed areas
where the housing market is bigger.
</P>
<P>
In Guangdong, about 80 percent of the commercial houses are
bought by individuals and in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, a city
famous for its prosperous township enterprises, all the commercial
homes are sold to individuals, according to Xie.
</P>
<P>
Foreign home saving banks have showed their interest in
expanding their business in China, which seems to be a promising
market for everything.
</P>
<P>
Although China has not opened the doors to foreign banks' RMB
business, experts predict that the opening will not be too far
away.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, experts suggest that RMB business be opened to
foreign home-savings banks first since their business scope is
limited and their business is considered long-term, which will
give the Chinese banks time to adapt to the competition of foreign
banks.
</P>
<P>
Schwabisch Bank, reportedly the biggest home savings bank in
Germany, hopes to set up joint ventures in the business, said bank
officials at a recent seminar in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The bank has seen good business in some Eastern European
countries it has recently entered, the bank official said.

<HEADLINE> Santer Happy Beef War Over, But Regrets Job Policy Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FLORENCE, Italy, June 22 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
President Jacques Santer said today he was pleased that the
two-day EU summit solved the beef war with Britain, but regretted
its failure to back his job-creation proposal of funding
infrastructure projects with EU money.
</P>
<P>
Having "found" almost 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for the battle
against "mad cow" disease, the EU's finance ministers rejected his
proposal to use some 1.24 billion dollars from surplus EU funds to
finance the job-creating projects, known as Trans-European
Networks (TENs).
</P>
<P>
"I am obviously happy that we have an agreed framework for the
eradication of BSE in parallel with the fulfillment of health
guarantees," said Santer.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) leaders agreed on the weekend to a
gradual, step by step lifting of the worldwide ban on British beef
exports, imposed after a health scare over BSE, or "mad cow"
disease, with an insistence on strict public health guarantees in
return for London abandoning its "non-cooperation" policy with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
But after healing the rift over "mad cow" disease, there were
differences over job-creation. Although the summit welcomed
Santer's "Confidence Pact," a strategy for cutting the 18 million
unemployment figure in the 15-nation body, leaders would not back
his plan to allocate more money for TENs.
</P>
<P>
"I have wanted the European Council to take a decision now on
the financing of the Trans-European Networks but a small number of
delegations were not yet ready to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pact had prompted a cool response from Germany, which
stressed that solutions to unemployment rested mainly with
national governments.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden were also among those who
baulked at a proposal to shift 1 billion ECUs (1.24 billion
U.S. dollars) between 1997 and 1999 in surplus EU funds towards
job-creating road and rail projects, arguing that any extra money
should be returned to cash-strapped national governments.
</P>
<P>
The plan is one of the few areas of Santer's pact where fresh
money is actually proposed to battle Europe's job problem.
</P>
<P>
But the commission president said the summit was a success as
there was a political commitment on the Confidence Pact, a
stimulus to inter-governmental conference (IGC) negotiations on
the EU's future, and a renewed confirmation of January 1999 as the
launch date of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The summit also cleared the way for the trans-European
crime-fighting intelligence agency Europol to begin work.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Rejects MNLF Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
rejected a demand by the Moro national liberation front (MNLF) for
setting up a 20,000-strong special regional force to secure peace
in a proposed autonomous area in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Davao city, where the peace talks are
being held, the government rejected the MNLF demand on the second
day of talks over an agreement to end a 24-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that MNLF chairman Nur Misuari demanded the
creation of the special regional force to strengthen the proposed
southern Philippine council for peace and development, which the
government wants him to head.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Aguirre, government representative, said that Misuari
wants to "clothe the council with police power and authority."
</P>
<P>
The government rejected the demand because it is "legally
impossible and unconstitutional" unless the Congress passes a law
creating "a new body of government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day talks are focusing on the establishment of
transitional implementing structure and mechanism, the integration
of 25,000 MNLF members into the government army and the setting up
of the regional security force.
</P>
<P>
The talks, if successful, will pave the way for formal peace
negotiations between the government and the MNLF in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has fought for autonomy in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, for the last two decades. Tens of thousands of
people were killed in the conflict between the government and the
MNLF.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Represents a New Era for Hong Kong: Henry Cheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's success results from
the contributions of millions of Hong Kong people working hard
and working together, and 1997 represents a new era for Hong
Kong, said Henry Cheng Kar-shun, chairman of Advisory Council of
the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech to the Foreign Correspondents' Club on
Friday, Cheng said that Hong Kong people's hard-working spirit has
made Hong Kong an excellent place to raise a family and build a
life and that spirit will endure and grow stronger in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that many people have become so myopic about
1997," he said, "This count down heightens our concerns and
worries. Instead of looking at 1997, we should be embracing it. We
should be counting up. It's a state of mind."
</P>
<P>
He said that 1997 should not be a date to focus on, but one
well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the establishment of the foundation, he said: "We
came together because not only do we have businesses in Hong Kong
but Hong Kong is our home. It is also the home of millions of
others. We will continue to be based in Hong Kong. It is a vibrant
and unique community and we wish to see Hong Kong and all its
people continuing to be rewarded for their communal effort."
</P>
<P>
He said that members of the foundation play an integral role in
the fabric of daily life in Hong Kong and have a strong stake in
building Hong Kong's strong sense of community. After 1997
community life will be evolving, not ending.
</P>
<P>
"We don't only say that we are confident in Hong Kong's future,
we've put hard cash on the table in the form of investments to
demonstrate that we believe that our confidence will be translated
into good returns for our shareholders, good opportunities for the
many thousands of people we employ and, of course, good for the
economy and the community overall."
</P>
<P>
He said that not only have businessmen invested in the future
of Hong Kong but Hong Kong is also the largest investor in the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of record that the degree of integration
between the Chinese and Hong Kong economies is much further down
the road than any other form of integration -- two thirds of
China's overseas investment comes from Hong Kong, and the bulk of
China's export growth is channeled through it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Hong Kong business community has
invested heavily in China for very good reasons -- Hong Kong
business people are confident that Hong Kong and their companies
will develop alongside the growth in the Chinese economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
"We are here for the long term and we are still investing
heavily.
</P>
<P>
"I fail to understand why some people are so ready to write off
the future of Hong Kong. And I fail to understand why no logical
connection is made between the hard headed decisions of the
business community to invest in both Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Better Hong Kong Foundation was established last year by a
group of noted figures from Hong Kong's business community.

NANJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Water in the Taihu Lake, the
"pearl" of the economically prosperous Yangtze River Delta, is to
become clear again by 2000, thanks to the joint efforts of
neighboring Shanghai and the two provinces of Jiangsu and
Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
This is only one goal included in an ambitious plan, hammered
out by the three, to improve the deteriorating environment of the
Yangtze River Delta.
</P>

Statistics show that in the past five years, Zhejiang has
poured 980 million yuan into 3,780 anti-pollution projects and
considerably reduced the total volume of industrial waste
discharged.
</P>

Recently, out of environmental protection consideration, the
Suzhou New Area, located in the western part of Suzhou City,

estate development companies will spend 580 million yuan (about 70
million US dollars) to remove old houses in an area in Jing'an
District, and build a modernized residential area with a building
space of 125,000 square meters.

Nearly 1,000 households in the area will move to new houses in
another place, and the newly built apartments in the area will be
sold to the local government at a moderate price.
</P>
<P>
The use of overseas investment in building new residential
areas in old city areas is aimed at speeding up the reconstruction
of Shanghai's old city areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a local regulation, the Chinese side will offer
land for development, overseas businesses are required to offer
investment, after joint real estate development, the local
government will purchase the new residential buildings and other
necessary installations in the rebuilt areas at moderate prices.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1991 showed that unsafe houses, slums and economy
houses in Shanghai had a total floor space of 3.65 million square
meters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the city completed 1.85 million square
meters of the old city area rebuilding.

<HEADLINE> England, France Sail into Euro Soccer Semi-Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua/OANA) -- England and France defeated
their arch-rivals Spain and the Netherlands by 4-2 and 5-4
respectively earlier today in two thrilling penalty shoot-outs and
sailed comfortably into the semi-finals of the on-going European
Soccer Championship in England.
</P>
<P>
In the Anglo-Spanish quarter-final clash played this afternoon
at the Wembley Stadium in London, the England soccer squad, which
thrashed its Dutch opponent by a 4-2 margin, started the match
with an eighth minute shooting from England top striker Alan
Shearer.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish, who scored crucial goals in the last six matches
in the dying minutes of normal time, also displayed excellent
football skills, but lost some good chances to score a goal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the England players were very patient in
manipulating the important match and also wasted some great
chances of upsetting the Spanish in the normal 90th minute time.
</P>
<P>
In the thrilling penalty shoot-out after a 30-minute "sudden
death" extra-time play, David Seaman, who is regared one of the
best England players in the tournament, became hero of the match
by making a superb save to push out a spot-kick from Angel Nadal
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, England coach Terry Venables said:
"It was a tough game and we showed real spirit and guts. When we
played Holland it was a football match, whereas today it was all
courage and I thought boys worked themselves into the ground."
</P>
<P>
"When it got to penalties I thought it was all courage and I
thought they did their job well and that's what it's all about,"
Venables said.
</P>
<P>
Venalbes has also paid praise for Stuart Pearce, who missed
his spot kick in the semi-final shoot-out against Germany in the
1990 world cup in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"He was magnificent. He had no doubt he wanted to take a
penalty. I had thought I didn't want to put him through that
experience again, but it was his decision. He wanted it," the
England coach added.
</P>
<P>
In the other quarter-final match between France and the
Netherlands played in Liverpool this evening, French goalkeeper
Bernard Lama turned out to be the savior of the French side by
successfully saving a spot kick by Dutch international star
Clarence Seedorf.
</P>
<P>
In another two quarter-final matches to be held tomorrow,
Germany and Portugal will play Croatia and the Czech Republic
separately to fight a berth the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> More Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The University of Michigan has
shown more evidence that the rich are getting richer and the poor
are getting poorer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The data was based on a long-running study of 7,000 families
around the country.
</P>
<P>
The most prosperous 10 percent of American households held 61.1
percent of the nation's wealth in 1989 and 66.8 percent in late
1994, the New York Times quoted the university as saying.
</P>
<P>
The average net worth of the 10 percent of the richest families
reached 1.48 million U.S. dollars in late 1994, according to the
data.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the average family in the poorest 10
percent of the country's population had debts exceeding assets by
7,075 U.S. dollars in 1994, measured in 1996 dollars, compared
with a negative net worth of 4,744 U.S. dollars in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The new figures came just two days after the Census Bureau
announced that the gap in annual income between the most affluent
Americans and everybody else was wider than any other time since
Second World World.
</P>
<P>
The University of Michigan focused on families' net worth --
assets like stocks, bonds, bank accounts, houses and cars, minus
debts like mortgages, home equity lines and credit card balances.
</P>
<P>
The data of the university also showed that the middle class in
the U.S. was also becoming prosperous, the paper said. The family
in this class had a net worth of 62,395 U.S. dollars in 1994, up
from 47,742 U.S. dollars in 1989, according to the university's
data.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Calls for Cracking Down Sex Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday announced plans to set up a national sex offenders
registry, allowing police to track child molesters across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his weekly radio address taped Friday while
campaigning in Chicago, announced he was instructing Attorney
General Janet Reno to come up with a plan to create the national
registry within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's new initiative is a follow-up of his earlier
anti-crime steps.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also stressed his anti-crime record today in a speech
before the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Cleveland and touched
again the issue of church-burning across the South, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Once again he called for an end to church arson, saying the
burnings represent "a dark part of our soul...."
</P>
<P>
Clinton reviewed his sexual offender initiatives for the mayors
and said of his proposal for a national directory: "These things
need to be shared and we need a national system to share it."
</P>
<P>
The 1994 crime bill requires that states establish registries
of sexual predators and child molesters.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Megan's Law," follow up legislation Clinton
signed recently, requires states to tell a community "whenever a
dangerous sexual predator enters its midst." The law is named for
a 7-year-old New Jersey girl who was murdered by a neighbor whose
record of sex offenses was unknown to her parents.
</P>
<P>
"Now we must take the next step," Clinton said in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure police officers in every state can get the
information they need from any state to track sex offenders down
and bring them to justice," Clinton said.
