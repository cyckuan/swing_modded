	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Teppo Numminen scored midway through the third period as the
Phoenix Coyotes extended their home winning streak to five games with a 5-3
victory over Detroit on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes snapped Detroit's five-game unbeaten and four-game winning
streaks and won the series for the second straight year with their third
straight this season over the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Numminen, a stylish World All-Star defenseman, beat Chris Osgood with a
one-timer 9:08 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Alatalo set up the winner when he outdueled Kris Draper for the puck
along the right side, swept around the boards and reappeared on Osgood's right
for a pass to Numminen in the opposite circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Tkachuk, Greg Adams, Jeremy Roenick and Travis Green also scored for
Phoenix, with Green tacking on an empty-net goal with 13 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk got his second assist on the play, and Roenick, whose goal came on a
power play, had one assist.
</P>
<P>
	   Kris Draper, Brendan Shanahan and Mathieu Dandenault scored for Detroit, and
Kirk Maltby had two assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Burke made 28 saves to improve to 7-2-2 in his 11 his starts for
Phoenix. Osgood faced 22 shots before he was pulled with a minute to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk was waiting when Roenick mucked the puck off the boards and sent it
on a sharp angle toward the circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk controlled it with a backhand, then flipped a forehand shot over
Osgood's right shoulder and into the top of the net with 5:58 left in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   But Phoenix's 1-0 lead was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
	   Draper scored 44 seconds later on a 10-foot wrist shot after a pass that
Maltby threaded between two Phoenix defenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The offense was even more intense in the second period, when each team
scored twice in a 1:33 span.
</P>
<P>
	   Shanahan got his 28th goal on a slap shot from the blue line 4:23 into the
period, and Adams tied it on a rebound 26 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-two seconds later -- 5:21 into the second -- Phoenix went on the
power play, and Roenick converted at 5:28, slapping a shot past Osgood, who was
screened by Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Red Wings gave Phoenix no time to enjoy the 3-2 lead. Dandenault
blasted a one-timer from the slot past Burke at the 5:56 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Burke's last lapse. He had 10 saves in the last half of the second
period and all six Detroit shots in the third.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 83, 76ers 80  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Nick Van Exel and George McCloud made key baskets in the
final 1:21, and the Denver Nuggets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 83-80 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The game apparently was the last one Ron Mercer will play for the Nuggets
this season. Denver agreed to a five-player trade with Orlando on Monday night,
according to players involved.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, which will be completed Tuesday, sends Mercer, guard Chauncey
Billups and former Orlando first-round pick Johnny Taylor to Orlando for forward
Chris Gatling and guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad, plus a future first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercer had 15 points, Van Exel 14 and Antonio McDyess 12 for Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, had 29 points for the 76ers, who
dropped their third straight game. Eric Snow and Theo Ratliff added 11 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrone Hill's layup and Snow's steal and layup gave Philadelphia a 77-76
lead with 1:38 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel countered with a 19-foot jumper with 1:21 remaining and, following
two Sixers turnovers, McCloud hit a 3-pointer for an 81-77 lead with 24.9
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Four seconds later, Snow sank a 3-pointer. Larry Hughes then promptly fouled
Van Exel, who made both free throws for an 83-80 margin with 16.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow then missed a 3-point attempt but the 76ers retained possession when
the rebound went out of bounds. Hughes missed from the corner at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the seesaw fourth quarter, Iverson's two free throws and his
fastbreak layup produced a 63-63 tie. McDyess then hit two jumpers for a
four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson made two more free throws and Hughes a fastbreak layup for a 72-71
lead with 3:58 remaining. Van Exel's short jumper, a free throw by McDyess and
Raef LaFrentz's layup made it 76-72, before the Sixers scored the next five
points, capped by Snow's layup.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson scored 14 points in the first quarter as the 76ers overcame 37
percent shooting to take a 26-19 lead. Philadelphia hit only 3 of its first 13
shots but trailed by only one point, 10-9. The Sixers scored the last seven
points of the quarter, including five by Iverson.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver outscored Philadelphia 24-15 in the second quarter to take a 43-41
halftime edge. The Sixers' 15-6 run opened up a 41-32 lead with 3:17 left in the
half, but Denver then scored the last 11 points of the half, including four by
Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than five points in the third period, which ended
with Denver holding a 61-57 lead.

<HEADLINE> Suns 117, Magic 113  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Penny Hardaway had more than harsh words for his
former team in his first trip back to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-time All-Star, booed virtually every time he touched the ball,
scored 21 points Monday night to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Magic 117-113.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardaway, traded to Phoenix last summer, missed 9 of his last 11 shots, but
went 11-for-14 from the foul line in his sixth game back since missing 21 games
with a muscle tear in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Clifford Robinson had 28 points and Jason Kidd scored 20 and had 14 assists
for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong had 26 points and 11 assists for the Magic, who trimmed a
25-point, second-half deficit to 108-106 before the Suns put the game away.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orlando Arena crowd of 13,677 -- nearly 3,600 less than capacity --
booed Hardaway during pregame warmups and also relished every time he was
whistled for a foul or missed a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   In six seasons in Orlando, the 28-year-old guard helped the Magic to five
playoff appearances, including a trip to the NBA Finals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But management and fans grew weary of critical statements Hardaway often
made in response to what he perceived as unfair expectations of him once
Shaquille O'Neal left the team for the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   He reopened some of the wounds earlier in the day when he complained again
about the way the Magic handled his becoming a free agent last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardaway criticized owner Rich DeVos for underestimating his worth and said
he essentially was forced out of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   "You give up on me, then I've got to give up on you," Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal bolted town for the Lakers in 1996. Rather than risk losing Hardaway
without compensation, the Magic sent him to Phoenix in a sign-and-trade deal in
exchange for Pat Garrity, Danny Manning and two future first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade was part of a major roster overhaul designed to free room under
the salary cap and build a younger, more athletic team under first-year coach
Doc Rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic potentially could have three top-10 draft picks next summer and
expect to be a position to aggressively pursue one or two big-name free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardaway took a swipe at the rebuilding plan, saying other players will take
note of how a once-dominant team was gradually dismantled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't understand why somebody would come here anyway. If somebody already
is in a (good) situation -- just because they're under the cap and have lottery
picks -- why would somebody want to come here after I've gone and Shaq's gone?
What does that say?"
</P>
<P>
	   Hardaway made his first three shots on his way to 12-first half points. Kidd
had 15 at the break on 6-of-7 shooting, helping the Suns take a 62-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns led by 25 with just over five minutes left in the third quarter.
The Magic pulled within two, 108-106, on Armstrong's 3-pointer but couldn't get
closer down the stretch.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines History  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Before Monday crash of an Alaska Airlines jet off the
California coast, the airline had two previous fatal accidents in three decades.
</P>
<P>
	   While there have been questions about the Seattle-based airline's
maintenance and repair record involving the MD-80, the airline has promoted
itself as among the safest air carriers in the United States. It hasn't been an
idle boast.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Monday, the most recent Alaska Airlines fatal accident was in 1976,
when one person died when a Boeing 727 overran a runway at Ketchikan, Alaska. In
1971, 111 died when an Alaska Airlines 727 crashed into a mountain on approach
to Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the industry,''
Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine, said late Monday. ``Twenty-four years
since a fatal accident. That's a long time in today's business.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airline mentioned the two fatal crashes at a news conference Monday, but
did not address the possibility of fatal accidents before 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has 500 daily departures from 40 cities in the western
United States and Mexico. Of its 88-aircraft fleet, 38 are MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft that crashed Monday was an MD-83, built in 1992. Alaska
Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said it had flown 26,584 hours and was serviced
Sunday. It also was given a service check on Jan. 11 and Jan. 13, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has been the subject of a federal grand jury investigation
over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report found two MD-80s that made 840
flights in late 1998 and early 1999 on which records were falsified. Because of
the fouled-up records, the aircraft were considered to be in ``unairworthy
condition,'' said FAA records.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said at the time that the airline was consistently told by federal
investigators that airplane safety was not in question and that the inquiries
were limited to record keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the airliner that crashed Monday was one of those
MD-80s involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines traces its beginnings to a three-passenger float plane that
began service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska, in 1932, under the name
McGee Airways. The present name was adopted in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, which has an image of an Eskimo painted on its planes' tails,
flourished with deregulation of the airline industry. In 1979, Alaska served 10
cities in Alaska as well as Seattle. Now it serves cities across the West and in
1998 carried more than 13 million passengers.

<HEADLINE> Boats Search for Plane, People  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- On the dark ocean off the California coast, an armada
of boats circled through rising swells and spreading oil Monday, searching for
signs of hope at the crash site of an Alaska Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard Coast Guard vessels, crew members on deck, some with night-vision
goggles, peered into the darkness and listened, hoping to hear shouts from
survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're loud engines, but you strain to hear above the din,'' said Edwin
Lyngar, spokesman for the Coast Guard's Pacific Area Headquarters in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
	   Red-and-white helicopters hovered over the slick.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still hoping for the best,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne Reincke.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 miles off the beaches and headlands northwest of Los Angeles, the
ocean's surface was streaked with widening lines of foam, plastic, paper and
what appeared to be pieces of the jet.
</P>
<P>
	   With light fading, the searchers started finding bodies along with debris.
</P>
<P>
	   A glow spread across the waves from the high-powered lights of squid fishing
boats beaming their searchlights onto the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Help came from small boats and cargo ships, military planes and oil
platforms. The Navy was sending ships from San Diego, and a Navy plane flew
patterns over the crash site.
</P>
<P>
	   When word of the crash spread, fishing boats took off from the Channel
Islands Harbor, a popular tourist port for whale-watching, fishing charters and
island tours.
</P>
<P>
	   From the oil drilling platform Gina between the Channel Islands and the
mainland, rig workers set out in crew boats for the search site several miles
away. They were fighting wind and swells, and were not optimistic about finding
survivors, said Lee Clark of the Torch Operating Co., which runs the platform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't look like it's good news,'' Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Glance at the MD-80 Series  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed off the Los Angeles coast was an MD-83,
part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell Douglas. The aircraft,
Flight 261, was never previously involved in an accident, said FAA spokesman
John Clabes.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80, designed by McDonnell Douglas' commercial airframe division in
Long Beach, Calif., is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a
single aisle and an engine on each side of the tail.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 went into service in 1980 and has had at least five variations
that offer different ranges, seating capacities and cockpit electronics. The
jetliners sold for $26 million in 1984 and have been flown by many airlines on
short-to-medium trips.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 series was almost solely responsible for returning the St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to profitability in 1985 after more than a decade
of red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1997, the Boeing Co. announced it would phase out the MD-80 and
MD-90 passenger aircraft models it inherited when it bought McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatal events involving MD-80 series aircraft include:
</P>
<P>
	   --On June 1, 1999, an American Airlines MD-82 crashed and ran off the runway
in Little Rock, Ark., killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
	   --On July 6, 1996, a Delta MD-88 taking off from Pensacola, Fla., aborted
its landing after an engine fan hub blew apart, killing a vacationing mother and
her son and injuring three others.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Nov. 13, 1993, an MD-82 belonging to China's Northern Airlines crashed
and burned in a rice paddy in Urumqi, a western Chinese city, killing 12 people
and injuring at least 60.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Oct. 26, 1993, a China Eastern MD-82 overshot a runway in Fuzhou,
China, during a rain storm, killing two of the 71 passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   -- June 12, 1988: An Austral Lineas Aereas MD-81 crashed three miles short
of the airport in Posadas, Argentina, during an approach in poor visibility. All
15 passengers and seven crew were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Aug. 16, 1987, a Northwest Airlines MD-80 crashed on takeoff at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, killing 156.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Dec. 1, 1981: An Inex Adria MD-80 flying through heavy fog crashed in
Ajaccio, Corsica, killing all eight crew and 170 passengers.

    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A two-alarm fire forced the Los Angeles Lakers to
evacuate their hotel Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters put out a small fire that started in the basement of La Mansion
Del Rio Hotel, along the San Antonio Riverwalk. The Lakers were staying there
before Tuesday night's game against the San Antonio Spurs.

<P>
	   The fire was mainly an inconvenience, and no injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> 92 percent of N.Y. seniors have already passed required English  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Only 8 percent of New York's seniors - or 10,000
12th graders - have yet to pass the English Regents exam they need to graduate,
Education Commissioner Richard Mills says.
<P>
	   This comes after months of worrying about how the students would do on the
exam. "The students are proving the critics wrong," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 114,220 of the state's 124,260 seniors have achieved the 55 score
they need to pass the exam. Mills said 10,042 seniors have not taken the test or
hadn't obtained the score needed to graduate yet.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests that were given last week were not factored into Mills'
statistics, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said he never doubted that the senior class would do well on the exam,
which he says wasn't easy. "While this is passing with a 55, it represents a
reasonable level of achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pass rate was high even the state's urban areas, where students
historically do not do as well on standardized exams.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, 23,682 of the 26,946 seniors passed the English Regents,
leaving 12 percent - or 3,264 - who still need to take or pass the test. In the
other Big 4 city school districts - Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse -
3,584 of the 4,224 seniors had passed the exam as of the end of last year,
leaving 15 percent who still need to pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
	   The first time the Regents exam was given this year was last week, with
April and June testing dates still to come before graduation, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   The April test will be a special one for seniors only and will make up for
the exams that were canceled because of last week's snowstorm, education
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said he didn't know how many of the seniors had to take the test more
than once. He did say that 12 percent of the seniors who have passed the exam
got grades between 55 and 65 on it. The passing score jumps to 65 in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Public school students will have to pass five Regents exams - in English,
math, American history, global studies and a science - to receive a diploma
starting by 2004. The requirements currently are being phased in, with one
subject added each academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's English Regents
exam to graduate as part of a state Board of Regents-imposed program to raise
school standards. Next year, the seniors will have to pass the English exam and
the math exam.
</P>
<P>
	   Students must also satisfactorily complete their regular course work in
order to get a diploma. However, if they pass the course work and don't pass the
test, they have to repeat the senior year again, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics had suggested delaying the effective date of the requirements,
worrying that a large number of students could be held back because of low
scores.
</P>
<P>
	   The high scores didn't allay former Regent Norma Gluck's fears any. She
noted the Regents exam got tougher after last January, saying most of these
seniors took the Regents test before January because of that reason.
</P>
<P>
	   Without know which seniors took which test, these test scores don't tell her
anything about the number of seniors who may be at risk of not graduating in the
future, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once kids start having to getting 65 then I think it starts getting more
troublesome," she said. "And then the math kicks in and then it really becomes a
serious situation and I keep wondering what happens to the kids who don't make
it."

<HEADLINE> Administration continues to reject unilateral MTBE action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York does not want to strike out on its own to
rid the state's gasoline supply of the additive MTBE, perferring a federal or
regional approach, the state's environmental conservation commissioner says.
<P>
	   John Cahill told a joint Assembly-Senate budget hearing Monday that about
3,000 oil storage tanks were inspected last year and he said he believes "we
have addressed all known spills in New York of MTBE."
</P>
<P>
	   The chemical compound is commonly added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner,
but there are growing concerns about its health effects when it leaks from
underground storage tanks into water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing before a joint state Assembly-Senate budget hearing on the 2000-01
state budget, Cahill said the DEC wants to get rid of MTBE as much as
legislators do. But he noted that under the federal Clean Air Act, the gasoline
additives MTBE or ethanol must be used to produce cleaner-burned fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is a product of natural gas. Ethanol
is a more expensive oxygenate used primarily in the Midwest. There is little
ethanol available in New York or the eastern United States, and massive
quantities would have to be trucked to be added to the state's gas supplies,
Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethanol has more formaldehyde than MTBE and its use is "not without its
concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, gasoline in general is a "bad product" as far as the environment
and human health is concerned, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gas is a nasty product," Cahill said. "MTBE makes it worse."
</P>
<P>
	   But under questioning from Democratic Assembly Ivan Lafayette of Queens,
Cahill said getting the federal Environmental Protection Agency to move against
MTBE throughout the United States is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way is nationally," Cahill said. "If they don't act, we're going
to act regionally."
</P>
<P>
	   New York is part of a regional Ozone Transport Commission which seeks ways
to lower smog and other pollution in the Northeast. Cahill said that board will
act on MTBE if the federal government does not.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lafayette said it is becoming clear that MTBE use is a "very dangerous
situation." He urged the state to act now against the additive and, "If it is
violation (of federal law), let the feds sue us."
</P>
<P>
	   In other environmental issues addressed by Cahill before the hearing:
</P>
<P>
	   -Cahill said his department may come before the Legislature later this year
to ask for more authority to require that recyclable materials are actually
separated from trash and recycled in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Municipalities now enforce recycling laws, and Cahill agreed with
Assemblywoman Audrey Hochberg, D-Westchester, that many complaints have arisen
about recyclables not being separated from garbage - or of recyclable materials
being separated and then thrown out by waste haulers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are focusing on it," Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   -The environmental commissioner said the state has "serious concerns" about
a fall-off in the lobster population in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Westchester, suggested that state resources
devoted to the management of crustaceans such as lobsters and crabs have been
drastically cut back since the 1994-95 fiscal year and that has something to do
with the reduction in the lobster population.
</P>
<P>
	   Cahill said science experts believe that a parasite is causing the lobster
shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what that (a drop-off in crustacean research) necessarily has
to do with the presence of a parasite in Long Island Sound," Cahill said.

<HEADLINE> Judge throws Trump off Reform Party ballot in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mega-developer Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. John
McCain now have something in common.
<P>
	   Both men are the victims of Albany judges when it comes to their
participation in New York's March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday a state judge kicked Trump off the Reform Party presidential
primary ballot. Last week, an Albany judge removed GOP Sen. John McCain in a
fourth of the districts in the Republican primary for not following the state's
arcane election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas McNamara said Trump's supporters did not
obey New York's election laws. According to those laws a presidential candidate
must at least submit 5,000 signatures of enrolled party members to get on a
party's ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "No petitions were filed with the state Board of Elections on behalf of
Donald Trump," McNamara said. "Consequently ... the designating petitions of all
twenty-seven candidates for delegate committed to Donald Trump are invalid."
</P>
<P>
	   That eliminates Trump from the entire New York Reform ballot, which operates
in New York as the Independence Party. It was not immediately known whether
Trump's supporters would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans on Monday also were waiting to see if a federal lawsuit by
McCain would get him back on the ballot all around the state. In a move that may
indicate his thinking, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman decided Monday that
McCain's name will appear on all military ballots sent out later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   However, if a member of the military votes for McCain in a district where
his name isn't on the ballot, the vote won't count, according to Amanda Cooper,
a spokeswoman for the Brennan Center for Justice, which is representing McCain
in his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, McCain is not on the ballot in 14 of the state's 31 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and his New York supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist
Lenora Fulani, wanted Trump's delegate slates thrown off the ballot, claiming
there were insufficient signatures from party members on his petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The state chairman of the Independence Party, Jack Essenberg, is backing
Trump. Fulani is attempting to have Essenberg removed as state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's executive committee will meet on Friday in Albany to discuss
removing Essenberg, Fulani spokeswoman Kathy Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections refused to throw Trump off the ballot and an
appeal of the board's decision by the Fulani forces was heard on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Both Assembly and Senate leaders threaten anti-toll action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Legislature is prepared to block a proposed toll
increase on the New York State Thruway, its top two leaders say.
<P>
	   Both Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
said a toll increase was unacceptable at a time when the state is struggling to
create and retain jobs in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Senate will prepare legislation to prevent the Thruway Authority from
going through with its plan to drive up costs for businesses and commuters
through their hidden tax increase," Bruno, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, said his transportation committee
would hold a hearing on the Thruway toll increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's determine what's necessary and what's not necessary and let's make a
determination, does this administration want to impose a tax specifically on
people to get to and from work?" Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, blasted the Thruway Authority
for approving an "outrageous" toll increase plan "in secret."
</P>
<P>
	   "What are they paying for?" McCall asked. "If there is a case to be made,
then you come out and make the case."
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker said lawmakers can block a toll hike either through legislation
or in the next state budget they will adopt, for fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's board late last week said it has adopted a
previously unannounced plan to impose a 1.8 percent toll hike on most Thruway
tolls beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also voted to allow future annual toll increases of up to 3
percent if construction costs in 20 U.S. cities, including New York and Buffalo,
increase during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway, whose board is appointed by Gov. George Pataki, referred to its
toll hike as annual toll "adjustments." It said it needed the money to pay for a
five-year, $1 billion capital improvement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver suggested that the Thruway Authority revise its list of construction
projects. Bruno said the authority "should be looking at managing its resources
as a way to help pay for infrastructure projects" rather than resorting to toll
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway Authority spokeswoman Anya Frost said Monday if legislators want to
forgo their "members' items" - the pork-barrel spending they annually use to
fund projects in their home districts - or provide funding for road improvements
from other sources, the Thruway would look at their proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, have not increased
since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrations start outside Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hundreds of chanting protesters received a heartfelt
thanks from Amadou Diallo's parents as the trial of the four police officers who
shot the young immigrant began.
<P>
	   Demonstrators endured cold temperatures and snow flurries Monday to kick off
protests outside the trial, chanting "Amadou, we love you" and counting out the
41 bullets fired at him. The demonstrators vowed that the trial's relocation
from New York City to Albany would not deter them from shedding a spotlight on
racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
	   The racially charged case was moved to the state capital by an appeals court
that said publicity and protests would make it impossible for a fair trial in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted them to know that if they wouldn't bring the trial to the Bronx,
the Bronx would come to the trial," the Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd, about
half who took buses up from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was killed in a barrage of 41 bullets
fired by the officers as they searched a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Buses left the city before sunrise Monday and traveled through the remains
of a winter storm that dumped 10 inches of snow on Albany. As flurries lingered
through the morning, demonstrators marched in circles on a snow-slicked city
park opposite the courthouse. Albany police estimate that about 400
demonstrators were on scene Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Raphael of Manhattan said the effort was important because it signals
that the trial was being watched closely.
</P>
<P>
	   Florence Middleton of Harlem agreed, saying: 'It could have been any one of
us, anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's parents addressed the crowd during the trial's lunch break,
expressing sorrow over their son's violent death, but thanking the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a victim of injustice," Kadiatou Diallo said of her eldest child.
"We have to make sure we are here for him."
</P>
<P>
	   A door painted with 41 bullet holes and the silhouette of a man served as a
vivid reminder of Diallo's death. And a number of protesters said they feared
Albany will become "Simi Valley II," a reference to the California court venue
that led to acquittals of police officers accused of brutality in the Rodney
King case.
</P>
<P>
	   But the protesters said they were determined to make their case peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   "You represent a young man who had dignity, who stood for peace" Sharpton
told the crowd. "And we are not going to mar his name."
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Curry, of the Capital Region Justice for Diallo Committee, said there
would be other rallies on key dates throughout the trial. Sharpton said busloads
of New York City protesters would return when opening arguments begin.

<HEADLINE> Governor, state Senate leader in spat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - At least three former state workers have learned
patronage has a down side.
<P>
	   The workers who gained their positions with help from a good word by state
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno have apparently lost them over a political
spat between Bruno and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went to work Friday, went home and got a phone call," said Mark McDonald
of East Greenbush, in the heart of Bruno's district. McDonald said he lost his
job as a special assistant to the commissioner of environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   His supervisor was "kind of vague" about the reason for the firing that
McDonald said apparently had nothing to do with his performance.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald said he got the state job eight months ago with the recommendation
of Bruno and other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's part of the system, I guess," he said Monday. "At this point I start
looking for a job."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was upset about the firings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's terribly unfair and really not the way that anything should be
done," he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said the firings may be the actions of Pataki staff members he did not
identify and that, perhaps, the staffers "who have acted inappropriately before"
were trying to send Senate Republicans a message.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would expect the governor of New York state would not conduct himself in
such a demeaning way," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor does not engage in petty feuds," said Pataki spokesman Michael
McKeon. "It is beneath him; rather he will continue to fight for the policies
that have helped transform New York state and trigger our economic renewal."
</P>
<P>
	   McKeon said payroll changes are common throughout any state fiscal year. "I
wouldn't read anything into that" routine practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno emphasized that the Legislature and governor are partners.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not to be dictated to. The governor is not a dictator, not a king,
(although) some of his staff might think so," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said both houses are needed to pass laws and approve appointments,
like some Pataki nominations whose approval was postponed Monday by the Senate.
The decision not to confirm the nominees was interpreted as a show of the
chamber's unhappiness with last week's firings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might be a little bit of a blip," veteran state Sen. Hugh Farley,
R-Schenectady, said Monday. "How serious the rift is, I can't comment on it."
</P>
<P>
	   Farley and others said the tensions revolve around Bruno's championing of a
plan to reimburse counties and New York City about $340 million to pay for new
health insurance programs for the poor. Pataki wants the counties to pay those
costs directly, and says they can afford to do so with the money they're getting
through their settlement with tobacco companies and state-sponsored cost
containments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that was," Farley paused, searching for the word, "the
misunderstanding, we'll call it."
</P>
<P>
	   Farley said the legislative and executive branches of any government "are
very jealous of the other's authority," and that Pataki and Bruno have natural,
although limited, tensions despite both being Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tensions apparently came to the fore late last week when
Bruno-supported state employees Stanley Brownell, a local legislator in Bruno's
home Rensselaer County; McDonald, the Rensselaer County Conservative Party
chairman; and a state Corrections Department employee from Bruno's hometown of
Brunswick, were dismissed by their agencies, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownell, declined comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a temper tantrum and some people were bounced and now it's in the
press and everyone's taking fighting positions," the source said, referring to a
New York Post report Monday about the Pataki-Bruno tiff and its fallout. The
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said one of the three employees
fired was told his dismissal came on orders from "the second floor," a reference
to the governor's office in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Farley said he expected Bruno and Pataki to patch things up quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's a terrific relationship between the senator and the
governor," Farley said, noting that Bruno is usually a peace maker in state
politics between Pataki and the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly,
Sheldon Silver. "I don't think it will amount to anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno also probably didn't endear himself to Pataki when, on Friday, he
issued a statement condemning Pataki's hand-picked board at the Thruway
Authority for approving a toll increase plan. Bruno reiterated his opposition to
the toll hike Monday and said he would fight them legislatively if the board
adopted the increases this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill is moving through the Assembly's health committee that would have the
state pick up the counties' costs of new health care insurance programs. It
would put Silver into alliance with Bruno and in opposition to Pataki on the
health cost issue.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia expert George McTurnan Kahin dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - George McTurnan Kahin, a Cornell University
professor and author who was one of the nation's leading scholars of Southeast
Asia and an early critic of U.S. policy during the Vietnam War, is dead at age
82.
<P>
	   Kahin died Saturday at a hospital in Rochester after being admitted a week
earlier. Cause of death was not disclosed. He had lived in Ithaca since being
enlisted by Cornell in 1951 as its first specialist on Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Ivy League school, Kahin was credited with helping to create the
foremost Southeast Asian studies program at an American university.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin wrote two highly praised books: "Nationalism and Revolution in
Indonesia" (1952), an account of Indonesian politics in the first half of the
20th century, and "Intervention: How America Became Involved in Vietnam" (1986),
which relied on hundreds of interviews and thousands of declassified documents
to analyze U.S. intervention in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been working in recent years on a manuscript, based largely on
personal experience, that examined the impact of U.S. policies on the political,
social and economic landscape of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin taught political science and history at Cornell up to 1988 but
remained active at the school through this year as the Aaron L. Binenkorb
professor emeritus of international studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of students took his "United States and Asia" course. Some of his
graduates helped him produce "Governments and Politics of Southeast Asia," one
of the first scholarly textbooks to focus on the region's politics. It was used
in classrooms around the country until the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Baltimore in 1918, Kahin grew up in Seattle and served in the U.S.
Army from 1942 to 1945 in between earning degrees at Harvard and Stanford. He
traveled in Indonesia in 1948 and 1949 during the country's independence
revolution against the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
	   His fieldwork earned him a doctorate in political science at Johns Hopkins
University and was the basis of his first book. Kahin also became active in
publicly opposing U.S. support for the Dutch colonial cause and, having his
passport withheld, was barred for several years from leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   He was appointed associate director of the fledgling Southeast Asia Program
in 1951, and was director from 1961 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin played an active role in speaking out against the Vietnam War, taking
part in the first nationally televised teach-in on the war in April 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife of 22 years, Audrey Kahin; his two children,
Brian and Sharon, two grandchildren, Ange and Owen, and his sister, Peggy Webb.
A private service will be held in Ithaca this week.

<HEADLINE> State's first witness says land less valuable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The state began its defense with a witness who
testified that properties in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim are among the
poorest farming lands in the area and considerably less valuable than what a
federal appraiser said.
<P>
	   "If you were going to take a contiguous 64,000 acres of the poorest soil,
you would take much of that area," John Bouck told jurors Monday as the damages
trial entered its second week in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the federal government's property appraiser said he used a
"highest, best use" methodology to value the claim area in Cayuga and Seneca
counties at $335 million for its current-market value and rental worth for a
204-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bouck, a real estate broker and appraiser from Auburn, said that he
found only 50 percent of the claim area was actually "functional cash crop farm
land," and even some of that amount was marginal.
</P>
<P>
	   To make it cultivable, farmers have drained most of the land, an expensive
process that can cost up to $500 an acre, which in some cases is nearly 25 times
the per-acre rental value, Bouck told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the land is not functional without drainage tiles installed. All
the best farms have been drained," he told jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is attempting to show that federal appraiser Arvel Hale grossly
overvalued the land during his testimony last week. The state's experts will
testify that the land is worth no more than $41 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The courts already have ruled that New York state illegally acquired the
land in 1795 and 1807 by failing to get the federal government's approval for
the land treaties it entered with the Cayugas. The jury will determine how much
compensation the Cayugas should receive for their lost ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouck also refuted Hale's rental appraisal, saying that much of the claim
area is unrentable as agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only land that gets rented is tillable land that is able to generate
some kind of income," Bouck said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale calculated his rental appraisal by considering the land's agricultural
worth since 1795. But Bouck told jurors that local farmers have been renting
their land out only since about the 1950s. Prior to that, the technology did not
exist to make the land cultivable and most farms were small, subsistence
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State attorneys have argued that Hale's appraisal was flawed, citing, among
other things, that Hale never personally inspected any of the properties but
instead relied solely on the counties' computer data to come up with averages.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to provide an appraisal that is more than just your own
judgment and be perfectly accurate, you have to go out and get the information
from the horse's mouth," said Bouck, who said he was personally familiar with
all the claim area through 30 years of working in the area as a broker,
appraiser and developer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just looking at the county records is easier, but it's not as accurate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouck also told jurors that the land's value was diminished because of the
proximity of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, a stopover for hundreds of
thousands of migrating birds who feed on the crops in local farm fields, leaving
them less productive and thus less valuable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers have to have their crops in by certain times or the birds ravage
their crops. It's a question of who is going to win the race," Bouck testified.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, many surrounding farms in the land claim area are now used as
pasture or for growing hay instead of more profitable crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony continues Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani already spending heavy in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - With the election still some nine months away, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have
already spent a combined $8 million in what is shaping up as the most expensive
U.S. Senate contest ever.
<P>
	   Giuliani, who began raising money some six months before the first lady,
outpaced her in both spending and contributions, according to reports each camp
sent on Monday to the secretary of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican mayor raised $8.8 million in the last six months of 1999,
compared with $8 million for Clinton. He spent $4.6 million last year - more
than many Senate candidates have even raised so far.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Giuliani took in $11.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton raked in a total of $8 million. Like the mayor, the first lady spent
heavily, shelling out $3.4 million in her six months of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the hefty bankrolls, neither candidate has officially entered the
race yet to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Clinton is set to
formally announce her candidacy on Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed what and where the campaigns spent
their money was not available. That information is contained in massive reports
each campaign is filing with the Federal Election Commission that had to be
postmarked by Jan. 31. Only summary pages were made available Monday by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million in cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to
his filing. Clinton trailed him with $4.7 million on hand, her report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson called the first lady's
financial filing "very strong."
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where either candidate spent the cash,
Giuliani's aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad
campaign. The Giuliani camp has also spent money on a direct-mail campaign to
solicit donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to
conservatives and have taken shots at Clinton. One called the first lady "leader
of the ultra left-wing." Direct mail, much of it from outside New York state,
has accounted for about 40 percent of Giuliani's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of each candidate's contributions came from individual donors, who
can only give up to $2,000. Giuliani raised $8.7 million from those individual
contributors, Clinton $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides have said they have raised money from residents in all of New
York's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp also raised $245,311 from political action committees,
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Giuliani recently hired a Washington,
D.C.-area fund raiser, Julie Wadler, who said she would specialize in raising
PAC contributions for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton brought in $219,925 from PACs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's report also showed a $1.2 million transfer from a committee set up
by her campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Clinton did
several joint fund raisers with the DSCC and was required to set up a separate
account for those contributions under federal election law, her spokesman said.
He said all were hard-money donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Corrado, a government professor who specializes in campaign finance
at Colby College in Maine, said the Clinton-Giuliani race was easily on track to
be the most expensive political contest in U.S. Senate history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in this race is that in addition to the candidates spending
enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars will be spent by the
political parties and outside interest groups," Corrado said, referring to the
largely unregulated soft money spent on candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Those totals are not included in the candidates' filings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at a level not seen in previous Senate races," Corrado said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton taps media team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's media team includes an
advertising agency that may know how to get under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's skin,
but has never before madfe ads for a political candidate.
<P>
	   Clinton is expected to face the New York City mayor in this year's race for
the Senate seat being vacated by New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the first lady said Monday that the media team includes veteran
media consultant Mandy Grunwald, pollster Mark Penn and the New York City
advertising agency, DeVito/Verdi.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outstanding team of experienced New Yorkers," Howard Wolfson,
the first lady's campaign spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grunwald was a key player on Bill Clinton's media team when he first ran for
president in 1992 and she has been Moynihan's top media adviser for his last
three Senate races. Penn worked on President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign
and has also done work for Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   DeVito/Verdi, on the other hand, has never handled advertising chores for a
candidate, although the agency has done some ads in support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency was responsible for ads on New York City buses in 1997 promoting
New York magazine as: "Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't
taken credit for."
</P>
<P>
	   After Giuliani objected, the Metropolitan Transportation Agency removed the
ads. The magazine took the MTA to court and won in a case that went all the way
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "He tends to get very angry and agitated. That's been our experience," Ellis
Verdi said Monday night when asked about the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Verdi said the award-winning agency wasn't concerned about never having done
ads for a candidate before.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like any other product. Advertising is always a challenge, but here
we're blessed with a great product," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Verdi said the work was also a chance for the 9-year-old company "to make a
mark in this industry."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to New York magazine, the agency has done work for a host of
companies, including Home Depot and Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady plans to formally announce her candidacy Sunday in suburban
Westchester County where she and President Clinton have purchased a $1.7 million
home. Until she moved into the house several weeks ago, the first lady had never
lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not said when he will formally declare his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> 92 percent of N.Y. seniors have already passed required English  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Only 8 percent of New York's seniors - or 10,000
12th graders - have yet to pass the English Regents exam they need to graduate,
Education Commissioner Richard Mills says.
<P>
	   This comes after months of worrying about how the students would do on the
exam. "The students are proving the critics wrong," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 114,220 of the state's 124,260 seniors have achieved the 55 score
they need to pass the exam. Mills said 10,042 seniors have not taken the test or
hadn't obtained the score needed to graduate yet.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests that were given last week were not factored into Mills'
statistics, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said he never doubted that the senior class would do well on the exam,
which he says wasn't easy. "While this is passing with a 55, it represents a
reasonable level of achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pass rate was high even the state's urban areas, where students
historically do not do as well on standardized exams.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, 23,682 of the 26,946 seniors passed the English Regents,
leaving 12 percent - or 3,264 - who still need to take or pass the test. In the
other Big 4 city school districts - Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse -
3,584 of the 4,224 seniors had passed the exam as of the end of last year,
leaving 15 percent who still need to pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
	   The first time the Regents exam was given this year was last week, with
April and June testing dates still to come before graduation, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   The April test will be a special one for seniors only and will make up for
the exams that were canceled because of last week's snowstorm, education
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said he didn't know how many of the seniors had to take the test more
than once. He did say that 12 percent of the seniors who have passed the exam
got grades between 55 and 65 on it. The passing score jumps to 65 in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Public school students will have to pass five Regents exams - in English,
math, American history, global studies and a science - to receive a diploma
starting by 2004. The requirements currently are being phased in, with one
subject added each academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's English Regents
exam to graduate as part of a state Board of Regents-imposed program to raise
school standards. Next year, the seniors will have to pass the English exam and
the math exam.
</P>
<P>
	   Students must also satisfactorily complete their regular course work in
order to get a diploma. However, if they pass the course work and don't pass the
test, they have to repeat the senior year again, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics had suggested delaying the effective date of the requirements,
worrying that a large number of students could be held back because of low
scores.
</P>
<P>
	   The high scores didn't allay former Regent Norma Gluck's fears any. She
noted the Regents exam got tougher after last January, saying most of these
seniors took the Regents test before January because of that reason.
</P>
<P>
	   Without know which seniors took which test, these test scores don't tell her
anything about the number of seniors who may be at risk of not graduating in the
future, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once kids start having to getting 65 then I think it starts getting more
troublesome," she said. "And then the math kicks in and then it really becomes a
serious situation and I keep wondering what happens to the kids who don't make
it."

<HEADLINE> Administration continues to reject unilateral MTBE action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York does not want to strike out on its own to
rid the state's gasoline supply of the additive MTBE, perferring a federal or
regional approach, the state's environmental conservation commissioner says.
<P>
	   John Cahill told a joint Assembly-Senate budget hearing Monday that about
3,000 oil storage tanks were inspected last year and he said he believes "we
have addressed all known spills in New York of MTBE."
</P>
<P>
	   The chemical compound is commonly added to gasoline to make it burn cleaner,
but there are growing concerns about its health effects when it leaks from
underground storage tanks into water supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing before a joint state Assembly-Senate budget hearing on the 2000-01
state budget, Cahill said the DEC wants to get rid of MTBE as much as
legislators do. But he noted that under the federal Clean Air Act, the gasoline
additives MTBE or ethanol must be used to produce cleaner-burned fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is a product of natural gas. Ethanol
is a more expensive oxygenate used primarily in the Midwest. There is little
ethanol available in New York or the eastern United States, and massive
quantities would have to be trucked to be added to the state's gas supplies,
Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethanol has more formaldehyde than MTBE and its use is "not without its
concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, gasoline in general is a "bad product" as far as the environment
and human health is concerned, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gas is a nasty product," Cahill said. "MTBE makes it worse."
</P>
<P>
	   But under questioning from Democratic Assembly Ivan Lafayette of Queens,
Cahill said getting the federal Environmental Protection Agency to move against
MTBE throughout the United States is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way is nationally," Cahill said. "If they don't act, we're going
to act regionally."
</P>
<P>
	   New York is part of a regional Ozone Transport Commission which seeks ways
to lower smog and other pollution in the Northeast. Cahill said that board will
act on MTBE if the federal government does not.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lafayette said it is becoming clear that MTBE use is a "very dangerous
situation." He urged the state to act now against the additive and, "If it is
violation (of federal law), let the feds sue us."
</P>
<P>
	   In other environmental issues addressed by Cahill before the hearing:
</P>
<P>
	   -Cahill said his department may come before the Legislature later this year
to ask for more authority to require that recyclable materials are actually
separated from trash and recycled in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Municipalities now enforce recycling laws, and Cahill agreed with
Assemblywoman Audrey Hochberg, D-Westchester, that many complaints have arisen
about recyclables not being separated from garbage - or of recyclable materials
being separated and then thrown out by waste haulers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are focusing on it," Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
	   -The environmental commissioner said the state has "serious concerns" about
a fall-off in the lobster population in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Westchester, suggested that state resources
devoted to the management of crustaceans such as lobsters and crabs have been
drastically cut back since the 1994-95 fiscal year and that has something to do
with the reduction in the lobster population.
</P>
<P>
	   Cahill said science experts believe that a parasite is causing the lobster
shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what that (a drop-off in crustacean research) necessarily has
to do with the presence of a parasite in Long Island Sound," Cahill said.

<HEADLINE> Groups say pollution cleanup money should be distributed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Great Lakes are so polluted that a change of
strategy might be in order, say two environmental groups.
<P>
	   The Sierra Club and Great Lakes United think it's time to give one or two
contaminated bays, harbors or river mouths extra resources instead of spreading
available federal money to all eight Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic change from current practice is needed because distributing the
funds around the entire region hasn't yet resulted in the completed cleanup of
any of the lakes' toxic hot spots, said Emily Green, the Sierra Club's Great
Lakes expert.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Great Lakes are still toxic after all these years," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green and Margaret Wooster of Great Lakes United proposed focusing a new
Great Lakes cleanup grant program, should it be approved by Congress, on as few
target areas as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has said he'll ask for $50 million for the proposed
grants, but Wooster said that would be a drop in the bucket compared to the
estimated cleanup pricetags: $100 million to $170 million for Wisconsin's Lower
Fox River, $1 billion for New York's Buffalo River and $42 million to $210
million to rid the Detroit River of its worst contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra $50 million President Clinton promised to seek for cleaning up the
lakes, plus state matching funds, might be enough to see one persistent
contamination problem through to the end, provided it's one of the smaller
problem areas.
</P>
<P>
	   That, Green said, "will allow us to develop the expertise to clean up these
hot spots completely."
</P>
<P>
	   "A model can then be made for other Great Lakes communities to follow," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toxic hot spots around the Great Lakes number 42, and 31 are on the U.S.
side. None of those has been cleaned up, though some are closer than others to
having cleanup plans implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmental groups did not prioritize the hot spots or suggest which
deserved to get first crack at the new grant money, should Congress approve it.
</P>
<P>
	   Both groups said strides have been made in reducing pollution in the lakes,
but the law still allows contamination to be piped directly into the waters, and
tests on fish and birds still show large concentrations of dangerous chemicals
in the food chain.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher, Dr. Theo Coburn, described studies showing that children
born to mothers who eat Great Lakes fish had hearing and memory problems that
made it difficult for them to keep up with their classmates.
</P>
<P>
	   She also described finding Lake Erie sportfish with thyroid glands so
enlarged that they had exploded. The exact cause of the glandular problem has
not been established, but researchers suspect a link with PCBs and perhaps other
chemicals, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Contaminants in Great Lakes sediment are absorbed by worms and forage fish
and eventually make their way up the food chain at increasingly higher levels as
medium-sized fish eat smaller contaminated fish and larger fish or birds eat the
contaminated medium-sized fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisories have been posted at each of the Great Lakes for children and
women of childbearing age to either limit how much fish they eat or, for certain
kinds of fish and certain bodies of water, avoid eating the fish altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmentalists illustrated that danger at a news conference where
they displayed a "toxic buffet" of elegantly prepared lake fish on artistically
arranged pools of sauce or beds of greens, each too toxic for consumption by
children or women of child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
	   The activists were in town for meetings with the Environmental Protection
Agency and Council of Environmental Quality, where a possible updating of the
Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada is
under review.

<HEADLINE> Judge throws Trump off Reform Party ballot in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Mega-developer Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. John
McCain now have something in common.
<P>
	   Both men are the victims of Albany judges when it comes to their
participation in New York's March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday a state judge kicked Trump off the Reform Party presidential
primary ballot. Last week, an Albany judge removed GOP Sen. John McCain in a
fourth of the districts in the Republican primary for not following the state's
arcane election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas McNamara said Trump's supporters did not
obey New York's election laws. According to those laws a presidential candidate
must at least submit 5,000 signatures of enrolled party members to get on a
party's ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "No petitions were filed with the state Board of Elections on behalf of
Donald Trump," McNamara said. "Consequently ... the designating petitions of all
twenty-seven candidates for delegate committed to Donald Trump are invalid."
</P>
<P>
	   That eliminates Trump from the entire New York Reform ballot, which operates
in New York as the Independence Party. It was not immediately known whether
Trump's supporters would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans on Monday also were waiting to see if a federal lawsuit by
McCain would get him back on the ballot all around the state. In a move that may
indicate his thinking, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman decided Monday that
McCain's name will appear on all military ballots sent out later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   However, if a member of the military votes for McCain in a district where
his name isn't on the ballot, the vote won't count, according to Amanda Cooper,
a spokeswoman for the Brennan Center for Justice, which is representing McCain
in his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, McCain is not on the ballot in 14 of the state's 31 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and his New York supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist
Lenora Fulani, wanted Trump's delegate slates thrown off the ballot, claiming
there were insufficient signatures from party members on his petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The state chairman of the Independence Party, Jack Essenberg, is backing
Trump. Fulani is attempting to have Essenberg removed as state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's executive committee will meet on Friday in Albany to discuss
removing Essenberg, Fulani spokeswoman Kathy Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections refused to throw Trump off the ballot and an
appeal of the board's decision by the Fulani forces was heard on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Governor, state Senate leader in spat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - At least three former state workers have learned
patronage has a down side.
<P>
	   The workers who gained their positions with help from a good word by state
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno have apparently lost them over a political
spat between Bruno and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went to work Friday, went home and got a phone call," said Mark McDonald
of East Greenbush, in the heart of Bruno's district. McDonald said he lost his
job as a special assistant to the commissioner of environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   His supervisor was "kind of vague" about the reason for the firing that
McDonald said apparently had nothing to do with his performance.
</P>
<P>
	   McDonald said he got the state job eight months ago with the recommendation
of Bruno and other political leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's part of the system, I guess," he said Monday. "At this point I start
looking for a job."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was upset about the firings.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's terribly unfair and really not the way that anything should be
done," he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said the firings may be the actions of Pataki staff members he did not
identify and that, perhaps, the staffers "who have acted inappropriately before"
were trying to send Senate Republicans a message.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would expect the governor of New York state would not conduct himself in
such a demeaning way," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor does not engage in petty feuds," said Pataki spokesman Michael
McKeon. "It is beneath him; rather he will continue to fight for the policies
that have helped transform New York state and trigger our economic renewal."
</P>
<P>
	   McKeon said payroll changes are common throughout any state fiscal year. "I
wouldn't read anything into that" routine practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno emphasized that the Legislature and governor are partners.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not to be dictated to. The governor is not a dictator, not a king,
(although) some of his staff might think so," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said both houses are needed to pass laws and approve appointments,
like some Pataki nominations whose approval was postponed Monday by the Senate.
The decision not to confirm the nominees was interpreted as a show of the
chamber's unhappiness with last week's firings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might be a little bit of a blip," veteran state Sen. Hugh Farley,
R-Schenectady, said Monday. "How serious the rift is, I can't comment on it."
</P>
<P>
	   Farley and others said the tensions revolve around Bruno's championing of a
plan to reimburse counties and New York City about $340 million to pay for new
health insurance programs for the poor. Pataki wants the counties to pay those
costs directly, and says they can afford to do so with the money they're getting
through their settlement with tobacco companies and state-sponsored cost
containments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that was," Farley paused, searching for the word, "the
misunderstanding, we'll call it."
</P>
<P>
	   Farley said the legislative and executive branches of any government "are
very jealous of the other's authority," and that Pataki and Bruno have natural,
although limited, tensions despite both being Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tensions apparently came to the fore late last week when
Bruno-supported state employees Stanley Brownell, a local legislator in Bruno's
home Rensselaer County; McDonald, the Rensselaer County Conservative Party
chairman; and a state Corrections Department employee from Bruno's hometown of
Brunswick, were dismissed by their agencies, according to a source.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownell, declined comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a temper tantrum and some people were bounced and now it's in the
press and everyone's taking fighting positions," the source said, referring to a
New York Post report Monday about the Pataki-Bruno tiff and its fallout. The
source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said one of the three employees
fired was told his dismissal came on orders from "the second floor," a reference
to the governor's office in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Farley said he expected Bruno and Pataki to patch things up quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's a terrific relationship between the senator and the
governor," Farley said, noting that Bruno is usually a peace maker in state
politics between Pataki and the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly,
Sheldon Silver. "I don't think it will amount to anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno also probably didn't endear himself to Pataki when, on Friday, he
issued a statement condemning Pataki's hand-picked board at the Thruway
Authority for approving a toll increase plan. Bruno reiterated his opposition to
the toll hike Monday and said he would fight them legislatively if the board
adopted the increases this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   A bill is moving through the Assembly's health committee that would have the
state pick up the counties' costs of new health care insurance programs. It
would put Silver into alliance with Bruno and in opposition to Pataki on the
health cost issue.

<HEADLINE> Both Assembly and Senate leaders threaten anti-toll action  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Legislature is prepared to block a proposed toll
increase on the New York State Thruway, its top two leaders say.
<P>
	   Both Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
said a toll increase was unacceptable at a time when the state is struggling to
create and retain jobs in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Senate will prepare legislation to prevent the Thruway Authority from
going through with its plan to drive up costs for businesses and commuters
through their hidden tax increase," Bruno, a Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, said his transportation committee
would hold a hearing on the Thruway toll increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's determine what's necessary and what's not necessary and let's make a
determination, does this administration want to impose a tax specifically on
people to get to and from work?" Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, blasted the Thruway Authority
for approving an "outrageous" toll increase plan "in secret."
</P>
<P>
	   "What are they paying for?" McCall asked. "If there is a case to be made,
then you come out and make the case."
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker said lawmakers can block a toll hike either through legislation
or in the next state budget they will adopt, for fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's board late last week said it has adopted a
previously unannounced plan to impose a 1.8 percent toll hike on most Thruway
tolls beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also voted to allow future annual toll increases of up to 3
percent if construction costs in 20 U.S. cities, including New York and Buffalo,
increase during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway, whose board is appointed by Gov. George Pataki, referred to its
toll hike as annual toll "adjustments." It said it needed the money to pay for a
five-year, $1 billion capital improvement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver suggested that the Thruway Authority revise its list of construction
projects. Bruno said the authority "should be looking at managing its resources
as a way to help pay for infrastructure projects" rather than resorting to toll
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway Authority spokeswoman Anya Frost said Monday if legislators want to
forgo their "members' items" - the pork-barrel spending they annually use to
fund projects in their home districts - or provide funding for road improvements
from other sources, the Thruway would look at their proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, have not increased
since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Demonstrations start outside Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hundreds of chanting protesters received a heartfelt
thanks from Amadou Diallo's parents as the trial of the four police officers who
shot the young immigrant began.
<P>
	   Demonstrators endured cold temperatures and snow flurries Monday to kick off
protests outside the trial, chanting "Amadou, we love you" and counting out the
41 bullets fired at him. The demonstrators vowed that the trial's relocation
from New York City to Albany would not deter them from shedding a spotlight on
racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
	   The racially charged case was moved to the state capital by an appeals court
that said publicity and protests would make it impossible for a fair trial in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted them to know that if they wouldn't bring the trial to the Bronx,
the Bronx would come to the trial," the Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd, about
half who took buses up from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was killed in a barrage of 41 bullets
fired by the officers as they searched a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Buses left the city before sunrise Monday and traveled through the remains
of a winter storm that dumped 10 inches of snow on Albany. As flurries lingered
through the morning, demonstrators marched in circles on a snow-slicked city
park opposite the courthouse. Albany police estimate that about 400
demonstrators were on scene Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Raphael of Manhattan said the effort was important because it signals
that the trial was being watched closely.
</P>
<P>
	   Florence Middleton of Harlem agreed, saying: 'It could have been any one of
us, anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's parents addressed the crowd during the trial's lunch break,
expressing sorrow over their son's violent death, but thanking the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a victim of injustice," Kadiatou Diallo said of her eldest child.
"We have to make sure we are here for him."
</P>
<P>
	   A door painted with 41 bullet holes and the silhouette of a man served as a
vivid reminder of Diallo's death. And a number of protesters said they feared
Albany will become "Simi Valley II," a reference to the California court venue
that led to acquittals of police officers accused of brutality in the Rodney
King case.
</P>
<P>
	   But the protesters said they were determined to make their case peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   "You represent a young man who had dignity, who stood for peace" Sharpton
told the crowd. "And we are not going to mar his name."
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Curry, of the Capital Region Justice for Diallo Committee, said there
would be other rallies on key dates throughout the trial. Sharpton said busloads
of New York City protesters would return when opening arguments begin.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia expert George McTurnan Kahin dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - George McTurnan Kahin, a Cornell University
professor and author who was one of the nation's leading scholars of Southeast
Asia and an early critic of U.S. policy during the Vietnam War, is dead at age
82.
<P>
	   Kahin died Saturday at a hospital in Rochester after being admitted a week
earlier. Cause of death was not disclosed. He had lived in Ithaca since being
enlisted by Cornell in 1951 as its first specialist on Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Ivy League school, Kahin was credited with helping to create the
foremost Southeast Asian studies program at an American university.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin wrote two highly praised books: "Nationalism and Revolution in
Indonesia" (1952), an account of Indonesian politics in the first half of the
20th century, and "Intervention: How America Became Involved in Vietnam" (1986),
which relied on hundreds of interviews and thousands of declassified documents
to analyze U.S. intervention in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been working in recent years on a manuscript, based largely on
personal experience, that examined the impact of U.S. policies on the political,
social and economic landscape of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin taught political science and history at Cornell up to 1988 but
remained active at the school through this year as the Aaron L. Binenkorb
professor emeritus of international studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of students took his "United States and Asia" course. Some of his
graduates helped him produce "Governments and Politics of Southeast Asia," one
of the first scholarly textbooks to focus on the region's politics. It was used
in classrooms around the country until the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Baltimore in 1918, Kahin grew up in Seattle and served in the U.S.
Army from 1942 to 1945 in between earning degrees at Harvard and Stanford. He
traveled in Indonesia in 1948 and 1949 during the country's independence
revolution against the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
	   His fieldwork earned him a doctorate in political science at Johns Hopkins
University and was the basis of his first book. Kahin also became active in
publicly opposing U.S. support for the Dutch colonial cause and, having his
passport withheld, was barred for several years from leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   He was appointed associate director of the fledgling Southeast Asia Program
in 1951, and was director from 1961 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Kahin played an active role in speaking out against the Vietnam War, taking
part in the first nationally televised teach-in on the war in April 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife of 22 years, Audrey Kahin; his two children,
Brian and Sharon, two grandchildren, Ange and Owen, and his sister, Peggy Webb.
A private service will be held in Ithaca this week.

<HEADLINE> State's first witness says land less valuable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The state began its defense with a witness who
testified that properties in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim are among the
poorest farming lands in the area and considerably less valuable than what a
federal appraiser said.
<P>
	   "If you were going to take a contiguous 64,000 acres of the poorest soil,
you would take much of that area," John Bouck told jurors Monday as the damages
trial entered its second week in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the federal government's property appraiser said he used a
"highest, best use" methodology to value the claim area in Cayuga and Seneca
counties at $335 million for its current-market value and rental worth for a
204-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bouck, a real estate broker and appraiser from Auburn, said that he
found only 50 percent of the claim area was actually "functional cash crop farm
land," and even some of that amount was marginal.
</P>
<P>
	   To make it cultivable, farmers have drained most of the land, an expensive
process that can cost up to $500 an acre, which in some cases is nearly 25 times
the per-acre rental value, Bouck told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the land is not functional without drainage tiles installed. All
the best farms have been drained," he told jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is attempting to show that federal appraiser Arvel Hale grossly
overvalued the land during his testimony last week. The state's experts will
testify that the land is worth no more than $41 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The courts already have ruled that New York state illegally acquired the
land in 1795 and 1807 by failing to get the federal government's approval for
the land treaties it entered with the Cayugas. The jury will determine how much
compensation the Cayugas should receive for their lost ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouck also refuted Hale's rental appraisal, saying that much of the claim
area is unrentable as agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only land that gets rented is tillable land that is able to generate
some kind of income," Bouck said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale calculated his rental appraisal by considering the land's agricultural
worth since 1795. But Bouck told jurors that local farmers have been renting
their land out only since about the 1950s. Prior to that, the technology did not
exist to make the land cultivable and most farms were small, subsistence
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State attorneys have argued that Hale's appraisal was flawed, citing, among
other things, that Hale never personally inspected any of the properties but
instead relied solely on the counties' computer data to come up with averages.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to provide an appraisal that is more than just your own
judgment and be perfectly accurate, you have to go out and get the information
from the horse's mouth," said Bouck, who said he was personally familiar with
all the claim area through 30 years of working in the area as a broker,
appraiser and developer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just looking at the county records is easier, but it's not as accurate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouck also told jurors that the land's value was diminished because of the
proximity of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, a stopover for hundreds of
thousands of migrating birds who feed on the crops in local farm fields, leaving
them less productive and thus less valuable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers have to have their crops in by certain times or the birds ravage
their crops. It's a question of who is going to win the race," Bouck testified.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, many surrounding farms in the land claim area are now used as
pasture or for growing hay instead of more profitable crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony continues Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani already spending heavy in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - With the election still some nine months away, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have
already spent a combined $8 million in what is shaping up as the most expensive
U.S. Senate contest ever.
<P>
	   Giuliani, who began raising money some six months before the first lady,
outpaced her in both spending and contributions, according to reports each camp
sent on Monday to the secretary of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican mayor raised $8.8 million in the last six months of 1999,
compared with $8 million for Clinton. He spent $4.6 million last year - more
than many Senate candidates have even raised so far.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Giuliani took in $11.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton raked in a total of $8 million. Like the mayor, the first lady spent
heavily, shelling out $3.4 million in her six months of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the hefty bankrolls, neither candidate has officially entered the
race yet to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Clinton is set to
formally announce her candidacy on Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed what and where the campaigns spent
their money was not available. That information is contained in massive reports
each campaign is filing with the Federal Election Commission that had to be
postmarked by Jan. 31. Only summary pages were made available Monday by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million in cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to
his filing. Clinton trailed him with $4.7 million on hand, her report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson called the first lady's
financial filing "very strong."
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where either candidate spent the cash,
Giuliani's aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad
campaign. The Giuliani camp has also spent money on a direct-mail campaign to
solicit donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to
conservatives and have taken shots at Clinton. One called the first lady "leader
of the ultra left-wing." Direct mail, much of it from outside New York state,
has accounted for about 40 percent of Giuliani's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of each candidate's contributions came from individual donors, who
can only give up to $2,000. Giuliani raised $8.7 million from those individual
contributors, Clinton $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides have said they have raised money from residents in all of New
York's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp also raised $245,311 from political action committees,
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Giuliani recently hired a Washington,
D.C.-area fund raiser, Julie Wadler, who said she would specialize in raising
PAC contributions for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton brought in $219,925 from PACs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's report also showed a $1.2 million transfer from a committee set up
by her campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Clinton did
several joint fund raisers with the DSCC and was required to set up a separate
account for those contributions under federal election law, her spokesman said.
He said all were hard-money donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Corrado, a government professor who specializes in campaign finance
at Colby College in Maine, said the Clinton-Giuliani race was easily on track to
be the most expensive political contest in U.S. Senate history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in this race is that in addition to the candidates spending
enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars will be spent by the
political parties and outside interest groups," Corrado said, referring to the
largely unregulated soft money spent on candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Those totals are not included in the candidates' filings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at a level not seen in previous Senate races," Corrado said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton taps media team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's media team includes an
advertising agency that may know how to get under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's skin,
but has never before madfe ads for a political candidate.
<P>
	   Clinton is expected to face the New York City mayor in this year's race for
the Senate seat being vacated by New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the first lady said Monday that the media team includes veteran
media consultant Mandy Grunwald, pollster Mark Penn and the New York City
advertising agency, DeVito/Verdi.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outstanding team of experienced New Yorkers," Howard Wolfson,
the first lady's campaign spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grunwald was a key player on Bill Clinton's media team when he first ran for
president in 1992 and she has been Moynihan's top media adviser for his last
three Senate races. Penn worked on President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign
and has also done work for Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   DeVito/Verdi, on the other hand, has never handled advertising chores for a
candidate, although the agency has done some ads in support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency was responsible for ads on New York City buses in 1997 promoting
New York magazine as: "Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't
taken credit for."
</P>
<P>
	   After Giuliani objected, the Metropolitan Transportation Agency removed the
ads. The magazine took the MTA to court and won in a case that went all the way
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "He tends to get very angry and agitated. That's been our experience," Ellis
Verdi said Monday night when asked about the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Verdi said the award-winning agency wasn't concerned about never having done
ads for a candidate before.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is like any other product. Advertising is always a challenge, but here
we're blessed with a great product," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Verdi said the work was also a chance for the 9-year-old company "to make a
mark in this industry."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to New York magazine, the agency has done work for a host of
companies, including Home Depot and Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady plans to formally announce her candidacy Sunday in suburban
Westchester County where she and President Clinton have purchased a $1.7 million
home. Until she moved into the house several weeks ago, the first lady had never
lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not said when he will formally declare his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Groups say pollution cleanup money should be distributed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Great Lakes are so polluted that a change of
strategy might be in order, say two environmental groups.
<P>
	   The Sierra Club and Great Lakes United think it's time to give one or two
contaminated bays, harbors or river mouths extra resources instead of spreading
available federal money to all eight Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic change from current practice is needed because distributing the
funds around the entire region hasn't yet resulted in the completed cleanup of
any of the lakes' toxic hot spots, said Emily Green, the Sierra Club's Great
Lakes expert.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Great Lakes are still toxic after all these years," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green and Margaret Wooster of Great Lakes United proposed focusing a new
Great Lakes cleanup grant program, should it be approved by Congress, on as few
target areas as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has said he'll ask for $50 million for the proposed
grants, but Wooster said that would be a drop in the bucket compared to the
estimated cleanup pricetags: $100 million to $170 million for Wisconsin's Lower
Fox River, $1 billion for New York's Buffalo River and $42 million to $210
million to rid the Detroit River of its worst contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra $50 million President Clinton promised to seek for cleaning up the
lakes, plus state matching funds, might be enough to see one persistent
contamination problem through to the end, provided it's one of the smaller
problem areas.
</P>
<P>
	   That, Green said, "will allow us to develop the expertise to clean up these
hot spots completely."
</P>
<P>
	   "A model can then be made for other Great Lakes communities to follow," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toxic hot spots around the Great Lakes number 42, and 31 are on the U.S.
side. None of those has been cleaned up, though some are closer than others to
having cleanup plans implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmental groups did not prioritize the hot spots or suggest which
deserved to get first crack at the new grant money, should Congress approve it.
</P>
<P>
	   Both groups said strides have been made in reducing pollution in the lakes,
but the law still allows contamination to be piped directly into the waters, and
tests on fish and birds still show large concentrations of dangerous chemicals
in the food chain.
</P>
<P>
	   One researcher, Dr. Theo Coburn, described studies showing that children
born to mothers who eat Great Lakes fish had hearing and memory problems that
made it difficult for them to keep up with their classmates.

enlarged that they had exploded. The exact cause of the glandular problem has
not been established, but researchers suspect a link with PCBs and perhaps other
chemicals, she said.

<P>
	   Contaminants in Great Lakes sediment are absorbed by worms and forage fish
and eventually make their way up the food chain at increasingly higher levels as
medium-sized fish eat smaller contaminated fish and larger fish or birds eat the
contaminated medium-sized fish.

<P>
	   Advisories have been posted at each of the Great Lakes for children and
women of childbearing age to either limit how much fish they eat or, for certain
kinds of fish and certain bodies of water, avoid eating the fish altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The environmentalists illustrated that danger at a news conference where
they displayed a "toxic buffet" of elegantly prepared lake fish on artistically
arranged pools of sauce or beds of greens, each too toxic for consumption by
children or women of child-bearing age.

<P>
	   The activists were in town for meetings with the Environmental Protection
Agency and Council of Environmental Quality, where a possible updating of the
Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada is
under review.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines History  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Before Monday's crash of an Alaska Airlines jet off the
California coast, the airline had not had a fatal accident in nearly a quarter
of a century.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent Alaska Airlines fatal accident before Monday was in 1976,
when one person died when a Boeing 727 overran a runway at Ketchikan, Alaska. In
1971, 111 died when an Alaska Airlines 727 crashed into a mountain on approach
to Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the industry,''
Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine, said late Monday. ``Twenty-four years
since a fatal accident. That's a long time in today's business.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airline mentioned the two fatal crashes at a news conference Monday, but
did not address the possibility of fatal accidents before 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline has promoted itself as among the safest air carriers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has 500 daily departures from 40 cities in the western
United States and Mexico. Of its 88-aircraft fleet, 38 are MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft that crashed Monday was an MD-83, built in 1992. Alaska
Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said it had flown 26,584 hours and was serviced
Sunday. It had a low-level maintenance check Jan. 11 and a more thorough check a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has been the subject of a federal grand jury investigation
over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report found two MD-80s that made 840
flights in late 1998 and early 1999 on which records were falsified. Because of
the fouled-up records, the aircraft were considered to be in ``unairworthy
condition,'' said FAA records.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said at the time that the airline was consistently told by federal
investigators that airplane safety was not in question and that the inquiries
were limited to record keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the airliner that crashed Monday was one of those
MD-80s involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines traces its beginnings to a three-passenger float plane that
began service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska, in 1932, under the name
McGee Airways. The present name was adopted in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, which has an image of an Eskimo painted on its planes' tails,
flourished with deregulation of the airline industry. In 1979, Alaska served 10
cities in Alaska as well as Seattle. Now it serves cities across the West and in
1998 carried more than 13 million passengers.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Voting Begins at Midnight  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE EMERY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. (AP) -- Voters in two tiny northern New Hampshire towns
cast the first votes in the state's earliest presidential primary at midnight
Monday, and gave Bill Bradley and John McCain the early lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had 13 votes and Al Gore 5 in the Democratic race. Among
Republicans, McCain had 19 and George W. Bush 17.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dixville Notch in the Ballot Room of The Balsams, the vote was Bradley 4
and Gore 2. Bush had 12 and McCain 10. Steve Forbes had 1 and Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes were shut out.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hart's Location, at the Notchland Inn, the vote was Bradley 9, Gore 3.
McCain had 9 and Bush 5. Elizabeth Dole, who had dropped out of the race, had
two write-in votes, and fringe candidate Jeffrey Peters got one write-in vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixville has 14 registered Republicans, three Democrats and 12 independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart's Location has 12 Republicans, four Democrats and 12 independents.
</P>
<P>
	   State law requires polls to stay open until 7 p.m. unless everyone eligible
to vote has done so.
</P>
<P>
	   The tradition of having everyone vote at midnight and closing the polls a
few minutes later began in Hart's Location in 1948, when nearly everyone worked
for the railroad and had to be at work before the polls opened. After letting
the tradition languish there, Hart's Location revived it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixville Notch began voting early in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Both towns get a lot of attention from reporters and others. But neither is
known for foreshadowing the winners statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in 1996, Lamar Alexander won the Republican vote in Hart's
Location, and Bob Dole won in Dixville Notch. Pat Buchanan won statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stephen Barba, president of The Balsams, said, ``It really has never
mattered how we voted; what matters is that we vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the hours before midnight are as likely to be spent swapping coffee
cake recipes as kibitzing about the candidates, residents take the vote
seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kids often come to the vote simply because the parents involved know
that it's a piece of history and a piece of Americana unfolding,'' said Les
Schoof, innkeeper at the Notchland Inn.

<P>
	   Bixler was the founder, chief executive officer and chairman of the board
for Cornerstone Television, which included WPCB-Pittsburgh, WKBS-Altoona,
W51BF-Hermitage, W51AO-Brookville, a 24-hour satellite channel and 163 affiliate
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bixler also was a pastor for 13 years, and wrote and edited for eight
Christian book publishers. He was a member of the board of directors of the
National Religious Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife, Norma Bowman Bixler; four children, and 10

Ron Feiereisel
</P>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Feiereisel, who played professional basketball before
becoming a coach and referee, died Friday of natural causes. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
	   While playing at DePaul from 1950-53, Feiereisel's 1,106 points made him
28th on the Blue Demons' career list.
</P>
<P>
	   He later played two years for the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving the NBA and coaching at DePaul and at an Arlington Heights
high school, Feiereisel became a referee, first in the American Basketball
Association, then in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, he returned to DePaul to coach the women's team. His teams were
61-57 in four seasons. His daughter, JoAnn, was one of the top scorers.
Gordon Fraser
</P>
<P>
	   WINTER PARK, Fla. (AP) -- John Gordon Fraser, a broadcast news pioneer who
delivered historic accounts of battles during World War II, died Thursday. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraser began his lengthy broadcasting career in 1932 and was the on-camera
announcer when President Franklin D. Roosevelt presided over a historic
demonstration of television at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraser covered World War II for the ABC Radio Blue Network and was a war
correspondent attached to the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1955, Fraser helped launch NBC's Monitor, a weekend news and features
radio program. He was a writer, producer and editor with Monitor for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraser worked at the college's radio station for 12 years until he retired

John J. Gaherin
</P>
<P>
	   HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- John J. Gaherin, a negotiator who represented
newspaper publishers and helped write the first labor contracts and pension plan
for Major League Baseball, died Jan. 24. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1964 to 1967, he was president and chief negotiator of the New York
Newspaper Publishers Association, representing seven newspapers against 10
unions at a time of strikes, slowdowns and wage-related battles.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent the next decade as chief negotiator for organized baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   Together with Marvin J. Miller, executive director of the players
association, he negotiated the first basic labor contract for Major League
Baseball in 1968. A year later, he negotiated the first baseball players pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1975, he was involved in talks tied to baseball's reserve clause, which
kept players with one team unless traded or sold. When club owners rejected the
proposal to negotiate, an arbitrator tossed out the clause. That led to free
agency, allowing players to negotiate for millions of dollars with the team that
bids highest.
Tamara Horowitz
</P>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tamara Horowitz, who served as chairwoman of the
Philosophy Department at the University of Pittsburgh and wrote about rational

<HEADLINE> Avalanches Strand Cars in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two avalanches stranded at least 19 motorists
Monday on a highway linking Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula, and unstable snow
and blizzard conditions made rescue operations uncertain, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can't get to them, they will have to stay there,'' said Alaska State
Troopers spokesman Greg Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
	   Driving snow and winds of up to 55 mph made it too dangerous to try to
rescue the people by helicopter, and road crews were forced to pull back from
the area because of the possibility of more avalanches, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said blizzard conditions prevented rescuers from dropping supplies, such
as food and blankets, for the stranded travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the motorists used cellular phones to tell troopers they were OK,
Wilkinson said. Since their cars were running low on gas, he said they were
advised to only run the motors for 5 minutes each hour, just enough to keep the
cold at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The temperature in the area was expected to dip into the low teens
overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The best thing they can do is stay with their cars and remember that snow
can make a good insulator, Wilkinson said Monday night, adding, ``Their cars are
completely buried in the snow by now.''
</P>
<P>
	   The motorists were stranded between two avalanches on the only surface link
between the Kenai Peninsula and Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkinson said other nearby areas were snow-heavy and avalanches were
likely. He said road crews were using recoilless rifles to try and bring down
the snow until the situation became too dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Taps Media Team  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has settled on a media team that
includes an advertising agency that may know how to get under Rudolph Giuliani's
skin, but has never done ad work for a political candidate, aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is expected to face the New York City mayor in this year's race
for the Senate seat held by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   The team includes veteran media consultant Mandy Grunwald, pollster Mark
Penn and the New York City advertising agency, DeVito/Verdi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an outstanding team of experienced New Yorkers,'' said Howard
Wolfson, the first lady's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Grunwald was a key player on Bill Clinton's media team when he ran for
president in 1992 and she was Moynihan's top media adviser for his last three
Senate races. Penn worked on President Clinton's 1996 re-election and also has
worked for Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   DeVito/Verdi, on the other hand, has never handled advertising chores for a
candidate, although the agency has produced ads in support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency was responsible for ads on New York City buses in 1997 promoting
New York magazine as: ``Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't
taken credit for.''
</P>
<P>
	   The city's transit agency removed the ads after Giuliani objected. The
magazine sued the agency and then won in a case that went all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellis Verdi said the award-winning agency wasn't concerned about never
having done ads for a candidate before. In addition to New York Magazine, the
advertising agency has done work for various companies, including Home Depot and
Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is like any other product. Advertising is always a challenge, but
here we're blessed with a great product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton plans to formally announce her candidacy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has not said when he will formally declare his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Crashes Off Coast Near L.A.  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 88 people plummeted
into the Pacific Ocean on Monday after the pilot reported mechanical problems
and it was diverted to Los Angeles for an emergency landing. Several bodies were
recovered from the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors hours after
the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later
to Seattle, went down at 4:36 p.m. PST, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
	   A National Park Service ranger on Anacapa Island, near the crash site,
``observed a jet going down,'' spokeswoman Susan Smith said at Channel Islands
National Park headquarters. ``From his observation it was nose first.''
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells about 10 miles offshore as
aircraft and small boats converged on the site just before sunset. Hours later,
the high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a
cutter and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Several bodies were found, Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Diorio said, but he could
not give a specific number. The weather was clear at the crash site, where the
water is between 300 and 750 feet deep, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every resource is out there to find people,'' said Coast Guard Capt.
George Wright. ``We're actively searching for survivors. ... In 58-degree water
temperature, people can survive. We're not going to quit until we're positive
there's absolutely no chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said the plane was carrying 83
passengers and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The plane that crashed had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in
1992, Thom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer
trim'' and asked to be diverted shortly before the plane crashed. ``Radar
indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,'' San Francisco
airport spokesman Ron Wilson told KRON-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   On the MD-80 series airplanes, the horizontal stabilizer looks like a small
wing mounted on top of the tail. The stabilizer, which includes panels that
pitch the nose up and down, is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' from the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If a plane lost its horizontal stabilizer, it would have no means to keep
the nose pointed at the proper angle up or down, and the plane would begin an
uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
	   A source with close knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the flight was normal and stable until the crew reported control
problems. Radar showed the plane plunging toward the ocean shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said the plane had no previous stabilizer problems, and FAA spokesman
John Clabes said it had never been in any accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans also said the plane went through a routine service Sunday in Seattle,
went through a low-level maintenance check on Jan. 11 and had a more thorough
routine check last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis ordered the California National
Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after takeoff from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the passengers on Monday's flight, 47 were headed to Seattle, 32 to San
Francisco, three to Eugene, Ore., and one to Fairbanks, Alaska, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and families of the
victims, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<HEADLINE> Group: Falun Gong Members Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In quietly convened trials, a Chinese court sentenced two
sisters who helped lead the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement to six and
seven years in prison and 30 other members who held a protest to terms of up to
two years, a rights group reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing's Dongcheng District Court convicted the 32 in one-day trials in
separate courtrooms last Friday, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said, citing relatives of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   China's entirely government-controlled news media have not reported the
trials, and court officials refused to comment. But the trials were the
capital's biggest since four leading organizers of Falun Gong were sentenced to
terms of up to 18 years on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Sisters Li Xiaobing and Li Xiaomei apparently had ties to those leaders. As
with the four organizers, the women were members of the group's inner circle,
the Falun Gong Research Association, the center said. The government claims the
association controlled Falun Gong in China and worked with sect founder, Li
Hongzhi, who now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The sisters ran a shop in Beijing that was the main place in the capital for
buying Falun Gong books, tapes and other materials, and prosecutors claimed it
had sold 1.8 million books, the center said. It added that they were convicted
of running an illegal business. Li Xiaobing got six years in prison and her
younger sister received seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   The other 30 people, from Beijing and Jinzhou in northeastern China's
Liaoning province, were tried on the same day in a separate courtroom and
convicted of using an evil cult to undermine the law, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were sentenced to terms ranging from four months to two years for
unfurling a banner in a protest in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong is a blend of meditation, slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn
from Buddhism, Taoism and its founder, and it is believed to promote health and
morality.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines History  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM KLAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Before an Alaska Airlines jet plummeted into the sea off the
California coast Monday, the airline had not had a fatal crash in nearly a
quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent Alaska Airlines fatal accident before Monday was in 1976,
when one person died when a Boeing 727 overran a runway at Ketchikan, Alaska. In
1971, 111 died when an Alaska Airlines 727 crashed into a mountain on approach
to Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Up until today it was probably the best domestic record in the industry,''
Jon Proctor, editor of Airliners magazine, said late Monday. ``Twenty-four years
since a fatal accident. That's a long time in today's business.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airline mentioned the two fatal crashes at a news conference Monday, but
did not address the possibility of fatal accidents before 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   In March 1990, an Alaska Airlines flight taking off from Sky Harbor
International Airport in Phoenix struck and killed a mental patient who wandered
onto the runway,
</P>
<P>
	   The airline has promoted itself as among the safest air carriers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The aircraft that crashed Monday was an MD-83, built in 1992. Alaska
Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said it had flown 26,584 hours and was serviced
Sunday. It had a low-level maintenance check Jan. 11 and a more thorough check a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has been the subject of a federal grand jury investigation
over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report found two MD-80s that made 840
flights in late 1998 and early 1999 on which records were falsified. Because of
the fouled-up records, the aircraft were considered to be in ``unairworthy
condition,'' said FAA records.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said at the time that the airline was consistently told by federal
investigators that airplane safety was not in question and that the inquiries
were limited to record keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the airliner that crashed Monday was one of those
MD-80s involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines has 500 daily departures from 40 cities in the western
United States and Mexico. Of its 89-aircraft fleet, 38 are MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline traces its beginnings to a three-passenger float plane that
began service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay, Alaska, in 1932, under the name
McGee Airways. The present name was adopted in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, which has an image of an Eskimo painted on its planes' tails,
flourished with deregulation of the airline industry. In 1979, Alaska served 10
cities in Alaska as well as Seattle. Now it serves cities across the West and in
1998 carried more than 13 million passengers.

<HEADLINE> NFL Player Charged in Double Murder  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Pro football player Ray Lewis was charged with murder Monday
in the slayings of two men outside an Atlanta nightclub after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, a Baltimore Ravens linebacker from Bartow, Fla., had been scheduled
to fly to Hawaii early Monday to play in Sunday's Pro Bowl. He was arrested
Monday night and was expected to appear in court on Tuesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before his arrest, Lewis had told reporters that he had been
questioned by police but had been cleared of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was the only person who had been charged in the slayings by Monday
night, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne said late Monday that the team was trying to
reach Lewis but had not yet spoken to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're waiting until we get more information until we comment," Bryne said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the two men were stabbed during a fight that broke out after a
Super Bowl party at the club ended about 4 a.m. Monday. Witnesses said six men
had fought and argued with the two victims, then fled in a stretch limousine,
firing at least five shots as they drove away.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the vehicle in a parking lot behind a hotel near the shooting
scene, Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Quigley and Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead both
said they could not release details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 24, is the second NFL player this month charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 4, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth was charged with
first-degree murder in the shooting death of Cherica Adams, who was pregnant
with their son. Carruth was released by the Panthers after the charges were
lodged.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last Friday, in his state of the NFL address, commissioner Paul
Tagliabue commented on the recent rash of criminal charges against NFL players.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not," Tagliabue said. "We
can't predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict students
shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was drafted by Baltimore in the first round of the 1996 draft after
leaving the University of Miami following his junior season. This year, he was
the Ravens' MVP and the NFL's leading tackler.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Towns Cast Votes for Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE EMERY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. (AP) -- Voters in two tiny northern New Hampshire towns
cast the first votes in the state's earliest presidential primary at midnight
Monday, and gave Bill Bradley and John McCain the early lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had 13 votes and Al Gore 5 in the Democratic race. Among the
Republicans, McCain had 19 and George W. Bush 17.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dixville Notch in the Ballot Room of The Balsams, the vote was Bradley 4
and Gore 2. Bush had 12 and McCain 10. Steve Forbes had 1 and Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes were shut out.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hart's Location, at the Notchland Inn, the vote was Bradley 9, Gore 3.
McCain had 9 and Bush 5. Fringe candidate Jeffrey Peters got one write-in vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Dole, who had dropped out of the presidential race, had two
write-in votes as vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixville has 14 registered Republicans, three Democrats and 12 independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Hart's Location has 12 Republicans, four Democrats and 12 independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Butler, one of owners of the Notchland Inn, said he voted for Bradley
partly because Bradley was the only candidate to visit the inn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought he was impressive. He reinforced my vote,'' he said. ``If Al
Gore or George Bush would have come, it might have made my vote more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Notchland, the voters entered 20 makeshift voting booths enclosed by
shower curtains with each voters name on a booth. The three married couples
voted together.
</P>
<P>
	   State law requires polls to stay open until 7 p.m. unless everyone eligible
to vote has done so.
</P>
<P>
	   The tradition of having everyone vote at midnight and closing the polls a
few minutes later began in Hart's Location in 1948, when nearly everyone worked
for the railroad and had to be at work before the polls opened. After letting
the tradition languish there, Hart's Location revived it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixville Notch began voting early in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Both towns get a lot of attention from reporters and others. But neither is
known for foreshadowing the winners statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in 1996, Lamar Alexander won the Republican vote in Hart's
Location, and Bob Dole won in Dixville Notch. Pat Buchanan won statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stephen Barba, president of The Balsams, said, ``It really has never
mattered how we voted; what matters is that we vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the hours before midnight are as likely to be spent swapping coffee
cake recipes as kibitzing about the candidates, residents take the vote
seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The kids often come to the vote simply because the parents involved know
that it's a piece of history and a piece of Americana unfolding,'' said Les
Schoof, innkeeper at the Notchland Inn.

<HEADLINE> Grief Hits Wash., Calif. Airports  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Amid the airport's normal faces -- the frowns of
impatience, the smiles of expectation -- were the unmistakable expressions of
grief.
</P>
<P>
	   As relatives and friends of those aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261 arrived
Monday night at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, they stood out from the
normal airport crowd. The tears gave some away; for others, it was the ashen,
blank expressions.
</P>
<P>
	   They said nothing as they walked into the airport and headed to a
second-floor waiting room for whatever information might be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our job is to just listen and try to help as much as possible,'' said
Maynard Sargent, a Salvation Army captain who was among dozens of counselors on
hand to meet the grieving. ``We will be here as long as we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, carrying 80 passengers and five crew members from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and on to Seattle, crashed Monday afternoon
in the Pacific Ocean north of Los Angeles. It had been diverted to Los Angeles
to attempt an emergency landing after reporting mechanical problems. There were
no signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-two of the passengers were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle,
three for Eugene, Ore., and one for Fairbanks, Alaska, according to the airline.
Their nationalities weren't immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, clergy, grief counselors and Salvation Army workers met
with about a dozen people in a room at the airport. A police officer stood guard
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said staff would do whatever they could.
``We'll put them up for the night. We'll feed them. We'll console them,'' he
said. ``We'll bring them whatever they desire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Topel of Berkeley, who said he knew someone on the flight, tried to be
optimistic. ``There's probably hope,'' he said. ``And they're searching all
night. So we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was scheduled to land in San Francisco at 5:11 p.m. By Monday
evening, the flight was still listed on the arrivals board evening with a
message: ``See agent.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Sea-Tac, anxious friends and relatives began arriving barely two hours
after the crash was reported, although the flight was not scheduled to arrive
until 8:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   For family members of an Auburn-based youth gymnastics club, news of the
crash caused a brief pang of anxiety. Their daughters were also aboard a
Seattle-bound plane from Puerto Vallarta -- but theirs landed 30 minutes before
the doomed Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was nerve-wracking because it could have been our flight,'' said Don
Mayer, of Kent, whose 12-year-old daughter and wife were aboard Flight 237.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Alaska Airlines ticket counter, agents did their best to handle
passengers not directly affected by the crash. One, Terry Weber, checking in for
her flight to San Diego, said she wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm in good hands with the Lord,'' Weber said. ``What's the odds of it
happening again?''

<HEADLINE> Man who masqueraded as lawyer wins self stiffest possible sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Paul C. Kurtz apologized to a judge at his sentencing
for repeatedly posing as a lawyer in criminal cases but could not attract
leniency from a jurist who said his regrets "ring hollow."
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Jones on Monday sent Kurtz to prison for
three years and five months, the stiffest possible sentence, because he
"jeopardized in every instance the administration of justice."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Kurtz had falsely represented himself in an "incredibly
numerous number of cases" and caused an enormous outpouring of government
resources to protect justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz, a balding man who still looked more like a lawyer than a defendant
with his finely manicured mustache and a business suit, apologized to the court
and "every other place" where he had falsely represented himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know what I did was wrong," the 58-year-old Bethesda, Md., man told the
judge. "I have some good in me as well."
</P>
<P>
	   He said what he did was "shameful behavior."
</P>
<P>
	   "I never intended to hurt anybody," he said. "I really intended to help guys
who were in trouble."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said she was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "To some extent your words ring hollow in view of your prior criminal
history and incarcerations and your efforts to somehow minimize your conduct in
this case," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz's criminal history includes four felony convictions for crimes
involving fraud, deceit or false statements. The crimes took place in Virginia,
Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the prison sentence, Kurtz also must pay a $5,000 fine and $12,812
in restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge allowed him to surrender voluntarily on March 15 because his
mother and fiancee were ill, but she said she thought he might be better off
going to prison immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz's lawyer, Brian Shaughnessy, said the judge should recommend that
Kurtz serve his sentence at a Maryland facility that has an alcohol
rehabilitation program "that would be of considerable help to him."
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice
after he was arrested in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, he pleaded guilty to making false statements and credit card
fraud. Prosecutors had cited scores of cases in which he allegedly held himself
out to be a lawyer even though he had no license to practice law.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases included approximately 14 federal criminal cases between late 1992
and mid-1998 as well as five cases before the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and one case in federal bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is far from a routine white-collar criminal case," Assistant U.S.
Attorney James Benjamin Jr. said in court papers. "Kurtz has embarked on a
calculated and apparently widespread effort to misrepresent himself as a
licensed attorney in numerous federal criminal cases."
</P>
<P>
	   After Kurtz's arrest, prosecutors notified courts and prosecutors in cases
in which he had appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz's lawyer said that the notifications resulted in just one guilty plea
that was nullified and had to be renegotiated.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers listen to treasurer reform ideas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state treasurer is asking lawmakers to outlaw
the corporate practice of paying fees to people who set up investment deals with
the state.
<P>
	   Denise Nappier's testimony Monday came four months after former Treasurer
Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from people who received
"finder's fees."
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal and the reform of the treasurer's office were the subjects of a
two-day hearing before the Legislature's finance committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Nappier also called for mandatory disclosure of similar fees paid to
federally licensed agents who arrange investments between firms and the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Paul Silvester abused his office and betrayed the public trust," Nappier
said. "Silvester and his cronies fed their ambitions and attempted to line their
pockets at the expense of every decent public employee, public servant and
law-abiding citizen in this state."
</P>
<P>
	   Silvester is scheduled to be sentenced in March on federal racketeering and
money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Nappier said her reforms would impose professional standards on investment
firms' marketing agents and exclude political cronies from influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
	   But she would not stop federally licensed firms from taking "placement agent
fees" for brokering state investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Committee member Rep. Michael Jarjura said all fees should be
banned. He and Rep. Thomas Conway, D-Waterbury, have filed a bill to ban all
fees in connection with state pension fund investments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to get rid of them and restore the public's confidence," said
Jarjura, D-Waterbury. "That's a no-brainer."
</P>
<P>
	   Nappier also said the Legislature should extend the current prohibition on
campaign contributions by those doing business with the treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Vendors currently cannot contribute to campaigns for treasurer; Nappier
wants the ban extended to all statewide candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Silvester, a Republican appointed by Gov. John G. Rowland, could
not raise money for his own campaign from financial firms he did business with,
he helped raise more than $100,000 for the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Nappier said a special election - not a gubernatorial
appointment - should be held when a treasurer quits. Rowland appointed Silvester
to replace Christopher Burnham, who left office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   But she spoke against forming a board of trustees to oversee state pension
investments - an idea favored by Burnham and some GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "A badly made decision by a board is not an improvement upon a badly made
decision by an individual," Nappier said. "It is more important to focus on how
investment decisions get made."
</P>
<P>
	   Burnham, who resigned to accept a job with a private company that did
business with his office, said an independent board would help crack down on
future corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you control over $20 billion as sole fiduciary and decision maker ...
I'm surprised the White House doesn't call," he said.

<HEADLINE> Peeler lawyers to renew request for new trial location  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - When a man mentioned he might be a juror in the
trial of two brothers accused in the killing of an 8-year-old witness and his
mother, his co-workers fell into two distinct camps.
<P>
	   Some told him to do everything he could to get off the high-profile case.
Others urged him to get on the jury so he could have a hand in putting the two
brothers to death.
</P>
<P>
	   After the man described his experience in court last week, a judge dismissed
him as a potential juror. But to defense lawyers for Russell and Adrian Peeler,
the man epitomizes the difficulty of picking a jury in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real concern," said John Walkley, a lawyer for Russell Peeler. "It
does make you wonder whether it's a significant number of the (jury) pool who
fall into these two camps."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell, 28, and Adrian, 24, are charged in the Jan. 7, 1999, killings of
Leroy "B.J." Brown Jr., and his mother, Karen Clarke. Prosecutors say the
brothers conspired to kill B.J. and his mother to prevent the boy from
testifying against Russell Peeler in the 1998 murder of Clarke's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, the brothers could get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge G. Sarsfield Ford said last week that he would continue
to try to pick a jury in Bridgeport until the end of February. He said he may
decide to move the trial if a substantial number of jurors have not been chosen
by then.
</P>
<P>
	   But Walkley said Monday he plans to renew his motion for a change of venue
much sooner, based on the man's comments and on the slow pace of jury selection
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the process began Jan. 6, four jurors have been chosen out of a pool
of approximately 200. Many people have been dismissed after telling the judge
they had already decided the brothers are guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley said the man who was dismissed last week reinforced his belief that
the brothers cannot receive a fair trial in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
	   "It does make you question the sincerity of the answers we're getting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have opposed the change of venue.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection was to resume Monday, but was postponed for a week because of
the death of the father of Bruce Koffsky, one of Adrian Peeler's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Walkley said he would renew the change of venue motion when jury selection
resumes on Feb. 7. Twelve jurors and four alternates must be selected for the
case.

<HEADLINE> Key meeting led to turnaround in Moxley investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - In 1991, investigators played what resembled a
high-stakes poker game during a secret meeting in the home of Rushton Skakel
Sr., whose son, Thomas, was then the prime suspect in the murder of Martha
Moxley.
<P>
	   The investigators held a thick black book they said pointed to another man
as the killer - Kenneth Littleton, the tutor who had moved into the Skakel home
the night more than 20 years ago when Martha was bludgeoned to death with a golf
club.
</P>
<P>
	   That meeting, described in a copyright story in The Advocate, altered the
investigation and ultimately helped lead to an arrest - not of Littleton or
Thomas Skakel, but of Thomas' younger brother, Michael.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Skakel was charged Jan. 19 in the Oct. 30, 1975, killing of Moxley.
His father, Rushton Skakel Sr., is the brother of Robert F. Kennedy's widow,
Ethel.
</P>
<P>
	   At the pivotal meeting, the state's former lead investigator, Jack Solomon,
appeared certain of Littleton's guilt. He told Emanuel Margolis, Thomas Skakel's
lawyer, and Thomas Sheridan, Michael Skakel's lawyer, that investigators had
information suggesting Littleton was a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
	   "He (Solomon) came to a meeting with Margolis and myself with a big black
book," Sheridan said. "He led us to believe he (Littleton) had bludgeoned four
or five teen-age girls under similar circumstances and that he was the prime
suspect in the Moxley murder."
</P>
<P>
	   Margolis said Solomon would not allow them to touch the three-ring spiral
notebook, which he described as "2 inches thick with a lot of pictures and
dates."
</P>
<P>
	   "He kept referring to a 'book compilation' that had been assembled as part
of the state's investigation. He said he was in close touch with law enforcement
in these various communities."
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview with The Hartford Courant, Solomon did not deny
telling the Skakel family attorneys that the police were looking into the
possibility that Littleton might be a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We certainly looked at any other unsolved murders throughout New England of
any female where the M.O. was similar," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In The Advocate's story Sunday, Solomon described his approach to the
Skakels' attorneys as a "ploy to get them to cooperate." The maneuver succeeded
in part. After listening to him expound about Littleton, the attorneys
acquiesced to his request to allow an inspection of the Skakel home, Margolis
recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were anxious to be given access to Solomon's black book on the basis of
which we would lend whatever assistance they asked. They were seeking the
opportunity to use video and still cameras inside the Skakel house and we
allowed this to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's "ploy" had another component, which did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   "He wanted access to question Thomas and Michael," Margolis recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Skakels had not allowed this since Margolis entered the case as their
attorney in January 1976, six months after the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Margolis said they considered allowing Thomas and Michael to be interviewed
by police, but decline after investigators refused to meet certain conditions.
The Skakels' attorneys had asked that investigators put something in writing to
the effect that neither Thomas nor Michael was a prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's move also had an unintended result. Based at least in part on the
theory that Littleton may have murdered Moxley, the Skakels hired private
investigators Jim Murphy and Willis Krebs of Sutton Associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Their investigation resulted in both Thomas and Michael admitting they had
lied to Greenwich police about their movements the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new account, Michael said he climbed a tree outside Moxley's window
and masturbated, then passed by what turned out to be the murder scene. It was
Michael's statement to those investigators that helped lead to his indictment,
sources told The Advocate.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Littleton was cleared of any involvement in Moxley's murder and
granted immunity in return for his testimony before the grand jury that decided
enough evidence existed to arrest Michael Skakel.

<HEADLINE> Image of actor walking again 'might be too dramatic'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The sight of Christopher Reeve walking again - even if
it was a computer image on a Super Bowl commercial - has advocates and
researchers at once thrilled and worried.
<P>
	   "It might be too dramatic," said James Peters, executive director of the
Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. "The idea that Reeves is bringing home,
that there is hope for a cure to spinal paralysis and reason to be enthusiastic,
is certainly a welcome attitude. ... But the date positive when the cure will
come, and how it will affect those who are already afflicted, those are kind of
big questions in our minds still."
</P>
<P>
	   In an ad for Nuveen Investments that aired Sunday, the "Superman" actor, who
was paralyzed in a fall from a horse in 1995, appears to be among those
gathering in an auditorium of the future to present an award for research that
supposedly cured spinal cord injury.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets up from a chair, then walks stiffly to the stage and stands with
other beneficiaries of the research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ad has a wonderful emotional appeal to it," said Dalton Dietrich,
scientific director of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. "And if it focuses
more attention on the need for research, that would be wonderful, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Though no date is given for the gathering, it is sometime after 2006. An
announcer says breakthroughs have been made by then against cancer and AIDS. The
New York skyline has some new skyscrapers, but Reeve hasn't aged.
</P>
<P>
	   Mercedes Rauen, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National
Spinal Cord Injury Association, said the idea of a complete cure so soon might
raise false hopes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be dreadful to live without hope, but hope has to be tempered with
reality," she said. "I know people who have been injured fairly recently who
believe they're going to be cured based on reports they've seen in the news
media, and that's pretty alarming. It becomes an additional devastation when it
doesn't come true."
</P>
<P>
	   Dietrich said, "I'm very enthusiastic about what we're doing in the field of
regeneration. But when it will occur, that's the problem. I'm a very
conservative scientist, and I cannot put a time period on it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said that whenever there's news about an advance in spinal cord research,
"everyone thinks paralysis is going to be cured relatively soon. We don't think
that's really the case. It's going to be just like cancer research and diabetes,
a multiple small-step kind of approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Reeve, 47, has been vowing to walk almost since the day of his accident. He
acknowledged Monday that he has been criticized for his unceasing optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest problem actually is people who have been in a chair for a very
long time," he said, "because in order to survive psychologically they have had
to accept, 'OK, I'm going to have to spend my life in a chair.' So I get shots
from some of them, you know, that I don't know what I am talking about."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued through Nuveen, Reeve insisted that the scene in the
commercial is "something that can actually happen. Most scientists agree that
with enough money and talent focused on spinal cord repair, the goal of walking
within the foreseeable future is a very real possibility."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Allen of Nuveen said the point of the ad is "to inspire a dialogue on
money, to have a new dialogue and get away from buying bigger boats and bigger
cars and think about the impact that money can have on the future."

Bodies Recovered in Alaska Airlines Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 88 people plummeted
into the Pacific Ocean on Monday after its pilot reported mechanical problems
and was diverted to Los Angeles for an emergency landing. Several bodies were
recovered from the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors hours after
the crash. Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco
and later to Seattle, went down at 4:36 p.m. PST, the airline said. A source
with close knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the flight was normal and stable until the crew reported control problems.

seven years in prison and 30 other members who held a protest to terms of up to
two years, a rights group reported Tuesday. Beijing's Dongcheng District Court

Bush Nears Campaign Spending Record

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spent almost $17.3 million -- some
$200,000 a day -- in the three months before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary and is nearing the spending record for an entire presidential campaign.
His spending total for the period between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 was far more than
any of the other contenders for the Republican nomination, according to reports
filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission. Bush already has spent almost
as much money -- $37.3 million -- as most of the other candidates will be

<HEADLINE> Grief Hits Wash., Calif. Airports  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WELLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Amid the airport's normal faces -- the frowns of
impatience, the smiles of expectation -- were the unmistakable expressions of
grief.
</P>
<P>
	   As relatives and friends of those aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261 arrived
Monday night at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, they stood out from the
normal airport crowd. The tears gave some away; for others, it was the ashen,
blank expressions.
</P>
<P>
	   They said nothing as they walked into the airport and headed to a
second-floor waiting room for whatever information might be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our job is to just listen and try to help as much as possible,'' said
Maynard Sargent, a Salvation Army captain who was among dozens of counselors on
hand to meet the grieving. ``We will be here as long as we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, carrying 83 passengers and five crew members from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and on to Seattle, crashed Monday afternoon
in the Pacific Ocean north of Los Angeles. It had been diverted to Los Angeles
to attempt an emergency landing after reporting mechanical problems. There were
no signs of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-two of the passengers were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle,
three for Eugene, Ore., and one for Fairbanks, Alaska, according to the airline.
Their nationalities weren't immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, clergy, grief counselors and Salvation Army workers met
with about a dozen people in a room at the airport. A police officer stood guard
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said staff would do whatever they could.
``We'll put them up for the night. We'll feed them. We'll console them,'' he
said. ``We'll bring them whatever they desire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Topel of Berkeley, who said he knew someone on the flight, tried to be
optimistic. ``There's probably hope,'' he said. ``And they're searching all
night. So we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was scheduled to land in San Francisco at 5:11 p.m. By Monday
evening, the flight was still listed on the arrivals board with a message: ``See
agent.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Sea-Tac, anxious friends and relatives began arriving barely two hours
after the crash was reported, although the flight was not scheduled to arrive
until 8:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   For family members of an Auburn-based youth gymnastics club, news of the
crash caused a brief pang of anxiety. Their daughters were also aboard a
Seattle-bound plane from Puerto Vallarta -- but theirs landed 30 minutes before
the doomed Flight 261 was scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was nerve-wracking because it could have been our flight,'' said Don
Mayer, of Kent, whose 12-year-old daughter and wife were aboard Flight 237.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Alaska Airlines ticket counter, agents did their best to handle
passengers not directly affected by the crash. One, Terry Weber, checking in for
her flight to San Diego, said she wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm in good hands with the Lord,'' Weber said. ``What's the odds of it
happening again?''

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Revives Family TV  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television time usually finds the McKinney family of Tulsa,
Okla., in separate rooms. Now they've found some common ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Three times a week, the family of four watches the same show -- ABC's quiz
craze, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." Everyone plays along. Four-year-old
Walker was especially delighted when he correctly completed the name of the
children's game "Duck-Duck-Goose."
</P>
<P>
	   It may be the most profound change wrought by the success of "Millionaire":
Experts say it has revived the concept of families watching TV together after a
decade's worth of forces pulling them apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, Walker and his 7-year-old sister, Katie, watch Nickelodeon in the
game room. Mom and Dad are elsewhere, watching news or business on one of the
home's three other sets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been really nice," said Melinda McKinney. "We probably watch more TV
than we should and we don't tend to watch it together. It's fun to be able to
actually enjoy something together."
</P>
<P>
	   Statistics bear out the broad-based popularity of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire." During the week of Jan. 17, it was among the four favorite shows
of children ages 2 to 11, adults over 55 and everyone in between, according to
Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very rare that you have a program like 'Millionaire' that
reaches every demographic group, where everybody watches together," said Larry
Hyams, ABC's chief researcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Family hour was once sacrosanct among broadcasters, a commitment to minimize
sex and violence between 8 and 9 p.m. Yet as adult-oriented fare gained a
foothold on cable in that hour, the promise crumbled. Shows like "Friends" and
"Beverly Hills 90210" stretched the bounds of family hour beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters have succeeded in recent years in tailoring material to certain
groups to attract advertisers. NBC often targets wealthy, young adults without
kids. CBS doesn't want to offend its older audience. The WB seeks teen-age
girls, while UPN goes after teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Americans have steadily stuffed their homes with more TVs.
Nielsen says four in 10 households now have three or more televisions. Only 15
percent had that many in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   The result? Families scattered in different rooms watching different shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fialkovs, a family of four from Plantation, Fla., have five TV sets.
With two teen-agers, 13-year-old Jason and 11-year-old Sarah, it avoids
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet as often as they can, Harvey, Maria, Jason and Sarah watch "Millionaire"
to have some time together.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what I give my life toward," Maria Fialkov said. "It's why I had
kids. 'Millionaire' is fun because we start talking about other things. It
stimulates other conversations."
</P>
<P>
	   The most people the Goederses of Lawrenceville, Ga., have crammed into a
room to watch the show is 14. Usually it's just Lisa and Shawn, with 8-year-old
Will and 5-year-old Perry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time it's on we're bathed and down in front of the TV set to watch
it," Lisa Goeders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The families all play along. Walker McKinney was able to answer a question
about Pokemon characters, something that would baffle many adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" is ridiculed for its simple early round questions by some who
see it as the dumbing down of America. But that's one secret of its success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The questions are deliberately easy in the beginning, because you want to
get everybody into the show," said Michael Davies, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Goederses, Fialkovs and McKinneys all say that they must monitor what
their children watch, that there are too many programs inappropriate for
children. They say they wish there were more shows like "Millionaire" that
everyone can enjoy together.
</P>
<P>
	   There are signs television executives may be listening. This season's only
other breakout hit, Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle," is a fresh comedy about the
high jinks of a family of four boys.
</P>
<P>
	   Television being an imitative industry, it is likely there will be more
family comedies soon, much like "Millionaire" has unleashed a flood of game
shows. NBC's top entertainment executives have already said that establishing
new family shows is their top development priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Goeders welcomes that. She finds herself seeking out the board games
she once played, and wants to wrest her children away from Nintendo to play
Ping-Pong. Anything to promote group, instead of solitary, activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the whole feeling you're getting back from 'Millionaire,"' she said.

<HEADLINE> Election Season Critical for Cable  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not just the politicians angling for bragging rights
in New Hampshire today.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's first primary is also the beginning of crunch time for the
cable TV news networks, who see the presidential race as a crucial campaign
season for viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN has dubbed itself ``America's Campaign Headquarters'' and sent 220
people to an abandoned mill in Manchester, N.H., in an attempt to cement its
dominance over two rivals who weren't on the air during the last presidential
primary season.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox News Channel hopes it can firmly establish itself as the No. 2 news
network following a recent string of ratings successes against MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this point, the broadcast networks don't really compete as much on
political stories,'' said Brit Hume, Fox News Channel's election anchor. ``The
intense competition and the real sweepstakes is among the all-news channels.''
</P>
<P>
	   CNN sent about 40 more staffers to New Hampshire this year than it did in
1996. The increase is largely due to CNN's affiliate news service and its online
news operation, said Sid Bedingfield, executive producer of the network's
political coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The beefed-up contingent has nothing to do with CNN's cable competitors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our plan this time around is not very different from last time,'' he said.
``We've made a commitment to political news and to owning the election story in
2000 and we felt the way to do it is to own it from the start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the cable news networks will essentially devote prime time to
reporting and interpreting the New Hampshire results today.
</P>
<P>
	   During prime-time coverage of Iowa caucus results a week ago, CNN led the
way with an average viewership of 977,000 people. Fox News Channel had 510,000
viewers and MSNBC had 262,000. The total of 1.7 million people watching caucus
coverage compares with the 1.2 million viewers on a typical night at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN is ``the George W. Bush campaign of cable news and the rest of us are
insurgent candidates,'' Hume said. While CNN is strong, it isn't used to
minute-by-minute competition for news, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like our chances,'' Hume said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox has inched ahead of MSNBC in prime-time over the past six months, but
usually not at the margins seen during last week's Iowa coverage. MSNBC noted
that it is seen in far fewer homes in Iowa than its rivals, and dismissed the
theory that MSNBC's reliance on lighter, taped features during slow periods has
eroded its reputation as a news network.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Capus, executive producer of MSNBC's nightly news with Brian Williams,
said MSNBC competes with itself on big news nights with NBC, CNBC and MSNBC's
online news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The exposure we get is from the accumulated audience of those different
platforms,'' Capus said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like on last week's caucus coverage, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw will be host of a
portion of MSNBC's New Hampshire coverage. Network stars like Andrea Mitchell,
David Bloom and Tim Russert also will appear on MSNBC.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Boy Has Divine Status for Some  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- In ``The Boy of the Dolphins,'' a Cuban painter
depicts Elian Gonzalez swaddled, like the baby Moses, in a blue blanket and
nestled inside an inner tube. Three dolphins surround him as the hand of God
manipulates puppet strings that lead the child away from a red background
symbolizing communism.
</P>
<P>
	   The painting is based on a story, reportedly told by Elian, that dolphins
swam around his inner tube and protected him while he drifted for two days in
the waters off the coast of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ... think that it has been a miracle from God that this boy was rescued
alive and that dolphins, like Elian himself says, helped the situation,'' artist
Alexis Blanco said. ``Elian, for me, is like a messenger that announces the end
of the communist dictatorship (in Cuba).''
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of fate and destiny swirls around the 6-year-old Cuban boy who has been
embroiled in an international custody battle that unfolds daily before
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Cuban Americans revere him as a divine messenger, believing it is God's
plan for Elian to remain in the United States. At least one sociologist contends
that Elian's divine image is simply political manipulation by those who want to
keep him in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The circumstances surrounding Elian's sea voyage provoke talk of divine
intervention. His mother set her only son adrift to save him while she was among
11 refugees who drowned. Elian was found on Thanksgiving by two fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them, Donato Dalrymple, thinks fate took him to the sea that day,
since it was his first time fishing. Dalrymple, who saw mahi mahi -- not
porpoises -- near Elian nonetheless believes the dolphin story.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to believe that God used the dolphins as an instrument to
keep him safe in that water,'' Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian also spoke of seeing an angel out at sea, according to Dalrymple and
Robert Curbelo, a friend of the Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the guardian angel and God were helping him through those
rough times when he was by himself,'' Curbelo said. ``Little boys who are 6
years old don't lie and they don't invent things like that. There are too many
factors here not to believe.''
</P>
<P>
	   One unconfirmed story circulating through Miami's Cuban community has Cuban
President Fidel Castro consulting a santero, a priest in the Afro-Cuban religion
Santeria, which melds elements of Catholicism and West African spiritualism and
sometimes calls for animal sacrifices. The santero told Castro his future
depends on Elian, and if the child stays in Florida, Castro's regime will fall.
If Elian returns to Cuba, the story goes, Castro will remain in power forever.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that's why Castro's making such a big deal about one little boy
when he's let thousands die in the water,'' Curbelo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is pictured holding a baby Jesus in one poster that is often seen at
demonstrations and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian is a prodigy of God,'' said 78-year-old Mariana Suarez, who joined
the demonstration last week outside the home where Elian met with his Cuban
grandmothers. ``God brought him to this country. I think he should stay here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Cuban Americans are eager to believe the mystical aspects of the Elian
saga because they have been waiting more than 40 years for an end to Fidel
Castro's regime, said Max Castro, a sociologist and researcher at the University
of Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're looking for divine intervention. This could be an announcement,
some kind of sign,'' he said. ``It's an episode of collective delusion ... but
there's a real belief in some people.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Bypass Small N.H. Town  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CRARY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON, N.H. (AP) -- This scenic little town has been bypassed by
candidates this year. Again. Just like all the other primary campaigns in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure what kind of reception they'd find if they did get here,''
said First Selectman Guy Eaton, the town's top elected official. ``You see those
orchestrated town meetings they have -- obviously they pack the place with their
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Incorporated in 1776 -- 15 years before the national capital first took
shape on a map -- this Washington has one store, 26 lakes and ponds and about
850 inhabitants scattered across 50 hilly square miles.
</P>
<P>
	   Through five decades of primaries, candidates have shown up in nearby
Hillsboro and Newport, but never in Washington. The trip here requires at least
a 20-minute detour off the nearest major highways in southwestern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're kind of forgotten,'' said Al Krygeris, a town assessor.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Dorval, a logger who serves with Eaton on the board of selectmen,
believes national candidates could learn something from the part-time
officeholders in Washington, where major decisions are made at annual public
meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We probably could give them some pointers,'' said Dorval, a motorcycle
buff with a Fu Manchu mustache. ``People have got to believe you're being up
front and you're not being shifty. You've got to look them straight in the
eye.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the lack of VIP visits, most Washington voters have dutifully
followed the campaign. Even the proudly apathetic, like John Goodliff, have been
bombarded by tele-canvassers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At 8 o'clock at night, you know what the call is,'' said Goodliff, who
sells everything from propane to pizza at the Washington General Store. ``I
throw my receiver in the pillows.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eaton, in addition to his selectman's duties, serves on the planning board
and delivers mail six days a week. He had an extra chore today -- making chile
for the dozen or so officials overseeing the polling station at a former YMCA
camp.
</P>
<P>
	   After the voting ends at 8 p.m., Town Clerk Janice Philbrick will help count
the ballots, then drive the sealed ballot box to the police station in nearby
Hillsboro.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes for a long, long day,'' said Philbrick, who starts pre-voting
chores at 7 a.m. and usually finishes election tasks around midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   A Republican, Philbrick has been torn between John McCain and George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing I don't like the most is the slamming of other people,'' she
said. ``I want to hear what you're going to do, not want you did last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Washington voters went for Bob Dole over President Clinton. As of
last fall, the town counted 316 Republicans, 100 Democrats and 241 undeclared
among its registered voters.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the Democrats -- backing Vice President Gore -- is Ronald Jager, a
retired Yale philosophy professor. He and his wife, Grace, wrote a history of
their adopted town and learned it had been stood up even in the 19th century,
when townsfolk waited in vain for a promised visit from President Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Jager used to be a Republican -- ``When I was young and foolish'' -- and
once tried to arrange a campaign visit to Washington by President Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's such a tiny little town, but it's beautiful,'' Jager said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the town common looks like a calendar photograph -- the
white-clapboard Congregational Church and 213-year-old Town Hall with almost
matching steeples, flanked by a few tasteful homes on a snow-covered hillside.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's hottest issue these days is school financing, not presidential
politics. The school board, at its upcoming annual meeting, will ask voters to
approve an expansion of the elementary school that could cost up to $4 million
-- by far the largest spending proposal in town history.
</P>
<P>
	   Any predictions on the meeting? ``War,'' said Dorval.
</P>
<P>
	   Rufford Harrison, the third selectman, was born in Britain and serves on the
governing council of the International Table Tennis Federation. He took no
interest in local politics until moving from Delaware to Washington in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been on a very steep learning curve,'' he said. ``I don't think
there's anywhere in the country that has the same pure democracy as we have
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   He likes McCain despite not sharing the senator's anti-abortion stance. As
for George W. Bush, ``I can't avoid the thought that he's not a straight
shooter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison's skepticism covers the whole field.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They all make these promises. And not one of them is going to do any of
these things,'' he said. ``It's only the Congress that can do it, and most of it
won't happen.''

<HEADLINE> Watts Announces Bid for 4th Term  </HEADLINE>
   By RON JENKINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., the only black Republican member
of Congress, has decided to run for a fourth term despite an earlier pledge to
serve only three.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of what I said in 1994, I will stand for re-election for the
citizens of the Fourth District of Oklahoma and let them judge me on election
day,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, 42, said he believed his constituents liked what Congress has
accomplished since the mid-1990s, including welfare reform and a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we think much more needs to be done,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The former University of Oklahoma football star had a fast ride to the
party's top echelon after his election among the Republicans' conservative class
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke during the 1996 GOP presidential convention and gave the party's
response to the State of the Union address in 1997. A year later, he was named
chairman of the Republican Conference, the No. 4 position in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said keeping the balance of power in Washington was a factor in his
decision. He said if Democrats gain control, chances of a tax cut and increase
in military spending would ``come to a screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are 222 Republicans in the House, 211 Democrats and two independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said he weighed the pros and cons during the past two months but did
not decide he would run again until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he still believed in term limits, but added, ``I don't believe
Oklahoma should restrict itself and the 49 other states not restrict
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   If voters return him to Washington, he said would seek re-election as
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have accused Watts of breaking his pledge to not serve more than
three terms in the House and produced a document showing his support of term
limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I honestly don't know if I did or didn't'' sign such a pledge, Watts said
Monday. He said he anticipates term limits to be a campaign issue in November,
but he would defend his record and ``await the election results in peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, no Democrats have announced plans to run for Watts' post.

<HEADLINE> Neighbor credited with saving Vonnegut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Fire marshals were investigating the cause of a fire
that left author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. in critical condition, including reports that
it may have been started by a cigarette.
<P>
	   A small but smoky blaze broke out in the fourth-floor study at Vonnegut's
East Side brownstone Sunday night. A fire department source, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said marshals believe the blaze may have been caused by
a cigarette left burning in the room.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire department spokesman Michael Regan said marshals have determined the
fire was not suspicious, but he said the cause was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old writer, known for satirical and darkly humorous novels
including "Cat's Cradle" and "Slaughterhouse-Five," suffered smoke inhalation
trying to extinguish the blaze, Regan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vonnegut was in critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit,
said New York-Presbyterian hospital spokeswoman Peggy Sung. No further
information was released.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials credited Vonnegut's neighbor Hans von Stackelberg with saving
the author, as well as his wife, celebrity photographer Jill Krementz; and their
daughter, Lily Vonnegut, 17, from serious harm. The fire, which caused minor
damage to one room, was reported shortly after it began, and firefighters had it
under control in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't consider myself a hero," said von Stackelberg, who is acting head
of the German consulate in New York. "In fact, if the fire brigade hadn't
arrived when it did I would have left the scene because I was scared."
</P>
<P>
	   Though not willing to accept the title of hero, von Stackelberg went into
the burning room with Vonnegut. Using plastic salad bowls and water from a
nearby bathroom faucet, the pair tried to douse the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   As the room continued to fill with thick, acrid smoke, von Stackelberg
warned Vonnegut to leave and helped guide him to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he didn't come out of the room, I shouted to him, 'Mr. Vonnegut, you
have to get out of there,"' von Stackelberg said. "I know he was working in the
study. Maybe he was trying to collect some material. When he finally came out, I
grabbed him by the hand and led him to the staircase."
</P>
<P>
	   Von Stackelberg said the real hero of the night was his 17-year-old daughter
Filippa, who called 911.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I did was rush out of the house like an idiot," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   None of Vonnegut's family knew of the fire at first. Von Stackelberg said
Krementz was walking out the door when he rushed over, Vonnegut was on the
ground floor and Lily Vonnegut was in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was sheer coincidence I even saw the fire," the diplomat said. "We
normally close the shutters in that room, but this night we didn't. I don't know
why."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was gazing out on the falling snow when he spotted the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials said Vonnegut had been watching the Super Bowl in his study
and went downstairs before the fire erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Stackelberg is friendly with Vonnegut's wife but had never met the
author, who is known for his novels, short stories, essays and plays filled with
black humor, fantastic plots and often apocalyptic destruction.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AP Drops Courtesy Titles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Effective today, The Associated Press will drop the use of
the courtesy titles Miss, Mrs. and Ms. in almost all of its news reports,
adopting the same style for references to women as for men.
</P>
<P>
	   Women and men will both be identified on first reference by first and last
name -- John Doe or Susan Jones, for example -- and on second reference simply
by the last name -- Doe or Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, AP's style called for the use of courtesy titles for women on
second and subsequent references unless a woman asked that none be used. Under
the new practice, writers and editors will use courtesy titles only when a woman
requests one.
</P>
<P>
	   The change, which will be reflected in the forthcoming edition of The
Associated Press Stylebook, reflects the preference of the vast majority of the
news cooperative's newspaper members. Courtesy titles were eliminated several
years ago in AP sports reports and in AP services for radio and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In stories where people share the same last name -- e.g., a husband and wife
or brother and sister -- first and last names may be repeated where necessary
for clarity or courtesy titles may be used.

<HEADLINE> Barak Ties Peace Talks to Hezbollah  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Blaming Syria for violence in southern Lebanon, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he will not negotiate with the Syrians until
Damascus cuts off support for the Islamic militant Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   With 30,000 troops in Lebanon, Syria is its neighbor's main powerbroker.
Israel has long maintained that Syria has tacitly approved -- and in some cases,
encouraged -- the flow of arms to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's decision Monday not to return to peace talks until
Syria reins in the Hezbollah guerrilla army came hours after three soldiers were
killed in an ambush in south Lebanon and a day after the guerrillas assassinated
the No. 2 man in Israel's allied militia, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The SLA's 2,500 soldiers help 1,500 Israeli soldiers control a swath of
South Lebanon occupied by Israel. Israel calls the area a security zone, using
it as a buffer against guerrillas attacks on its northern towns. Hezbollah is
leading the war to liberate the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak is under pressure to show results from the revived peace process with
Syria, and may face a serious crisis of confidence if he does not deliver on his
campaign promise to bring quiet to Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel will not be able to negotiate peace as long as the Syrians do not
restrain the Hezbollah from acting against the Israeli army in the security
zone,'' he said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The new stance by Barak, a former army chief voted in by a public that
wanted peace with security, challenges intensive U.S. efforts to revive the
stalled peace talks, launched in December after a four-year break.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's army radio, without citing sources, said the United States had sent
messages to Syria urging it to restrain Hezbollah. A senior U.S. administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the Clinton
administration had been in touch this week with all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria pulled out of the talks in early January because of Israel's refusal
to commit in advance to a total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, and over the extent of demilitarization on the
strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's stand on Monday marked a dramatic new tone for the prime minister,
who for weeks since the breakdown of talks with Syria has tried to win over
President Hafez Assad with flattering statements about the Syrian leader's
character.
</P>
<P>
	   That changed as Barak faced military funerals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our boys are killed with (Syrian) permission. This pattern is
unacceptable,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his statement, Barak used language that has in the past foreshadowed a
major Israeli counterattack. ``We have known in the past, and we still know,
(how) to strike at the place and time of our choosing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some said Barak was losing the support of the center -- crucial to his hopes
of winning a referendum he has promised on any peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the recent spate of violence, Barak faced tenuous support for
his Syrian peace efforts. If the Syrians can't prove they can keep the Lebanese
front quiet, Israelis will have little incentive to support a treaty that would
cede the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has long been a homebase for groups who reject peace with Israel, and
has cultivated an image among Israelis as a state opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
	   The peace talks have done little to dispel concerns that peace for the
Syrians is tactical and temporary, and that impression has been fueled by
Syria's official press.
</P>
<P>
	   The Syrian government newspaper Tishrin accused Israel on Monday of using
Nazi-like policies in its dealings with the Arabs and said it grossly
exaggerated the Holocaust to win over international support for its policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Melchior, a Cabinet minister who is close to Barak, said the
editorial represented a moral low.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This makes continued dialogue with them more difficult,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Brits, Irish Studies Report on IRA  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish governments early
today studied a long-awaited report by a disarmament commission looking into
whether the Irish Republican Army is finally willing to reveal its network of
arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither government would reveal details of the report, which they received
just before midnight Monday. That was the deadline set by American mediator
George Mitchell as part of his successful mission last year to rescue Northern
Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But Catholic and Protestant politicians in the province's 8-week-old Cabinet
fear that the report will confirm that the IRA has not yet begun to disarm, and
that this in turn will force the British government to suspend the local
administration's powers and resume so-called ``direct rule'' from London.
</P>
<P>
	   The compromise package brokered by Mitchell required the major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, to form a Cabinet that included the IRA-linked Sinn
Fein party in advance of any IRA disarmament. In exchange, the IRA was supposed
to cooperate with the disarmament commission and negotiate the gradual
destruction of its hidden weapons stores.
</P>
<P>
	   While IRA commanders have been discussing the prospect in secret with the
disarmament commission's head, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, his report will
indicate whether the outlawed group has made any concrete commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who so far has faced down substantial
Protestant opposition to including Sinn Fein in power-sharing arrangements, says
his party can't sustain the administration if the IRA doesn't reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
	   He expects the British government to suspend the administration's powers in
advance of an Ulster Unionist meeting Feb. 12. Trimble scheduled that meeting as
a reassurance to party activists skeptical that the IRA would disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   A suspension of powers would allow the four-party, 12-member Cabinet to be
mothballed pending a breakthrough in the IRA arms impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   But both Sinn Fein and the province's major Catholic-supported party, the
moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, warned that any suspension of
authority could lead to the Cabinet's eventual collapse and would only make IRA
disarmament tougher to achieve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord anticipated that Northern Ireland would receive a new
cross-community government by late 1998, and that the IRA would completely
disarm by May. But the Ulster Unionists delayed forming the Cabinet for more
than a year, arguing that Sinn Fein's eligibility to hold office should depend
on a start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble received just 58 percent support for moderating that policy in a
ballot of the Ulster Unionists' grassroots council. That November result was
deemed sufficient for him to enter a Cabinet alongside Sinn Fein -- but too
little for him to stay there for long if the IRA doesn't begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has countered that the accord only obliges his
party to attempt to persuade IRA commanders to disarm. He stresses there's no
guarantee -- given the many broken deadlines already experienced on Northern
Ireland's slow road to peace -- that the IRA will discard even a single bullet
by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA started a campaign of bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of
abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked to Britain. It
called a cease-fire in 1997 after slaying more than 1,800 people. The gesture,
though short of a formal renunciation of violence, cleared the way for Sinn Fein
to join multiparty talks that produced the Good Friday pact.

<HEADLINE> Judge limits scope of reporters' appearance before grand jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - A state Supreme Court judge says two Long Island
reporters have to appear before a grand jury, but the scope of questioning will
be limited.
<P>
	   Last week, Suffolk County District Attorney James Catterson Jr. subpoenaed
Newsday's Elizabeth Moore and News12's Scott Feldman to testify before a grand
jury probing corruption allegations at the Suffolk Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the lawyer who represented both Newsday and the News12 cable TV
news channel before state Supreme Court Judge John J.J. Jones Jr. said he was
pleased that narrow restrictions were ordered, but the news organizations could
still appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that it is inappropriate for a district attorney to
bring reporters before a grand jury," attorney David Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Shield Law limits the circumstances under which reporters can be
called to testify about information gathered while on assignment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling Monday, the judge said the district attorney's office would be
limited to asking the News12 reporter to authenticate a videotaped interview
with Catterson and to attest to its accuracy. Similarly, questions to the
Newsday reporter would be limited to the authenticity and accuracy of her
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered the reporters to appear before the grand jury on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Schurr Levin, Newsday's vice president and general counsel, said the
subpoena could compromise the reporters' independence and harm their relations
with news sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "Putting any reporter into a secret grand jury potentially harms what they
do," she said Monday. "It no longer makes them an impartial observer."
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson's yearlong investigation is believed to focus on allegations of
improper political activity in Sheriff Patrick Mahoney's department, including
allegations that deputies and correction officers were required to make
political donations to the sheriff in exchange for promotions or plum
assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson and Mahoney are longtime foes; Mahoney claims the district
attorney has abused his power by threatening opponents with grand jury
investigations, a charge Catterson denies.

<HEADLINE> 5 picked for jury in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A black foreperson has been chosen for the trial of
four white police officers accused of murdering an unarmed black man in the
Bronx.
<P>
	   The foreperson - a soft-spoken, middle-age woman who once lived in the Bronx
- was picked Monday during the first day of jury selection in downtown Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Another black woman, two white women and a white man were also seated on a
panel that will number 16 - 12 regulars and four alternates - but only after
attorneys privately clashed over race at a bench conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The pace of jury selection, rapid for a high-profile trial, means testimony
could begin later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're moving along at a good speed, which is a little surprising," said
defense attorney Stephen Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings opened almost a year after police fired 41 shots at Amadou
Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999. The
African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is taking place in Albany, 150 miles from the scene of the
shooting. A state appeals court decided that the accused cops wouldn't get a
fair trial in the Bronx because of publicity and racially charged protests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that this case is being tried in Albany County is irrelevant,"
Justice Joseph Teresi told prospective jurors after reading the second-degree
murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 jurors and four alternates will be chosen from a pool of nearly 2,000
people. On Monday, 242 people were sworn in; 39 were excused while undergoing
questioning in smaller groups by the judge and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   The five jurors were picked after the prosecution and defense accused each
other of challenging potential jurors based on race, which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors sought to remove 10 prospective jurors, including seven white
men; the defense tried to keep three black women off the jury, according to the
transcript of a conversation at the judge's bench later read to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Bennett Epstein accused the prosecution of trying to remove
jurors "solely based on the fact they are white males."
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutor Eric Warner told the judge the prosecution challenges were
fair, given the make-up of Albany's population.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the Bronx," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was
about 39 percent and the white population of Albany County about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner also labeled defense attempts to disqualify the three blacks
"blatantly discriminatory." Epstein denied the charge, arguing that the women
could be biased because one had lived in the Bronx and two had relatives who had
brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge decided to allow two of the three black women to serve on the
jury. He also upheld all of the prosecution's challenges, leaving the five
jurors who were seated.
</P>
<P>
	   While the screening took place, demonstrators staged a prayer vigil outside
the courthouse. About 100 people who had traveled from Harlem to Albany by bus
chanted "Amadou, we love you" and "No justice, no peace." The Rev. Al Sharpton
and other civil rights activists have portrayed the case as symbolic of racism
and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, the dead man's mother, told reporters outside the
courtroom: "We are praying for Amadou and to achieve justice in a peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted in March. They aimed their barrage at
Diallo, a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a pager, while searching his
neighborhood for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who plan to testify, have claimed they used deadly force only
after Diallo refused to halt and appeared to be reaching for a gun.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists warn of global deforestation crisis, demand more  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As the United Nations opened the final session of a
forum on forest protection, environmentalists joined activists from Alaska and
Peru in urging participants to act quickly and decisively to stop what they
called a global crisis of deforestation.
<P>
	   "We compare the situation to the sinking Titanic and the band playing
music," Ricardo Carrera, coordinator of the World Rainforest Movement, told
reporters Monday across the street from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of more than a dozen environmental groups and indigenous
peoples from the Peruvian Amazon and Alaska spoke out at the news conference as
the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development's Intergovernmental Forum on
Forests began its final session of talks on how to create an international
system for managing and protecting the world's remaining forests.
</P>
<P>
	   The session, which ends Feb. 11, may result in the establishment of a
permanent forum to discuss forest policy issues or the establishment of a
legally binding convention to regulate forest management at the global level.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a sense that this round of negotiations is perhaps a last chance
for reaching a global accord on forest management," said a statement issued
Monday by the United Nations on the forum's session.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Steiner, a representative of the environmental group Coastal Coalition
and professor at the University of Alaska, said, "We have a world crisis on our
hands, and it's solvable. But to solve it we need definitely immediate help from
the United Nations and its member states. ... Instead, there's a talk shop going
on across the street."
</P>
<P>
	   The environmentalists said that they had little confidence in the results of
the forum and that the discussions about what to do were dragging on too long.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very serious. What's gonna happen (if nothing is done) is gonna hit
everybody like a brick in the head," warned TV wildlife personality Jack Hanna,
holding a black leopard kitten he called an ambassador of species endangered by
deforestation. "Without the forest, this animal doesn't survive."
</P>
<P>
	   Steiner said that 2 acres of forest disappear every second and that up to
150 species become extinct every day because of deforestation. Half the earth's
original forest cover is gone, and only a fifth still exists in large relatively
undisturbed tracts of natural forests, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 400 million people depend on forests, of whom about 60 million are
indigenous peoples, he said, introducing representatives of dozens of tribes in
the Peruvian Amazon and one tribe in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lives of many isolated tribes are in danger right now because lumber
companies infringe on the forests they depend on and live in. We need help now,"
said Wrays Perez, vice president of the Inter-Ethnic Development Association of
the Peruvian Jungle, which represents 64 indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials related to the session did not immediately return calls
Monday seeking comment on the environmentalists' concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   But speaking to the forum, Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette said,
"We should not wait for a major calamity, public health crisis or even war over
water to focus our minds. We have the tools now to secure our future. Do we have
the will? Let us show that we do."

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani already spending heavy in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - With the election still some nine months away, First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have
already spent a combined $8 million in what is shaping up as the most expensive
U.S. Senate contest ever.
<P>
	   Giuliani, who began raising money some six months before the first lady,
outpaced her in both spending and contributions, according to reports each camp
sent on Monday to the secretary of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican mayor raised $8.8 million in the last six months of 1999,
compared with $8 million for Clinton. He spent $4.6 million last year - more
than many Senate candidates have even raised so far.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Giuliani took in $11.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton raked in a total of $8 million. Like the mayor, the first lady spent
heavily, shelling out $3.4 million in her six months of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the hefty bankrolls, neither candidate has officially entered the
race yet to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Clinton is set to
formally announce her candidacy on Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed what and where the campaigns spent
their money was not available. That information is contained in massive reports
each campaign is filing with the Federal Election Commission that had to be
postmarked by Jan. 31. Only summary pages were made available Monday by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million in cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to
his filing. Clinton trailed him with $4.7 million on hand, her report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson called the first lady's
financial filing "very strong."
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where either candidate spent the cash,
Giuliani's aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad
campaign. The Giuliani camp has also spent money on a direct-mail campaign to
solicit donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to
conservatives and have taken shots at Clinton. One called the first lady "leader
of the ultra left-wing." Direct mail, much of it from outside New York state,
has accounted for about 40 percent of Giuliani's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of each candidate's contributions came from individual donors, who
can only give up to $2,000. Giuliani raised $8.7 million from those individual
contributors, Clinton $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides have said they have raised money from residents in all of New
York's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp also raised $245,311 from political action committees,
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Giuliani recently hired a Washington,
D.C.-area fund raiser, Julie Wadler, who said she would specialize in raising
PAC contributions for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton brought in $219,925 from PACs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's report also showed a $1.2 million transfer from a committee set up
by her campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Clinton did
several joint fund raisers with the DSCC and was required to set up a separate
account for those contributions under federal election law, her spokesman said.
He said all were hard-money donations.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Corrado, a government professor who specializes in campaign finance
at Colby College in Maine, said the Clinton-Giuliani race was easily on track to
be the most expensive political contest in U.S. Senate history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in this race is that in addition to the candidates spending
enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars will be spent by the
political parties and outside interest groups," Corrado said, referring to the
largely unregulated soft money spent on candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Those totals are not included in the candidates' filings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at a level not seen in previous Senate races," Corrado said.

<HEADLINE> Kaye names investigator to probe scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former assistant Manhattan district attorney plans to
investigate whether judges have been giving plum court jobs to attorneys based
on political connections.
<P>
	   Chief Judge Judith Kaye announced Monday that Sherrill Spatz will head a new
court office charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance with court rules
governing judicial appointments of guardians, receivers, referees and other
fiduciary posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Spatz, 42, is currently the trial counsel in the enforcement division of the
New York Stock Exchange, where she is responsible for investigating and
prosecuting wrongdoing by brokers, dealers and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointment comes three weeks after Kaye promised to establish the
office in light of allegations by two Brooklyn Democratic Party officials who
claimed that judges have been appointing lawyers to plum court jobs on the basis
of political party affiliation and personal connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "Allegations of political favoritism in fiduciary appointments can
jeopardize the public's trust in our court system," Kaye said in a statement
Monday. "Although we cannot prejudge what improprieties have actually occurred,
the public must have confidence that the business of the courts is being
conducted free of partiality."
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Brooklyn Democratic Party loyalists Thomas J. Garry and Arnold
J. Ludwig sent a letter to more than 40 Democratic Party officials complaining
that they had been shut out of fiduciary jobs but that a fellow lawyer, Ravi
Batra, who had no party office, was getting plenty of work.
</P>
<P>
	   "The letter laid out such a stark picture," said Chief Administrative Judge
Jonathan Lippman, who hired Spatz.
</P>
<P>
	   After the letter became public - apparently confirming long-standing rumors
of widespread patronage in the surrogates court system - Kaye promised to
appoint a special investigator and a blue ribbon panel to examine the fiduciary
appointment process and make recommendations for reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Spatz said she is eager to start.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there's a lot of information out there, so there are a lot of
documents to go through, a lot of people to talk to," she said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect asks chief state's attorney to take over investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The lawyer for former Yale lecturer James Van de
Velde says his client has been unfairly targeted by New Haven police
investigating the slaying of Yale student Suzanne Jovin.
<P>
	   David Grundberg, who represents Van de Velde, on Monday asked the chief
state's attorney's office to take over the investigation. In a letter to Chief
State's Attorney John Bailey, Grundberg says he believes New Haven police can no
longer be objective in investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Grudberg asked Bailey to assign the investigation to his office's cold case
squad.
</P>
<P>
	   Grudberg said Monday he would not comment on his request until the chief
state's attorney had decided whether to grant it. But Bailey said he doesn't
have the authority to take the case from New Haven State's Attorney Michael
Dearington's office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I plan to talk with Mike about it, but until they say they want us to do
something, it's their case," Bailey said. "They have done a lot of work on it
and are still working on it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jovin, 21, was killed Dec. 4, 1998, suffering 17 stab wounds in the back and
neck. Her body was found in the upscale East Rock neighborhood not far from
campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors reported hearing shouting, as though a couple were arguing,
minutes before the body was discovered, but police say there were no witnesses
to the brutal slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, police said Van de Velde - Jovin's senior thesis advisor - was
in a "pool of suspects." No other suspect was identified. No arrests have been
made.
</P>
<P>
	   Van de Velde has maintained his innocence and has accused police of ruining
his life by naming him as a suspect. Yale officials didn't renew Van de Velde's
contract. He left New Haven last summer to live on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have asked Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee, a forensics expert,
to perform a reconstruction of the murder. They also are waiting for test
results on cat hairs found on Jovin's clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said Monday he has not set a date for the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The cold case squad was formed last year to review old cases by using new
techniques, such as DNA testing, to re-examine evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   It was DNA testing, as well as fingerprint work, that led the cold case
squad to charge Edward L Grant Jr. of Waterbury with the murder of Concetta
"Penney" Serra, who was found stabbed to death in a New Haven garage in 1972.
Grant has pleaded innocent and is awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drinking, Fainting Connected  </HEADLINE>
    By JUAN A. LOZANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Scientists say they have learned part of the reason why some
people pass out when they stand up after drinking alcohol: lower blood pressure
and wider blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
	   Two or three beers on average is enough to impair the body's ability to
maintain a steady blood pressure, according to a 1999 study believed to be the
first to explain the cardiovascular effects of drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   Those changes impair the body's ability to pump fresh blood to the brain,
said Dr. Virend Somers, a co-author of the study published today in the journal
Circulation. As a result, drinkers who suddenly stood up often felt lightheaded
and sometimes fainted.
</P>
<P>
	   How alcohol causes those changes is unknown, said Somers, a cardiologist at
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. He suggested the alcohol could be blunting the
nerve signal sent from the brain to the vessel, or the alcohol was preventing
the blood vessel from constricting.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Lange, a professor of internal medicine at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center who was not affiliated with the study, said
the research was the first to define why fainting may occur after drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more than just being inebriated. This explains in a very mechanical
fashion on how alcohol can cause someone's blood pressure to fall," said Lange.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1999 study, 18 healthy men and one woman averaging age 26 were given
the equivalent of two to three beers.
</P>
<P>
	   Each participants' blood pressure dropped after the drinks. Somers said none
of the subjects passed out during the study, but several became lightheaded.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Groups Urge Phone Fee Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer groups say they have come up with a plan to
reduce phone bills for everyone, particularly those callers who have not
benefited greatly from declining long-distance rates.
</P>
<P>
	   A proposal by Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, the
National Retail Federation, AARP and others would cut $4 billion a year from
home and business telephone bills, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would guarantee that every consumer, regardless of how much calling
they do, would get the benefit of declining industry costs,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, responds
to a plan offered to the FCC by the phone industry to reduce the ``access'' fees
that local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies contend customers could save at least $5.8 billion over five
years. In turn, certain flat-rate fees would be consolidated on local phone
bills, but not decreased.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer advocates' plan, on the other hand, would take $1 off the cost
of the phone line from the local phone company into the home -- marking a direct
savings to customers regardless of their long-distance usage. That charge,
identified on monthly bills as the Subscriber Line Charge, is now capped at
$3.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer proposal also would get rid of another charge, which pays for
long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. That item varies by
company but averages about $1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer advocates say the industry plan contains no guarantee that
long-distance companies will pass on the savings to consumers. They pledged to
file suit if the FCC adopts the companies' proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The phone companies can afford the cut if they recover costs from customers
more in line with their actual expenses, said Mark Cooper, research director of
the Consumer Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper said consumers will save even more over the course of the next four
years as regulators continue to cut access charges to better reflect local phone
companies' connection costs. This should lead to lower per-minute long-distance
rates for customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry coalition immediately criticized the consumer plan as
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to issue price controls to drive savings for consumers, when the
clear trend is to use the marketplace to drive savings for consumers,'' said
John Nakahata, a lawyer with the Washington firm Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis,
which represents the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the industry proposal contains a provision to keep local phone
service affordable to poor people and customers living in rural areas, while the
consumer plan does not.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC put out the industry plan for comment last year, but has said it is
interested in hearing from consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the industry proposal include Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE, SBC,
AT&AMP;T and Sprint.

<HEADLINE> 'Simpsons' Character To Die Off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alas, poor Maude Flanders, we hardly knew her.
</P>
<P>
	   Maude, the wife of Homer Simpson's annoying do-good neighbor Ned Flanders,
is rumored to be the character that dies in the Feb. 13 episode of "The
Simpsons."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in our 11th season and we're always looking for new ways to shake up
the show a little and do something that might open up new story possibilities,"
the show's executive producer, Mike Scully, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't say Maude's demise is definite, adding that other possibilities
include school principal Seymour Skinner and Moe the bartender, one of
beer-guzzling Homer's best friends.
</P>
<P>
	   A dead giveaway, however, is the episode's title "Alone Again,
Natura-Diddly," a play on Ned's annoyingly chirpy overuse of the word "diddly."
</P>
<P>
	   What's more, Maggie Roswell, who provides Maude's voice, left the show
because she tired of commuting from Denver to Los Angeles to record her lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The voices of Skinner and Moe are done, respectively, by series regulars
Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria. The two actors also play a number of other
characters on the series about Homer and Marge Simpson, their kids Bart, Lisa
and Maggie and their wacky hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   If Maude is the one, her sacrifice might not be in vain. The episode airs
during the February "sweeps," a key ratings period used to help set advertising
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it would be interesting to show how the surviving characters
cope with the death and maybe take them in a new direction," Scully said. "Plus,
it's sweeps. "
</P>
<P>
	   The character won't be the first to die on "The Simpsons." A gravestone will
be shown in the upcoming death episode with the names of four others who have
passed out of the series to cartoon heaven.
</P>
<P>
	   They include Bleeding Gums Murphy, the jazz musician who was Lisa's musical
idol; family shrink Dr. Marvin Monroe; Beatrice Simmons, girlfriend to Grampa
Simpson; and Frank "Grimy" Grimes, an unlucky co-worker of Homer's at the
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Simpsons," created by Matt Groening, has been acclaimed as a brilliant,
sophisticated satire on America and family life.
</P>
<P>
	   Since "The Simpsons" draws children as well as adult viewers, the show is
taking the death seriously -- to an extent.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of discussion about making sure we did deal with some of
the emotional ramifications of the death and not just make it all joke, joke,
joke," Scully said. "But at the same time, we're a comedy, they're animated,
they're not real."

<HEADLINE> Senator: Biosafety Deal Hurts U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are watching to see whether new rules regulating
trade in genetically engineered crops will hurt exports of U.S. commodities or
require conventional and biotech varieties to be stored separately.
</P>
<P>
	   The UN-sponsored deal, which was reached early Saturday after a week of
negotiations involving 130 countries, will require exporters to label all
shipments of biotech grain. The labels won't be required on shipments of food
products, such as cooking oil or meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Lugar, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and an
outspoken proponent of biotechnology, said the labeling rule will be ``a
substantial problem'' for U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To say the least this is a damper on exports and trade,'' the Indiana
Republican said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the National Corn Growers Association was more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing in this agreement should dissuade U.S. farmers from using
biotechnology,'' said Susan Keith, the group's senior director of public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't see this as requiring segregation. That will be a market-driven
decision. Contrary to what some others may be saying the biotech sky is not
falling.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Lugar's concerns were echoed by the smaller American Corn Growers
Association, which has been critical of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement ``will severely burden farmers and grain elevators, resulting
in higher premiums paid for'' conventional varieties, said Gary Goldberg, chief
executive officer of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everywhere we turn, additional obstacles are being placed in the way for
farmers to continue planting'' genetically engineered crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Soybean Association issued a statement saying it was ``taking a
wait and see position'' toward the agreement but predicted that the soybean
trade ``will go on largely as it does today.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has fought any labeling requirements or import bans on
biotech crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically engineered corn, soybeans and cotton have been become widely
popular in the United States over the past couple of years because of the
increased yields, but they have met increased consumer resistance in Europe and
Asia. Critics of the crops, which are resistant to herbicides or insects, say
that there isn't enough known about their impact on health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar, speaking at a news conference where he outlined his agenda for the
year, also said Monday that he expected Congress to put together an aid package
for farmers this year along the lines of measures it has approved over the past
two years totaling $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration's proposed 2001 budget will include about $5
billion in special assistance for farmers, including a new subsidy program
expected to cost $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar said farmers are likely to reject the administration's subsidy program
as inadequate once they see the details. The subsidies would be targeted to
small and medium-size producers and would be tied to fluctuations in crop
income.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the farm assistance the administration's budget also will
include a 20 percent increase in funding for food-safety programs. The extra $68
million will go toward research, education and other programs in three agencies.

    SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dolly Parton is selling the radio station where
she first performed as a child.
</P>
<P>
	   Parton bought WSEV-AM, on which she first sang at age 10, and its sister FM
station in 1991. She renamed the FM station WDLY.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since that time, we have tripled sales and developed the station to be a
solid business serving the community," Parton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Parton and her partners, Orr &AMP; Earls of Branson, Mo., believe the new owner,
the East Tennessee Radio Group, "can take the station to the next level since
radio is their primary business."
</P>
<P>
	   The sale price was not disclosed. Dollywood general manager Ken Bell said
the main change will be new call letters for WDLY.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Scores With 43.2 Rating  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pair of small markets produced big Super Bowl ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' stirring 23-16 victory over Tennessee on Sunday night drew a 43.2
rating and a 62 share on ABC, up 7 percent from last year. That makes it the
19th-highest rated among the 34 Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's game, Denver's 34-19 win over Atlanta, received a 40.2 rating
and 61 share, the lowest rating since the 1990 game registered a 39.0 rating.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC estimated 130,745,000 people watched the game, making it the fifth
most-watched telecast in U.S. history, trailing four other Super Bowls. Last
year's game, broadcast by Fox, was watched by 127.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The No. 1 program was the 1996 Super Bowl between Dallas and Pittsburgh,
watched by 138.5 million. Sunday's game pushed the final episode of "M-A-S-H,"
broadcast by CBS on Feb. 28, 1983, and watched by 121.6 million, out of the top
10 list, which includes nine Super Bowls and the women's skating final of the
1994 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   With two small markets, ABC said last week it hoped for a 42.0 rating, but
the close games caused ratings to grow throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
	   When the game began at 6:26 p.m. EST, it had a 39.0 rating and 61 share,
which grew to 41.4/64 from 6:30-7 p.m., 42.7/64 from 7-7:30 p.m. and 43.5/64
from 7:30-8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The halftime show got a 40.8/48 in the next half-hour, and the second half
began with a 43.9/62 from 8:30-9 p.m. That was followed by a 44.2/62 and a
46.9/65 for the final half-hour, which included Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown
pass to Isaac Bruce and Mike Jones' tackle of Kevin Dyson at the 1 as time ran
out.
</P>
<P>
	   The rating for the final half-hour was up 21 percent from the 38.9 for the
final half-hour last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In St. Louis, the 21st-largest television market in the United States, the
game produced a 55.6 rating and 78 share, In Nashville, Tenn., the No. 30
market, it drew a 50.3/67.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston, the Titans' home when the team was the Oilers, the game got a
47.0 rating and 67 share. In Los Angeles, the former home of the Rams, it got a
38.7/64.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the game got a 39.6 rating and 54 share.
</P>
<P>
	   The rating is the percentage of television households watching a telecast,
and each point represents 1,008,000 homes. The share is the percentage tuned in
among those televisions on at the time.

<HEADLINE> 5 picked for jury in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A black foreperson has been chosen for the trial of
four white police officers accused of murdering an unarmed black man in the
Bronx.
<P>
	   The foreperson - a soft-spoken, middle-age woman who once lived in the Bronx
- was picked Monday during the first day of jury selection in downtown Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Another black woman, two white women and a white man were also seated on a
panel that will number 16 - 12 regulars and four alternates - but only after
attorneys privately clashed over race at a bench conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The pace of jury selection, rapid for a high-profile trial, means testimony
could begin later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're moving along at a good speed, which is a little surprising," said
defense attorney Stephen Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings opened almost a year after police fired 41 shots at Amadou
Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999. The
African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is taking place in Albany, 150 miles from the scene of the
shooting. A state appeals court decided that the accused cops wouldn't get a
fair trial in the Bronx because of publicity and racially charged protests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that this case is being tried in Albany County is irrelevant,"
Justice Joseph Teresi told prospective jurors after reading the second-degree
murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 jurors and four alternates will be chosen from a pool of nearly 2,000
people. On Monday, 242 people were sworn in; 39 were excused while undergoing
questioning in smaller groups by the judge and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   The five jurors were picked after the prosecution and defense accused each
other of challenging potential jurors based on race, which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors sought to remove 10 prospective jurors, including seven white
men; the defense tried to keep three black women off the jury, according to the
transcript of a conversation at the judge's bench later read to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Bennett Epstein accused the prosecution of trying to remove
jurors "solely based on the fact they are white males."
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutor Eric Warner told the judge the prosecution challenges were
fair, given the make-up of Albany's population.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the Bronx," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was
about 39 percent and the white population of Albany County about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner also labeled defense attempts to disqualify the three blacks
"blatantly discriminatory." Epstein denied the charge, arguing that the women
could be biased because one had lived in the Bronx and two had relatives who had
brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge decided to allow two of the three black women to serve on the
jury. He also upheld all of the prosecution's challenges, leaving the five
jurors who were seated.
</P>
<P>
	   While the screening took place, demonstrators staged a prayer vigil outside
the courthouse. About 100 people who had traveled from Harlem to Albany by bus
chanted "Amadou, we love you" and "No justice, no peace." The Rev. Al Sharpton
and other civil rights activists have portrayed the case as symbolic of racism
and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, the dead man's mother, told reporters outside the
courtroom: "We are praying for Amadou and to achieve justice in a peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted in March. They aimed their barrage at
Diallo, a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a pager, while searching his
neighborhood for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who plan to testify, have claimed they used deadly force only
after Diallo refused to halt and appeared to be reaching for a gun.

<HEADLINE> New Network for Women Goes On Air  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The first thing that strikes you about Oxygen is the
suffocating cuteness of its name.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of an audacious startup called Oxygen Media, this is a women-targeted
cable network that pledges to be a breath of fresh air, a resource to draw on, a
supportive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   But will Oxygen get in your blood? Maybe not, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Web component already is available to any PC user with an
Internet connection (oxygen.com), when Oxygen TV starts flowing Wednesday at 8
p.m. EST, it will reach between 7 million and 10 million cable homes. (This
compares with the 75 million-plus homes receiving its heretofore unchallenged
rival Lifetime, which has programmed for women since 1984.)
</P>
<P>
	   What those viewers who get Oxygen will see is an estrogen-laced menu of
original, nonscripted programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Oxygen is pointedly leaving TV movies and "Golden Girls" reruns to Lifetime.
Instead, there will be a morning yoga session called "Inhale," and a nightly
talk show called "Exhale" with Candice Bergen as host. "Pure Oxygen" is a midday
block of news and humor, including a financial advice show, "ka-Ching." Comedy
and talk are scheduled at the dinner hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday at 10:30 p.m. EST, "X-Chromosome" presents women-oriented
animation.
</P>
<P>
	   And Friday at 10 p.m., a certain chat show (according to Oxygen's lofty
sales pitch) "playfully twists the classic sleepover ingredients -- taboo
topics, mind-bending trends and far-out music -- into grown-up friskiness." The
show is called "Pajama Party." Everybody wears jammies.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether any of this will qualify as appointment viewing -- and if so, by
whom -- remains to be seen. However, as billed, "Pajama Party" sounds best
suited to the heavy-breathing constituency of Comedy Central's "Man Show."
</P>
<P>
	   The person who created Oxygen out of thin air is Geraldine Laybourne, the
not-to-be-underestimated inspiration behind Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
	   Among her creative and financial partners is Oprah Winfrey, who initially
will appear on Oxygen in a 12-week how-to series about Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach -- creators of such hit sitcoms
as "Roseanne," "Cybill," and "Grace Under Fire" -- are also part of the Oxygen
team.
</P>
<P>
	   But are these names -- even Oprah's -- that will drive up Oxygen's ratings?
However colossal her following, can even Winfrey bring to Oxygen anything that
her fans don't get every weekday from her syndicated talk show? And do "Murphy
Brown" devotees care to see Candice Bergen without a script and a laugh track?
</P>
<P>
	   Or perhaps those are Old Media questions in a New Media world. Oxygen seems
to frame itself less as a slate of TV series than as a media haven where sisters
are doing it for themselves. Oxygen presents itself as a virtual gathering place
by and for you, the smart, take-charge woman who wants to "lean into your life"
(whatever that means).
</P>
<P>
	   "We think it's high time for the media to involve you as a companion,
contributor and critic," says Oxygen's promotion. "We're the facilitators,
you're the star." You are your own drawing power.
</P>
<P>
	   And with Oxygen's cable network linked to its interactive Web site, you'll
join your co-stars to inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale -- hey, take it easy!
You're hyperventilating!
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe Oxygen, for all its breathless talk of social crusades, is just
another entry in the race for TV-Internet convergence.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oxygen's words, convergence is "the idea that every television will be
able to serve up the World Wide Web and every computer will be able to display
TV and cable programs."
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, you might describe convergence as "an interlocking chain of news
and information delivery that meets all levels of viewers' needs." Those are the
words of NBC President Robert Wright in 1995, when he announced the creation of
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Oxygen, the MSNBC cable-and-online brand was created from the inside
out. MSNBC Cable and Online supplement each other, welcome audience input, and
promote themselves as a multimedia environment. Oxygen vows to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the heft of NBC in tandem with Microsoft, MSNBC has yet to spark
any perceptible revolution or change anyone's life. Will Oxygen and its
partners, which include the irrepressible America Online, be the venture that
makes convergence (in Oxygen's description) "as natural as breathing"?
</P>
<P>
	   The visionary Laybourne may succeed in her latest quest. But it's worth
recalling that her brainchild Nickelodeon triumphed by bringing girls and boys
together.
</P>
<P>
	   With somewhat the opposite strategy, Oxygen may live up to its name in
unintended ways, proving weightless and, for the time being, mostly invisible.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party boss thinks Giuliani doesn't want his help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The leader of the state Conservative Party says he
thinks Mayor Rudolph Giuliani doesn't want the backing of the small, but
politically potent party in his expected Senate race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
<P>
	   "Evidently he does not want to seek the Conservative Party endorsement,"
Michael Long said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's my speculation," the state party chairman added.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the Republican mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost 5-3
margin, no Republican has won statewide office in the past 25 years without the
Conservative Party's cross endorsement. Republican George Pataki beat
then-Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 on the strength of the Conservative
Party vote.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, there has been speculation in political circles over whether
Giuliani would reach out to Long and other Conservative Party leaders in a bid
for their support. For his part, Long said he hasn't talked to the mayor about
it since a brief conversation in August when the mayor said he would get back in
touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Long said there have been no phone calls since from the mayor. But the party
leader also said, "It's not just about a phone call. It's about issues."
</P>
<P>
	   "I would think he's more comfortable with the Liberal Party endorsement,"
the Conservative Party leader added.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Giuliani has routinely run for mayor with Liberal Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   Long has said that the only way Giuliani could win Conservative Party
backing in his Senate bid would be to give up Liberal Party support and come out
in favor of a ban on what critics call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, like Mrs. Clinton, is an abortion rights supporter. He is also a
supporter of gay rights and tough gun control rules, two positions that put him
at odds with many Conservative Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a whole host of issues that the mayor possibly might be different
on," Long said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conservative Party leader said some New York Republicans have tried to
arrange talks between he and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   "The phone calls I've gotten have been that they want to put meetings
together," Long said. "No one has ever said, 'The mayor wants to have a
meeting."'
</P>
<P>
	   Long said that neither state GOP Chairman William Powers nor Gov. George
Pataki, both Giuliani backers who are close to Long, has attempted to intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Long has said he has other possible Senate candidates waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton have been courting leaders of the state's
Independence Party, the New York arm of the Ross Perot-inspired Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, unlike most states, major party candidates can run on several
ballot lines and the votes for them on all lines are then added together to
determine the election winner.

<HEADLINE> Police officers march in support for officer killed in crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) - Hundreds of police officers and firefighters
marched down Main Street this morning to honor a sergeant killed when his car
crashed during a high-speed chase.
<P>
	   Led by a somber drum corps, the hearse carrying the body of Sgt. George
Dingwall was flanked by fellow officers, their badges covered in black tape.
</P>
<P>
	   Town residents, many with tears in their eyes, lined the street for the
brief parade to a memorial service for Dingwall, who died Friday while pursuing
two burglary suspects on Route 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall's widow, Kim, and their two children watched the procession from
the second floor of the police station.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Carta was among the residents paying tribute. The restaurant owner said
Dingwall had responded to alarms at his business.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was always there with a smile and a wave, just everything you'd want a
police officer to be," Carta said. "It's just such a sad thing he had to go like
this."
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, about 80 officers marched with Mrs. Dingwall to Superior Court to
watch the arraignment of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a tremendous show of unity. We wanted to show support for Kim, and
we wanted to demonstrate a sign of unity to the perpetrators there," said Capt.
Michael Custer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant Browne, 36, was ordered held on $2.5 million bond. Victor Santiago,
38, was held on $1 million bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Both New Haven men have been charged in the attempted burglary of a
Middletown house, but police said more charges, such as vehicular homicide,
could come out of a state police investigation of the crash that killed
Dingwall.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingwall, 47, was to be buried later today at a cemetery in Manchester,
where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne was restrained with Dingwall's handcuffs during the brief proceeding
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne and Santiago said nothing at the brief court appearance and they
averted their eyes from the sea of police officers that crowded the courtroom.
Bail was set high because of the suspects' lengthy criminal records, the bail
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were arrested in Branford following a chase down Route 9 and onto
Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Police apparently interrupted a burglary at a Middletown home, Custer said.
While police were at the back of the house, the burglars escaped through the
front door and drove away.
</P>
<P>
	   Three police officers gave chase, with Dingwall the supervisor of the chase.
As the chase went onto Route 9, Dingwall radioed into police headquarters that
the road was dry and clear of snow, and that traffic was light, Custer said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't need permission because he was the road supervisor. He was in
compliance with policy," Custer said. "It was his call."
</P>
<P>
	   Everything seemed to be proceeding normally until about 18 miles later in
Essex, when Dingwall's car went off the road and crashed, killing him.
</P>
<P>
	   State police are investigating whether Dingwall lost control of the car, was
rammed or was forced off the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne and Santiago were arrested about 25 miles later in Branford, when
state police used spikes to stop the car. Both men were held in separate cells
in a prison in Suffield.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspects were found with three items police believe were stolen from the
house Friday: a high school class ring and two television remote controls.
</P>

as the Federal Reserve begins a two-day session on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy in an effort to
slow the economy and prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   There is cause for celebration, however. Today, the first day of February,
marks the 107th straight month of expansion for the U.S. economy, the longest

<HEADLINE> Demonstrations start outside Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hundreds of chanting protesters received a heartfelt
thanks from Amadou Diallo's parents as the trial of the four police officers who
shot the young immigrant began.
<P>
	   Demonstrators endured cold temperatures and snow flurries Monday to kick off
protests outside the trial, chanting "Amadou, we love you" and counting out the
41 bullets fired at him. The demonstrators vowed that the trial's relocation
from New York City to Albany would not deter them from shedding a spotlight on
racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
	   The racially charged case was moved to the state capital by an appeals court
that said publicity and protests would make it impossible for a fair trial in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted them to know that if they wouldn't bring the trial to the Bronx,
the Bronx would come to the trial," the Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd, about
half who took buses up from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was killed in a barrage of 41 bullets
fired by the officers as they searched a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, a dozen city and state police officers and more than a dozen
reporters and television news crew members were penned in front of the
courthouse. There, a lone demonstrator shouted his protests of organized
religion, apparently unrelated to the trial underway indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings said there were no surprises in Monday's
protest.
</P>
<P>
	   "It went very well, with proper planning," Jennings said today outside the
courthouse in 24-degree temperatures. "We'll make our judgments (on further
police staffing) based on the needs of each day."
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, buses left the city before sunrise and traveled through the
remains of a winter storm that dumped 10 inches of snow on Albany. As flurries
lingered through the morning, demonstrators marched in circles on a snow-slicked
city park opposite the courthouse. Albany police estimate that about 400
demonstrators were on scene Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Raphael of Manhattan said the effort was important because it signals
that the trial was being watched closely.
</P>
<P>
	   Florence Middleton of Harlem agreed, saying: 'It could have been any one of
us, anybody."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's parents addressed the crowd during the trial's lunch break,
expressing sorrow over their son's violent death, but thanking the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a victim of injustice," Kadiatou Diallo said of her eldest child.
"We have to make sure we are here for him."
</P>
<P>
	   A door painted with 41 bullet holes and the silhouette of a man served as a
vivid reminder of Diallo's death. And a number of protesters said they feared
Albany will become "Simi Valley II," a reference to the California court venue
that led to acquittals of police officers accused of brutality in the Rodney
King case.
</P>
<P>
	   But the protesters said they were determined to make their case peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   "You represent a young man who had dignity, who stood for peace" Sharpton
told the crowd. "And we are not going to mar his name."
</P>
<P>
	   Neal Curry, of the Capital Region Justice for Diallo Committee, said there
would be other rallies on key dates throughout the trial. Sharpton said busloads
of New York City protesters would return when opening arguments begin.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 7; Nasdaq Is Up 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were little changed today as the Federal Reserve
began its two-day meeting in Washington. Many investors decided to wait for the
Fed's decision on raising interest rates before taking major new positions.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 7.30 at 10,947.83.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 1.77 at 1,392.69, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.79 at
3,942.14.
</P>
<P>
	   Central bankers are widely expected to raise short-term interest rates in a
continuing effort to slow the pace of the nation's economic growth. As of today,
the U.S. economy set a record for the longest expansion ever -- 107 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has defied many analysts' expectations by maintaining a torrid
rate of growth without significant inflation. The Fed raised interest rates
three times in 1999 to keep inflation under control, and many economists believe
the central bank will continue to raise rates because of the economy's
unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of
borrowing money. That makes it difficult for many companies, especially the
high-growth technology businesses prized by investors in 1999, to finance
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Hewlett-Packard fell 1 3/4 to 106 1/2. JDS Uniphase, a high-flying
Nasdaq stock, was down 6 1/4 to 197 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues barely outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, where volume came to 119.50 million shares, slightly ahead of Monday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.15 to 496.08.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.4 percent and France's CAC-40 was up 1.9
percent, rebounding from heavy losses on Monday. Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
0.02 percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge limits scope of reporters' appearance before grand jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - Two Long Island news organizations said today
they will appeal a state Supreme Court judge's order requiring two reporters to
appear before a grand jury.
<P>
	   "We are going to file with the appellate division this afternoon," said
Carolyn Schurr Levin, Newsday's vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Suffolk County District Attorney James Catterson Jr. subpoenaed
Newsday's Elizabeth Moore and News12's Scott Feldman to testify before a grand
jury probing corruption allegations at the Suffolk Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the lawyer who represented both Newsday and the News12 cable TV
news channel before state Supreme Court Judge John J.J. Jones Jr. said he was
pleased that the judge ordered narrow restrictions on the questions the
reporters may be asked, but held open the option of an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that it is inappropriate for a district attorney to
bring reporters before a grand jury," attorney David Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Shield Law limits the circumstances under which reporters can be
called to testify about information gathered while on assignment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling Monday, the judge said the district attorney's office would be
limited to asking the News12 reporter to authenticate a videotaped interview
with Sheriff Patrick Mahoney and to attest to its accuracy. Similarly, questions
to the Newsday reporter would be limited to the authenticity and accuracy of her
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered the reporters to appear before the grand jury on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin said the subpoena could compromise the reporters' independence and
harm their relations with news sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "Putting any reporter into a secret grand jury potentially harms what they
do," she said Monday. "It no longer makes them an impartial observer."
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson's yearlong investigation is believed to focus on allegations of
improper political activity in Mahoney's department, including allegations that
deputies and correction officers were required to make political donations to
the sheriff in exchange for promotions or plum assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson and Mahoney are longtime foes; Mahoney claims the district
attorney has abused his power by threatening opponents with grand jury
investigations, a charge Catterson denies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit India, Bangladesh  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will visit India and Bangladesh in March
but has not decided whether he also will stop in Pakistan, India's archrival,
White House officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the first presidential visit to India in 22 years, since Jimmy
Carter's trip in 1978, and the first ever to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton had been planning to visit both India and Pakistan earlier but
reversed course after both countries set off nuclear explosions in 1998.
Planning for the trip resumed last year but then was derailed when Pakistan's
elected government was ousted in October by a military coup led by General
Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
	   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy, asked if Clinton might add
Pakistan to his itinerary, said, ``No decisions have been made about other
stops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to see significant movement on terrorism, on nonproliferation and
the restoration of democracy'' in Pakistan, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton would travel to South Asia during the week of March 20 for
about a week.

<HEADLINE> Lott Cautions China on Trade Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China must be on best behavior and President Clinton must
garner the support of Democrats if Congress is to approve a major trade deal
with China this year, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got to be realistic,'' Lott said about the vote expected later this
year on granting permanent normal trade status to China. ``It can be done, but
China is going to have to watch its conduct and the president is going to have
to weigh in aggressively with the Democratic leadership who are being pushed
very strongly by labor not to do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott was addressing a gathering of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which
strongly supports giving China permanent trade status as part of a deal to allow
China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think this is in the nation's interest and at the very top of the list
of items to get done this year,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of
the Chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's annual decision to extend normal trade relations with China
is always a tough sell in Congress, and making that status permanent ``is going
to be delicate and it's going to take a lot of work,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese, he said, ``are very susceptible to doing things that could
cause this to blow up.'' Lott mentioned China's alleged weapons sales to North
Korea and countries such as Iran and Iraq, it's threats toward Taiwan and its
human rights violations and religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese Embassy in Washington in turn on Monday accused Congress of
insensitivity in taking up legislation to expand U.S. military ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott, who is joining other Republican leaders at a meeting with Clinton
today, said he would raise the China issue and ask him ``are you willing to get
behind us?''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton last week promised an all-out mobilization to pass the China trade
bill, and said Commerce Secretary William Daley would be the administration
point man in pushing for the deal worked out with China last November that would
open China's markets in exchange for giving China a seat in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said Congress is also not happy with the WTO, which held a tumultuous
and largely unsuccessful meeting in Seattle last year. ``So far the TWO is not
doing a really wonderful job in terms of what they are deciding or how it is
being enforced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott also sought White House help in resolving differences between the House
and Senate on bills that would promote trade with sub-Saharan Africa. The
measure passed by the Senate combines the Africa trade bill with legislation to
open up trade with Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said Congress will also take up legislation this year that would look
at how the United States applies sanctions on other nations. The business
community in particular has been critical of unilateral sanctions used to punish
other countries, saying they are counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott said the president needs more flexibility and that sanctions have been
allowed ``to become very cumbersome and abusive in a way that's not positive.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Director Defends Investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George J. Tenet today defended his conduct in
an internal investigation into whether a predecessor mishandled large volumes of
secret material. Tenet insisted a full investigation had been conducted and
``decisive action'' taken to improve the agency's security process.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet, who was a deputy when John Deutch was director, reacted to a story in
today's New York Times, which cited a 1999 report by the CIA inspector general
suggesting agency officials had restrained the probe of Deutch.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Tenet confirmed the existence of the internal report but
said it did ``not conclude that anyone intentionally impeded the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Times story quoted Tenet as saying he had given directions for the
investigation to proceed unimpeded. The story did not accuse Tenet or his aides
of violating any laws in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA, at the inspector general's recommendation, has established a panel
to examine whether Tenet and other top officials handled the Deutch case
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the internal inquiry, completed last August, Deutch was
stripped of his security clearance, an unusual move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I made the tough decision to suspend the security clearances of my former
boss and predecessor,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch probe began in December 1996, when he was leaving office. CIA
computer security officials found that he had placed classified material on his
unsecured home computers, a violation of agency rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA report said, however, that an inquiry by security officials was
shelved within a few months and that the CIA failed to notify the Justice
Department about the case for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general notified the Justice Department of the situation in
early 1998, the Times reported, after a CIA employee complained that the case
had been improperly handled.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet learned of the alleged security breach almost immediately but failed
to act until the Justice Department had been notified and the inspector
general's office had completed its report on CIA handling of the case, the story
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department reviewed the case and decided in April not to
prosecute Deutch, who issued an apology in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the inspector general uncovered evidence that he or other CIA officials
had deliberately sought to stall the internal investigation, ``he would have had
an obligation to refer the matter to the Justice Department,'' Tenet said. ``He
did not do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question,
`Can the CIA police itself?' The answer is that we can and we did,'' Tenet said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect asks chief state's attorney to take over investigation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The lawyer for the only suspect police have
publicly identified in the slaying of a Yale University student has asked the
chief state's attorney to take over the investigation.
<P>
	   David Grudberg said his client, former Yale lecturer James Van de Velde, has
been unfairly targeted by New Haven police probing the slaying of 21-year-old
Suzanne Jovin.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Chief State's Attorney John Bailey, Grudberg said he believes
New Haven police can no longer be objective. He asked Bailey to assign the
investigation to his office's cold case squad.
</P>
<P>
	   Grudberg said Monday he would not comment on his request until the chief
state's attorney had decided whether to grant it. But Bailey said he doesn't
have the authority to take the case away from New Haven State's Attorney Michael
Dearington's office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I plan to talk with Mike about it, but until they say they want us to do
something, it's their case," Bailey said. "They have done a lot of work on it
and are still working on it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jovin was killed Dec. 4, 1998, suffering 17 stab wounds in the back and
neck. Her body was found in the upscale East Rock neighborhood not far from
campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors reported hearing shouting, as though a couple were arguing,
minutes before the body was discovered, but police say there were no witnesses
to the brutal slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, police said Van de Velde - Jovin's senior thesis advisor - was
in a "pool of suspects." No other suspects have been identified. No arrests have
been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Van de Velde has maintained his innocence and has accused police of ruining
his life by naming him as a suspect. Yale officials didn't renew Van de Velde's
contract. He left New Haven last summer to live on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have asked Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee, a forensics expert,
to perform a reconstruction of the murder. They also are waiting for test
results on cat hairs found on Jovin's clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said Monday he has not set a date for the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The cold case squad was formed last year to review old cases by using new
techniques, such as DNA testing, to re-examine evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   It was DNA testing, as well as fingerprint work, that led the cold case
squad to charge Edward L. Grant Jr. of Waterbury with the murder of Concetta
"Penney" Serra. The 21-year-old dental assistant was found stabbed to death in a
New Haven garage in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant has pleaded innocent and is awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Chaplain Controversy Hits House GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What started as a simple quest to replace a retiring
chaplain in the House has turned into a political tempest after Republican
leaders snubbed a Catholic priest for the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the party's leaders are worried that accusations of an ``anti-Catholic
bias'' could hurt GOP candidates next fall with a crucial voting bloc -- members
of the largest religious denomination in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominee for the $138,000-a-year position, Rev. Charles Wright, a
Presbyterian minister, was selected by Republican leaders over the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, a Catholic priest and the top choice of a bipartisan committee of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright has spent the last week meeting with lawmakers in hopes of gaining
support. Democratic Rep. Tony Hall of Ohio, a close friend, made an unusual
appearance before the House GOP Conference last week on Wright's behalf, and
Wright has been invited to attend a GOP retreat this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, despite the overtures, many Catholics are crying foul, and Democrats
have refused to invite Wright to their retreat, also this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has a stink to it,'' said William Donahue, president of the
350,000-member Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. ``What they want
to do is keep the chaplain post in Protestant hands. There is a residue of
anti-Catholicism embedded in the evangelical community. It shows up more often
than some people want to admit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats, treading lightly for the most part on the bias allegation, have
discussed trying to change the selection process and other measures to register
a protest when the House votes on Wright's appointment, likely later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's founders made provisions during the First Continental Congress
in 1774 to have a chaplain. Over time, that desire has evolved into full-time
jobs for clerics, one each in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one in 1832 but
he was on the job only a year. The current House chaplain, James David Ford, a
Lutheran, is retiring after 21 years. His retirement had been scheduled for
January but is on hold while Republicans try to quell the controversy over his
successor.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute erupted after an 18-member bipartisan selection committee last
October forwarded three finalists to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, Majority
Leader Dick Armey and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Those finalists -- Wright, O'Brien and the Rev. Robert Dvorak, an
Episcopalian -- were not ranked, said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., who co-chaired
the selection panel. But it was made known to the three House leaders that
O'Brien was the panel's top choice, with a score of 14.5, compared with 10.5 for
Dvorak and 9.5 for Wright, Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, both sides concede, the decision was Hastert's, and the speaker
chose Wright.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The speaker put in place a process to find a consensus candidate and in
the end, backed away from the process to back a candidate predominantly
supported by Republicans,'' Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has Republicans concerned about relations with the nation's 30
million Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a realization that the swing vote is the Catholic vote,'' said
John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. ``We are concerned that some people might
try to politicize the office of the chaplain in order to gain a partisan
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert invited Cardinal Francis George of Chicago to join him at last
week's State of the Union address. And House Republicans passed a resolution
today honoring the contributions of Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution passed by a voice vote but not before some Democrats debated
its motive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to question the timing of this first ever pro-Catholic
resolution,'' said Rep. Jerry Klecka, D-Wisc. and a Catholic. ``Let's see if
that pro-Catholic feeling continues to exist when the House has before it the
issue on electing the first . . . Catholic chaplain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Wright nor O'Brien responded to recent requests for interviews.
O'Brien told The Associated Press in December, ``I am convinced that if I were a
mainline Protestant minister and not a Catholic priest, I would be the
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Critics have pounced upon the interview process, noting that at one point
Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., asked O'Brien whether his collar would be seen as
divisive. The current chaplain, Ford, also wears a collar.
</P>
<P>
	   Pomeroy, who attended the interviews, said he saw no ``anti-Catholic''
sentiment in any of the questioning. ``I am not one that suggests there was a
bias against a particular denomination that resulted in the selection,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jury weighs fate of man retried for 1973 murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A jury on Tuesday weighed the fate of a man put
on trial for a second time for bludgeoning and strangling a Philadelphia
businessman in 1973.
<P>
	   John Duval, 47, a former transvestite prostitute, was freed last spring on
the basis of new evidence after serving 25 years in prison for the murder of
Timothy Haworth, who left his hotel the night of May 24, 1973, apparently in
search of a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the absence of physical evidence, Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson
were convicted on the basis of confessions they insist were beaten out of them
by a rogue detective, and on the testimony of two teen-age runaways.
</P>
<P>
	   "I submit to you that that confession was obtained through coercion,
intimidation, trickery, force and wrongful detention," defense attorney Gilda
Sharrod-Ali said in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no threats, no coercion, no beatings," countered prosecutor Joe
Curran. "Every stitch of evidence you've heard proves ... the statement was
voluntarily given."
</P>
<P>
	   After a week of testimony, deliberations got under way Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the teen witnesses, Wayne Wright, testified last Thursday that chief
Detective William Mahoney threatened to either kill him or charge him with
murder if he didn't cooperate with the police.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright straightened out his life in the mid-1980s after ratcheting up a
string of convictions for robbery and prostitution. He recanted his testimony in
1997, saying he had lied in 1973 about seeing Duval and Tyson with the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors then came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the
other teen, Jon Jackson, in which he also denied seeing Duval or Tyson with
Haworth, 52, a business consultant for Eastman Kodak Co. Neither prosecutors nor
defense lawyers had seen the interview before.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling that exculpatory evidence was wrongfully suppressed, a judge freed
Tyson in May 1998 and Duval last April. While prosecutors decided not to retry
Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in compensation - they went after Duval
again. While Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence, Duval had twice
admitted his guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer said Duval lied to the parole board in 1995 and in 1997 because
"he believed that was the only way he could get out."
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney, investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing suspects,
resigned in 1980 after fabricating evidence in an unrelated case. He died in
1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval's retrial does not constitute double jeopardy because he did not
establish in his appeal that there was prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his sentence, Duval had to serve a minimum of 25 years. If convicted
again of second-degree murder, he would be returned to prison. He could someday
be granted parole or spend the rest of his life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaign blasts mailings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Citing what they called a "campaign of lies and
deceit," aides to Hillary Rodham Clinton blasted fund-raising letters from
conservative groups out to stop her from becoming a senator from New York.
<P>
	   "Today, we are calling on Rudy Giuliani to disavow his arch-conservative
allies," Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio said. "Mr. Mayor, tell your
friends in the far right to stop their campaign of lies and deceit."
</P>
<P>
	   "If these are the mayor's allies, what kind of senator will he be?" de
Blasio said. "Whose interests will he represent?"
</P>
<P>
	   A top campaign aide to the New York City mayor, the first lady's expected
Senate opponent, said the offensive from the Clinton camp was "a typical tactic
of their campaign" meant to "deflect attention away from the fact that they got
caught in a $1 million lie."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aide Bruce Teitelbaum's comment referred to Clinton's first
campaign financial report showing she had raised just over $6.8 million during
the last six months of last year and received more than $1.1 million in
additional money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Clinton camp had boasted of raising $8 million to Giuliani's $8.8
million, Teitelbaum said the DSCC money shouldn't be considered part of that
equation. The Clinton camp said it should be and that the money was her share of
money raised in joint events with the DSCC.
</P>
<P>
	   In what is expected to be one of the most heated Senate races in the nation
this year, the Clinton campaign went on the attack Tuesday after the latest
report on conservative groups using Clinton's expected Senate campaign to raise
money nationwide appeared in the New York Daily News. The News said at least
seven conservative groups have launched direct-mail, fund-raising appeals
targeting anti-Hillary Clinton prospective donors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton team, in its attempt to appeal to New York's moderate voters,
has also taken Giuliani to task for direct-mail appeals of his own to
conservatives across the country in.
</P>
<P>
	   A sampling of the letters from the conservative groups was made available
Tuesday by Clinton aides.
</P>
<P>
	   One letter from the American Conservative Union warned that Clinton's goal
was to become "America's first feminist president" and that she was "far more
liberal and corrupt than her husband."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter, to "274,456 carefully selected conservatives across America,"
seeks to raise $7 million to finance a "Truth About Hillary" ad campaign to run
in newspapers across the state. The ad claims that "corruption and scandal
follow Hillary as sure as night follows day."
</P>
<P>
	   Another letter, from the White Plains-based ConserveAmerica, states that
"Mrs. Clinton is an ultra-liberal, carpet-bagging opportunist who wishes to use
our state as a stepping stone back to the White House as a candidate for
president in 2004." The letter describes Hillary Clinton and President Clinton
as "two charlatans."
</P>
<P>
	   A letter from U.S. Rep. Sue Kelly on behalf of Conservatives for Effective
Leadership says "there isn't a neo-socialist cause she won't shove down our
throats" with her "radical liberal agenda." The congresswoman from suburban
Westchester County where the Clintons recently purchased a $1.7 million house
also warns that Clinton would be "a dagger in the heart of any conservative
idea" to come before Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the claims in the letters, de Blasio said Clinton was really "a New
Democrat who supports balanced budgets, targeted tax cuts and welfare reform."

<HEADLINE> Making Sure New Boeing 737 Works  </HEADLINE>
    By GEORGE TIBBITS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABOARD SOUTHWEST AIRLINES N759GS (AP) -- Five miles or so above ground,
Capt. Christine Hollop's hands dance over the controls as she deals with another
of the dozens of carefully orchestrated emergencies aboard the Boeing 737-700
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just lost the engine," remarks Capt. Brent Hedgpeth, sitting next to her
in the compact cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   As the pilot in command on the jet's third-ever flight, he had
matter-of-factly ordered the engine shut down, along with the lowering of the
landing gear. The plane shudders until the wheels are raised again. The engine
is re-lit.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's something an airline company would never see unless they lost the
left engine after takeoff," Hedgpeth says.
</P>
<P>
	   On a rainy winter day, Hedgpeth, 52, Boeing Co.'s chief pilot for production
flight test, and Hollop, 32, one of the company's 15 other production test
pilots, are methodically checking that a brand-new Southwest Airlines 737 does
everything that's advertised, and for which the airline paid roughly $45
million. It's the final step in the months-long process of building and
delivering a commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
	   They pivot the airplane through the sky, rock it back and forth, speed up,
slow down. They throttle back and raise the nose until the aircraft warns it's
in danger of falling from the sky. They purge the cabin of pressure until the
oxygen masks start to drop.
</P>
<P>
	   "We identify things that don't meet the standards -- things we call
'squawks,"' Hedgpeth says.
</P>
<P>
	   During their two-hour flight, the two pilots, along with systems officer
George Kegebein and flight analyst Terry Bigger, perform 84 tests, checking out
electrical, hydraulic, climate, engine and flight control systems, and making
sure the instruments are accurate.
</P>
<P>
	   The flight takes them from Boeing Field south of Seattle into the sunshine
of eastern Oregon, north to central Washington and the former bomber base at
Moses Lake that Boeing uses as a test field, then back to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Beforehand, Hollop gives the aircraft a close inspection. She finds the
first of the day's two squawks: an inspection window the size of a quarter that
was accidentally painted over.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be fixed before Southwest takes delivery a week later, as will the
other problem, a stuck windshield air vent. Boeing guarantees a 100 percent
trouble-free flight before every plane is handed over to a customer, who often
make flights of their own before accepting an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Hedgpeth, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, and Hollop, who learned
how to fly after she joined Boeing a decade ago and now is a certified
instructor, have done hundreds of such test flights.
</P>
<P>
	   As they run through their list, alarms fire off, warning lights glare and
recorded voices shout.
</P>
<P>
	   "Too low! Gear! Too low! Gear!" an anxious electronic voice nags during a
pass of the Moses Lake field, telling them to make sure the landing gear is down
properly. A few minutes later, the same voice pipes up in a test of the ground
proximity warning system: "Don't sink! Don't sink!"
</P>
<P>
	   "If something goes wrong we have to evaluate that and get enough information
as we can" so ground crews can fix the problem before the plane flies again,
Hedgpeth says.
</P>
<P>
	   The 149-passenger plane can fly quite well on just one of its two engines.
Much more dramatic is the stall test, losing lift on the wings until the "stick
shaker" begins vibrating the steering column and speed warnings activate.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cabin, Bigger is looking out windows to check the wings, testing
lights and oxygen masks, working restroom faucets and flushing toilets, and
checking the storage bins in the no-frills airline's minimal galley.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to make sure the attendants can get all the peanuts out," he jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   It's bumpy flying back to Seattle over the Cascade Mountains through the
rain clouds. "Keep your eyes on the windscreen and you'll see lots of St. Elmo's
fire," Hollop says, pointing to the static electricity discharges that crackle
and glow on the plane's outer skin.
</P>
<P>
	   The city emerges from the mist, checklists are completed, and the plane sets
down at Boeing Field. One more test to go.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an eye-opening maneuver -- you'll really enjoy it," Hedgpeth promises.
</P>
<P>
	   After coming to a dead stop on the runway, he and Hollop floor the engines
-- like drag racing in a machine weighing some 50 tons. Once past 100 mph, they
yank the throttles to idle, slam on the brakes and hang on. That's called a
rejected takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   As the half-dozen passengers on the flight return to a full, upright
position, Hedgpeth smiles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, that worked well," he says.

<HEADLINE> 12 picked for jury in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - They moved the trial 150 miles north of the Bronx,
but attorneys in the Amadou Diallo murder case still wound up with three jurors
linked to the borough as jury selection neared completion Tuesday.
<P>
	   Twelve jurors, including a forewoman who once resided in the Bronx, were
seated by the afternoon in the second day of the selection process. Four
alternates remained to be picked, with a possibility that the trial could begin
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the dozen people seated, four were African-American, including the
forewoman, and three had ties to the borough where Diallo, an African immigrant,
was fatally shot by four white police officers on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying was immediately cited by NYPD critics as an egregious example of
police brutality, although the defendants - who intend to testify - claim it was
a tragic accident. Diallo, who was unarmed, refused to halt and appeared to be
reaching for a gun, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a white man whose parents once lived in the Bronx was added to
the panel, along with a black woman who often visits relatives in the borough.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time, the race of the jurors was brought up by a defense
attorney in open court during questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time to talk about race," defense attorney Stephen Worth said at one
point. "We're all worried about it on the defense side."
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing a black woman with a grown daughter, Worth inquired, "Let me ask
you as the mother of a 21-year-old black female, maybe do you say to yourself,
'That could have been my daughter?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it will impact how I could listen to the case," replied the
woman, who was seated on the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The 22-year-old Diallo was hit 19 times in a hail of 41 bullets in the
vestibule of his Bronx home. The case was moved to Albany after an appeals court
ruled that pre-trial publicity made it impossible to find an impartial New York
City jury.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, a pool of nearly 2,000 potential jurors was called to the
courthouse. The screening process, particularly for such a high-profile case,
moved quite quickly despite allegations by both sides that the other was
challenging jurors based on race.
</P>
<P>
	   According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was
about 39 percent and the white population of Albany County about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted in March. They opened fire on Diallo,
a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a pager, while searching his
neighborhood for violent criminals.

<HEADLINE> Bradley first on Democratic ballot; Keyes holds No. 1 slot for GOP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - While New Hampshire residents voted in the first
presidential primary of 2000 on Tuesday, Connecticut's secretary of the state
drew lots to determine the order on the March 7 ballot.
<P>
	   Bill Bradley tops Al Gore on the Democratic primary ballot. Alan Keyes and
Gary Bauer take the top two slots on the GOP ballot, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Following on the GOP list are George W. Bush, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch.
John McCain's name was picked last by Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch, who quit the race last week, will be on the ballot because he never
officially notified the state of his withdrawal, Bysiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't believe the positioning of names has made much of a difference to
voters," Bysiewicz said. "The person who has the top spot doesn't necessarily
win the primary."
</P>
<P>
	   Except for New Hampshire, all New England states hold their primaries March
7. So do California, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, New York and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Only registered Democrats and Republicans can vote in the Connecticut
primaries. Unaffiliated voters have until noon on March 6 to register with a
party, Bysiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's too late for voters to jump from one party to another - that
deadline was Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut usually has a 20 to 40 percent voter turnout rate in
presidential primaries, Bysiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the March 1996 primary, there was a 28.4 percent GOP turnout. There was
no Democratic primary because Bill Clinton ran unopposed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because both the Democrats and Republicans have had lively debates this
year, that should create more interest and higher turnout," Bysiewicz said. "And
not having an incumbent also tends to get more people involved."

<HEADLINE> GM Won't Spin Off Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to issue $15 billion in new
shares of the stock that tracks the performance of its Hughes Electronics unit
in a bid to increase the value of GM shares, and denied it intends to spin off
the high-flying Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it will offer its shareholders $8 billion in Hughes tracking
stock in return for their regular GM shares. GM will also contribute $7 billion
of Hughes' stock to trust funds for retiree benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions enable GM to realize $15 billion of the value of Hughes, and
improve GM's financial flexibility to pursue business and growth initiatives in
our automotive and financial services businesses," GM's chairman, Jack Smith,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' tracking stock reflects its financial performance, but does not
represent any ownership stake in the company, which will remain a wholly owned
subsidiary of GM.
</P>
<P>
	   The move will reduce the number of GM shares on the market, driving up GM's
earnings per share. The transaction will also reduce GM's hoard of Hughes stock
from 68 percent to 35 percent, or about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts had been expecting some kind of move from GM on its
Hughes stock for months, as Hughes enjoyed a strong run in a market hungry for
technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The former defense electronics specialist has become a leader in the
satellite television business; its DirecTV service has 8 million subscribers.
Hughes is also building a $1.4 billion wireless data network called Spaceway
that it expects to unveil in 2003. The system will be marketed to home users and
businesses to transmit data directly to other Spaceway users.
</P>
<P>
	   While GM has not been shy about selling or spinning off businesses, company
leaders say they have no such plans for Hughes. GM has been looking at ways to
squeeze more profits out of each vehicle by selling services such as Internet
access, its OnStar security system or satellite radio -- all of which require
expertise in wireless and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
	   GM shares rose more than 2 percent, rising $1.75 to $82.31 1/2 a share
Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, where GM's Hughes' shares
were down 25 cents at $112.25.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Handling of Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA director George Tenet insisted Tuesday he took
``decisive action'' when faced with an investigation's finding that former
director John Deutch violated security by working on secret material at home.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision to strip his former boss of his security clearances proved that
he acted properly, Tenet said. He denied that the investigation was deliberately
delayed, despite a CIA inquiry that suggested he and other top agency officials
acted to slow down the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the classified August 1999 report by the CIA's inspector general
were reported Tuesday by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Tenet confirmed existence of the inspector general's report
but said he had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done, decisive action
was taken, and steps have been implemented to improve our security process,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look
into the handling of the case. The panel still is at work, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that while the internal investigation may not have proceeded as
quickly as some would have liked, action was taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch's access to
classified information. Deutch violated agency rules by keeping secret files on
an unsecured computer at his home, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter comes against a backdrop of the government's prosecution of Wen
Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, on charges of
mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving
classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Lee, who was not
charged with espionage, is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are able to work on
classified material at home, but stringent safeguards are in place involving
their computers, including lockable hard drives, safes for depositing laptops
when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet with secure
computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday for an annual
report on world threats, and the issue of security could come up.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public
service, was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When leaving his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that
secrets were properly protected. They found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999 the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Deutch but
recommended that the CIA review his continued suitability to hold high-level
security clearances. Justice concluded Deutch's security lapses were reckless
rather than criminal. Deutch apologized for his lapses.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report ``did not conclude that anyone intentionally
impeded the investigation,'' said Tenet, Deutch's former deputy. ``Had the IG
any information to that effect, he would have had an obligation to refer the
matter to the Justice Department. He did not do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Times story quoted Tenet as saying he had given directions for the
investigation to proceed unimpeded. The story did not accuse Tenet or his aides
of violating laws in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question,
`Can the CIA police itself?' The answer is that we can, and we did,'' Tenet
said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors say church rivalry at center of arson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Federal prosecutors say they can prove that the
burning of a Utica church in 1997 was no accident and that it was ordered by a
rival clergyman.
<P>
	   The blaze at Believers Miracle Deliverance Church was an attempt to drive
out the competition, according to a federal prosecutor's court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   Two members of St. Mark's Healing and Deliverance Church are on trial this
week in U.S. District Court on charges of setting the fire. Joseph Brown, 22,
and Jimmy Jackson, 31, both of Utica, are each accused of conspiring to commit
arson as a means of destroying property used in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers filed before the trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr
said the evidence showed Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Roger Perkins were
involved in setting the fire at the request of Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr. of St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley, 65, is listed in a grand jury indictment as an unindicted
coconspirator. Prosecutors have given no explanation why Ashley has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Perkins, 19, who also is listed as an unindicted coconspirator, told
investigators Ashley was angry with Pastor Willie Jewel Steele for starting the
new church, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steele, who once shared a ministry with Ashley, said she was surprised to
learn of Ashley's alleged involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   "How can we lead people to the Lord on one hand, then on the other hand be
the devil's advocate?" Steele said. She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Savage's lawyer said his client is innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't set this fire. The government thinks it knows who set this fire,
and they think they know who put him up to it. And neither one of those people
is on trial," Menkin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, Carr said Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Steele for starting the rival
church, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "During the course of the dinner, Ashley says that he wouldn't be sorry if
Steele's church went up in smoke," the court papers said. "After dinner, he
insists that Perkins drive by the church. Ashley points out how easy it would be
... for Perkins to gain entry into the church and burn it down."
</P>
<P>
	   Later that night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins met
with Savage, Brown and Jackson, who is described in court papers as the musical
director of St. Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins forced open
the church door and Savage poured gasoline on the floor and doors leading to the
church sanctuary, Carr wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire was ignited, the four men went to a woman's home, called
Steele and told her that her church was on fire, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, prior to jury selection, U.S. District Judge Frederick Scullin
dismissed the charges against Henry Savage at the request of Carr. The
prosecutor made the motion rather than continuing to fight a defense request to
prevent Denise Savage from testifying against her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Scullin said prosecutors could try to indict Henry Savage again at a later
date.

<HEADLINE> AIDS May Date Back to 1930  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The worldwide AIDS epidemic has been traced back to a
single viral ancestor -- the HIV Eve -- that emerged perhaps around 1930.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier research had suggested that the epidemic began in the first half of
the 20th century, but the latest analysis, done at the Los Alamos National Lab
in New Mexico, appears to be the most definitive so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Bette Korber, who keeps a database of HIV genetic information at the lab,
calculated HIV's family tree by looking at the rate the virus mutates over time.
She assumed these genetic changes happen at a constant rate, and using a
supercomputer she clocked the mutations back through time to a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
	   Korber estimates that the current epidemic goes back to one or a small group
of infected humans around 1930, though this ancestor virus could have emerged as
early as 1910 or as late as 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   From this single source, she suggests, came the virus that now infects
roughly 40 million people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "This offers a small piece in a larger puzzle concerning the origins of
HIV," she said. Her findings were released at a scientific conference this week
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe that HIV's ancestor is a virus that ordinarily infects
chimpanzees. Somehow it spread to people -- perhaps through a bite or hunting
mishap -- in west equatorial Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Just when this happened, though, is still a mystery, Korber said. The leap
from chimp to man could have been around 1930. Or it may have occurred much
earlier and the virus stayed within a small group of humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The work challenges a theory that AIDS actually began in the 1950s, when HIV
was accidentally mixed with the polio vaccine. In last year's book "The River,"
Edward Hooper theorizes that HIV contaminated batches of the vaccine that were
grown in chimp tissue. This then spread when the vaccine was tested in the
Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Korber said this is highly unlikely, since it would require the introduction
of at least 10 genetically separate strains of the virus into the vaccine from
different chimps.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Expansion Hits Record  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion, which for more than a
year has been the country's longest peacetime expansion, now holds the all-time
record, in war and peace.
</P>
<P>
	   As of today, the current expansion has lasted 107 months, one month longer
than the previous record-holder, the 1960s expansion that covered the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton celebrated the news in a meeting with congressional
leaders at the White House, saying that the expansion "was earned by the
American people" through hard work and innovation.
</P>
<P>
	   Acknowledging that the election season will produce a "fast-paced
congressional year," Clinton nonetheless asked the lawmakers to work with him to
"deepen and improve" the nation's economic success.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think if we work together, we can get a lot done," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, flanking
Clinton in the Cabinet Room, appeared to counter predictions that gridlock would
prevail on Capitol Hill this year. The Republican leaders said they saw room for
compromise on saving Social Security, debt reduction, investing in
underprivileged areas, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am enthusiastic about this session and looking forward to working with
the White House," Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
	   And on that point, private economists lend support -- the current expansion
has been truly remarkable, not just in length but in terms of its ability to
remain robust, despite its advancing years, and without triggering rising
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight years and 11 months of uninterrupted growth since the last
recession is in itself quite a feat considering that the average of all U.S.
expansions, dating back to 1854, is just 35 months, not long enough to celebrate
a third birthday, let alone a ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unprecedented economy," said David Wyss, chief economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. "If you are not cheering for this accomplishment, then
you have awfully high standards."
</P>
<P>
	   By most measures, these are good economic times. Unemployment is at its
lowest level in 30 years -- 4.1 percent -- consumer confidence is at record
highs and Wall Street keeps hitting record highs.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past three years, the total economy, as measured by the gross
domestic product, has expanded by 4 percent or more annually, a pace that
normally would trigger fears that the dwindling supply of workers would begin to
demand inflationary wage increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, inflation has remained well-behaved. The so-called core rate of
inflation, which takes out volatile energy and food products, was up just 1.9
percent in 1999, the best performance in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton takes every opportunity to cite the soundness of the Clinton-Gore
deficit reduction program as a key building block for the good economy, hoping
voters will reward Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are quick to note that the current recovery actually started
nearly two years before Clinton took office, when Republican George Bush was
president. Some Republicans go back even further, dating the current good times
to the supply-side tax cuts of Ronald Reagan, saying there has been only one,
brief recession since the Reagan expansion started in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's misfortune, however, was that while the last recession only lasted
eight months, from July 1990 until March 1991, the recovery in the early days
was dubbed the "jobless recovery" because it was exceptionally sluggish,
allowing Clinton to make the weak economy a key campaign issue in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists generally give most of the credit for the current good
economic times to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his sure-handed
handling of interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan has already engineered one soft landing -- raising interest rates
seven times in 1994 and early 1995 to slow things down and keep inflation under
control. And he is now attempting a second soft landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last June, the Fed has raised rates three times and it is expected to
announced a fourth rate increase at the end of this week's two days of meetings
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is growing so fast that even the Federal Reserve hasn't been
able to slow it down and that's why they will be raising rates again," said
Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists, in fact, are looking for as many as three more rate increases
before summer, bringing the total number of credit tightening moves to seven in
one year. Normally, a string of Fed rate hikes would bring worries that the
central bank was in danger of overdoing the slowdown and could end up with a
recession.
</P>
<P>
	   But analysts believe this time will be different because the absence of
inflation pressures means the central bank has been correct in letting the
economy run at a faster rate than previously thought possible.

<HEADLINE> CNH Global To Cut 7,000 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- CNH Global NV, the farm and construction equipment
company created by last year's acquisition of Case Corp. by New Holland NV,
plans to reduce its worldwide work force by about 20 percent -- 7,000 jobs -- by
2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had previously said it would seek to achieve $400 million to
$500 million in annual savings over the next three to four years as a result of
the combination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands-based company will close 10 plants and 15 warehouses
worldwide by 2002, said spokesman Bill Masterson.
</P>
<P>
	   "Case and New Holland do a lot of the same functions," Masterson said.
"Since we have like products there is opportunity to combine functions."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, CNH reported a fourth-quarter loss, before restructuring, of $32
million, or 21 cents per share. It said that compared to a net loss, before
restructuring, of $3 million, or 2 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $2 billion, a 66 percent increase
from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results include full operations of New Holland and about
seven weeks of operations from the Racine-based Case, which was acquired last
November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger of New Holland and Case in the fourth quarter created a company
with geographic and product line balance, and global size and scope, that is
unmatched in our industry. We have begun the actions that will enable us to
realize the tremendous cost savings that have been identified," said Jean-Pierre
Rosso, CNH chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   CNH said it anticipates somewhat higher production during the first quarter
of 2000 but a loss is expected during that period in part because of the impact
of merger integration expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   CNH has 46 plants in 16 countries around the world, including in North
America, Europe and Latin America. Its products are sold in 160 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign shares of CNH fell 18 3/4 cents to $13.68 3/4 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Growing Pains for Small Cap Managers  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Money managers who oversee mutual funds that focus
primarily on small companies are facing growing pains.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem stems from small stocks that don't stay small very long.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the almost hysterical demand among investors for shares of technology
companies, many small tech stocks are being transformed almost overnight into
large stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   That explosive growth means small stock fund managers have to sell the
shares of rapidly growing companies once the stocks no longer fit the stated
goal of a small-capitalization sector fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The dynamic is frustrating to small-cap fund investors, who are essentially
being punished for getting in too early on a successful stock.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, investors get hurt because funds are required to pay taxes on
stocks that are sold, and those costs are paid by fund shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also frustrating to fund managers, who hate being forced to sell their
most successful companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "It breaks our hearts," said Phil Fine, a co-manager of Boston-based Loomis
Sayles' Small-Cap Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "I heard another fund manager say these companies stop for a cup of coffee
in small-cap territory then they move on, and that's the truth. A lot of great
names that used to fall into the small-cap category have moved quickly up to mid
and large-cap status."
</P>
<P>
	   Take SDLInc., a fiber-optics company that less than a year ago had a market
capitalization of around $850 million, well below the $1.5 billion ceiling
established for the small-cap category.
</P>
<P>
	   Market capitalization refers to a company's stock price multiplied by the
number of shares the company has issued.
</P>
<P>
	   So when SDL Inc.'s stock was trading at around $23.75, the company had a
market capitalization of $850 million because SDL has issued 35.7 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the stock started soaring in 1999, climbing as high as $288.50
recently, the value of the company surged past $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   When that happened small-cap fund managers like Fine had to sell the stock
because it no longer fit the criteria established for small-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Fine said he replaced SDL in his portfolio with another fiber optics
company, Netoptics Corp., which has a market capitalization of around $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to replace high-flying tech stocks was brought about by shifting
investor priorities, Fine observed.
</P>
<P>
	   Whereas investors once sought so-called value stocks, or overlooked stocks
that can be bought cheap, investors are now willing to pay a lot for a
technology stock in the hope that the stock will soar even higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Actively managed funds have more discretion in choosing when to sell fast
moving stocks since most managed sector funds generally require that only about
65 percent of a given portfolio fit the established criteria. Managers have more
flexibility with the other 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Small-cap index funds are another matter, however. The stocks included in
index funds must conform to the sector the fund is tracking. So when a stock
outgrows the small-cap category it has to be sold quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Even John Bogle, generally regarded as the father of modern index fund
investing, said he never could have predicted an investment environment that
puts such a premium on technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't foresee these things," he said. "I should have seen it. I'm paid
to see these things."
</P>
<P>
	   Bogle said small-cap index fund managers will have to change the way they
formulate small-cap funds to take into account the surging growth rates of tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fine said the bright side of the problem -- at least for active managers
-- is that it keeps them on their toes, always in search of the next big trend.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good to refresh the portfolio. You've got to get new blood in there,"
he said.

	   Construction Spending Surges
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending surged 2 percent in
December, pushing the amount of money spent on single-family homes
to a monthly record. Good weather helped the rise. The Commerce
Department reported today that spending was at a record annual rate
of $730.3 billion. That followed a revised 2 percent increase in
November. December's performance was much stronger than many
analysts expected. They had predicted that construction would fall
by 0.3 percent in December. For the year, construction spending
rose 6 percent, following an increase of 7.6 percent in 1998.

in December, a manufacturers' group said in a report that also
raised inflation worries. The report from the National Association
of Purchasing Management also contained a worrying jump in the

the debate over interest rates. But as the Federal Reserve began
its two-day meeting in Washington, many investors were trading
cautiously. Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 56.47 at 10,997.00. Broader stock indicators were
also higher, with the Nasdaq composite index up 58.18 at 3,998.53.
After slumping for much of the morning, stocks rose on a growing
sense that despite rising interest rates, which can cut into
corporate profits, most U.S. companies will post strong earnings
growth throughout the year.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines lost $353.4 million during
1999, with most of the shortfall due to a fourth-quarter loss that
grew sharply from a year earlier. The company said it was still
suffering from the effects of labor uncertainty last spring and
summer. TWA's losses, announced yesterday, mean the carrier hasn't
turned an annual profit since 1988. Its 1999 loss came to $5.58 per
share, and compared with a deficit of $120.5 million, or $2.35 per
share, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chaplain Controversy Hits House GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An uproar over the choice of a Presbyterian minister
instead of a Catholic priest to be the new chaplain of the House of
Representatives flared anew Tuesday as Republicans pushed a resolution honoring
Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats openly questioned GOP motives during floor debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to question the timing of this first ever pro-Catholic
resolution,'' said Rep. Jerry Kleczka, D-Wis., and a Catholic. ``If the people
who are bringing this resolution forward are so pro-Catholic, let's see if that
pro-Catholic feeling continues to exist'' when the House votes later this month
on a new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said there was no connection between
the scheduling of the Catholic schools resolution and the continuing chaplain
controversy. Armey accused Democrats of fueling the brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are some people who think they've got a hot political issue and
they're going to press that point. It's kind of a shame,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominee for the $138,000-a-year position, Rev. Charles Wright, a
Presbyterian minister, was selected by Republican leaders over the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, a Catholic priest and the top choice of a bipartisan committee of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have threatened to offer a substitute resolution in favor of
O'Brien, scrap the entire selection or revamp the selection process for the
future when the House votes on Wright's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the selection of Wright last November by Speaker Dennis Hastert and
Armey, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights has asserted there was
an ``anti-Catholic bias'' in the choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has a stink to it,'' said William Donahue, president of the
350,000-member league. ``What they want to do is keep the chaplain post in
Protestant hands. There is a residue of anti-Catholicism embedded in the
evangelical community. It shows up more often than some people want to admit.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few Democratic lawmakers have echoed the charge. Republicans have
vehemently denied it.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, GOP leaders are worried that the accusations could hurt
Republican candidates next fall with a crucial voting bloc -- members of the
largest religious denomination in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a realization that the swing vote is the Catholic vote,'' said
John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. ``We are concerned that some people might
try to politicize the office of the chaplain in order to gain a partisan
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wright has spent the last week meeting with lawmakers in hopes of gaining
support. Democratic Rep. Tony Hall of Ohio, a close friend, made an unusual
appearance before the House GOP Conference last week on Wright's behalf, and
Wright has been invited to attend a GOP retreat this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one in 1832 but
he was on the job only a year. The current House chaplain, James David Ford, a
Lutheran, is retiring after 21 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute erupted after an 18-member bipartisan selection committee last
October forwarded the names of three finalists to Hastert, Armey and Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Those finalists -- Wright, O'Brien and the Rev. Robert Dvorak, an
Episcopalian -- were not ranked, said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., who co-chaired
the selection panel. But it was made known to the three House leaders that
O'Brien got more support than Wright or Dvorak, Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, both sides concede, the decision was Hastert's, and the speaker
chose Wright.

<HEADLINE> Cohen OKs Training on Gays Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, the nation's military services have
written guidelines to ensure that the Pentagon's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy on gays is implemented fairly and uniformly.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday he has approved new training
programs for each of the services, including guidelines for investigating
harassment or threats against individuals based on allegations of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
	   As a matter of policy, commanders are not to use complaints of such
harassment or threats as a reason to investigate the complaining person but is
supposed to investigate the source of the threat or harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These plans make it very clear ... that there is no room for harassment or
threats in the military,'' Cohen said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon also announced Tuesday the number of discharges from the
military in the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30 fell to 1,034 from 1,145 in the
year-earlier period. Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 83.5 percent of discharges
resulted from statements by service members that they were homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Clinton administration's policy, gays may serve in the military as
long as they keep their sexual orientation to themselves. If they state that
they are homosexual, they are supposed to be removed from the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen instructed the services to develop new training guidelines last
December amid widening criticism that administration policy on gays in the
military was not working. The criticism sharpened after a court-martial in which
an Army private was convicted of murdering a gay soldier harassed with the
knowledge of his superiors. President Clinton called the Pentagon's
implementation of the administration policy ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also asked each of the service's top civilian and uniformed leaders to
issue statements to their troops reinforcing the policy against harassment of
gays.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters and the Air
Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael Ryan, said, ``Harassment, threats or ridicule
of individuals or groups based upon their real or perceived differences,
including sexual orientation, have no place in the United States Air Force and
will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Army's statement said, ``We expect commanders at every level to take
appropriate action to prevent harassment of or threats against any member of our
Army.''

<HEADLINE> Chaplain Controversy Hits House GOP  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An uproar over the choice of a Presbyterian minister
instead of a Catholic priest to be the new chaplain of the House of
Representatives flared anew Tuesday as Republicans pushed a resolution honoring
Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats openly questioned GOP motives during floor debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One could ask, why is this being done? We have had Catholic School Week
celebrated in this country for years and years,'' said Rep. Jerry Kleczka,
D-Wis. ``I hope that same level of pro-Catholicism exists when the House later
this month has before it the appointment of a chaplain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said there was no connection between
the scheduling of the Catholic schools resolution and the continuing chaplain
controversy. Armey accused Democrats of fueling the brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are some people who think they've got a hot political issue and
they're going to press that point. It's kind of a shame,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominee for the $138,000-a-year position, Rev. Charles Wright, a
Presbyterian minister, was selected by Republican leaders over the Rev. Timothy
O'Brien, a Catholic priest and the top choice of a bipartisan committee of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have threatened to offer a substitute resolution in favor of
O'Brien, scrap the entire selection or revamp the selection process for the
future when the House votes on Wright's nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the selection of Wright last November by Speaker Dennis Hastert and
Armey, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights has asserted there was
an ``anti-Catholic bias'' in the choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has a stink to it,'' said William Donahue, president of the
350,000-member league. ``What they want to do is keep the chaplain post in
Protestant hands. There is a residue of anti-Catholicism embedded in the
evangelical community. It shows up more often than some people want to admit.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few Democratic lawmakers have echoed the charge. Republicans have
vehemently denied it.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, GOP leaders are worried that the accusations could hurt
Republican candidates next fall with a crucial voting bloc -- members of the
largest religious denomination in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a realization that the swing vote is the Catholic vote,'' said
John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. ``We are concerned that some people might
try to politicize the office of the chaplain in order to gain a partisan
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wright has spent the last week meeting with lawmakers in hopes of gaining
support. Democratic Rep. Tony Hall of Ohio, a close friend, made an unusual
appearance before the House GOP Conference last week on Wright's behalf, and
Wright has been invited to attend a GOP retreat this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has never had a Catholic chaplain; the Senate had one in 1832 but
he was on the job only a year. The current House chaplain, James David Ford, a
Lutheran, is retiring after 21 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute erupted after an 18-member bipartisan selection committee last
October forwarded the names of three finalists to Hastert, Armey and Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   Those finalists -- Wright, O'Brien and the Rev. Robert Dvorak, an
Episcopalian -- were not ranked, said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., who co-chaired
the selection panel. But it was made known to the three House leaders that
O'Brien got more support than Wright or Dvorak, Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, both sides concede, the decision was Hastert's, and the speaker
chose Wright.

<HEADLINE> Chicken Deaths Could Boost Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Grocery shoppers could notice a slight increase in
the price of chicken following a southern snowstorm that collapsed hundreds of
poultry barns and decimated flocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's chicken supply could be reduced by as many as 30 million birds
through this spring, said Richard Lobb, spokesman for the Washington-based
National Chicken Council. The loss would represent less than 1 percent of the
nation's flock of nearly 8 billion chickens.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect it will lead to some tightening of supply and potentially some
impact on price," Lobb said.
</P>
<P>
	   With high production and strong demand, poultry prices have been somewhat
depressed, Lobb said Tuesday. "So if you take production off, that price will
almost certainly be impacted."
</P>
<P>
	   A poultry specialist said prices should not rise substantially.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers will probably barely notice the difference -- there might be a
cent or two higher price," said Frank Jones, a University of Arkansas liason to
the poultry industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of chickens were killed or left in the cold when roofs buckled
under the weight of as much as a foot of snow last week in southern Arkansas,
eastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   The losses are multiplied because the poultry houses will be out of
production for several months, Lobb said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicken barns typically are long and low, with large open spaces housing
thousands birds under one roof. A new building, equipped with computer-operated
environmental controls, can cost as much as $120,000, according to the Farm
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the losses were sustained by growers for Springdale, Ark.-based
Tyson Foods, Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra and Pittsburg, Texas-based Pilgrims
Pride, Lobb said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry producer, said it lost about 275
of the 6,500 chicken houses used by its contract farmers in Arkansas, killing or
destroying the barns of more than 1 million birds.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time we've ever had this many houses damaged," said Tyson
spokesman Ed Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson plans to make up for the shortfall, in part, by cycling more chickens
through the barns that weren't destroyed. Typically, growers have a two-week
break between flocks, but that will be reduced, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilgrims Pride lost about 200 chickens barns in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas
-- about 10 percent of its buildings in that area, said company vice chairman
Cliff Butler.
</P>
<P>
	   "These weather calamities always have caused prices to increase in the past,
primarily in the wholesale sector," Butler said. "It's possible that consumers
could see prices rise."
</P>
<P>
	   Poultry companies said they would bear the cost of the lost chickens, and
insurers likely would cover most of the cost of rebuilding. But farmers will
lose the income they normally would receive for flocks during the time it takes
to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee declared disasters in 17 Arkansas counties,
which, if approved by the federal government, could make farmers eligible for
low-interest loans similar to what farmers can receive after a drought or a
flood devastates a crop.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 42.90; Nasdaq Up 55.05  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher today as investors bought
beaten-down shares of companies that have faltered during the latest debate over
interest rates. But as the Federal Reserve began its two-day meeting in
Washington, many investors were trading cautiously.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 42.90 at 10,983.43.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 5.06 at 1,399.52, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 55.05 at
3,995.40.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping for much of the morning, stocks rose amid a growing sense
that despite rising interest rates, which can cut into corporate profits, most
U.S. companies will post strong earnings growth throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings story continues to come in very strong across the board," said
Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private client group. The
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 have posted average profit growth of 20.9
percent for the fourth quarter of 1999, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said strong earnings were helping to distract investors from concerns
that interest rates are headed sharply higher in a continuing effort to slow the
pace of the nation's economic growth. As of today, the U.S. economy set a record
for the longest expansion ever -- 107 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has defied many analysts' expectations by maintaining a torrid
rate of growth without significant inflation. The Fed raised interest rates
three times in 1999 to keep inflation under control, and many economists believe
the central bank will continue to raise rates because of the economy's
unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest suggestion that higher rates are on the way came today from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said in its monthly survey
that manufacturing activity is continuing to grow and the price of raw materials
is escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of
borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "When interest rates are rising, you look to companies that are accelerating
their sales growth enough to compensate," Wolfe said. "Last year, technology was
the sector that was able to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, technology stocks gained ground as investors bet that they can repeat
their strong performance in 2000. Cisco Systems rose 4 7/16 to 113 15/16,
Qualcomm gained 7 3/4 to 134 3/4 and Amazon.com rose 2 7/8 to 67 7/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong corporate earnings in more traditional companies once again provided
some spark to the market. Tricon Global Restaurants, which operates the Pizza
Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, rose 2 1/4 to 30 7/8 after saying it expects to
substantially exceed analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's strongest gains came from General Motors, up 4 1/4 at 84 13/16,
and WalMart, up 4 1/16 at 58 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnstone Systems made a powerful debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market today,
opening at 90 after being priced at 29 per share. In late afternoon trading,
shares rose to 94 5/8. Turnstone makes products that allow local telephone
companies to put in and maintain digital subscriber lines quickly to allow their
customers broader data access.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 759.24 million shares, well ahead of
Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.76 to 499.99.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices gained Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade
in a small correction to the previous day's 3 percent slide. Grains also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean traders said the recovery showed that Monday's steep decline may
have been a slight overreaction to the heavy rains that improved crop prospects
in South America.

the Nos. 2 and 3 world soybean producers -- kept soybeans' increase limited.

underpinned the market.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Study: Danger of Oral Sex High  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oral sex, long regarded by many gay men as a low-risk
practice, appears to be a surprisingly frequent way of spreading AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   A study released Tuesday found that oral sex was probably the cause of 8
percent of recent HIV infections among a group of homosexual men examined in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, there have been occasional reports of people apparently
catching HIV orally. But health investigators have had difficulty being certain,
since gay men who have oral sex also may engage in other, riskier sex practices,
such as anal intercourse.
</P>
<P>
	   Now diagnostic tests allow doctors to narrow down the timing of HIV
infections. They were used in the latest study, described as the most definitive
on the subject to date.
</P>
<P>
	   The work was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the University of California at San Francisco, and was presented in San
Francisco at a scientific conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "While oral sex may still be safer than anal intercourse or vaginal
intercourse, it is not without risk and perhaps has higher risk than we would
have expected otherwise," said Dr. Helene Gayle, the CDC's AIDS chief.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers sought to learn the means of infection in 102 gay and
bisexual men who had recently caught HIV. When all other possible means of
infection were ruled out, oral sex turned out to be the only risk behavior in
eight of these men. Most of them said they thought oral sex had little or no
risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the strict criteria used, the real number of cases resulting from
oral sex may actually have been higher. For instance, two men said they had oral
sex but not anal sex. But they also said they had blacked out once and could not
be sure what had happened, so they were excluded from the total.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the men apparently caught the virus by giving oral sex, rather than
receiving it, and none used condoms.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know that the only safe sex is total abstinence or sex with a mutually
monogamous, non-HIV-infected partner," Gayle said. "Everything else has some
degree of risk. The sense that oral sex is safe sex may have been an unfortunate
message."
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle said she assumes that the risk of oral sex when properly using a
condom is close to zero. She also said that if oral sex alone has played a large
role in the spread of AIDS, that would already have become obvious during the 20
years of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, noted that some gay men turned to frequent unprotected oral sex after
giving up anal intercourse.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of us in the public health field have been saying all along to be
careful of unprotected fellatio," he said. "People think the risk is low, but
what's low?"
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Frederick M. Hecht of San Francisco General Hospital, a co-author of the
study, said anal intercourse may be 100 times riskier than oral sex. "The
message is not that everyone will get infected through oral sex," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of declines in unprotected anal intercourse, there has been a big
reduction in high-risk exposure, Hecht said, but there is still plenty of
low-risk exposure through oral sex without condoms, "and that low risk adds up."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1.2B For Indian Country  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to ask Congress for $1.2 billion
in new spending on American Indian programs, including hundreds of millions more
to build schools, hire police and improve health care on reservations, a White
House aide says.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the Indian spending initiative in his State of the Union
address last week, but did not include specifics. That plan, to be included next
week in Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, includes new or expanded Indian programs
in nearly every federal agency, said Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on
Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking
about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, a day after
she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas..
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the proposal include $300 million to build at least six new
reservation schools, $650 million for housing programs, a $117 million increase
for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health
Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main
agency funding tribal governments, was not as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's anything to have a party over because the needs in
Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to
head the BIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler acknowledged that Clinton's proposal fell short of meeting the needs
of American Indians, who face far higher rates of poverty, unemployment and
other social problems than the country as a whole. She said the $1.2 billion
plan is the largest increase in Indian funding ever proposed, and anything more
would face stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the
estimated $4 billion backlog of repairs needed for highways through Indian
Country, Cutler acknowledged. An Interior Department report last year
recommended repairing or replacing 170 BIA schools at a total cost of $1.2
billion, far more than the six schools that would be replaced under Clinton's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know half a dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's
a drop,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31
tribal colleges, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be released Wednesday says tribal colleges, which serve 26,000
students in 12 states, have created jobs and helped increase education levels on
the reservations where they operate. The report from the Institute for Higher
Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median
incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster
between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Other details of Clinton's proposal, according to Cutler, include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program to draw companies to
reservation areas.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Handling of Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA director George Tenet insisted Tuesday he took
``decisive action'' when faced with an investigation's finding that former
director John Deutch violated security by working on secret material at home.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision to strip his former boss of his security clearances proved that
he acted properly, Tenet said. He denied that the investigation was deliberately
delayed, despite a CIA inquiry that suggested he and other top agency officials
acted to slow down the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the classified August 1999 report by the CIA's inspector general
were reported Tuesday by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Tenet confirmed existence of the inspector general's report
but said he had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done, decisive action
was taken, and steps have been implemented to improve our security process,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look
into the handling of the case. The panel still is at work, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that while the internal investigation may not have proceeded as
quickly as some would have liked, action was taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch's access to
classified information. Deutch violated agency rules by keeping secret files on
an unsecured computer at his home, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter comes against a backdrop of the government's prosecution of Wen
Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, on charges of
mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving
classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Lee, who was not
charged with espionage, is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are able to work on
classified material at home, but stringent safeguards are in place involving
their computers, including lockable hard drives, safes for depositing laptops
when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet with secure
computers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy praised
Tenet for taking ``strong, decisive and unprecedented action'' in the Deutch
matter. Leavy also said he sees no parallels to Lee's case, and no double
standard at work in the treatment of a top-ranking intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision to punish Mr. Deutch was unprecedented,'' Leavy said during
the regular White House briefing for reporters. ``He had his security clearance
revoked. That is quite punitive for a former director of the Central
Intelligence Agency. ''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday for an annual
report on world threats, and the issue of security could come up.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public
service, was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When leaving his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that
secrets were properly protected. They found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999 the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Deutch but
recommended that the CIA review his continued suitability to hold high-level
security clearances. Justice concluded Deutch's security lapses were reckless
rather than criminal. Deutch apologized for his lapses.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's report ``did not conclude that anyone intentionally
impeded the investigation,'' said Tenet, Deutch's former deputy. ``Had the IG
any information to that effect, he would have had an obligation to refer the
matter to the Justice Department. He did not do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Times story quoted Tenet as saying he had given directions for the
investigation to proceed unimpeded. The story did not accuse Tenet or his aides
of violating laws in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question,
`Can the CIA police itself?' The answer is that we can, and we did,'' Tenet
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Report Mixed Sales  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers turned in a mixed performance for
January sales, with General Motors Corp. showing a strong gain, Ford Motor Co.
seeing a modest increase and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG posting
a decline.
</P>
<P>
	   With several foreign automakers reporting gains, overall sales appeared to
be staying strong after hitting an all-time record for 1999 with 16.9 million
vehicles, despite winter storms that hurt January sales in some parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said its U.S. sales of cars and light trucks were up 12 percent overall,
with an 18 percent increase in truck sales and a 6.5 percent increase in car
sales over January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those gains came from mainstays whose production had been slowed
while new versions were rolled out, like the Chevrolet Suburban sport utility
vehicle and the Cadillac DeVille sedan. GM's results do not include sales from
its Saab unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said GM also benefitted from
comparison to a weak January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But GM said even taking that into account, its performance was still good.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're off to a brisk beginning, and we think the industry is off to a brisk
beginning," said Paul Ballew, GM's director of industry analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at Ford were up 3 percent, thanks to a 15 percent gain in cars that
outweighed a 3 percent decline in trucks. Ford's results do not include sales
from the Volvo or Jaguar lines that it owns.
</P>
<P>
	   The decline in truck sales was led by the Ranger pickup, but also hit most
of the company's SUVs -- the Ford Explorer and Excursion and the Lincoln
Navigator. Healy said some of the decline was likely due to new truck models
from GM, Dodge and other automakers luring customers from Ford's aging lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their bread-and-butter light truck lines have been out there a while and
are getting hurt by the competition," Healy said.
</P>
<P>
	   While some of Ford's gains in cars came from new models -- the restyled Ford
Taurus/Mercury Sable sedans, the Focus compact and the Lincoln LS -- the biggest
gains were posted by two models that Ford plans to discontinue, the Ford
Contour/Mercury Mystique sedans. Healy said Ford might be trying to clear out
its lots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly you don't have customers lining up around the block to buy
semi-obsolete models unless there are rebate or fleet deals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles were down 6 percent overall, with
cars and trucks each down 6 percent. Much of the decline could be traced to the
Plymouth line, which Chrysler is phasing out. Other results were mixed; while
minivan sales ticked up, sales of some pickups and Dodge and Jeep SUVs fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing
operations, said the company's results suffered due to comparisons with
blockbuster results from a year ago. Jameson also said winter storms in the
Northeast hit Chrysler hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Other automakers who posted results Tuesday include Honda, which said its
U.S. sales were up 3 percent thanks to strong demand for its Odyssey minivan.
Volkswagen said its sales were up 48 percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Surgery May Aid Cancer Survivors  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Young women with breast cancer associated with two genetic
mutations may live years longer by having their healthy breast and their ovaries
removed, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was an analysis of women with gene mutations known as BRCA1 and
BRCA2, which were identified a few years ago and are known to raise the risk of
breast cancer so much that some women with the flaws have had their breast and
ovaries removed before any sign of disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, led by Dr. Deborah Schrag and published in Wednesday's Journal of
the American Medical Association, is a follow-up to a statistical analysis she
and colleagues at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute did estimating the benefits
of such pre-emptive surgery for healthy women. Schrag, a cancer specialist, is
now at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study, also based on a statistical analysis rather than on real
patients, looks at women in early stages of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   It does not advocate surgery. It notes that some women may be more concerned
with sexual and reproductive function and self-image than with gaining a few
years in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
	   "For others, taking maximum steps to reduce the risk of a terrifying outcome
such as ovarian cancer may result in a psychological benefit that outweighs even
a very small survival benefit," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings are designed to ease the decisions faced by women who carry the
mutations.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 5 percent and 10 percent of the estimated 175,000 cases of breast
cancer diagnosed annually are linked to the mutations, according to the American
Cancer Society. Many women don't discover they carry the mutations until they
have been diagnosed with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic, said there is
very little hard data on the benefits of preventive surgery for such women.
</P>
<P>
	   "We definitely need some guidance in women who've already had a first cancer
and I think this begins to open that discussion," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because women who carry the mutations have a high risk of developing breast
and ovarian cancer, some healthy women have chosen to have their breasts or
ovaries removed just in case. Ovary removal may help guard against breast cancer
because it curbs production of estrogen, which encourages tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
	   A University of Pennsylvania study published last year found that healthy
BRCA1 women who had had their ovaries removed could reduce the breast cancer
risk by about 70 percent. But ovary removal induces menopause, which could put
young women at risk for early development of brittle bones and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Schrag estimates that women already diagnosed with BRCA-linked breast cancer
are two to eight times more likely to develop cancer in the opposite breast than
women with non-genetic breast cancer. They face similar or even higher risks for
developing ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors estimated that women first diagnosed with genetically-linked
breast cancer at age 30 who undergo removal of their ovaries and opposite breast
and take the cancer drug tamoxifen for five years would see the most gains in
life expectancy -- between 1.1 and 4.4 years. For women who choose removal of
the second breast only, the range in gains was estimated at 0.9 to 2.1 years.
The gain was put at 0.2 to 1.8 years for ovary removal alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Those whose first cancer had spread to adjacent lymph nodes and those first
diagnosed at age 50 or older could expect significantly lower gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Schrag stressed that the numbers are only estimates and that many women
could live much longer depending on numerous individual factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Women diagnosed with breast cancer, including those with the gene mutations,
generally have a good prognosis if their disease is caught early, Schrag said,
"and that makes it all the more important that you think ahead about how to
prevent problems down the road."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visiting India, Bangladesh  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid tense times between India and Pakistan, the White
House announced Tuesday that President Clinton will travel to India next month
but left unanswered questions about whether he will visit its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   The India trip is the first by a U.S. president in 22 years. The visit,
complicated by alliances that have shifted since the end of the Cold War, comes
despite India's pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going because it's the biggest democracy in the world, and I think we
haven't been working with them enough,'' Clinton said. ``We have an enormous
common interest in shaping the future with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton were to visit India and not Pakistan, it would be symbolize
Pakistan's faltering relationship with Washington. Diplomatic ties were strained
by last summer's fighting along the Kashmir border with India and October's
military coup that ousted a democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials, who said Clinton would also visit neighboring
Bangladesh, stopped short of ruling out going to Pakistan. That raised the
possibility that a presidential visit could be used to entice Islamabad to take
a tougher stand against terrorists and begin restoring democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to characterize it like that,'' said David Leavy, spokesman
for the National Security Council. ``We have made clear our concerns more
broadly, and we continue to engage the Pakistanis, and if that affects the trip
we'll let you know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen P. Cohen, a former State Department official who is now a South Asia
specialist at The Brookings Institution, said there were ``compelling reasons''
for Clinton to go to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan can create problems both for the president and for India, should
it want to,'' he said. ``Whatever moderate groups are in Pakistan, you don't
want to alienate them.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Cohen, who lamented that U.S. presidents have ignored India since Jimmy
Carter traveled there in 1978, said Clinton shouldn't expect to have much of an
effect on India-Pakistan relations in the twilight of his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton has said on several occasions that he wanted to do something about
India-Pakistan relations,'' Cohen noted. ``It's probably seven years too late to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and Pakistan were allied during the Cold War and
cooperated to support the Afghan rebels fighting Soviet forces in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. officials have been critical of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program
and the military coup last October. They also have pressured Islamabad to use
its influence to combat terrorism, particularly with the Taliban now in control
of Afghanistan, from where Osama bin Laden has allegedly been directing strikes
against American targets. The United States contends bin Laden runs an
international terrorist network that bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in 1998, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pakistanis want to renew close ties at a time when they face a weakening
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But even a brief Clinton visit could raise questions about why a U.S.
president was visiting military leaders who had supplanted democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the Pakistanis can demonstrate some visible progress towards
recivilization and towards cleaning up other aspects of Pakistan, then I don't
think the embarrassment would be that great,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   India, a nation of 1 billion, had frosty relations with the United States
during the Cold War. The United States, Japan and Europe imposed economic
sanctions on both Pakistan and India after the two tested nuclear weapons in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But the international climate is changing and the world's two largest
democracies have been exploring common ground. Clinton and Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee were in almost daily contact by telephone when India and
Pakistan were engaged in heavy fighting in the Himalayan mountains of Kashmir
last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president views strong Indian relations as essential to our own
interests, the interests of the American people,'' Leavy said. ``They have an
important role to play in the future, not only in terms of strategic interests
but also the environment, health, improved trade and investment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton likened his overtures toward India to his policy of engagement with
China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just as I believe we have to engage China that has a political system very
different from ours, we have to engage India,'' Clinton said. ``I think it's
unfortunate that the United States has been estranged -- or, if not estranged,
at least it's had a distant relationship with the Indians -- for too long.''

<HEADLINE> Quaker 4Q Earns Meet Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Riding high on Gatorade sales, Quaker Oats Co. on Tuesday
reported a modest profit gain in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The food company said that including one-time items such as restructuring
charges, it earned $59 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $73.2
million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, fourth-quarter earnings were $45.5 million, or 33
cents a share, up from $45 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. That
matched the estimate from analysts surveyed by First Call-Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter totaled $949.1 million, down 1.5 percent from $963.3
million a year earlier, the company said. Quaker said that excluding 1998 sales
from now-divested businesses and exchange rate differences, sales were up 2
percent year-over-year.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon, shares of Quaker Oats were trading at $55.75, down $3.62
1/2 or about 6 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker's steady transformation from a cereal maker to a company increasingly
dependent on Gatorade paid off in a 7 percent increase in 1999 worldwide sales
for the beverage, while food sales edged up 1 percent. Gatorade accounted for
nearly 40 percent of the company's overall sales.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income totaled $455 million, or $3.23 a share, up from
$284.5 million, or $1.97 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, earnings were $393.8 million, or $2.80 a share, in
1999, compared with $334.4 million, or $2.32 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales fell 2.3 percent to $4.73 billion from $4.84 billion in 1998. The
company said that excluding foreign exchange differentials, sales in 1999 were
about even with 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Chicago-based company sacrificed some short-term earnings
by increasing its marketing budget to try to boost future sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a very good year for the company," said analyst Nomi Ghez of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. "The fourth quarter could have been much stronger if they
didn't choose to significantly increase marketing spending."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Gatorade, Quaker Oats' major brands include Quaker cereals
and snacks, Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima mixes and syrup. About 75 percent of its
sales are in the United States, where it holds about two-thirds of the market
for hot cereals and more than 80 percent for sports drinks.

<HEADLINE> Cohen OKs Training on Gays Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, the nation's military services have
issued written guidelines to ensure that troops who complain of anti-gay threats
or harassment are not themselves investigated.
</P>
<P>
	   The intent is to allow such complaints to be aired without fear of being
drummed out of the service for being homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday the new guidelines on how to
investigate anti-gay threats are incorporated in updated training programs
designed to ensure that the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy on gays is enforced fairly and uniformly throughout the services.
</P>
<P>
	   As a matter of policy, commanders are not to use complaints of anti-gay
harassment or threats as a reason to investigate the complaining person. Instead
the commanders are supposed to investigate the source of the threat or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These plans make it very clear ... that there is no room for harassment or
threats in the military,'' Cohen said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Service members need to understand that harassment for any reason will not
be tolerated, and commanders will take prompt, appropriate actions against
individuals involved in such behavior,'' Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon also announced Tuesday the number of discharges from the
military in the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30 fell to 1,034 from 1,145 in the
year-earlier period. Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 83.5 percent of discharges
resulted from statements by service members that they were homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the administration's policy, gays may serve in the military as long as
they keep their sexual orientation to themselves. If they state that they are
homosexual, they are supposed to be removed from the service.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, the first full year of ``don't ask, don't tell,'' discharges
totaled 617. They rose every year since until 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Benecke, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Fund, welcomed Cohen's approval of the training guidelines but said such
guidance should have been made available to field commanders years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're glad to see, finally, that the secretary is taking steps to train
people,'' Benecke said. She said her group has found that most service members
who declare their homosexuality, and thereby are removed from the service, do so
because they feel threatened by an anti-gay environment in their workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is needed now is for leaders to enforce the harassment guidelines
with commitment,'' Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen instructed the services to develop new training guidelines last
December amid widening criticism that administration policy on gays in the
military was not working. The criticism sharpened after a court-martial in which
an Army private was convicted of murdering a gay soldier harassed with the
knowledge of his superiors. President Clinton called the Pentagon's
implementation of the administration policy ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also asked each of the service's top civilian and uniformed leaders to
issue statements to their troops reinforcing the policy against harassment of
gays.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters and the Air
Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael Ryan, said, ``Harassment, threats or ridicule
of individuals or groups based upon their real or perceived differences,
including sexual orientation, have no place in the United States Air Force and
will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Army's statement said, ``We expect commanders at every level to take
appropriate action to prevent harassment of or threats against any member of our
Army.''

<HEADLINE> US Has 12 Mos. of Industrial Growth  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A manufacturing group warned Tuesday that "prices are
rising to levels of concern" as the nation's industrial economy grew in January
for a 12th straight month.
</P>
<P>
	   The inflation warning came as Federal Reserve policy-makers began a two-day
meeting in Washington that is expected to result in the fourth increase in
interest rates since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's figures from the National Association of Purchasing Management
confirmed that the current economic expansion -- already the longest in American
history -- is continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   But a worrying jump in the prices of raw materials -- to the highest reading
in nearly five years -- gives the Fed even more cause to raise interest rates to
cool the economy and hold inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   "The manufacturing sector appears to have momentum, but prices are rising to
levels of concern, particularly with a new round of petroleum price increases,"
said Norbert J. Ore, head of the group's business survey committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were uneasy as traders waited for the Fed's decision, but
bargain-hunting once again drove stocks broadly higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average, up 201 points Monday, gained an additional 100.52 to close Tuesday at
11,041.05.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing executives' group said that its manufacturing index, based on
a national survey of executives who buy raw materials and other supplies for
industry, registered 56.3 percent in January, down slightly from a revised 56.8
percent in December but a bit stronger than the 56 percent analysts had
expected. A reading above 50 percent indicates growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The index is watched closely because it is the first national reading for
January on U.S. industrial performance, a key sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The index component measuring prices factories pay for raw materials surged
in January to 72.6 percent from a revised 68.3 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   That reading was the highest since April 1995, when the price index hit 74.5
percent, economists for the association said. The group said 17 of 20 industries
reported higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   David Orr, chief economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.,
characterized the high price index reading as "the danger zone," noting: "The
last two times it was above 70 percent -- in 1994-95 and 1987-88 -- correlated
with aggressive Fed tightening" of credit.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Orr said he expected Federal Reserve policy-makers to raise interest
rates just a quarter of a percentage point -- not the half a point that some
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   "From a Machiavellian point of view, I think they would like to keep the
stock market off guard," Orr said. "Moving the rate a bit at a time, that keeps
the market off guard."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times last year, a quarter of a point
each time, but the economy -- and stock markets -- have remained strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary R. Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis,
said the rise in the price index reflected surging fuel costs as members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   "It hasn't spilled over to other industrial commodity prices," Thayer said.
He added that the current "competitive pricing environment" also made it
difficult for manufacturers to pass the costs through to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added: "I don't think the Fed can exclude OPEC and say we don't have
a problem and do nothing. They have to be alert to the fact that energy prices
could spill over."
</P>
<P>
	   He, too, predicted a quarter of a point rate increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending
surged 2 percent in December to an all-time high, pushing the amount of money
spent on building single-family homes to a monthly record.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said spending rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $730.3 billion. That followed a revised 2 percent increase in November,
helped out by better-than-usual weather.
</P>
<P>
	   December's performance was much stronger than many analysts expected. They
had predicted a 0.3 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, construction spending rose 6 percent, following an increase of
7.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchasing managers said that the index of new orders rose to 60.4
percent in January from 59.6 percent the month before, while the backlog of
orders increased to 52 percent from 50. The index of inventories was up to 53.4
percent from 47.8 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's report shows that new orders accelerated in January, which strongly
indicates that manufacturing is off to a healthy start in 2000," said Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He said
this, coupled with a rise in orders for exported goods, bodes well for the
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
	   The monthly survey of purchasing managers polls executives from more than
350 industrial U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures for 1999 and earlier years have been revised to reflect a
recalculation by the U.S. Department of Commerce of seasonal adjustment factors.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 100.52  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply for a second consecutive session today
as investors bought beaten-down shares of companies that have faltered during
the latest debate over interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the Federal Reserve met in Washington, many investors remained
concerned that a rate increase this week will be the first of several this year,
making it difficult for companies to sustain the strong profit growth that has
helped the market rebound from crushing losses last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.52 to close at 11,041.05, building
on its 201-point gain on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 14.82 to 1,409.28, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 111.54 to 4,051.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,699 up, 1,335 down and 494 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 974.38 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 968.15 million
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.52 to 503.75.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping for much of the morning, stocks rose amid a growing sense
that despite rising interest rates, which can cut into corporate profits, most
U.S. companies will post strong earnings growth throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings story continues to come in very strong across the board," said
Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private client group. The
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 have posted average profit growth of 20.9
percent for the fourth quarter of 1999, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said strong earnings were helping to distract investors from concerns
that interest rates are headed sharply higher in a continuing effort to slow the
pace of the nation's economic growth. As of today, the U.S. economy set a record
for the longest expansion ever -- 107 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy has defied many analysts' expectations by maintaining a torrid
rate of growth without significant inflation. The Fed raised interest rates
three times in 1999 to keep inflation under control, and many economists believe
the central bank will continue to raise rates because of the economy's
unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest suggestion that higher rates are on the way came today from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said in its monthly survey
that manufacturing activity is continuing to grow and the price of raw materials
is escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of
borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "When interest rates are rising, you look to companies that are accelerating
their sales growth enough to compensate," Wolfe said. "Last year, technology was
the sector that was able to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, technology stocks gained ground as investors bet that they can repeat
their strong performance in 2000. Cisco Systems, Qualcomm and Amazon.com all
rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the buying came from bargain-hunting investors eager to purchase
well-known technology names after many stocks in the sector fell last week, said
Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the same old culprits who were just waiting for these tech stocks to
come back to more reasonable prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong corporate earnings in more traditional companies once again provided
some spark to the market. Tricon Global Restaurants, which operates the Pizza
Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, rose after saying it expects to substantially
exceed analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's strongest gains came from General Motors and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnstone Systems made a powerful debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market, opening
at 90 after being priced at 29 per share. Turnstone makes products that allow
local telephone companies to put in and maintain digital subscriber lines
quickly to allow their customers broader data access.

<HEADLINE> AmeriServe Files for Bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc., the nation's
second-largest food service distributor, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, based in the Dallas suburb of Addison, distributes meat,
produce, beverages and other supplies to more than 30 fast-food and
casual-dining chains with about 36,000 restaurants, including Burger King, Pizza
Hut, Taco Bell and T.G.I. Friday's.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had supplied Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants until the
chains switched distributors last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company intends to carry on its operations and continue to honor its
commitments to customers," said Matthew Kleiman, a Chicago attorney representing
the company in the bankruptcy filing made Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kleiman said the company has more than 1,000 creditors and expects to be
able to make some kind of repayment to its unsecured creditors. "I can't tell
you what that distribution will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., did
not list specific asset and debt figures, but its latest quarterly report in
November listed assets of less than $2 billion and liabilities of more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how or if the company's bankruptcy filing would affect food
distribution. AmeriServe officials did not return phone calls seeking comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson Foods, Inc., a major supplier to AmeriServe's customers, said in a
statement today that the filing was "a surprise."
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson, which supplies poultry products, added that it was engaged in
conversations with its customers and AmeriServe to "assure continuity of supply
of Tyson products to their restaurants."
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe grew rapidly through acquisitions during the 1990s and benefited
from the dining-out trend among Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But by late last year, AmeriServe was in trouble. The company's net sales
had slipped below year-ago levels. The company announced it would cut 1,500
jobs, about 15 percent of its work force, and raise at least $110 million by
selling excess vehicles and closed warehouses and by reducing inventories.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Standard &AMP; Poor's put a credit watch on the company.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe had 1998 sales of $7.4 billion, a gain of 115 percent over the
previous year. But it also lost $147 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Its chief competitors include Alliant Foodservice, U.S. Foodservice and
SYSCO, which grabbed AmeriServe's best customer, the Wendy's hamburger chain, in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Holten, the chief executive, also owns 66 percent of Greenwich, Conn.-based
Holberg Industries, which in turn owns 93 percent of AmeriServe. Norwegian
consumer goods company Orkla owns the other 34 percent of Holberg Industries and
remaining 7 percent of AmeriServe.

<HEADLINE> Under Fire Codes, Capitol Closes  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Capitol and its office buildings ``probably
would be closed down'' if fire safety codes were strictly enforced, the official
responsible for Congress' health and safety testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Architect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman estimated four years of design work
and 10 additional years of construction might be needed bring the domed Capitol
in compliance with fire safety standards. Congressional office buildings could
comply sooner but not for several years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This needs to be raised to a very high level of concern,'' Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., told Hantman at a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing. ``You
are the person responsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The architect was asked to respond to conclusions by Congress' Office of
Compliance last week that the buildings were in violation of fire safety laws.
The report by Congress' health and safety enforcement unit said the lives of
lawmakers, their staffs and visitors were being jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress until 1995 exempted itself from health, safety and environmental
laws that were applied virtually everywhere else. The Congressional
Accountability Act passed that year forced lawmakers to follow those laws, but
the enforcement agency can only issue citations without financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantman said his office was hampered by the need to preserve historic
features of the Capitol, where construction began in 1793; by the inability to
evacuate buildings to undertake major construction, and the lack of a staffed
trained in fire safety issues.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been enforcing
workplace safety for three decades, the 1995 statute applying to Congress only
became effective in 1997, he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Describing problems in bringing a national treasure up to modern fire codes,
Hantman said he couldn't approve major construction that would turn the Capitol
into a maze like a ``rabbit warren.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said fire sprinklers could not be tested because they had to be connected
to each other in a zone, and his workers have not always had access to certain
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoyer asked whether Congress would ``be able to continue to operate'' its
buildings if subject to District of Columbia fire codes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We probably would be closed down,'' Hantman said, adding, ``Your concern
is my concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., pointed out that instructions for opening emergency
doors in the Rayburn House Office Building were so imprecise that even Congress'
police officers didn't know how to open them.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Police Chief Gary Abrecht said he has tried to educate his officers
at roll calls, through a video and with written instructions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You issue these people guns?'' asked Rep. Charles H. Taylor, R-N.C., the
subcommittee chairman.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Handling of Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA director George Tenet insisted Tuesday he took
``decisive action'' when faced with an investigation's finding that former
director John Deutch violated security by working on secret material at home.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision to strip his former boss of his security clearances proved that
he acted properly, Tenet said. He denied that the investigation was deliberately
delayed, despite a CIA inquiry that suggested he and other top agency officials
acted to slow down the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the classified August 1999 report by the CIA's inspector general
were reported Tuesday by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Tenet confirmed existence of the inspector general's report
but said he had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done, decisive action
was taken, and steps have been implemented to improve our security process,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said reports such as the
still-classified one by the CIA inspector general raise ``fundamental
questions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to be a pattern. I think it's very troublesome,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., chairman of a
presidentially-appointed commission which oversees intelligence issues, said he
had followed the matter from 1998 when the CIA ``very properly'' notified his
oversight panel about the inquiry into Deutch's behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tenet did exactly what he should have done'' in stripping his predecessor
of his security clearances, Rudman said. ``Did he act quickly enough? That's a
subjective matter,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look
into the handling of the case. The panel still is at work, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch's access to
classified information. Deutch violated agency rules by keeping secret files on
an unsecured computer at his home, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to congressional and administration officials familiar with the
report, Deutch deleted over a thousand files from his computer once he learned
about the investigation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, the inspector general said there was no evidence that any of
the information had fallen into the hands of a foreign power, said the
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. At the same time, it could
not be proven that there had not been such a security breach, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, Deutch used the classified material for a variety of
writing projects, the officials said. At the time, he was serving as a
consultant to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter comes against a backdrop of the government's prosecution of Wen
Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, on charges of
mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving
classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Lee, who was not
charged with espionage, is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are able to work on
classified material at home, but stringent safeguards are in place involving
their computers, including lockable hard drives, safes for depositing laptops
when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy praised
Tenet for taking ``strong, decisive and unprecedented action'' in the Deutch
matter. Leavy also said he sees no parallels to Lee's case, and no double
standard at work in the treatment of a top-ranking intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had his security clearance revoked. That is quite punitive for a former
director of the Central Intelligence Agency,'' Leavy said during the regular
White House briefing for reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday for an annual
report on world threats, and the issue of security could come up.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public
service, was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When leaving his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that
secrets were properly protected. They found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999, the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Deutch but
recommended that the CIA review his continued suitability to hold high-level
security clearances. Justice concluded Deutch's security lapses were reckless
rather than criminal. Deutch apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times story did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating laws in their
handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question,
`Can the CIA police itself?' The answer is that we can, and we did,'' Tenet
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Work on Reducing Debt  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT  AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Republican leaders of Congress
basked in the glory of the longest economic expansion in America's history
Tuesday, pledging to put aside political differences to reduce the national debt
and protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we can really get some things done,'' Clinton exclaimed. Following
suit, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said, ``There's a lot of neutral
ground that we can work with the president.'' But Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., acknowledged the obvious: ``There will be distractions and there
will be disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans said they were committed to action on administration-backed
trade bills for China, Africa and the Caribbean Basin and a $1.6 billion package
of aid for Colombia to combat illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   With Congress back in town, Clinton summoned the leaders -- Republicans and
Democrats alike -- to review prospects for legislative action in an election
year. It's a difficult time for compromise, with the two parties battling for
control of Congress and the White House. On the other hand, neither side wants
to be seen by voters as an obstruction to politically popular initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats and Republicans departed a White House meeting still at odds over
Clinton's proposal to provide a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. They
also disagree over a patients' bill of rights, gun safety legislation, raising
the minimum wage, an overhaul of campaign finance laws and how to improve
America's schools, said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So there's a lot of disagreement,'' Gephardt added.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans were sensitive to the symbolism of the moment, the first day of
the 107th consecutive month of economic growth -- a milestone for which all
sides are eager to grab credit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think the president can claim all the glory,'' Hastert said after
the meeting, talking with reporters in the driveway. He said Congress deserves a
pat on the back, too. Lott pointed out that the good times started during the
Bush presidency in the spring of 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the meeting was spent on how to move the Caribbean Basin, Africa and
China trade bills, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made a commitment to put his shoulder to the wheel to try to
get this done,'' Lott said. ``If he's not going to get in and work hard ... it's
not going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Clinton must push reluctant
Democrats to vote for permanent normal trade relations with China. ``We're going
to have to go out and find the votes,'' Armey said. ``The president understood
that was his challenge.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The consensus is that we need to schedule it as early as possible.,''
Armey added.
</P>
<P>
	   With Congress' calendar shortened by lawmakers' need to campaign, Clinton
said he was ``looking forward to working in what will be a fast-paced
congressional year.'' In particular, he mentioned proposals to pay down the
debt, prolong the solvency of Social Security and bring economic investment to
needy urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert singled out some of the same priorities. ``I think paying down the
debt is very, very important and we can do that,'' the speaker said. Clinton has
pledged to offer a blueprint that would eliminate the debt in 13 years, two
years faster than a Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking up on the remarks by Clinton and Hastert, Lott said, ``You've both
already referred to keeping a balanced budget, paying down the debt, protecting
and saving Social Security. We need to do something to continue to help improve
education in America. There are some health care areas where we've got to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said Republicans talked to Clinton about the marriage penalty tax.
The GOP is pushing a relief plan far more ambitious than Clinton's own version,
which would do little for couples in higher income brackets. ``That's an
important thing that we think we can work on,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have been pushing marriage penalty relief for years. Clinton
embraced a limited form of relief in his State of the Union address last
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Congressman: Reduce Runway Incidents  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal aviation officials should convene a summit to
find a fast way to curtail runway incidents, Rep. Frank Wolf said Tuesday,
playing a tape of a pilot saying he's going to ``stay clear of all runways''
until he's sure there's no other plane in his path.
</P>
<P>
	   Incidents that occur at airports as planes taxi, take off and land have
increased 60 in the past five years from 204 in 1994 to 327 last year, according
to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Statistics show that the American public continues to be at unnecessary
risk of an aviation disaster, but as bad as the situation is, the problem will
only get worse if more is not done,'' said Wolf, R-Va., who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee's transportation subcommittee. ``The volume and
complexity of air traffic is expected to rise significantly over the next few
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf, who extended condolences to the families of 88 people aboard an Alaska
Airlines jet that plunged Monday night into the Pacific, noted that more than 50
people have died since 1990 in runway incidents. Called runway ``incursions'' by
federal aviation officials, they range from two planes nearly colliding to a
vehicle or person getting too close to a plane taxiing to a gate.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf called on the FAA to hold a summit where technical experts, airlines,
controllers, airport officials and private pilots could write recommendations
for solving the problem. He said he will ask the FAA to provide details of a
more aggressive effort to reduce runway incidents at his subcommittee's March 22
hearing on aviation.
</P>
<P>
	   John Mayrhofer, FAA director of runway safety, said the problem is complex
because it involves thousands of controllers, pilots and people authorized to
operate vehicles and equipment at airports nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   He said FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has given the problem a higher level
of management focus in recent months, and that there have been fewer runway
incursions recorded in five of the past six months as compared to the same
periods a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA is working on a lower-cost alternative to costly ground radar
systems used at the nation's busiest airports, he said. For larger airports, a
new system designed to prevent runway collisions has been delayed until 2002. In
addition, Mayrhofer said the FAA has training, education and awareness programs
addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The taped conversation Wolf played occurred moments after a Federal Express
cargo plane took off in fog from Providence, R.I., on Dec. 6, 1999. The takeoff
was in close proximity to a United Airlines passenger plane, prompting that
pilot to complain to a female controller: ``Ma'am, I'm trying to advise you that
I'm on an active runway.''
</P>
<P>
	   The controller says the runway was not being used, but a USAir pilot getting
ready to take off isn't convinced. He tells the controller he's not leaving
until the whereabouts of the United Airlines plane is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody standby please! Radio silence until I talk to you!'' the
controller snaps.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, she clears the USAir plane for takeoff. The pilot refuses to
leave, saying ``until we figure out what's going on down there, we're just going
to stay clear of all runways.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the locations of both planes were confirmed, the USAir plane took off
safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the mixup is being investigated by federal aviation
officials.

<HEADLINE> Congress Aims At Child Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House sent to the White House on Tuesday legislation
giving states the authority to use federal law enforcement grants for child
abuse prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, passed 410-2, also sets aside more money in the Crime Victims Fund
-- which is financed through forfeited bail bonds and fines paid to the
government -- for child abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure will ``strengthen the national arsenal of resources that can be
used in the prevention and treatment of child abuse,'' Said Rep. Deborah Pryce,
R-Ohio, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   It allows existing grants to be used by states to give child welfare
organizations and groups responsible for placing children in foster care access
to criminal conviction records.
</P>
<P>
	   Another provision allows grant money to be used specifically to form
cooperative programs between law enforcement and media groups to better identify
and apprehend suspected criminal offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The House vote was on an amended version passed by the Senate last November.
The bill now goes to President Clinton for his expected signature.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate added an amendment, called ``Jennifer's Law,'' that helps states
cover the cost of entering information on unidentified deceased people into
national missing persons files.
</P>
<P>
	   ------ Eds -- The bill number is H.R. 764.

<HEADLINE> Study: Less Heart Care for Women  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Women who go to the hospital with serious chest pain are
less likely than men to be given diagnostic tests for heart trouble, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the researchers also found that women are less likely to go on to
suffer heart attacks. As a result, they suggested the findings do not
necessarily mean that women aren't getting enough care; instead, they said men
might be getting too much.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mayo Clinic study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, follows previous studies that have documented differences
in how men and women are treated for heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   This study is believed to be one of the first to look at differences in how
the problems are diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 5 million people are evaluated for chest pain every year in emergency
rooms across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mayo study looked at 1,306 men and 965 women in Olmsted County, Minn.,
where two of the three hospitals are part of the Mayo Clinic and all health care
providers contribute to a large database that dates to the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects went to emergency rooms between 1985 and 1992 with unstable
angina, which occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get as much blood as it
needs. It may happen during exercise or strong emotions and can go away.
Unstable angina carries a risk of heart attacks, irregular heart rhythms and
congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Veronique Roger, looked at the diagnostic
procedures the subjects underwent within 90 days of their trip to the emergency
room, and what happened during an average follow-up period of six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty-five percent of the men and 72 percent of the women underwent common
diagnostic procedures. The researchers said men were 27 percent more likely than
women to undergo noninvasive cardiac tests like stress tests on treadmills or CT
scans. The men were also 72 percent more likely to have invasive procedures such
as angioplasty, which involves injecting a dye into the heart that can be seen
on X-rays.
</P>
<P>
	   After adjusting for age, cardiac risk factors and other factors, the men had
a 23 percent higher risk of death and a 21 percent higher risk of heart attack
or other serious heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   While the women "were subjected to fewer cardiac procedures than men, one
cannot infer from these data that more aggressive management of women with
unstable angina is warranted," the authors wrote. They said it's possible that
men are subjected to unnecessary diagnostic procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Vallerie McLaughlin, a cardiologist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago and member of the American Heart Association's Board
for Women and Heart Disease, agreed it is possible that men are over-tested and
over-treated. But she stressed the need to educate doctors and patients about
the dangers of heart disease for women.
</P>
<P>
	   "One has to keep in mind that cardiac disease is the No. 1 killer among
women, and any woman who presents with any complaints that could be cardiac in
origin should be evaluated very thoroughly," McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   That is especially important for post-menopausal women because their risk
approaches that of men, she said.

<HEADLINE> Right Austria Party Gets Gov't Role  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Outspoken populist Joerg Haider on Tuesday
negotiated a deal to allow his far-right party to share power in Austria's
government -- despite warnings from the United States and the European Union
that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so, even
though he fears the foreign backlash that would result from the Freedom Party's
inclusion in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the United States is
``continuing to keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
said it would continue a ``working relation'' with the new government as long as
it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it,'' Italy's left-wing
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Italian radio Tuesday. ``If these are
thrown into question, Europe has a right to speak its mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is only now recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented to
the Austrian ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, said Haider's party ``recalls
the dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the
Nazi regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to contain the diplomatic damage, Klestil met separately
Tuesday with Schuessel and caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima. Klestil asked the
other EU member countries to ``continue to treat Austria as an equal partner in
the international community of states.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel said the EU threat without prior consultations was ``not fair and
not in concord with the spirit of the European treaties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the EU action stunned the political establishment. Austria has
been without a stable government since inconclusive parliamentary elections Oct.
3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between Klima's first-place Social Democrats and the People's
Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last month, paving the way for
talks with Haider's group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes Debt-Collection Guide  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Tuesday rebuffed an attempt by some
Democrats to make it harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect
debts from people who have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate, in a 53-44 vote, rejected an amendment proposed by liberal Sen.
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging
more than 100 percent annual interest from recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of sweeping
legislation that would make it more difficult for people to erase their debts
through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   A minimum wage increase is likely to be popular this election year. About 11
million workers would be directly affected, half of them workers under the age
of 24 and many of them holders of part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Away from the Senate floor, Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said the
provision contained in the bankruptcy overhaul bill -- a $1 increase in the
$5.15 hourly minimum over three years -- was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the White House and Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion
in small-business tax breaks proposed by the GOP that are tied to the minimum
wage increase in the bipartisan bankruptcy legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made in a House-Senate conference, Daschle told
reporters, ``I'm concerned that the bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   He did not specify what action the minority Democrats might take against the
bill. Democrats could use parliamentary rules to hold up Senate passage of the
legislation after it is revised by House and Senate negotiators and sent back to
each chamber for final votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The current bill, which appeared headed toward likely Senate passage on
Wednesday, has been pushed by banks, credit card companies and retail-business
groups. Proponents say the sweeping overhaul of the bankruptcy laws is needed to
stem abuse by people who can afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation favors
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt who need a
fresh start. They insist that the credit card companies share the blame by
flooding consumers with mailed solicitations to entice them into easy credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved bankruptcy overhaul legislation last May by a veto-proof
margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the minimum wage-tax breaks provision, the Senate bill
contains several other key provisions unrelated to bankruptcy: tightened
penalties for selling illegal drugs to minors and a narrowing of the disparity
in sentences for sales of powder and crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone's defeated proposal opened a debate on so-called ``payday loans''
-- small, short-term cash advances against a borrower's paycheck that carry
triple-digit interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone called such lenders ``unscrupulous loan sharks'' who prey on
people in desperate financial straits.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
insisted that payday loans are ``a legitimate service that many honest consumers
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, senior Democrat on the Banking
Committee, proposed legislation that would prohibit federally insured banks from
engaging in payday loan business, either directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
	   A report released Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America and U.S.
Public Interest Research Group found that consumers are paying 300 percent or
more, on an annual basis, for payday loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups have maintained that some businesses skirt state laws by
making payday loans through out-of-state national banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry officials have acknowledged that there are problems, including
cases of excessive use of ``rollovers,'' in which consumers are unable to repay
the loans and they are extended for two more weeks or so. However, they say, no
new federal regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our product fills a tremendous market need and is enthusiastically
embraced by millions of working Americans,'' Billy Webster, president of the
company Advance America and head of the Community Financial Services
Association, said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The loans are legal in 31 states. The industry earned an estimated $1.4
billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Abandon Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- A large contingent of Chechen fighters have
abandoned positions in their embattled capital of Grozny and escaped despite a
Russian blockade. Two senior rebel commanders along with scores of their
fighters stumbled into a minefield and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Chechen fighters broke out and tried Tuesday to head south to
join up with fellow rebels, battling federal forces attempting to prevent their
escape with tanks and artillery. Russian reports estimated there were about
3,000 rebel fighters in Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Other rebels stayed in the battered Chechen capital to keep up the fierce
resistance they have mounted to months of air and artillery attacks and a
five-week Russian push to take the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two prominent rebel commanders remained in Grozny with their
forces, rebels said. It was unclear how many rebels remained under their
command.
</P>
<P>
	   A large group of rebels got caught in a minefield on the outskirts of Grozny
on Monday, and several prominent Chechen commanders were killed or badly
wounded, witnesses said. Russian artillery then opened fire on the field,
killing and wounding scores more fighters, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Notorious Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev reportedly had his leg torn
off when his car was blown up by a mine as he escaped Grozny; he was spirited
away, rebels said, and his whereabouts was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Chechen commanders reportedly killed were Aslanbek Ismailov, who
had headed Grozny's defenses, Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov, and Grozny Mayor Lecha
Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders denied that the rebels escaped; a main goal of the
Russian offensive had been to wipe out the fighters in Grozny. The rebels who
left Grozny are expected to join thousands of comrades in the south to go on
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said Russian troops clashed with rebels Tuesday in
the Argun and Vedeno gorges, which lead through the mountains. The Interfax news
agency cited a rebel spokesman as saying fighting continued in Grozny on Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev insisted Tuesday that federal forces
were successfully blocking rebels trying to flee Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody will ever allow the rebels to leave the city other than under a
white flag and after laying down their weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels did not announce that they had given up the fight for the
capital. Their strategy in Grozny was to inflict as many losses as possible on
the Russians while avoiding heavy casualties that would harm their ability to
continue the war.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last Chechen war, the rebels lost Grozny in 1995, but kept fighting
until they retook the city in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighters' exodus began Monday as groups of rebels broke out of the
western edge of the city along a railway line. The rebels continued to flee
overnight, rebel commanders and residents of nearby villages said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no sign that any of the estimated 15,000-40,000 civilians trapped
in Grozny had left with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders insisted they had defeated rebel attempts to break out of
Grozny. A Russian military spokesman confirmed some rebels had been caught in a
minefield as they attempted to reach Alkhan-Kala, a village on the capital's
western outskirts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of these groups hit the minefield, the other was destroyed by our
units' artillery fire,'' said Col. Alexander Veklich.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen of the Chechen wounded who made it to Alkhan-Kala lay on the
snow around the village's small clinic because there was no room for them
inside, residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wounded fighters lie almost in piles inside the hospital, and we had to
put dozens more on the snow outside,'' said Baiant Munayeva, who helped care for
the injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is just one doctor, and no medicines, no syringes, no nothing,''
said Munayeva, visibly shaken and pale. ``Dozens have had their legs torn away,
and they lie there covered with blood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel commanders met in Alkhan-Kala to plot their next moves and possible
negotiations with Russian forces over an escape corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   A fighter who attended the meeting said there was no talk of taking a stand
against Russian forces in Alkhan-Kala. Russian forces surrounded and shelled the
village on Tuesday, and skirmishes erupted between the federal troops and
Chechen fighters on the outskirts.

<P>
	   The Russians have been fighting since October to seize Grozny. On Monday,
Russian commanders announced their forces had taken a strategic square that is a
key to the city center after two weeks of combat.

Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August, and a series of deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were
blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Congress Takes Aim at Child Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House sent to the White House on Tuesday legislation
giving states the authority to use federal law enforcement grants for child
abuse prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, passed 410-2, also sets aside more money in the Crime Victims Fund
-- which is financed through forfeited bail bonds and fines paid to the
government -- for child abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure will ``strengthen the national arsenal of resources that can be
used in the prevention and treatment of child abuse,'' Said Rep. Deborah Pryce,
R-Ohio, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   It allows existing grants to be used by states to give child welfare
organizations and groups responsible for placing children in foster care access
to criminal conviction records.
</P>
<P>
	   Another provision allows grant money to be used specifically to form
cooperative programs between law enforcement and media groups to better identify
and apprehend suspected criminal offenders.

<HEADLINE> Congressman: Reduce Runway Incidents  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal aviation officials should convene a summit to
find a fast way to curtail runway incidents, Rep. Frank Wolf said Tuesday,
playing a tape of a pilot saying he's going to ``stay clear of all runways''
until he's sure there's no other plane in his path.
</P>
<P>
	   Incidents that occur at airports as planes taxi, take off and land have
increased 60 percent in the past five years from 204 in 1994 to 327 last year,
according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Statistics show that the American public continues to be at unnecessary
risk of an aviation disaster, but as bad as the situation is, the problem will
only get worse if more is not done,'' said Wolf, R-Va., who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee's transportation subcommittee. ``The volume and
complexity of air traffic is expected to rise significantly over the next few
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf, who extended condolences to the families of 88 people aboard an Alaska
Airlines jet that plunged Monday night into the Pacific, noted that more than 50
people have died since 1990 in runway incidents. Called runway ``incursions'' by
federal aviation officials, they range from two planes nearly colliding to a
vehicle or person getting too close to a plane taxiing to a gate.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf called on the FAA to hold a summit where technical experts, airlines,
controllers, airport officials and private pilots could write recommendations
for solving the problem. He said he will ask the FAA to provide details of a
more aggressive effort to reduce runway incidents at his subcommittee's March 22
hearing on aviation.
</P>
<P>
	   John Mayrhofer, FAA director of runway safety, said the problem is complex
because it involves thousands of controllers, pilots and people authorized to
operate vehicles and equipment at airports nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   He said FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has given the problem a higher level
of management focus in recent months, and that there have been fewer runway
incursions recorded in five of the past six months as compared to the same
periods a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA is working on a lower-cost alternative to costly ground radar
systems used at the nation's busiest airports, he said. For larger airports, a
new system designed to prevent runway collisions has been delayed until 2002. In
addition, Mayrhofer said the FAA has training, education and awareness programs
addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The taped conversation Wolf played occurred moments after a Federal Express
cargo plane took off in fog from Providence, R.I., on Dec. 6, 1999. The takeoff
was in close proximity to a United Airlines passenger plane, prompting that
pilot to complain to a female controller: ``Ma'am, I'm trying to advise you that
I'm on an active runway.''
</P>
<P>
	   The controller says the runway was not being used, but a USAir pilot getting
ready to take off isn't convinced. He tells the controller he's not leaving
until the whereabouts of the United Airlines plane is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody standby please! Radio silence until I talk to you!'' the
controller snaps.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments later, she clears the USAir plane for takeoff. The pilot refuses to
leave, saying ``until we figure out what's going on down there, we're just going
to stay clear of all runways.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the locations of both planes were confirmed, the USAir plane took off
safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the mixup is being investigated by federal aviation
officials.

<HEADLINE> GM Won't Spin Off Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to issue $15 billion in new
shares of the stock that tracks the performance of its Hughes Electronics unit
in a bid to increase the value of GM shares, and denied it intends to spin off
the high-flying Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it will offer its shareholders $8 billion in Hughes tracking
stock in return for their regular GM shares. GM will also contribute $7 billion
of Hughes' stock to trust funds for retiree benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions enable GM to realize $15 billion of the value of Hughes, and
improve GM's financial flexibility to pursue business and growth initiatives in
our automotive and financial services businesses," GM's chairman, Jack Smith,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   GM shares rose nearly 6 percent on the news, moving up $4.68 3/4 to $85.25 a
share Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange GM's Hughes' shares were up $2.50
to $115, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' tracking stock reflects its financial performance, but does not
represent any ownership stake in the company, which will remain a wholly owned
subsidiary of GM.
</P>
<P>
	   The move will reduce the number of GM shares on the market, driving up GM's
earnings per share. The transaction will also reduce GM's hoard of Hughes stock
from 68 percent to 35 percent, or about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts had been expecting some kind of move from GM on its
Hughes stock for months, as Hughes enjoyed a strong run in a market hungry for
technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The former defense electronics specialist has become a leader in the
satellite television business; its DirecTV service has 8 million subscribers.
Hughes is also building a $1.4 billion wireless data network called Spaceway
that it expects to unveil in 2003. The system will use satellites to connect
users to the Internet at high speeds and to swap data with each other.
</P>
<P>
	   While GM has not been shy about selling or spinning off businesses, company
leaders say they have no such plans for Hughes. GM has been looking at ways to
squeeze more profits out of each vehicle by selling services such as Internet
access, its OnStar security system or satellite radio -- all of which require
expertise in wireless and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
	   One example: Smith said last month that Hughes scientists had figured out a
way to use satellite radio services to carry video signals, making a satellite
TV service for vehicles possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no current plans or intentions to separate Hughes from GM," said J.
Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer. "We continue to like the Hughes
growth opportunities and the telecommunications synergies."
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities said the deal would likely be a
good compromise between GM's need to stay in control of Hughes and Wall Street's
clamor for a full spin-off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not as good a deal as if GM had spun off the whole Hughes business,"
Healy said. "But they balanced the need of the corporation with the needs of
shareholders."

<HEADLINE> US Highlights Iraq Weapons Efforts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Tuesday continued Iraqi efforts
to develop weapons of mass destruction underscore the need for the return of
international inspectors to enforce a ban on such armaments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are certainly concerned by activity at the sites known to be capable of
producing weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles,''
spokesman James Foley said. He was responding to a New York Times story alleging
that Iraq has rebuilt military sites damaged by U.S. and British air strikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the administration has been highlighting for months Iraqi efforts
at reinstating its weapons capability.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council has approved a new weapons inspection system but
Iraq has said it will not cooperate. Iraq has not allowed any weapons inspectors
into the country since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said concerns about the Iraqis will increase as more time passes with
no monitoring system in place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We obviously will continue to make the Iraqi capabilities in this regard a
high priority of the U.S. intelligence community, but it also underscores the
importance, in our view, of having inspectors return to Iraq to do a credible
and effective job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Prices at 24-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices swooned to a 24-year low Tuesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange as the export of bumper crops in West Africa puts increasing
pressure on an oversupplied world market.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose 2 percent, heating oil
went higher with them and palladium hit its latest all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa's long, steady descent of recent months accelerated Tuesday after the
price hit contract lows and still drew little buying interest, prompting funds
to drive it still lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa for March delivery settled down $32 at $763 per ton -- a 4 percent
decline -- after hitting $757 at midday. The last time the price was lower was
March 19, 1976, at $747.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the fundamental developments driving Tuesday's plunge were old
news: huge crops just coming to docks in Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia, the
top three producers of cocoa beans.
</P>
<P>
	   World production is expected to rise 6 percent this year while grindings,
reflecting consumption, increase less than 3 percent, trade house ED&AMP;F Man said
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's expecting a surplus of production this year," said Luis Rangel
of Fimat Futures in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the continued rise of the dollar and pound against the euro has
encouraged more producer selling. Rangel said that while a "corrective bounce"
from the one-day nosedive is likely, there's no rally in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market probably has some more room on the downside," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude and heating oil both rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
anticipation that new reports would show that heating oil stockpiles had shrunk
further. Prospects for an oil union strike in Venezuela, threatening a supply
disruption, further underpinned the market.
</P>
<P>
	   March crude rose 58 cents to $28.22 a barrel; March heating oil rose 2.85
cents to 77.19 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline rose 1.96 cent to 77.67
cents a gallon; March natural gas rose 3.7 cents to $2.699 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude rose 42 cents to $26.39 a barrel on London's International
Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium pushed to its latest in a series of all-time highs in a market
where demand is soaring and supplies are tight. Russian sales have dried up in
recent days, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   March palladium settled up $7.85 at $492.55 per ounce on the New York Merc
after reaching $499.50.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Deal Reached in Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Outspoken populist Joerg Haider on Tuesday
negotiated a deal to allow his far-right party to share power in Austria's
government -- despite warnings from the United States and the European Union
that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so, even
though he fears the foreign backlash that would result from the Freedom Party's
inclusion in the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the United States is
``continuing to keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
said it would continue a ``working relation'' with the new government as long as
it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it,'' Italy's left-wing
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Italian radio Tuesday. ``If these are
thrown into question, Europe has a right to speak its mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is only now recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented to
the Austrian ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, said Haider's party ``recalls
the dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the
Nazi regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to contain the diplomatic damage, Klestil met separately
Tuesday with Schuessel and caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima. Klestil asked the
other EU member countries to ``continue to treat Austria as an equal partner in
the international community of states.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel said the EU threat without prior consultations was ``not fair and
not in concord with the spirit of the European treaties.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the EU action stunned the political establishment. Austria has
been without a stable government since inconclusive parliamentary elections Oct.
3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between Klima's first-place Social Democrats and the People's
Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last month, paving the way for
talks with Haider's group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power.

	   Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 100.52
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply for a second consecutive
session today as investors bought beaten-down shares of companies
that have faltered during the latest debate over interest rates.
But as the Federal Reserve met in Washington, many investors
remained concerned that a rate increase this week will be the first
of several this year, making it difficult for companies to sustain
the strong profit growth that has helped the market rebound from
crushing losses last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
100.52 to close at 11,041.05, building on its 201-point gain on
Monday. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq

	   Economic Expansion Is Longest
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current economic expansion now holds the
all-time record. As of today, the boom has lasted 107 months, one
month longer than the previous record-holder, the 1960s expansion
that covered the Vietnam War. President Clinton celebrated with
congressional leaders at the White House, saying the expansion
``was earned by the American people'' through hard work and
innovation. The eight years and 11 months of growth since the last
recession is in itself quite a feat considering that the average of
all U.S. expansions, dating back to 1854, is just 35 months, not
long enough to celebrate a third birthday, let alone a ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of Raw Materials Rise
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A manufacturing group warned today that ``prices
are rising to levels of concern'' as the nation's industrial
economy grew in January for a 12th straight month. The inflation
warning came as Federal Reserve policy-makers began a two-day
meeting in Washington that is expected to result in the fourth
increase in interest rates since June. Today's figures from the
National Association of Purchasing Management confirmed that the
current economic expansion -- now the longest in American history --
is continuing. But the prices of raw materials rose to the highest
reading in nearly five years, which is seen as giving the Fed even
more cause to raise interest rates to cool the economy and hold
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
	   Construction Spending Surges
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending surged 2 percent in
December, pushing the amount of money spent on single-family homes
to a monthly record. Good weather helped the rise. The Commerce
Department reported today that spending was at a record annual rate
of $730.3 billion. That followed a revised 2 percent increase in
November. December's performance was much stronger than many
analysts expected. They had predicted that construction would fall
by 0.3 percent in December. For the year, construction spending
rose 6 percent, following an increase of 7.6 percent in 1998.

	   DETROIT (AP) -- Major U.S. automakers turned in a mixed
performance for January sales, with General Motors Corp. showing a
strong gain, Ford Motor Co. seeing a modest increase and the
Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG posting a decline. With
several foreign automakers reporting gains, overall sales appeared
to be staying strong after hitting an all-time record for 1999 with
16.9 million vehicles, despite winter storms that hurt January
sales in some parts of the country. GM said its U.S. sales of cars
and light trucks were up 12 percent overall. Sales at Ford were up
3 percent. Sales of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles were down 6
percent overall.

benefits. Hughes' tracking stock reflects its financial
performance, but does not affect its status as a wholly owned
subsidiary of GM.

	   Sprint Beats Wall Street Forecasts
</P>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp.'s profit rose 3 percent for
the fourth quarter as growth in its core long-distance and local
telephone businesses helped the company beat Wall Street forecasts.
The Sprint PCS wireless business posted a bigger than expected loss
for the quarter even as revenues more than doubled. The company
reported today that its FON Group, which doesn't include Sprint
PCS, earned $416 million in the three months ended Dec. 31,
improving from $404 million in the same period in 1998. Earnings
per share held steady at 47 cents, however, because there's more
Sprint stock on the market now than a year ago. Even so, analysts
had predicted earnings of 39 cents per share in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Wider FBI Crime Fighting Role Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The attorney general and the FBI should have more
authority to coordinate the fight against new and increasingly dangerous forms
of crime, a congressional commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement, formed in part
in response to such contentious law enforcement episodes as the standoffs at
Ruby Ridge and Waco, recommended that the FBI take over enforcement functions of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The ATF is part of the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-drug effort of the Drug Enforcement Administration should become a
separate division of the FBI, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has failed to act on similar recommendations in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of today's current structure is based on problems of the past, such
as Prohibition,'' said former FBI Director William H. Webster, chairman of the
five-member commission. ``The nation critically requires a federal law
enforcement establishment that is ready to meet the crime problems of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those problems include global criminal cartels, cybercrime and domestic and
international terrorism, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commission member Donald Dahlin of the University of South Dakota said
fighting such new threats ``will be an increasingly difficult task'' if federal
law enforcement is not coordinated better.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the attorney general should be responsible for overseeing
all major federal law enforcement policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Created by Congress in 1996, the commission also chided Congress for its
recent tendency to ``federalize'' crimes. It said 40 percent of federal crimes
have been put on the books since 1970, and the total now is more than 3,000.
``This situation threatens to overwhelm federal law enforcement capacities, just
as dramatic and serious new law enforcement challenges grow in intensity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Webster acknowledged that others in the past, going back to Lyndon Johnson,
attempted, with limited success, to restructure the ATF or consolidate law
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   He said adoption of his commission's recommendations ``is possible if
Congress agrees the need is there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said his panel
``will study the report and review its recommendations.'' A hearing was
scheduled Thursday on the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster said that while such events as Ruby Ridge and Waco had become
``metaphors'' for some recent problems in law enforcement, they were only part
of a larger picture that included real successes such as law enforcement
coordination after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI was deeply involved in both the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and 1993
Waco, Texas, incidents. At Ruby Ridge, the wife and son of white separatist
Randy Weaver and a deputy U.S. marshall died. At Waco, which began with a
botched ATF raid on the Branch Davidians religious sect's complex, the FBI was
in charge for most of the standoff that ended in the complex's destruction by
fire, with more than 80 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also recommended that law enforcement and intelligence
agencies coordinate their activities better, that global crime be made a
national law enforcement priority and that Congress require that law enforcement
agencies establish new standards for professionalism and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Ad 'Rewards' Keyes' Mosh Dive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alan Keyes got the promised TV endorsement -- but only a
mocking one -- as a reward for meeting a filmmaker's challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Moore, who pledged to endorse the first candidate who would jump
into his mosh pit, forked out $400 for a pair of ads on Keyes' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads suggested that voters overlook that Keyes is "against women's
rights, affordable health care and anyone who doesn't refer to him as
'ambassador."' Voters should support Keyes "simply because he jumped into our
mosh pit."
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes did just that on the eve of the Iowa caucuses last week. A mosh pit is
a crowd of people, typically just in front of the stage, who catch a performer
who jumps in.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad ran Monday night, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, first
during a 10:30 p.m. showing of "Wheel of Fortune," and again during a 2 a.m.
Kojak rerun.
</P>
<P>
	   The Keyes campaign took the "endorsement" in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole thing is entertainment," said spokeswoman Connie Hair, suggesting
it was actually a ploy for Moore to boost his ratings. "I think it's funny,
personally."
</P>
<P>
	   She added that Keyes dove into the pit to impress his daughter, Maya.
</P>
<P>
	   "It had to do with a 49-year-old man taking advantage of one of the very few
opportunities he has with his 14-year-old daughter to be very cool," she said.
"Those opportunities don't come along every day."

<HEADLINE> High-Interest Lender Regs Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rebuffed an attempt by some Democrats on
Tuesday to make it harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect debts
from people who have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted, 53-44, to reject an amendment proposed by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging more
than 100 percent annual interest in recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of legislation
that would make it more difficult for people to erase their debts through
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said a $1 increase in the $5.15 hourly
minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House and
Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion in small-business tax breaks proposed
by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The current bill, which appeared headed toward likely Senate passage on
Wednesday, has been pushed by banks, credit card companies and retail-business
groups. Proponents say the overhaul of bankruptcy laws is needed to stem abuse
by people who can afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation favors
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. They insist
that the credit card companies share the blame by flooding consumers with mailed
solicitations to entice them into easy credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved bankruptcy overhaul legislation last May by a veto-proof
margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the minimum wage-tax breaks provision, the Senate bill
contains several other provisions unrelated to bankruptcy: tightened penalties
for selling illegal drugs to minors and a narrowing of the disparity in
sentences for sales of powder and crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone's defeated proposal opened a debate on so-called ``payday loans''
-- small, short-term cash advances against a borrower's paycheck that carry
triple-digit interest rates. Wellstone called them ``unscrupulous loan sharks.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
insisted that payday loans are ``a legitimate service that many honest consumers
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   A report released Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America and U.S.
Public Interest Research Group found that consumers are paying 300 percent or
more, on an annual basis, for payday loans. Consumer groups have maintained that
some businesses skirt state laws by making payday loans through out-of-state
national banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry officials have acknowledged that there are problems, including
cases of excessive use of ``rollovers,'' in which consumers are unable to repay
the loans and they are extended for two more weeks or so. However, they say, no
new federal regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our product fills a tremendous market need and is enthusiastically
embraced by millions of working Americans,'' Billy Webster, president of the
company Advance America and head of the Community Financial Services
Association, said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The loans are legal in 31 states. The industry earned an estimated $1.4
billion last year.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Pro-Taiwan Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a veto threat and sharp criticism from China,
the House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to increase American military ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we truly love freedom, we must protect democratic Taiwan,'' said
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas as the chamber sent the bill to the Senate.
Its fate there is less certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, approved 341 to 70, would lift a long-standing prohibition
on direct communication and cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwanese military,
open American military academies to more Taiwanese officers and require annual
Pentagon reports on threats to Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the bill was less hard-edged than an earlier version, the Clinton
administration contends it could undermine stability in Asia while doing little
to help Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
	   The House vote came a day after Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning
asserted that the bill's passage ``will bring about serious damage'' to
U.S.-Chinese relations. He suggested it would undermine the U.S. commitment to
recognize only one China.
</P>
<P>
	   The House's slap at China came as the administration worked to build support
for a measure to give China permanent trade benefits to accompany its expected
entry into the World Trade Organization. A vote on that measure is expected this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taiwan bill had bipartisan election-year support, and the
administration's Democratic allies put up only token opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``will not add one single missile to Taiwan's defense capability,
and it will not take away one single missile from China's,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif. Lantos said it was important to preserve ``the carefully
crafted fiction that there's only one China.''
</P>
<P>
	   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. However, the legislation did not appear to enjoy as
much initial support there.
</P>
<P>
	   While citing his long support for Taiwan, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., cautioned he didn't want to complicate further already tense relations
between the mainland and the island. ``We should proceed with due diligence,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors portrayed the bill as a reaction to the reported buildup of China's
missile arsenal along the Taiwan Strait and continued Chinese human-rights
abuses. They called it an expansion of the landmark 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,
which allows the United States to provide military supplies to Taiwan to use in
defending itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time to act on this promise is now,'' said House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the principal sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   As to its prospects in the Senate, ``I think the Senate never realized the
depth of support in the House. They cannot ignore a huge vote like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, national security spokesman David Leavy said the bill
``would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan security and risk the stability of
the entire East Asian region.''
</P>
<P>
	   If it passes in its present form, ``the president's senior advisers would
recommend that he veto it,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Its present form is a more modest version of a bill by DeLay that originally
would have authorized the sale to Taiwan of specific weapons systems, including
a ballistic missile defense, sophisticated radar warning equipment and
conventional submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the bill, even in its
watered-down form, ``would seriously diminish Taiwan's security and undermine
overall U.S. objectives of stability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
	   While a veto threat has been put on the table, ``We will, in the meantime,
be working hard to persuade the Congress not to enact it into law,'' Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1.2B For Indian Country  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to ask Congress for $1.2 billion
in new spending on American Indian programs, including hundreds of millions more
to build schools, hire police and improve health care on reservations, a White
House aide says.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the Indian spending initiative in his State of the Union
address last week, but did not include specifics. That plan, to be included next
week in Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, includes new or expanded Indian programs
in nearly every federal agency, said Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on
Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking
about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, a day after
she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the proposal include $300 million to build at least six new
reservation schools, $650 million for housing programs, a $117 million increase
for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health
Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main
agency funding tribal governments, was not as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's anything to have a party over because the needs in
Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to
head the BIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and
chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sen. Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does wonder
why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a look at
Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler acknowledged that Clinton's proposal fell short of meeting the needs
of American Indians, who face far higher rates of poverty, unemployment and
other social problems than the country as a whole. She said the $1.2 billion
plan is the largest increase in Indian funding ever proposed, and anything more
would face stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the
estimated $4 billion backlog of repairs needed for highways through Indian
Country, Cutler acknowledged. An Interior Department report last year
recommended repairing or replacing 170 BIA schools at a total cost of $1.2
billion, far more than the six schools that would be replaced under Clinton's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know half a dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's
a drop,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31
tribal colleges, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be released Wednesday says tribal colleges, which serve 26,000
students in 12 states, have created jobs and helped increase education levels on
the reservations where they operate. The report from the Institute for Higher
Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median
incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster
between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Other details of Clinton's proposal, according to Cutler, include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program to draw companies to
reservation areas.

<HEADLINE> TWA Suffers $353.4 Million Loss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines lost $353.4 millon during 1999, with
most of the shortfall due to a fourth-quarter loss that grew sharply from a year
earlier. The company said it was still suffering from the effects of labor
uncertainty last spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA's losses, announced Monday, mean the carrier hasn't turned an annual
profit since 1988. Its 1999 loss came to $5.58 per share, and compared with a
deficit of $120.5 million, or $2.35 per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the fourth quarter, TWA lost $271.9 million, or $3.97 per share,
compared to $79.1 million, or $1.30 per share, in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline reported one-time items including $159.1 million related to
discontinued European routes and severance costs associated with restructuring
of the company's international operations; and $17.7 million related to
improvements at New York's Kennedy Airport and costs related to the planned
retirement of the Boeing 727, DC-9, and 767-200 fleets.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the extraordinary items, the company lost $105.9 million, or $1.60
per share, for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA said it was still recovering from a drop in business travel that
occurred earlier in the year amid a strike threat by the Machininsts union.
Although TWA reached an agreement with the union in the summer, it reported some
travelers have been slow to come back to the airline.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating revenues for the quarter were $801.7 million, up from $747.1
million in the fourth quarter of 1998. For the full year, TWA had revenues of
$3.31 billion, up from $3.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the fourth-quarter results are disappointing, we continue to take the
necessary steps to return this airline to sustainable profitability," said
William F. Compton, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, TWA expanded service to warm-weather ports such as
Puerto Rico, Mexico and Hawaii, adding a total of 46 new roundtrip flights each
week. At the same time, the airline eliminated some unprofitable feed service
into Kennedy Airport and dropped service to Rome, Madrid and Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief financial officer Michael J. Palumbo said the company plans to reduce
its 21,000 work force by about 5 percent this year, mostly through attrition and
retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA shares fell 6 1/4 cents to $2.75 in trading at 4 p.m. on the American
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Profit, Sales Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Telecommunications equipment maker Nokia's profit
rose 46 percent in the fourth quarter as sales of mobile phones surged.
</P>
<P>
	   Its chairman and chief executive, Jorma Ollila, also confirmed Tuesday that
the world's largest supplier of mobile phones has had discussions with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. on possible cooperation with the media concern.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference to discuss the earnings report, Ollila said senior
management from both companies met two weeks ago. He said the talks were in an
"early stage of discussion." He declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
	   The Guardian newspaper of the U.K. reported in Tuesday's edition that News
Corp. executives had met with Nokia because Murdoch believes customers
increasingly want to access films, television and information through mobile
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Nokia said it had agreed to acquire privately held Network
Alchemy Inc. for $335 million in Nokia stock and stock options.
</P>
<P>
	   Alchemy, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., makes software for secure
communications over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Nokia also disclosed it will propose a four-for-one share split at its
annual meeting on March 22. It said the split would increase liquidity of its
shares.
</P>
<P>
	   In its earnings report, Nokia said its net profit rose to 853 million euros,
or $835 million, during the last three months of 1999 from 585 million euros a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose to 6.37 billion euros, or $6.23 billion, from 4.35 billion euros
during the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobile phones continued as the strongest business in the company, as sales
leapt to 4.2 billion euros in the quarter from 2.7 billion euros a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Nokia's results were slightly higher than market expectations, and its share
price was up 4.6 percent at midday on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Nokia earned 2.58 billion euros, or $2.53 billion, up from
1.75 billion euros in 1998. Sales grew to 19.7 billion euros, or $19.3 billion,
from 13.3 billion euros a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> 2 Nabbed for Iran Arms Sales  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two Israeli businessmen were arrested Tuesday for
allegedly selling military equipment -- including armored personnel carriers --
to Iran through other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The yearlong secret investigation of the two suspects involved police from
the United States, Europe and the Far East, Israeli police spokesman Uzi Sanduri
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanduri said the two men allegedly sold a great deal of armored personnel
carriers, engines and spare parts to dealers abroad who in turn sold the
equipment to Iran, one of Israel's bitterest enemies. He would not give further
details about the equipment but said the men knew the equipment was headed for
Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran regularly calls for Israel's destruction, and backs Hezbollah
guerrillas battling Israeli troops in a border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Police would not release the names of the suspects but said they lived in
central Israel, were 50 and 32 years old and would be brought before a hearing
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV named the suspects as Eli Cohen and Avihai
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanduri said one of the men had been involved in a similar case seven years
ago but he did not know if he had served time in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel TV said the equipment originated in the United States, was sold in
Germany and then transferred to Iran. The report said that police could not
prosecute the similar case seven years ago because they could not prove the
equipment ever reached Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has been developing sophisticated missiles capable of countering the
Iranian Shahab-3 missile, whose range is large enough to strike Israel. Israel
also suspects Iran of developing nuclear capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Israeli, Nahum Manbar, was convicted of treason in 1998 and
sentenced to 16 years in prison for selling millions of dollars in chemical
weapons materials to Iran.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Argentina to Seek Bodies  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli Cabinet minister said Tuesday that Argentina's
president has promised to help locate the bodies of Jewish dissidents killed
during the South American nation's ``dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diaspora Affairs Minister Michael Melchior said Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua made the commitment when the two met last week in Stockholm at an
international conference on preserving the memory of the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   The Argentine government did not return repeated phone calls to confirm
Melchior's version of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   During Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship, at least 9,000 leftists
and dissidents vanished after being detained by the junta's security forces,
according to a government report. Human rights groups say the figure is closer
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Argentina's largest Jewish group, the Delegation of Argentine Jewish
Organizations, or DAIA, estimates at least 1,500 Jews ``disappeared'' during the
country's ``dirty war.'' Melchior put the number at 2,000.
</P>
<P>
	   According to human rights groups and survivor accounts, opponents to the
military regime who were Jewish were often singled out for harsher treatment by
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior said de la Rua's offer showed the new president was determined to
``build a new image of Argentina, and to fight against anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pledge showed courage, Melchior said. ``Coming to Stockholm was not easy
for him,'' he told the Associated Press in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The Argentine government did not return repeated phone calls to confirm
Melchior's version of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior, a rabbi, said he hoped de la Rua's pledge of cooperation could
help some families of the disappeared track down the missing bodies for a Jewish
ritual burial, an act he said he hoped would give them with a sense of closure.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Argentina's top junta leaders were sentenced to life in prison
after public trials found them guilty of human rights abuses. But the imprisoned
leaders were freed five years later on a presidential pardon signed by
then-President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior said de la Rua also promised to reinvigorate investigations into
two bombing attacks on the Jewish community in Buenos Aires. A 1992 bombing of
the Israeli embassy killed 29 people, and two years later an attack on a Jewish
community center in the Argentine capital claimed 86 people.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been no major convictions in either case and Israel has
criticized the Argentine authorities' conduct of the investigations as slow and
inept. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has called them ``an open sore.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have blamed Iranian-backed groups for
the bombings, a charge Tehran has denied.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsolved investigations have been a diplomatic stumbling block between
Israel and Argentina, which is home to some 300,000 Jews, the second largest
community in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> NATO Kosovo Violations Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said Tuesday
she has seen no evidence to warrant an investigation of whether NATO's Kosovo
bombing campaign violated international treaties on the conduct of war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our work is not done but what we can say is that up until now we have no
indications that we should open an inquiry,'' she said, speaking to reporters
after meeting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
	   Del Ponte, who is prosecutor for both the Yugoslav and Rwanda U.N.
tribunals, disclosed in December that her staff had completed a confidential
report on NATO's 78-day bombing campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was prompted by Yugoslavia, some Western legal experts and
Russian lawmakers who said the NATO bombing killed scores of civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacks compelled the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, which is
part of Yugoslavia's Serb province and has a mainly ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook said British forensic experts will return to Kosovo this year to search
for more evidence of war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   British teams exhumed about 500 bodies in Kosovo last year before winter set
in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who carry out crimes against humanity should face the full rigor of
the law and be brought to justice,'' Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Feds, Wal-Mart Team To Promote Coin  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mindful of the debacle with the Susan B. Anthony coin,
the U.S. Mint is aggressively marketing the new Sacagawea coin by placing it in
Wal-Mart cash registers and boxes of Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right away, this gets the new golden dollar coin into cash registers
across the nation,'' said Philip Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint. ``We've
achieved a huge objective in the first week, something the Susan B. Anthony
dollar never had the chance to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Anthony coin, often mistaken for a quarter because of its similar size
and ridged edge, was a flop, and the government was stuck with nearly two-thirds
of the 857 million coins produced between 1979 and 1981. Supplies eventually ran
out and the Mint produced a final 1999 encore run.
</P>
<P>
	   The silver-colored coin bore the likeness of suffragette Susan B. Anthony.
The new dollar coin, with an image of the Shoshone Indian woman who helped the
Lewis and Clark expedition explore the West, has a gold-colored surface and a
smooth edge.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint is shipping $100 million worth to Wal-Mart and the same amount to
Federal Reserve banks, which in turn will distribute them to private banks.
Diehl said the Mint plans to produce as many as 1 billion coins this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last Thursday, cashiers at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club store checkouts
have been making change with the Sacagawea coin instead of dollar bills. And
thousands of Cheerios boxes will include coins or certificates for coins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through the end of February, we will be the exclusive holder,'' said Laura
Pope, spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer.
``We're giving it back automatically to customers unless you request dollar
bills.''
</P>
<P>
	   Transactions involving the Sacagawea coins at the 3,000 Wal-Mart and Sam's
Club stores are limited to $10, Pope said. Customers also can request the coin
as change without buying anything.
</P>
<P>
	   People also may order the coins via the Internet at www.usmint.gov.
</P>
<P>
	   The special deal with Wal-Mart is vexing to some Main Street retailers, who
cannot get the coins. Jim Seigfreid, owner of Jim's IGA in Marshall, Mo., said
customers started asking for the coins last Friday, but local bank officials
told him they didn't have coins to distribute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the government offers something like this to private industry over
others, especially an industry as big as Wal-Mart, they ought to offer it to
small businesses who are trying to compete,'' said Seigfreid, also a Missouri
state legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   Seigfreid and others complained to Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who wrote to the
Mint on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wal-Mart is a fine organization, but there are also many, many small
businesses that would like to participate in this,'' Skelton said in an
interview. ``The backbone of the American economy is the small business
community. Why not let small businesses across the nation distribute these?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint plans to spend $40 million promoting the gold-colored coin in a
television, radio and print advertising campaign in the spring.

<HEADLINE> GM Won't Spin Off Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to issue $15 billion in new
shares of the stock that tracks the performance of its Hughes Electronics unit
in a bid to increase the value of GM shares, and denied it intends to spin off
the high-flying Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it will offer its shareholders $8 billion in Hughes tracking
stock in return for their regular GM shares. GM will also contribute $7 billion
of Hughes' stock to trust funds for retiree benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions enable GM to realize $15 billion of the value of Hughes, and
improve GM's financial flexibility to pursue business and growth initiatives in
our automotive and financial services businesses," GM's chairman, Jack Smith,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   GM shares rose nearly 6 percent on the news, moving up $4.68 3/4 to $85.25 a
share Wednesday in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange GM's
Hughes' shares were up $2 to $114.50, also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' tracking stock reflects its financial performance, but does not
represent any ownership stake in the company, which will remain a wholly owned
subsidiary of GM.
</P>
<P>
	   The move will reduce the number of GM shares on the market, driving up GM's
earnings per share. The transaction will also reduce GM's hoard of Hughes stock
from 68 percent to 35 percent, or about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts had been expecting some kind of move from GM on its
Hughes stock for months, as Hughes enjoyed a strong run in a market hungry for
technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The former defense electronics specialist has become a leader in the
satellite television business; its DirecTV service has 8 million subscribers.
Hughes is also building a $1.4 billion wireless data network called Spaceway
that it expects to unveil in 2003. The system will use satellites to connect
users to the Internet at high speeds and to swap data with each other.
</P>
<P>
	   While GM has not been shy about selling or spinning off businesses, company
leaders say they have no such plans for Hughes. GM has been looking at ways to
squeeze more profits out of each vehicle by selling services such as Internet
access, its OnStar security system or satellite radio -- all of which require
expertise in wireless and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
	   One example: Smith said last month that Hughes scientists had figured out a
way to use satellite radio services to carry video signals, making a satellite
TV service for vehicles possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no current plans or intentions to separate Hughes from GM," said J.
Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer. "We continue to like the Hughes
growth opportunities and the telecommunications synergies."
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities said the deal would likely be a
good compromise between GM's need to stay in control of Hughes and Wall Street's
clamor for a full spin-off.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not as good a deal as if GM had spun off the whole Hughes business,"
Healy said. "But they balanced the need of the corporation with the needs of
shareholders."

<HEADLINE> Progress on Nazi Compensation Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- German negotiators have backed down on a plan that
threatened to stall talks over how to distribute $5.2 billion in compensation
for Nazi-era slave and forced laborers, the head U.S. negotiator said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat said German negotiator Otto
Lambsdorff agreed in talks ended Tuesday that Germany will revise draft
legislation that would have deducted compensation money in cases of victims who
had already received payments under previous German World War II restitution
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference at the end of two days of talks, Eizenstat noted that
the U.S. government and victims' representatives opposed the plan, which he
called ``a potential deal breaker'' in a year-old effort to compensate laborers
as well as some other categories of Holocaust survivors. Those include people
subjected to medical experiments and children deported from their homelands when
their parents were taken to Germany from surrounding nations for labor.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators for German government and industry, victims and five European
governments were meeting to work out how to divide $5.2 billion Germany pledged
last month toward the so-called German Foundation Initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative, partly in answer to lawsuits filed in the United States, is
to compensate for the first time people forced to do unpaid labor in support of
the Nazi war machine. In return for setting up the fund, German government and
industry would get what Eizenstat called ``legal peace'' -- a promise the U.S.
government will oppose any further lawsuits seeking Holocaust-related claims in
U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has paid $60 billion in reparations and compensation for a number of
Holocaust wrongs, including persecution, imprisonment, destruction of peoples'
health. But until this initiative, it has not paid the millions forced to work
for companies, farms, municipalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Most who would receive money from the fund are Christians forced into work
as Germany overran Central and Eastern European countries during the war.
Negotiators differ greatly on the number of laborers still surviving. Estimates
run from 1.3 million to 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat said agreement that there would not be a so-called ``offset'' for
previous payment was ``the most important breakthrough'' in this week's talks.
He said further negotiations on how to set up and administer the foundation
initiative will continue Feb. 18-19 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Allocation of money among victims is expected to be another extremely sticky
issue. At this point, victims' lawyers have different ideas on how much should
be paid to each forced laborer, how much to a slave laborer meant to be worked
to death, how much to agricultural workers and so on.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 130 German companies have announced they will participate in the
fund, but only about $1 billion has been pledged, less than half industry's
share in the $5.2 billion fund, said fund spokesman Wolfgang Gibowski.
</P>
<P>
	   The German Chamber of Commerce said last month it had sent letters to
220,000 companies nationwide in an attempt to drum up more support.

<HEADLINE> Sprint Beats Wall Street Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp.'s profit rose 3 percent for the fourth
quarter as growth in its core long-distance and local telephone businesses
helped the company beat Wall Street forecasts. The Sprint PCS wireless business
posted a bigger than expected loss for the quarter even as revenues more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported Tuesday that its FON Group, which doesn't include
Sprint PCS, earned $416 million in the three months ended Dec. 31, improving
from $404 million in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share held steady at 47 cents, however, because there's more
Sprint stock on the market now than a year ago. Even so, analysts had predicted
earnings of 39 cents per share in the latest fourth quarter, according to a
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues in the quarter rose 8 percent to $4.4 billion from 4 billion in the
last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sprint PCS wireless group lost $706 million or $1.50 per share in the
fourth quarter. That was wider than most analyst forecasts and 1998's
fourth-quarter loss of $647 million, which broke down to $1.52 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues more than doubled to $996 million compared with 1998's
fourth-quarter tally of $437 million, as the company added more than 1 million
new subscribers in the quarter compared to 836,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint FON includes the company's long distance, local calling, product
distribution and directory publishing businesses, as well as the new Sprint ION
high-speed voice and data network.
</P>
<P>
	   In the FON Group, the quarterly results were dampened again by a loss of
$115 million or 9 cents a share from Sprint ION as the company continued to
develop and deploy the new high-speed voice and data service. In the fourth
quarter of 1998, losses from Sprint ION totaled $65 million or 5 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the FON Group, a 20 percent increase in long-distance calling
volume helped boost revenues in that sector to $2.71 billion, up from $2.52
billion in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues from local telephone service rose 7 percent to $1.48 billion,
reflecting an increase in usage as more people installed second telephone lines
for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Sprint FON earned $1.57 billion or $1.78 per share, up
slightly from $1.54 billion or $1.77 per share in 1998. Revenues for the year
totaled $17 billion, up 8 percent from $15.8 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint PCS lost $2.5 billion or $5.46 per share for the year, which compared
to a loss of $1.1 billion or $4.50 per share in 1998. Revenues totaled $3.2
billion in 1999, an increase of 160 percent from 1998 revenues of $1.2 bilion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Sprint FON fell $1.25 to $63.37  1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange, while Sprint PCS was rose $1.75 per share to
$111.81 1/4, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 100.52  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose on the eve of the Federal Reserve interest rate
announcement as investors bet that even a significant spike in borrowing costs
won't stop U.S. companies from posting strong profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.52 to close at 11,041.05, building
on its 201-point gain on Monday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 111.63 to
4,051.98, its sharpest point gain since Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 14.82 to 1,409.28.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping for much of the morning, stocks rose amid a growing sense
that despite rising interest rates, which can cut into corporate profits, many
U.S. companies will be able to extend their strong profit performances from 1999
well into 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings story continues to come in very strong across the board," said
Chris Wolfe, equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private client group. The
companies that comprise the S&AMP;P 500 have posted average profit growth of 20.9
percent for the fourth quarter of 1999, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe said strong earnings helped distract investors from concerns that
interest rates are headed sharply higher in a continuing effort to slow the pace
of the nation's economic growth. As of Tuesday, the U.S. economy set a record
for the longest expansion ever -- 107 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The new record coincided with the start of the Fed's two-day meeting in
Washington, where central bankers are expected to announce Wednesday a
quarter-percentage point increase in short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 to keep inflation under
control, and many economists expect at least three more increases this year
unless the economy begins to demonstrate evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest suggestion that higher rates are on the way came Tuesday from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which said in its monthly survey
that manufacturing activity continues to grow and the price of raw materials is
escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt corporate profits by raising the cost of
borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
	   "When interest rates are rising, you look to companies that are accelerating
their sales growth enough to compensate," Wolfe said. "Last year, technology was
the sector that was able to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday, technology stocks gained ground as investors bet that they can
repeat their strong performance in 2000. Cisco Systems rose 8 5/16 to 117 13/16,
Qualcomm rose 9 1/16 to 136 1/16 and Microsoft gained 5 1/16 to 102 15/16,
buoying the Dow.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the buying came from bargain-hunting investors eager to purchase
well-known technology names after many stocks in the sector fell last week, said
Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the same old culprits who were just waiting for these tech stocks to
come back to more reasonable prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong corporate earnings in more traditional companies once again provided
some spark to the market. Tricon Global Restaurants, which operates the Pizza
Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, rose 2 1/8 to 30 3/4 after saying it expects to
substantially exceed analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors rose 4 11/16 to 85 1/4 and Wal-Mart rose 3 15/16 to 58 11/16,
padding the Dow's gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnstone Systems made a powerful debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market, closing
at 97 after being priced at 29 per share. Turnstone makes products that allow
local telephone companies to put in and maintain digital subscriber lines
quickly to allow their customers broader data access.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.17 billion shares, down from 1.19 billion
in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.52 to 503.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 3.1 percent and France's CAC-40 rose 2.0 percent, rebounding from
heavy losses on Monday. Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> AmeriServe Files for Bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- This week's bankruptcy filing by a fast-growing Texas food
distributor has thrown a scare into restaurants that depend on the company for
everything from paper napkins to pizza fixings.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc., the nation's largest supplier to
restaurants, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 percent of the distributor's accounts are with Tricon Global
Restaurants Inc., which owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell and accounts for about
40 percent of AmeriServe's accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   David Novak, chief executive of the Louisville, Ky.-based Tricon, said in a
statement that the bankruptcy filing should lead to a short-term financing plan
for AmeriServe "that we expect will ensure a continued supply to our restaurants
with minimal service disruptions."
</P>
<P>
	   But Tricon, which extended an unsecured $15 million loan to AmeriServe and
is owed about $40 million by the company, said it is talking with other food
distributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Tyson Foods Inc. said they were caught off-guard.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd been told as recently as last week by AmeriServe this wasn't going to
occur," said Ed Nicholson, a spokesman for the poultry company, based in
Springdale, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholson said Tyson had extended $25 million in trade credits to AmeriServe
and is also concerned about restaurants not getting their chicken.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe chairman and chief executive John V. Holten and other company
officials remained unavailable for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe grew from a 1996 deal that joined two acquisition-minded food
companies. The following year, it more than doubled in size with the $830
million purchase of PFS, PepsiCo's food-service business. A year later,
AmeriServe gobbled up ProSource for $320 million, creating a company with $4
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had too much debt and took on more than they could handle in two large
acquisitions," said Robert Cummins, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The Addison-based company's bankruptcy petition didn't list assets and
debts, but in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
November, it reported assets of less than $2 billion and liabilities of slightly
more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts expect rivals to benefit from AmeriServe's problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be some opportunities for SYSCO and U.S. Foodservice in terms of
potentially getting some business and you'll see stronger margins because of
stronger negotiating power of the existing distributors," said Greg
Badishkanian, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the legacy of AmeriServe's purchase of PepsiCo's distribution
business in 1997 is that the distributor still has close ties to Pizza Hut, KFC
and Taco Bell, which PepsiCo spun off.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think it's important to stay with AmeriServe and work through this,"
said Troy Cook, chief financial officer of NPC International Inc., the largest
Pizza Hut franchisee with 785 restaurants in 26 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one distribution company can step in and replace them," Cook said. "For
us to replace them, it would take a patchwork system of several distributors."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, AmeriServe's largest customers might have no choice but to stand
beside the distributor -- and even invest money to keep it going -- because they
can't replace AmeriServe with any single rival. said Cummins, the Schroder
analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Del. The company distributes food, beverages and other
supplies to more than 30 fast-food and casual-dining chains with about 36,000
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for AmeriServe said Monday that the company has more than 1,000
creditors and expects to be able to make some kind of repayment to its unsecured
creditors. He declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe reported last fall that sales were dropping and that it would cut
1,500 jobs, about 15 percent of its work force, and raise at least $110 million
by selling assets and reducing inventories. Standard &AMP; Poor's put a credit watch
on the company in November.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Med Records Opening Pushed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Six human rights groups on Tuesday joined Belgium in formally
requesting a review of a judge's decision to leave Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
medical records confidential.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty International and five other organizations filed an application
seeking a judicial review before a panel of senior High Court judges. It is
expected to be heard next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The move follows a High Court judge's decision Monday to reject a request by
Belgium and the human rights groups to challenge the secrecy of the medical
report, which found the former Chilean dictator unfit to stand trial in Spain on
allegations of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's top law enforcement official, Home Secretary Jack Straw, has said
he will not rule on whether to extradite Pinochet while court action is pending.
However, he announced earlier this month that he is inclined to let the
84-year-old general return home, citing the report by the independent medical
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium, France and Switzerland are also seeking Pinochet's extradition on
behalf of citizens of their countries who contend their relatives were jailed or
killed in Chile. Only Belgium is involved in the legal challenge to see
Pinochet's medical records, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium and the human rights groups want to review the records before
Straw's final ruling -- which also can be appealed -- but Straw has refused,
citing Pinochet's right to patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling, High Court Justice Maurice Kay dismissed Belgium's arguments
and held that the human rights groups have no legal standing in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty spokesman Claudio Cordone disagreed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do think we have a strong case and it is a perfectly legal business of
ours to raise objections to the process. We've been doing it for 30 years in all
sorts of contexts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other groups involved are Human Rights Watch, the Redress Trust, the
Association of Relatives of the Disappeared, Justicia and the Medical Foundation
for the Care of the Victims of Torture.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Spain's Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit aimed at forcing
Spain to appeal if Britain decides to free Pinochet rather than extradite him.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling allows Foreign Minister Abel Matutes to keep his pledge to
respect the ruling expected by Straw to free the aging general.
</P>
<P>
	   Joan Garces, a lawyer working to get Pinochet extradited, accused Matutes
last week of withholding documents that might help the case of those who want
Pinochet to stand trial. The Foreign Ministry denies it withheld any papers it
should have passed on.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested during a visit to Britain in October 1998 while
recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital. He has spent the past 15
months fighting extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
during the general's 1973-90 dictatorship.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which runs the Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, expects to
substantially exceed analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and the
year. Tricon said it got better-than-expected performance from its base business
and benefited from lower insurance costs and a lower tax rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., which plan to merge, agreed to swap
wireless operations in 13 states with Alltel. The swap will clear the way for
Bell Atlantic's joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The utility company said it will create a tracking stock in an effort to
improve its balance sheet and pay down debt. The stock will represent 20 percent
of the financial interest in Consumers Energy, its electric and gas utility, and
is expected to raise about $600 million.
</P>
<P>
	   An analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston cut his rating on the stock to
"hold" from "buy." U.S. Foodservice is a food-service distributor.
</P>
<P>
	   Salomon Smith Barney launched coverage of the wireless communications
company with a "buy" rating. Analyst Michael Rollins said Nextel is poised to
benefit from increased use of cellular phones as it focuses on the business
market.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it will delay the release of its fourth-quarter and
fiscal-year results by about seven days because its audit is not complete.
Brokerage Raymond James &AMP; Associates cut its rating on the company, an
information technology provider.
</P>
<P>
	   Andersen and Moscow Telecommunications Corp. formed a joint venture to build
and operate full-service broadband access networks in Moscow. The venture will
provide cable television and high-speed Internet access for individual
subscribers and businesses in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The company signed a licensing agreement with Microsoft Corp. which will
allow its software to be bundled with Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0. Prophet 21

</P>
<P>
	   Some employers encourage their staff to play games to relieve stress; others
resent office computers being used for diversion.
</P>

	   In all, about 42 percent of employees surf the Web during their breaks: 16

according to Consumer Reports Travel Letter.

<P>
	   Airlines like the new generation of 737s because they're more
fuel-efficient. But passengers won't be so happy.
</P>
<P>
	   The new planes are more cramped, with seats about 17-inches wide, about an
inch or so less than on most long-distance jets. The toilet-to-passenger ratio
has been trimmed too. On the up-side? Larger overhead bins and entrainment
consoles have been added, and the extended range of the new planes means more
choices for fliers who might prefer to fly nonstop and avoid big hub airports.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Firms Expand Services  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Everybody wants more of your money, and your stock broker
is no exception. To get it, brokerage firms are offering more of the services
your bank does, such as savings accounts, home loans and estate planning.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider these recent announcements:
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch said Tuesday it will offer federally insured savings accounts
to many of its brokerage customers, and will expand its online mortgage
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, American Express announced new products for its online bank,
which was launched in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Charles Schwab announced a $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S.
Trust Corp., a New York-based bank for wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in January, ETrade, a big online brokerage, completed its purchase of
Telebank, an Internet bank, and plans to offer customers a brokerage account
linked to a federally insured bank account.
</P>
<P>
	   This transformation of the brokerage industry is expected to accelerate
thanks to a law passed late last year eliminating the Depression-inspired
barriers that separated banks, brokerage and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each side is eating in the other's backyard," said Samuel Hayes, professor
of finance at Harvard School of Business, who expects the trend will drive down
the cost of banking and brokerage services due to greater competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch, the world's largest brokerage firm, is expanding its Cash
Management Account, which currently allows customers to buy stocks, write some
checks, invest in money market accounts, and which also offers a Visa credit
card.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch requires $20,000 to open a Cash Management Account, but the
money is not currently federally insured. Soon, the company will give customers
the option of putting some of their money in savings accounts, which are
insured.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch can then use the savings deposits to make home loans and
business loans to more customers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers of Merrill Lynch currently have $119 billion in taxable money
market accounts. If that money were transferred into savings accounts, Merrill
Lynch would rank 10th on the list of biggest U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Hayes, the Harvard professor, said Merrill isn't trying to be your
local bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't want us to write all of our checks to the local dry cleaners,
it's not profitable to them," he said. "So they are not really wanting to take
the place of the banks, they just want to skim some more of the cream."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Merrill's competitors are also going after the cream.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Schwab, which has dominated online trading, announced on Jan. 13 its
acquisition of U.S. Trust as part of a strategy to offer trust, financial and
estate planning and private banking services.
</P>
<P>
	   While Schwab and Merrill Lynch are aiming at well-heeled customers,
investors with fewer resources can now do their banking with ETrade.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its acquisition of Telebank, ETrade plans to launch its own cash
management account in the spring, allowing customers to link their brokerage
accounts to their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Telebank, which is federally insured, offers customers no-fee,
interest-bearing checking and savings accounts for those who maintain a minimum
balance of $500. It also offers rebates on ATM fees of $6 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The new services will make ETrade more competitive with American Express,
which is best known for its credit cards and travel services, but also offers
banking and stock trading.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, American Express said it would expand its online bank to include
a no-fee, federally insured checking account that earns 2 percent interest, with
a $100 minimum balance. The bank also will offer a money-market account earning
an attractive 5.65 percent interest rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Online banking offers values and advantages that bricks-and-mortar branches
cannot match, said Ruediger Adolf, senior vice president of strategic planning
and business development at American Express. The biggest reason is that online
banks don't have the tremendous overhead costs of running a network of branches
so they can offer better interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But your neighborhood bank probably isn't worried too much about these new
competitors. Check your mailbox -- it is probably trying to get you to open a
stock brokerage account.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Down Vs. Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose Tuesday to the highest level in nearly four
months against the Japanese yen as traders expected continued strength in the
U.S. economy and an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The
beleaguered euro hit another new low, then recovered some lost ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 107.78 yen late Tuesday, up from 107.42 yen Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   With the U.S. economy this month achieving the longest expansion in its
history, currency traders have been pushing the dollar higher relative to the
currencies of Europe and Japan, which have slower growth rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Expectations that the Federal Reserve will nudge U.S. interest rates higher
Wednesday has also been adding to the dollar's appeal. Europe and Japan have
relatively lower interest rates, and another increase by the Fed would widen the
gap further, making dollar-denominated investments that much more attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro edged higher against the dollar in New York trading Tuesday after
falling to a new low of 96.68 cents in early European trading. By the end of the
trading day in New York, the euro was quoted at 97.28 cents, up from 96.99 cents
late Monday and Monday's low of 96.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   European financial authorities have so far seemed reluctant to step into
currency markets to influence the level of their year-old currency, and foreign
exchange traders have been testing the European Central Bank to see how far down
they can push the euro. But the ECB meets again Thursday and is beginning to
voice worries that a persistently weak euro will heighten inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6550 Swiss francs, down from 1.6580, and
1.4464 Canadian dollars, just below its level of 1.4467 late Monday. The British
pound edged lower to $1.6145 from $1.6150.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Tuesday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0104 German marks, down from 2.0165; 6.7426
French francs, down from 6.7631; and 1,990.31 Italian lire, down from 1,996.36.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Handling of Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA director George Tenet insisted Tuesday he took
``decisive action'' when faced with an investigation's finding that former
director John Deutch violated security by working on secret material at home.
</P>
<P>
	   His decision to strip his former boss of his security clearances proved that
he acted properly, Tenet said. He denied that the investigation was deliberately
delayed, despite a CIA inquiry that suggested he and other top agency officials
acted to slow down the process.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the classified August 1999 report by the CIA's inspector general
were reported Tuesday by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Tenet confirmed existence of the inspector general's report
but said he had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done, decisive action
was taken, and steps have been implemented to improve our security process,''
Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said reports such as the
still-classified one by the CIA inspector general raise ``fundamental
questions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to be a pattern. I think it's very troublesome,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., chairman of a
presidentially-appointed commission which oversees intelligence issues, said he
had followed the matter from 1998 when the CIA ``very properly'' notified his
oversight panel about the inquiry into Deutch's behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tenet did exactly what he should have done'' in stripping his predecessor
of his security clearances, Rudman said. ``Did he act quickly enough? That's a
subjective matter,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look
into the handling of the case. The panel still is at work, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate intelligence committee,
said his committee would conduct an investigation once the special CIA panel's
work is complete.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch's access to
classified information. Deutch violated agency rules by keeping secret files on
an unsecured computer at his home, the CIA said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to congressional and administration officials familiar with the
report, Deutch deleted over a thousand files from his computer once he learned
about the investigation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, the inspector general said there was no evidence that any of
the information had fallen into the hands of a foreign power, said the
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. At the same time, it could
not be proven that there had not been such a security breach, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, Deutch used the classified material for a variety of
writing projects, the officials said. At the time, he was serving as a
consultant to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter comes against a backdrop of the government's prosecution of Wen
Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, on charges of
mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving
classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Lee, who was not
charged with espionage, is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are able to work on
classified material at home, but stringent safeguards are in place involving
their computers, including lockable hard drives, safes for depositing laptops
when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy praised
Tenet for taking ``strong, decisive and unprecedented action'' in the Deutch
matter. Leavy also said he sees no parallels to Lee's case, and no double
standard at work in the treatment of a top-ranking intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had his security clearance revoked. That is quite punitive for a former
director of the Central Intelligence Agency,'' Leavy said during the regular
White House briefing for reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday for an annual
report on world threats, and the issue of security could come up.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public
service, was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When leaving his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home for routine checks to ensure that
secrets were properly protected. They found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 1999, the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Deutch but
recommended that the CIA review his continued suitability to hold high-level
security clearances. Justice concluded Deutch's security lapses were reckless
rather than criminal. Deutch apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times story did not accuse Tenet or his aides of violating laws in their
handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The article in the newspaper this morning raised the rhetorical question,
`Can the CIA police itself?' The answer is that we can, and we did,'' Tenet
said.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Industry Sets New Rules  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stung by revelations of widespread rule violations at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an accounting industry group adopted new industry
guidelines to ensure that accountants remain independent from the companies they
audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said Tuesday it would
require the nation's top five accounting firms to set up more rigorous internal
control systems to make sure that accountants don't violate rules prohibiting
them from owning stock in the companies under their scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   The new oversight measures, which include training programs for accountants
and strengthening inspection processes, are expected to cost the five top firms
-- which dominate the accounting industry -- about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came less than a month after an independent review found
that nearly half the partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers reported having violated
rules prohibiting them from owning stock in companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The revelations were an embarrassment for public accountants, whose mission
is to serve as independent arbiters of the way publicly traded companies keep
their books.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into PricewaterhouseCoopers began a year ago after the
Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that the firm compromised its
independence by owning stock in corporations they audited. As part of a
settlement, the firm also agreed to create a $2.5 million education fund to
ensure the problems did not recur.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC, which is continuing its investigation of PWC, gave the new rules a
cautious welcome. "This is a first step in ensuring that the firms comply with
elementary independence rules," said SEC spokesman Chris Ullman. "But while
systems changes are helpful, the culture needs to change as well."
</P>
<P>
	   The new proposals include broader oversight measures for the five top firms,
such as formalizing disciplinary steps for rule violators and modernizing
language used in the rules about stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Conway, chairman of the group's SEC Practice Section Executive
Committee, said too many of the rules "have become disconnected from the
realities of how business is conducted and how society has evolved in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Melancon, president of the accountants' group, told reporters in a
conference call that he expected most of the new provisions to be in place by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the new measures "most intensive set of compliance rules for
independence that have ever been issued for the profession."
</P>
<P>
	   The other Big Five firms are Andersen Worldwide, KPMG Peat Marwick, Deloitte
&AMP; Touche and Ernst &AMP; Young.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Steelworkers Put Off Rally  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN K. WILEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A protest rally at the Boeing company by locked-out
steelworkers from Kaiser Aluminum Corp. was canceled Tuesday because of the
crash of an Alaska Airlines jetliner.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the United Steelworkers of America and supporters had planned to
gather in front of Boeing's corporate headquarters in Seattle, then deliver more
than 10,000 postcards to the office of Boeing's chairman, Phil Condit, to ask
the airline to stop using Kaiser metals in its planes. A demonstration also had
been planned at Boeing's Wichita, Kan., plant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Out of respect to the family members and friends of the passengers and
flight crew on Alaska Airlines flight 261, we are canceling our Boeing rally
today," the union said in a release. No plans have been made for rescheduling
the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing in 1997 bought McDonnell Douglas, which makes the MD-83, the jetliner
that crashed in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast Monday with 88 people
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor dispute began when more than 3,000 Steelworkers struck five Kaiser
plants in September 1998. The company locked the union employees out in January
1999 and continued to use replacement workers and managers to operate the
plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaiser said Boeing is "a significant customer" of rolled aluminum from
Kaiser's Trentwood mill in the Spokane Valley. Boeing has said it will honor its
contracts with Kaiser, and will continue to hold the aluminum company to the
highest quality standards.

<HEADLINE> 4 Militants Arrested in Mauritania  </HEADLINE>
   By SHEIKH BEKAYE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) -- Mauritania has arrested four Islamic
militants suspected of having links to millionaire fugitive Osama bin Laden,
security officials in this West African nation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests were part of an inquiry into allegations that a Mauritanian,
Mohambedou Ould Slahi, plotted bomb attacks against the United States, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They did not say who was
arrested or when.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was arrested in Mauritania after leaving neighboring Senegal last
week. He had been living in Canada but left there in part because of an
investigation into an alleged bomb plot U.S. authorities say was linked to bin
Laden, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials accuse bin Laden, a Saudi believed to be living in
Afghanistan, of masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in 1999, Mauritanian authorities arrested more than a dozen Muslims
for alleged ties to bin Laden. All were later released without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times has reported that Slahi's brother-in-law is one of bin
Laden's top lieutenants. However, a U.S. law enforcement official said on
condition of anonymity that U.S. investigators are unsure of this.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators also are not sure if Slahi was a major figure in the alleged
bombing plot, or just a minor messenger, the official in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
	   No specific evidence has been released linking bin Laden to the newly
alleged bombing plot. Authorities have not said what the targets of that plot
might have been.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian authorities have said Slahi left Canada sometime after Dec. 14,
when authorities uncovered the alleged plot. That's when they arrested Ahmed
Ressam for allegedly trying to smuggle bomb-making components into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, an Algerian, pleaded innocent Thursday in federal court in Seattle
to charges of planning a terrorist bombing.

<HEADLINE> High-Interest Lender Regs Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate rebuffed an attempt by some Democrats on
Tuesday to make it harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect debts
from people who have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate voted, 53-44, to reject an amendment proposed by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging more
than 100 percent annual interest in recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of legislation
that would make it more difficult for people to erase their debts through
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said a $1 increase in the $5.15 hourly
minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House and
Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion in small-business tax breaks proposed
by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The current bill, which appeared headed toward likely Senate passage on
Wednesday, has been pushed by banks, credit card companies and retail-business
groups. Proponents say the overhaul of bankruptcy laws is needed to stem abuse
by people who can afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation favors
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. They insist
that the credit card companies share the blame by flooding consumers with mailed
solicitations to entice them into easy credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved bankruptcy overhaul legislation last May by a veto-proof
margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration, which supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws
in principle, has criticized the House and Senate versions as being too hard on
debtors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the minimum wage-tax breaks provision, the Senate bill
contains several other provisions unrelated to bankruptcy: tightened penalties
for selling illegal drugs to minors, a narrowing of the disparity in sentences
for sales of powder and crack cocaine and stiffer penalties for makers of the
illegal drug methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone's defeated proposal opened a debate on so-called payday loans --
small, short-term cash advances against a borrower's paycheck that carry
triple-digit interest rates. Wellstone called the businesses making them
``unscrupulous loan sharks.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
insisted that payday loans are ``a legitimate service that many honest consumers
use.''
</P>
<P>
	   A report released Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of America and U.S.
Public Interest Research Group found that consumers are paying 300 percent or
more, on an annual basis, for payday loans. Consumer groups have maintained that
some businesses skirt state laws by making payday loans through out-of-state
national banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry officials have acknowledged that there are problems, including
cases of excessive use of ``rollovers,'' in which consumers are unable to repay
the loans and they are extended for two more weeks or so. However, they say, no
new federal regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our product fills a tremendous market need and is enthusiastically
embraced by millions of working Americans,'' Billy Webster, president of the
company Advance America and head of the Community Financial Services
Association, said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The loans are legal in 31 states. The industry earned an estimated $1.4
billion last year.

<HEADLINE> College Sports Betting Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The point-shaving scheme that landed Kevin Pendergast in
a federal prison began with illegal bribes to Northwestern basketball players.
It ended with his cohort doing something legal -- walking into a Las Vegas
casino and placing bets on the fixed games.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without Nevada, without the option of betting money in Nevada, the
Northwestern basketball point-shaving scandal would not have occurred,''
Pendergast said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pendergast, 28, who spent two months in prison for his role in fixing three
Big Ten basketball games in 1995, lent his story and his support to a bill
introduced Tuesday that would ban betting on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   He bolstered a fundamental argument of the measure's sponsors -- that legal
sports gambling in Nevada promotes and legitimizes widespread illegal sports
betting on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sports gambling has become a black eye on too many of our colleges and
universities,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who is sponsoring the
legislation with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada is the only state that allows widespread sports betting. The state's
gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports wagers in fiscal 1999, with 30
percent to 40 percent bet on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the National Federation
of State High School Associations were among those joining Brownback and Leahy
during a news conference touting the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Wethington, president of the University of Kentucky and chairman of
the NCAA executive committee, said a ban would strengthen the NCAA's
long-running argument that newspapers should stop publishing point spreads for
college games. The NCAA believes the spreads encourage betting.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada lawmakers and other gambling supporters criticized the proposed ban
as misguided.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., called it ``a red herring, an exercise in
finger-pointing'' that blames Nevada for the nationwide problem of illegal
sports gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who lobbies for casinos as president of the American
Gaming Association, said the bill ``amounts to an ineffective Band-Aid on a
campus cancer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said they will
introduce competing legislation asking the Justice Department to study illegal
gambling on campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a frequent critic of the gambling industry said the bill misses the
point.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to help, but it's not going to solve the real problem,'' said
Arnie Wexler, former executive director of New Jersey's Council on Compulsive
Gambling. ``The real problem is what's going on on the campus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress banned sports betting in most states in 1992, but exempted Nevada.
Leahy called Nevada's exemption ``a loophole'' that should be closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which spent two years
studying all aspects of gambling, last year recommended banning wagering on
collegiate and amateur athletic events.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownback and Leahy's bill also would prohibit wagering on high school
sports and Olympic events. Representatives of Nevada's gambling industry say
there is little legal betting on the Olympics and none on high school sports.

<HEADLINE> Maintenance Bars America West Planes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- America West Airlines will not be allowed to add to its
fleet until it improves the maintenance of planes it already has, the Federal
Aviation Administration has told the carrier.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA told the nation's No. 9 carrier last week by letter that it must
improve maintenance before the agency would authorize additional aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, America West announced plans to add 27 Airbus aircraft. Three
were to be in service by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline denied it lacks adequate maintenance and accused the FAA's
Phoenix office of promoting a "contentious environment" between it and the
airline.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Rosenhahn, FAA supervisor in Phoenix, said in a Jan. 25 letter that his
agency's concerns include "extremely low levels" of aircraft reliability, based
on the number of maintenance-related delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   America West also has flown planes beyond maintenance deadlines and has "an
acute shortage of properly trained ramp workers" who direct and service planes
at the gates. The airline's ineffective management oversight has led to minor
accidents at the gates, Rosenhahn said.
</P>
<P>
	   America West was fined $5 million in 1998 over maintenance problems, though
half of it was forgiven when the FAA said the airline had improved.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenhahn, who had objected to forgiving the second half of the 1998 fine,
said adding planes would create additional demands that would "serve only to
accelerate the negative consequences associated with rapid growth."
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert Mook, the airline's chief operating officer, said America West has
doubled the number of heavy maintenance repair lines and has added a vice
president of base maintenance and director of planning.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said America West has resolved 73 of 103 maintenance concerns raised
by the FAA and is working to address the remaining items.
</P>
<P>
	   America West spokesman Steve Johnson said the FAA action could delay plans
to retire some of airline's oldest Boeing 737 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   America West has one of the best safety records in the industry. It has
never crashed an aircraft in more than 16 years of flying. However, it has one
of the worst reliability records among major airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   An FAA crackdown that halted maintenance deadline extensions led to a rash
of cancellations in early November.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, the National Transportation Safety Board said its preliminary
investigation of a September in-flight accident that injured four flight
attendants was linked to a faulty ground-proximity warning system that had been
reported by America West pilots but had not been repaired.

<HEADLINE> Wider FBI Crime Fighting Role Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The attorney general and the FBI should have more
authority to coordinate the fight against new and increasingly dangerous forms
of crime, a congressional commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement, formed in part
in response to such contentious law enforcement episodes as the standoffs at
Ruby Ridge and Waco, recommended that the FBI take over enforcement functions of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The ATF is part of the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-drug effort of the Drug Enforcement Administration should become a
separate division of the FBI, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has failed to act on similar recommendations in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Much of today's current structure is based on problems of the past, such
as Prohibition,'' said former FBI Director William H. Webster, chairman of the
five-member commission. ``The nation critically requires a federal law
enforcement establishment that is ready to meet the crime problems of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those problems include global criminal cartels, cybercrime and domestic and
international terrorism, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in a
joint statement, said: ``We have previously considered, studied and rejected the
idea of merging the ATF and DEA into the FBI. We believe such a merger would be
unnecessary and would be detrimental to our law enforcement efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Commission member Donald Dahlin of the University of South Dakota said
fighting such new threats ``will be an increasingly difficult task'' if federal
law enforcement is not coordinated better.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the attorney general should be responsible for overseeing
all major federal law enforcement policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Created by Congress in 1996, the commission also chided Congress for its
recent tendency to ``federalize'' crimes. It said 40 percent of federal crimes
have been put on the books since 1970, and the total now is more than 3,000.
``This situation threatens to overwhelm federal law enforcement capacities, just
as dramatic and serious new law enforcement challenges grow in intensity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Webster acknowledged that others in the past, going back to Lyndon Johnson,
attempted, with limited success, to restructure the ATF or consolidate law
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   He said adoption of his commission's recommendations ``is possible if
Congress agrees the need is there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said his panel
``will study the report and review its recommendations.'' A hearing was
scheduled Thursday on the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster said that while such events as Ruby Ridge and Waco had become
``metaphors'' for some recent problems in law enforcement, they were only part
of a larger picture that included real successes such as law enforcement
coordination after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI was deeply involved in both the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and 1993
Waco, Texas, incidents. At Ruby Ridge, the wife and son of white separatist
Randy Weaver and a deputy U.S. marshal died. At Waco, which began with a botched
ATF raid on the Branch Davidians religious sect's complex, the FBI was in charge
for most of the standoff that ended in the complex's destruction by fire, with
more than 80 people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also recommended that law enforcement and intelligence
agencies coordinate their activities better, that global crime be made a
national law enforcement priority and that Congress require that law enforcement
agencies establish new standards for professionalism and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Generous to Hastert  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert continues to be one of
Congress' top recipients of health care dollars, collecting $113,000 from the
industry for his campaign committees in the last half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The transportation sector also was a healthy contributor, with truck
dealers, Federal Express, the Big Three automakers and others combining to give
$32,000 of the $817,000 Hastert raised. The money was raised for his re-election
committee and his Keep Our Majority political action committee from July through
December, according to reports filed this week with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Hastert, R-Ill., took the House's top job at the beginning of
last year he had carved out a niche as his party's standard-bearer on health
care issues, and the industry has been a major contributor to him for years.
</P>
<P>
	   The $113,000 he collected most recently included money from all types of
insurers and many groups representing providers, such as physical therapists and
orthopedic surgeons. Major contributions included $5,000 from the American
Health Care Association, a nursing home group, $3,000 from Prudential Insurance
and $2,000 from Aetna Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   An analysis by the Washington-based watchdog organization Center for
Responsive Politics found Hastert's own campaign committee received $23,250 last
year from PACs and employees of members of the Health Benefits Coalition. The
collection of health, insurance and business groups lobbies against managed care
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's take was the second-highest in the House, according to CRP. He
also had the second-largest donation total from pharmaceutical companies, which
are fighting a broader Democratic plan to provide a prescription benefits for
Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, efforts to give patients new rights in dealing with managed care
companies grabbed the spotlight as Hastert saw dozens of his Republican
colleagues defect and help Democrats pass a bill that would allow patients to
sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate version, more to the liking of health insurers, does not allow
patient lawsuits. But GOP leaders have indicated they may be ready to compromise
on the issue, which is popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FEC filings, Hastert raised $633,565 for his own campaign
committee and $183,441 for his leadership PAC during the last six months of
1999. He gave $118,000 to GOP congressional candidates, plus $75,000 to the
House Republican Campaign Committee.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Trade Deficit Shrinks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Soaring exports helped to shrink Brazil's trade
deficit to $94 million in January from $696 million a year ago, the Development
Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Exports rose to $3.453 billion in January, up 17 percent from a year
earlier, the ministry's foreign trade secretary, Lytha Spindola, said. Imports
dipped to $3.547 billion, down 3 percent from January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Brazil's currency collapsed and the economy spun into recession
as problems in Asia and Russia spilled over into Latin America. Today, the
Brazilian currency, the real, is 33 percent cheaper and the economy has started
growing again.
</P>
<P>
	   The government predicts a trade surplus of around $4 billion this year,
compared to a deficit of $1.2 billion in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bid To Resell Wireless License Nixed  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal court has rejected a bid by the Federal
Communications Commission to take back valuable airwave licenses from a bankrupt
wireless company and reauction them.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ruled on
Monday that the FCC exceeded its authority Jan. 12 by declaring that NextWave
Telecom's licenses had been revoked because the company failed to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, emboldened by a November appeals court ruling that confirmed the
agency's authority over the licenses, argued that NextWave violated FCC rules by
failing to pay the remaining $4.3 billion of the $4.7 billion the company bid
when it won a spectrum auction back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bankruptcy court rejected that argument with a stern tone, asserting
that FCC rules do not supercede the federal Bankruptcy Code.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also criticized the FCC's timing, calling it "shocking" that the
agency would take such an action after more than a year of "intense litigation"
involving three federal courts and at least five federal judges.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC declaration "conflicted with countless written and oral utterances
and acts of the FCC throughout the past year," the ruling said, adding that the
bankruptcy court had not yet been able to rule on a new proposal by NextWave to
pay its debts and begin building a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   "Astonishingly, the January 12 Declaration followed by one day a letter from
the President of NextWave to the Chairman of the FCC offering to satisfy
NextWave's entire 10-year installment obligation to the FCC by making a single
lump sum payment."
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, anxious to put finally NextWave's portion of the airwaves to use
for consumers, had hoped to hold a new auction for the NextWave licenses in
July. With the current frenzy over wireless access to the Internet, those
licenses could fetch far more than NextWave's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the agency declined to comment specifically on the ruling, but
said it expects to file an appeal shortly.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., is one of three winning bidders in the
1996 auction that have since filed for Chapter 11, tying up the licenses in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   The NextWave licenses include spectrum in major metropolitan markets such as
New York, Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a group of investors including Global Crossing and Liberty
Media, an affiliate of AT&AMP;T, agreed to provide $1.6 billion in cash to help
NextWave emerge from bankruptcy court and build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   That process, however, could take much longer than reauctioning the licenses
to an existing wireless operator.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Stall Traffic  </HEADLINE>
   By IAN PHILLIPS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- The French government put on a brave face Tuesday as its new
35-hour workweek law came into effect against a backdrop of public transport
strikes in Paris and nationwide blockades by truckers.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second day, truckers brought traffic to a standstill at ports and
cities, blaming the government for caving in to employers' demands that trucking
companies be exempted from the law. In Paris, 50 percent of buses, suburban
train and subway services were hit by a strike. Many commuters were forced to
walk or drive to work.
</P>
<P>
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, 10,000 people rallied to protest
what they also saw as poor implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   By Tuesday evening, only a handful of barricades remained in place and all
were expected to be lifted by morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialist-led government played down Tuesday's protests. Labor Minister
Martine Aubry told lawmakers they were a result of workers simply ``assuring
that they get the best possible conditions.'' She denied the program was
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says reducing the workweek from 39 hours to 35 will help
reduce unemployment since companies will have to hire more staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders have criticized the cost of the program, accusing officials
of unnecessary meddling in the economy. Many employers say they will demand more
productivity from workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Trade unions are concerned about exactly how the law will be implemented,
and are keen to ensure workers do not see their salaries shrink.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 20 percent of the 82,000 companies nationwide that are supposed to
fully adhere to the new law have reached agreement with their employees,
officials say. But Aubry says tens of thousands of jobs have already been
created by the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's strikes coincided with the symbolic Feb. 1 deadline for French
companies with more than 20 employees to comply with the law. Other companies
have until 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The shorter workweek is the centerpiece of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's efforts to reduce a stubborn unemployment rate which, despite edging
down since he took office in mid-1997, is still hovering above the 10 percent
mark.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, French truckers blocked traffic at international borders and
around major cities to demand that their hourly rates and bonuses rise to soften
the impact of a shorter week.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers, many of whom now work double the new 35-hour limit, want a
shorter week and were infuriated after their bosses won concessions from the
government exempting them from the new law.

<HEADLINE> Quaker 4Q Earns Meet Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Riding high on Gatorade sales, Quaker Oats Co. on Tuesday
reported a modest profit gain in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The food company said that net income was $59 million, or 42 cents a share,
compared with $73.2 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, fourth-quarter earnings were $45.5 million, or 33
cents a share, up from $45 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. That
matched the estimate from analysts surveyed by First Call-Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter totaled $949.1 million, down 1.5 percent from $963.3
million a year earlier, the company said. Quaker said that excluding 1998 sales
from now-divested businesses and exchange rate differences, sales were up 2
percent year-over-year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Quaker Oats fell $3.31 1/4 to $56.06 1/4, or nearly 6 percent, in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Quaker's steady transformation from a cereal maker to a company increasingly
dependent on Gatorade paid off in a 7 percent increase in 1999 worldwide sales
for the beverage, while food sales edged up 1 percent. Gatorade accounted for
nearly 40 percent of the company's overall sales.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income totaled $455 million, or $3.23 a share, up from
$284.5 million, or $1.97 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, earnings were $393.8 million, or $2.80 a share, in
1999, compared with $334.4 million, or $2.32 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales fell 2.3 percent to $4.73 billion from $4.84 billion in 1998. The
company said that excluding foreign exchange differentials, sales in 1999 were
about even with 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Chicago-based company sacrificed some short-term earnings
by increasing its marketing budget to try to boost future sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a very good year for the company," said analyst Nomi Ghez of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. "The fourth quarter could have been much stronger if they
didn't choose to significantly increase marketing spending."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Gatorade, Quaker Oats' major brands include Quaker cereals
and snacks, Rice-A-Roni and Aunt Jemima mixes and syrup. About 75 percent of its
sales are in the United States, where it holds about two-thirds of the market
for hot cereals and more than 80 percent for sports drinks.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Deal Reached in Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Outspoken populist Joerg Haider on Tuesday
negotiated a deal to allow his far-right party to share power in Austria's
government -- despite warnings from the United States and the European Union
that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have decided to try this path,'' declared Haider. ``This government
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider and Schuessel offered no details on the composition of their
government or details of their program. But in an attempt to defuse
international criticism, both politicians pledged that tolerance would be high
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence to indicate that anyone is going to have to leave
this country,'' Haider said, referring to charges that his party's stance on
immigration is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so. Haider
and Schuessel planned to meet with Klestil on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate State Department response to the agreement, but
earlier Tuesday, spokesman James Foley said the United States is ``continuing to
keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
said it would continue a ``working relation'' with the new government as long as
it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it,'' Italy's left-wing
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Italian radio Tuesday. ``If these are
thrown into question, Europe has a right to speak its mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is only now recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented to
the Austrian ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, said Haider's party ``recalls
the dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the
Nazi regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria has been without a stable government since inconclusive
parliamentary elections Oct. 3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead
of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima's first-place Social
Democrats and the People's Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last
month, paving the way for talks with Haider's group.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Swap Systems  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and merger partner GTE Corp. are
trading wireless networks in 13 states with AllTel Corp., eliminating potential
overlaps between Bell Atlantic and Vodafone AirTouch PLC in their planned
national mobile alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Tuesday is meant to satisfy conditions set by the Justice
Department to win the federal agency's stamp of approval on Bell Atlantic's
pending acquisition of GTE and the partnership with Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   The wireless systems being traded to Arkansas-based AllTel serve 1.5 million
customers across 27 markets in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, New Mexico,
Texas and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Bell Atlantic and its partners get AllTel's majority and
minority interests in wireless systems serving 1 million customers across 42
markets in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   AllTel also agreed to pay about $600 million to Bell Atlantic, GTE and
Vodafone, and the companies signed a new national roaming agreement that will
allow their respective customers to make wireless calls on each other's networks
at reduced rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a consent decree issued Dec. 6 with the Justice Department, Bell
Atlantic still needs to sell or swap some systems to eliminate certain overlaps
that would be created by the merger with GTE.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the decree called for the three companies to agree to sell wireless
businesses in 96 markets in 15 states, the largest ever required by the
government in approving a corporate merger.
</P>
<P>
	   After the swaps with AllTel, the combined Bell Atlantic-GTE-Vodafone venture
will cover markets with 23 million wireless customers and a total population of
223 million people. AllTel will have a total of 5.8 million wireless customers
in markets with a combined population of 46 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   About 700 Bell Atlantic workers and 1,000 GTE workers will become AllTel
employees, while about 900 AllTel employees will join the new Bell Atlantic
venture.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very pleased to have reached this agreement and proceed quickly to
close our transaction with Vodafone AirTouch," said Denny Strigl, president and
CEO of Bell Atlantic Mobile and the designated president and CEO of the planned
Bell Atlantic-Vodafone business. "Further, we strengthen our national leadership
position by expanding our footprint in central Pennsylvania, the Midwest and Las
Vegas."

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Lays Out IMF Agenda  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund needs to pursue an
"active and wide-ranging agenda" to deal with the world's financial troubles,
the departing head of the agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus laid out an extensive agenda for
action by the 182-nation lending organization in a speech that ran directly
counter to recent suggestions by the Clinton administration that the IMF scale
back its activities.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hallmarks I have most admired in the IMF are its universality and its
adaptability," Camdessus told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "It
is a perennially self-reforming institution, very mindful of its obligation to
its entire membership."
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, led by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, is proposing
significant changes in how the IMF does business. It wants the IMF to focus on
short-term emergency loans and to withdraw from the business of making long-term
loans to poor countries that can obtain money from private sources such as
banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus said, however, that the IMF must maintain its "global perspective"
and make sure it serves the needs of all its members.
</P>
<P>
	   He recommended expansion of the IMF mission by officially designating the
agency as the "international lender of last resort." It often plays that role
for financially troubled countries, but such lending is not in the IMF's formal
job description.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus, former head of the Bank of France, announced last year that he
would step down as IMF managing director in February, more than a year before
his current term expires. The IMF came under heavy criticism from Congress and
others who objected to its handling of the two-year Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Various countries have put forward candidates to replace Camdessus. The
likelihood is increasing that Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, an
American, will step into the top job on an acting basis. Europeans traditionally
head the lending agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus used Tuesday's speech, copies of which were handed out in
Washington, to criticize the current decision-making mechanism of the Group of
Seven largest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Group leaders meet in an annual summit to coordinate global economic policy
better. Their finance ministers and central bank presidents also gather three
times a year to survey economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Camdessus called this process a "suboptimal solution" to managing the global
economy. The problems with the current system are highlighted by the failure of
the 135-nation World Trade Organization to launch a new round of global trade
negotiations in December as scheduled, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the trade agenda has been stalled by protests, Camdessus said he was
pleased that the world's largest countries agreed on a major program to provide
debt relief to the poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey EU Membership Takes Step  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY ULBRICH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Turkey took a first step Tuesday toward achieving
its much-anticipated goal of joining the European Union by meeting with EU
officials to hammer out a timetable for membership talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Just seven weeks after EU leaders decided that Turkey was worthy of
consideration, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in Brussels began laying out
the groundwork with top EU officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Turkish authorities have really demonstrated they are ready to pursue
vigorously our common goal,'' said the EU's commissioner for enlargement,
Guenter Verheugen.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey's entry into the 15-nation union will require resolving difficult
economic and trade issues and sticky political problems, such as Ankara's
relations with Greece and the status of Cyprus, which has been divided into
Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU currently is negotiating on membership with a dozen candidates --
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Bulgaria,
Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovakia. It had long denied Turkey's
candidacy, rejecting it on grounds that Turkey was not fully democratic and
still had serious human rights problems.
</P>
<P>
	   EU leaders reversed their stance on Ankara's application at their last
summit in Helsinki. They declared Turkey an official candidate, but said it
still had to fulfill the economic and political criteria for starting actual
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Cem said the delay in Turkey's democratic development was due in part to its
``mission of being the outpost of NATO for 40 years, an outpost at the moment
where the security of Western Europe and the West in general was the
responsibility of Turkey on the eastern flank of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
	   The other reason, he said, was the Kurdish rebellion in eastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have already accomplished some of the tasks that are generally expected
from candidate countries,'' Cem told reporters at EU headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
	   For the past four years, Turkey has had a customs union agreement with the
EU that enabled it to trade on an almost equal basis. The agreement required
Ankara to institute many economic reforms, which in turn has helped it prepare
for eventual membership.
</P>
<P>
	   Verheugen said Turkey will not be able to join the EU, however, until it has
settled some very important problems with its neighbors. Even there, progress is
being made.
</P>
<P>
	   A slight thaw in relations with Greece, already an EU member, has been
underway for six months, and a second round of Cyprus talks began in Geneva on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Up Ahead of Fed Meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices rose Tuesday amid expectations that
investors will seek a safe haven in bonds if the Federal Reserve boosts interest
rates as expected when this week's meeting concludes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 23/32 point, or $7.18 3/4 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.42
percent compared with late Monday's level of 6.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to 1/32 point
higher, while intermediate maturities rose 1/32 to 9/32 point, according to
Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   The gains came as Fed officials met for the first day of a two-day strategy
session that's expected to produce another increase in the central bank's
lending rates to slow the economy and fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, a top manufacturing group reported Tuesday that raw materials
prices jumped in January to the highest level in five years. Stock investors
fear that higher interest rates will hurt company profits, making the fixed
payoff on bonds more appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 0.02
percentage point, finishing at 5.69 percent with a discount rate of 5.53
percent. Six-month yields settled at 5.95 percent with a discount of 5.69
percent, up 0.02 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
	   One-year yields finished at 6.27 with a discount of 5.90 percent, up from
late Monday's levels, but below Tuesday's action results of 6.29 percent with a
discount of 5.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.87 1/2 percent from late Monday's 6.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 1/16 point to 91 1/4. The yield
was unchanged at 6.31 percent.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Stall Traffic  </HEADLINE>
   By IAN PHILLIPS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- The French government put on a brave face Tuesday as its new
35-hour workweek law came into effect against a backdrop of public transport
strikes in Paris and nationwide blockades by truckers.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second day, truckers brought traffic to a standstill at ports and
cities, blaming the government for caving in to employers' demands that trucking
companies be exempted from the law. In Paris, 50 percent of buses, suburban
train and subway services were hit by a strike. Many commuters were forced to
walk or drive to work.
</P>
<P>
	   In the southern port city of Marseille, 10,000 people rallied to protest
what they also saw as poor implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   By Tuesday evening, only a handful of barricades remained in place and all
were expected to be lifted by morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialist-led government played down Tuesday's protests. Labor Minister
Martine Aubry told lawmakers they were a result of workers simply ``assuring
that they get the best possible conditions.'' She denied the program was
unpopular.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says reducing the workweek from 39 hours to 35 will help
reduce unemployment since companies will have to hire more staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Business leaders have criticized the cost of the program, accusing officials
of unnecessary meddling in the economy. Many employers say they will demand more
productivity from workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Trade unions are concerned about exactly how the law will be implemented,
and are keen to ensure workers do not see their salaries shrink.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 20 percent of the 82,000 companies nationwide that are supposed to
fully adhere to the new law have reached agreement with their employees,
officials say. But Aubry says tens of thousands of jobs have already been
created by the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's strikes coincided with the symbolic Feb. 1 deadline for French
companies with more than 20 employees to comply with the law. Other companies
have until 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The shorter workweek is the centerpiece of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's efforts to reduce a stubborn unemployment rate which, despite edging
down since he took office in mid-1997, is still hovering above the 10 percent
mark.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, French truckers blocked traffic at international borders and
around major cities to demand that their hourly rates and bonuses rise to soften
the impact of a shorter week.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers, many of whom now work double the new 35-hour limit, want a
shorter week and were infuriated after their bosses won concessions from the
government exempting them from the new law.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: No Progress in Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- No progress was made in the first two rounds of a 10-day
marathon of intensive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a Palestinian negotiator
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Saeb Erekat would not say what issues the two sides raised over the past two
days, but he indicated that Israeli negotiators were pushing to keep east
Jerusalem and West Bank water sources under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a serious gap between the two sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the Palestinians are trying to meet a Feb. 13 deadline for
formulating the outline of a peace treaty, addressing hotly contested issues
such as borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements. A final
treaty is due in September.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unlikely the sides will make much headway before a summit Thursday
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's office on Tuesday said the meeting would take place at noon at the
Gaza Strip's Erez Crossing.
</P>
<P>
	   The office said in a statement that Barak would also meet with Jordan's King
Abdullah on Sunday in Amman ``as part of the prime minister's intensive
activities to advance the peace process on all its tracks.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, was to arrive Wednesday to
be briefed by negotiators. Arafat said Secretary of State Madeline Albright
might be coming to the region as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said both sides were genuinely trying to meet the February deadline,
but that Ross' intervention would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   In a push toward a framework treaty, the two sides decided to hold 10 days
of intensive negotiations in secret locations. The first round was held Sunday,
and a second session was convened Monday in the West Bank town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
	   A meeting between Erekat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran, set for
Tuesday, was postponed to Thursday, Erekat said. He did not give a reason for
the delay.
</P>
<P>
	   The two were expected to discuss an Israeli withdrawal from 6.1 percent of
the West Bank that was to have taken place Jan. 20. Israel has asked for an
extra three weeks to get organized.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak aide Gadi Baltiansky on Tuesday said that Israel would carry out the
withdrawal by Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want to gain control of West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem in
the upcoming withdrawal, but Israel apparently wants to keep those areas as a
bargaining chip for talks on the status of disputed Jerusalem, claimed by both
sides as their capital.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the PLO's policy-making Central Council was to meet in the
Gaza Strip to discuss the date for a Palestinian declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unlikely, though, that Arafat will declare independence ahead of the
September deadline for a peace treaty. Arafat has raised the possibility of
unilateral action in the past to prod the Israelis in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   All PLO factions have said that they would take part in the meeting, except
for the militant Islamic groups, Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Tuesday, Israeli troops demolished a Palestinian home in the east
Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiyeh.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner, Sheik Omar Abdel Razek, had rebuilt after it was demolished eight
months ago for being built without a permit. Abdel Razek said City Hall
officials had told him the house wouldn't be destroyed again.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerusalem municipal spokesman Hagai Elias said the authorities were only
enforcing the law by destroying the home, which had been built on land that was
not zoned for residential use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say Israel refuses to give them permits to build in
contested east Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Mexian Crash Victim Family Waits  </HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH DALZIEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico (AP) -- American tourists on Tuesday prepared to
board the Alaska Airlines plane to San Francisco, but it was no longer Flight
261 -- the number of the carrier that crashed Monday. The flight number was
changed to 7201.
</P>
<P>
	   There were other signs of the tragedy as well.
</P>
<P>
	   A half-dozen tense, red-eyed relatives of Gabriela Chavez -- the only
Mexican citizen known to be aboard Flight 261 -- tried to hold back the tears as
they waited for definitive news about the fate of the 33-year-old mother of one.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a Puerto Vallarta homemaker, took the flight to visit a sister who
lives in San Francisco. Her husband paced the airport Tuesday until an Alaska
Airlines employee approached him and held his arm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anything that can be done, will be done,'' Julian Acosta told the man, who
refused to talk to the media. ``If you want to go to Los Angeles, that will be
arranged.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Alaska Airlines ticket counter nearby, American tourists finishing up
their vacations chatted on line while waiting to board their flights home.
</P>
<P>
	   While an official list of the victims has yet to be released, only two of
the 88 passengers and crew aboard Flight 261 were believed to be Mexican --
Chavez and a man officials said was a U.S. citizen of Mexican origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials said the plane took off normally from here Monday at about
1:00 p.m. The craft had received no unusual maintenance here, other than the
normal preparations to return to San Francisco, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet plummeted into the Pacific Ocean on Monday afternoon after its pilot
reported mechanical problems and was diverted to Los Angeles for an emergency
landing. No survivors have been found.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators said Tuesday that the pilots struggled with a sudden
control problem for at least six minutes before the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had heard a pinging
from the ocean, apparently from the flight recorders, which could reveal exactly
what went wrong with the stabilizer.

<HEADLINE> General Criticizes E. Timor Report  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Setting the stage for a showdown between
Indonesia's reformist president and its generals, the powerful security minister
on Tuesday ignored calls to resign over allegations he was responsible for
crimes against humanity in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wiranto came out fighting instead, with intransigence that could bring
to a climax a simmering power struggle between President Abdurrahman Wahid and
generals linked to former dictator Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, meanwhile, called again for Wiranto to step down. Speaking in London
during a stop on his European tour, Wahid said if Wiranto refuses to quit, he
will ``remove him from office'' when he returns home on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The president on Monday raised the stakes in the confrontation when he
called on Wiranto to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesting his innocence, Wiranto criticized a government report that
accused him and five other generals of allowing pro-Indonesian militia gangs and
some troops to kill and burn across East Timor after it voted for independence
on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a soldier, I am going to continue to fight to reveal the truth,''
Wiranto declared after reporters repeatedly asked whether he would step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, once a close Suharto aide, was commander of Indonesia's armed
forces during the weeks of turmoil after the East Timor ballot results were
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of East Timorese were killed and thousands of building were burned.
Some 400,000 people fled their homes to avoid the violence. The mayhem ended
only with the deployment of international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his election in October as the nation's first democratic head of state
in 44 years, Wahid has tried to reduce the military's role in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   He has gradually eroded the power of Wiranto and other commanders who helped
prop up Suharto during his 32 years in power. Suharto now lives in virtual
seclusion in Jakarta, fending off separate allegations of corruption. Wiranto
and Suharto, like many Indonesians, use one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid ignored coup rumors last week before starting a 16-day European and
Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. human rights report on East Timor, released separately Monday, also
condemned Indonesia's military and recommended the creation of an international
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with senior commanders and officials at Jakarta's military
headquarters Tuesday, Wiranto said he wanted to confer with Wahid, who returns
to Indonesia on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly angered by the charges against him, Wiranto, 52, spoke sternly but
confidently for 30 minutes in defending his record of command.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Indonesian investigators of ignoring his efforts to prevent
violence in East Timor before and after the ballot, adding that the referendum
itself had been carried out peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto said he deployed extra troops, arranged for rival Timorese factions
to sign peace agreements and encouraged civilians to surrender their weapons,
then declared martial law after the violence began.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The commission) does not care about this positive activity at all,'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of Wiranto's legal defense team, Adnan Buyung Nasution, accused the
report's authors of political motives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence, no witnesses and no documents to show that Wiranto
has done anything wrong,'' he said. ``The report reflects a hatred against
military officers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia invaded and occupied the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Over 24
years its military was harshly criticized for widespread human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has lost much of his authority under Wahid, and some analysts say
his position is untenable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wiranto will go in the end,'' said Harold Crouch, an Indonesian military
expert at Australian National University in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's sacked, I don't think he could do a great deal anyway, he doesn't
have that sort of support in the military as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senior politicians, including parliamentary speakers Akbar Tanjung and Amien
Rais, urged all generals implicated in human rights abuses to quit.

<HEADLINE> Report: Toyota Reaches Deal With GM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has reached separate deals with General
Motors Corp. and Volkswagen on sharing design and development systems, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota will set up common computer systems with the U.S. and German
automakers to share information on car and auto parts development by 2001, the
Yomiuri Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
	   Natsuki Den, a spokeswoman for Toyota, could not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper, Japan's largest, said the companies hope to cut costs and
gain advantages as competition to create new technology intensifies in the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The three companies may also agree to create a unified design system in the
future, the Yomiuri said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri said that because the agreement will create a framework for
joint auto development, it could be a step toward a mega-alliance between the
top carmakers in Japan, North America and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian General Cultivated Image  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Once a loyal supporter of Indonesia's former
dictator, then a military chief with presidential aspirations, Gen. Wiranto
cultivated the image of a respected professional soldier.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-star general, now 52, rose quickly through the ranks after
graduating at the top of his military academy class in 1968. After tours of duty
in remote provinces, he served in East Timor twice before being chosen for
bigger things.
</P>
<P>
	   His fortunes skyrocketed in 1989, when then-President Suharto appointed him
as his military aide. It was a crucial apprenticeship for the young officer, who
learned quickly about affairs of state and how to cope with intrigues within the
ornate presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   After impressing the autocratic Suharto, he breezed through a quick
succession of senior commands. In March 1998, Suharto named Wiranto armed forces
commander and appointed him defense minister. Suharto and Wiranto, like many
Indonesians, use one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Although regarded as deeply loyal to Suharto, Wiranto played a pivotal role
in ending the dictator's 32-year reign in May 1998, after massive rioting swept
the country as a result of the worst economic downturn in decades. Much of
Jakarta was in flames when Wiranto successfully urged Suharto to quit -- and
assumed the role of a maker and breaker of presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Suharto's hand-picked successor, President B.J. Habibie, seemed worried
about Wiranto. The few times that Habibie traveled overseas he took Wiranto
along, apparently because of coup fears.
</P>
<P>
	   That theme sounded familiar Tuesday when President Abdurrahman Wahid was
asked during a European tour whether he was afraid that his demand for Wiranto's
resignation would precipitate a military coup. He made the demand Monday and
repeated in Tuesday in London.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even Gen. Wiranto himself would not do that kind of thing,'' said Wahid.
``The armed forces know the people are all behind the government in this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Wiranto refuses to quit, Wahid said he will ``remove him from office''
when he returns home on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, however, maintained his public support for the government and came
up with a long list of reforms to change the military's traditionally strong
role in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Tall, trim and fine featured, Wiranto was even considered a possible
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   But the actions of his troops ate away at his reformist reputation. In
November 1998, soldiers shot and killed a dozen students outside parliament. For
East Timor, Wiranto had repeatedly guaranteed the United Nations that his forces
would maintain order so people in the former Portuguese colony could vote on
breaking free from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   After officials announced that voters had overwhelmingly chosen
independence, militias that had been armed and trained by Wiranto's army went on
a rampage. At least 250 people were killed. Some 400,000 people fled. The mayhem
stopped only when Australian-led international peacekeepers arrived on Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto steadfastly denied any part in the violence. He was sure enough of
his position to vie for the vice presidency last October, after parliament voted
in Wahid as the first freely elected head of state in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
	   While he failed to get the job, Wiranto's power was such that he was
included in Wahid's Cabinet as security affairs minister. But the president
whittled away at Wiranto's position. He was replaced as military commander and
forced to retire from the army.

<HEADLINE> Twins Said Face Higher Cancer Risk  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) --Fraternal twin sisters face more than twice the risk of
developing breast cancer after menopause than women who aren't twins, a Mayo
Clinic researcher reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A study to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute found that women who were fraternal twins were 2.1 times more likely
to develop breast cancer than women who were not. The risk for identical twins
was no different from the risk for women born solo.
</P>
<P>
	   For women with a male twin, the risk was elevated but not statistically
significant, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 175,000
women are diagnosed with breast cancer yearly and more than 43,000 die from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraternal twins are produced when the mother releases more than one egg and
both are fertilized. Identical twins, which are less common, come formed when
one fertilized egg splits early in an embryo's development, giving both twins an
identical genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who are twins should not become overly concerned, but should follow
the recommended guidelines for breast cancer screenings including regular
mammograms, said the lead author, Dr. James Cerhan, an epidemiologist with the
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "The importance of this study is that it adds to a small but growing body of
research that suggests that intrauterine exposures may influence later breast
cancer risk," Cerhan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cerhan said the study was motivated by previous studies that found that a
mother's estrogen and other hormone levels are substantially higher when she is
pregnant with twins, and that intrauterine exposure to elevated levels of these
hormones may increase the risk of developing breast cancer as an adult.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said that to their knowledge, their finding that the
relative risk is highest for female fraternal twins has not been reported
previously, though earlier studies have associated being a twin with an elevated
breast cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very interesting," said Chung-cheng Hsieh, a professor of medicine
at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester and adjunct
associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsieh led a study published in 1992 that also found a higher risk of breast
cancer in women who were twins, but noted that he and his colleagues were unable
to determine then if their subjects were fraternal or identical twins.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new study, researchers with the Mayo Clinic, University of
Minnesota, Wake Forest University and the University of South Carolina evaluated
a group of 29,197 postmenopausal Iowa women with no history of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the size of that data set, Hsieh said, the researchers appeared to
have "very good information" to support their conclusions that fraternal twin
sisters face an elevated cancer risk.

<HEADLINE> Study: Teens Practice Bad Habits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Half the 15-year-olds in Wales drink beer every
week. Ninety percent of teens in Northern Ireland say they exercise daily -- but
even more eat potato chips.
</P>
<P>
	   These are some of the findings of a World Health Organization study of
teen-agers in Europe, the former Soviet Union and North America.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. body expressed concern over the statistics on health and
lifestyles, based on interviews with more than 120,000 teen-agers from those
regions.
</P>
<P>
	   In Greenland, more than half of all 15-year-old boys light up on every day,
while nearly half of all girls do. Nearly a third of teens in Germany and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
	   Many teen-agers in Germany, Latvia and Hungary also smoked daily. The United
States ranked 24th out of 28 countries for teens who smoke daily, with 12
percent of 15-year-olds saying they smoke every day.
</P>
<P>
	   Family problems and peer pressure were seen as strong predictors of use of
tobacco and alcohol. Data showed a direct link between smoking and difficulties
talking with parents, the WHO study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said the frequency of weekly beer consumption -- 43 percent among
teen-agers in Denmark and nearly as high in Greece -- was clearly associated
with peer pressure and school factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-five percent of the 15-year-olds in Northern Ireland said they eat
potato chips every day. They also were the largest consumers of chocolate,
sweets and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Childhood is an important time for establishing healthy eating habits and
maintaining healthy eating patters remains important as children grow into
adolescents," the survey warned.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there were some brighter spots in the survey.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-nine percent of 15-year-old Danish boys and 56 percent of the girls
said they exercised two or more times a week. In Northern Ireland, 90 percent of
the boys reported frequent exercise, while 63 percent of girls did.
</P>
<P>
	   The WHO also examined television viewing habits and found that less than
half of the students in most countries watch four or more hours each day. Those
figures were highest in Lithuania and Slovakia, with 46 percent of the
15-year-old boys and lowest in France with just 17 percent of the boys saying
they watched that much TV.

	   Their comments came in response to those of Jeanne O'Laughlin, a nun of the
Dominican order who hosted their meeting last week with the child they hope to
bring home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In an NBC television interview shown in part during the Cuban broadcast,
O'Laughlin suggested that the two women were under pressure from the Cuban
government in the struggle to wrest the 6-year-old from his great-uncle's family
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She is a lying person,'' said maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez.
``It's a lie... so many lies,'' she said, weeping as she recalled the meeting
with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy has been at the center of an international custody battle pitting
his father and grandparents against the great-uncle's family almost since he was
rescued from an innertube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother and 10
other people died when the boat carrying them from Cuba to the United States
sank.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers complained that the child -- who lived most of his life in
their homes -- seemed quiet and withdrawn when he was brought to meet them on
Jan. 26 at the home of O'Laughlin, president of Barry University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He looked frightened... His face was sad. He was not the boy we knew,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that the boy's second-cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, of Miami,
apparently remained with O'Laughlin and another nun in a room next door and
could listen though an open entryway, despite an agreement that members of the
Miami family would not be at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a column published Tuesday in the New York Times, O'Laughlin said she now
favors keeping Elian in the United States with his second cousin partly because
the boy ``has transferred his maternal love to her'' following the loss of his
mother. She said the grandmothers seemed fearful -- apparently of their own
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez said Elian seemed nervous when the grandmothers questioned the
presence of his cousin. ``He said, 'Look grandmother, this is my cousin.' He
said it as if the boy was depending on her, that he could not be without her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said that Marisleysis Gonzalez had almost no relationship with
Elian before the November shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
	   The women said their meeting with the boy was repeatedly interrupted by the
nuns offering food or bringing messages. Rodriguez said one nun entered three
times with the same message, asking them to meet members of the Miami family.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that the boy was starting to warm up when O'Laughlin halted the
meeting after 90 minutes, short of the two-hour minimum reportedly agreed to.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers said they remained cheerful during the farewell for the
boy's sake, but when he had gone, ``we cried a lot. That was terrible,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two also complained that a nun and policeman took a cellular telephone
from them just as the boy was starting to speak to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said they had been unable to speak with the boy by telephone either
from the United States or Cuba, being told when they called that the child was
either sleeping or out.
</P>
<P>
	   She said that the boy's father, however, had managed to speak to the boy
twice in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father, but the Miami relatives are trying to block that action
in federal court. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb.
22 on whether their lawsuit should be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> 45 Countries Lose Assembly Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Forty-five countries, most of them in Africa, lost
their voting rights in the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday after failing
to pay their dues on time, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of them, however, are expected to pay up before the assembly starts its
session again in September and any votes are held.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of the 188 U.N. member states don't pay their dues on time.
</P>
<P>
	   But this year, 52 countries fell victim to U.N. Charter Article 19, which
penalizes long-term debters, after a Jan. 31 deadline for payment passed. That
is the highest number in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule stipulates that a country loses its vote in the assembly if the
amount of its debt equals or exceeds the amount it was billed in the preceding
two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly allowed seven of those 52 countries -- Bosnia, Comoros,
Congo, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Nicaragua and Tajikistan -- to keep their voting
rights through June 30 because of extenuating financial situations.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ukraine, a new member of the Security Council, lost its assembly vote
because it owes $15 million. Gambia, whose two-year term on the council ended at
the end of December, also lost its vote with a debt of $139,300.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq, which owes the United Nations $11 million, hasn't had a vote in the
assembly for years. The Baghdad government has been under sweeping U.N. trade
sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which currently owes the United Nations over $1 billion,
was threatened with losing its vote in the assembly for the past two years, but
scraped through with last-minute payments.
</P>
<P>
	   There are dozens of U.N. members who are considered deadbeat but have kept
their assembly votes because they haven't allowed the amount of debt to exceed
the two-year contribution level.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, only 43 countries of the 188 member states paid their bill for the
regular U.N. budget in full for 2000 by the Jan. 31 deadline, U.N. spokesman
John Mills said. That was 11 more countries than paid up by the deadline in
1999, and the highest number in recent years, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices rose in early trading Wednesday
following a jump on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average advanced 181.23 points, or 0.93
percent, to 19,604.61 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 116.32 points, or 0.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.78 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
up 0.42 yen from the previous day, but below its late Tuesday level in New York
of 107.85 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, share prices rose as traders were encouraged by a
second straight session of strong gains in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday rose 100.52 points, or 0.9
percent, to close at 11,041.05, building on its 201-point gain Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
18.70 points, or 1.10, at 1,715.85 early Wednesday. The TOPIX lost 10.81 points,
or 0.63 percent, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar largely retained strength gained in New York
as the rise on Wall Street prompted buying of greenbacks, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese currency was also hurt by a report Tuesday from ratings agency
Fitch IBCA that expressed concern about Japan's credit outlook as the government
takes on record debt to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 104.77 yen early Wednesday, above
its level of 103.96 yen late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unchanged
from its Tuesday close of 1.7500. Its price remained at 99.57.

<HEADLINE> E-mail Tells Australia Rate Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Financial journalists and analysts got a jump on
interest rate policy Wednesday, when an inadvertently sent e-mail delivered the
news six minutes ahead of the official announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "The text of monetary policy statement which had been preloaded onto a
computer for release at 9:30 a.m. local time was inadvertently sent by e-mail at
9:24 a.m. to the 64 recipients who were on the Reserve Bank media release
mailing list," the central bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement told most people what they'd already predicted anyway --
that rates would rise, although the half-percentage point hike to 5.5 percent
was slightly higher than many had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   A Reserve Bank spokesman said the circumstances of the early release of the
data would be investigated and appropriate action taken, if needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's rate hike was the second in three months -- the central bank
raised rates from 4.75 percent to 5 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank cited a strengthening of the global economy and rising inflation
due to higher oil prices as reasons for the latest increase.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Delays U.S. Visas in Havana  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans applying for U.S. visitor visas in Havana will have to
wait up to 15 days because of a dispute with the Cuban government, the U.S.
Interests Section announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The mission said the Cuban government had backed away from an earlier
agreement on a more efficient visa application process. But U.S. officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said later they had reached a new, verbal
pact with the Cubans to implement the system within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem affects most Cubans trying to visit relatives in the United
States or take part in academic, cultural or other events.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said the problem was procedural, not political, and was not
related to the custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez or other disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old system, Cubans seeking such visas had to send a letter to the
Interests Section, which then had to send them a letter inviting them to apply
for a visa. With that letter, they were allowed to enter the diplomatic
mission's compound to apply. The old process could take months.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system, which U.S. officials hoped to start Monday, would have let
Cubans come directly to the mission and drop an application into a box.
Officials said most applicants would have an interview and a reply to their
request the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Tuesday, Cuban police blocked streets near the mission, preventing
about 200 people from entering. The crowd waited peacefully, hoping police might
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are people who have been waiting here for three days,'' said Isabel
Rodriguez Cruz of the central Cuban city of Matanzas, who had waited for several
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Another of those waiting, Isabel Monsibaez, said Cuban officials had told
the crowd on Monday that the old system would continue. But she said U.S.
officials told them Tuesday that it would not.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interests Section will continue to receive applications from people who
have already received letters from the mission under the old system but will
issue no more letters. In preparing for the new system, U.S. officials said
consular officials in Havana had already destroyed letters sent to them under
the old method.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement said the mission ``no longer has the ability -- nor is it
willing -- to revert to the inefficient and easily corrupted system of issuing
application letters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Interests Section has issued about 4,800 such visas since the start of
October.
</P>
<P>
	   The Section, operated by U.S. diplomats under a Swiss flag, performs most of
the functions of an embassy, but the United States and Cuba have no formal
diplomatic relations. Cuba also operates an Interests Section in Washington,
D.C.

	    Chretien Denies Allegations of $1B Worth of Waste on Job Programs
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien tried to lower the stakes
Tuesday in the showdown over mismanaged federal job grants, saying the sums
involved are far less than the $1 billion widely assumed.
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't put his own price tag on the affair, but suggested there are
serious questions about only a fraction of the more than 400 projects audited by
the Human Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is 37 cases, some are $10,000, it is not $1 billion,'' Chretien said
outside a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not allegations of big fraud there, it is allegations that the
reporting has not been done completely adequately, and we will fix it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Good, a senior official at Human Resources, said the 37 projects
referred to by the prime minister received $30 million in combined funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual grants varied widely, from a low of $500 on one project to $11.5
million for the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Winberg, another department official, said only a portion of the
$30-million total is under investigation but he could not say exactly how much.
</P>
<P>
	   Winberg said if any grant recipients were mistakenly overpaid the department
will take steps to recover the money. If there is evidence of fraud or other
criminal wrongdoing the files will be turned over to the RCMP. ----

	    Federal Government Sets Aside $50M For Merchant Navy Veterans
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Veterans of Canada's merchant navy ended a 55-year battle
Tuesday when Ottawa announced it would become the first Allied government to
compensate civilian sailors for wartime service.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabinet set aside $50 million for the program, including lump-sum payments
of up to $24,000 in lieu of benefits sailors did not receive before 1992. The
seamen were declared full-fledged veterans last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This marks a historic occasion for these veterans and for our country,''
said Veterans Affairs Minister George Baker, who made the long-awaited plan a
priority when he was appointed to cabinet last August.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I went looking for precedents in the world for what these organizations
were advocating and I could find none.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tax-free compensation, available immediately to veterans or their spouses,
is graduated according to service aboard cargo ships, primarily between 1939 and

	    White Says He'll Tell All About Preston Manning in Leadership Race

<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Ousted Reform House leader Randy White says he'll be dishing
out all the dirt he has about his boss Preston Manning when it comes time to
fight for the helm of the new Canadian Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   White was demoted Monday -- without warning, he says. The British Columbia
MP had been guarded in his support for Manning's vision of a new coalition of
like-minded Reformers and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel actually quite unrestricted (as) to what I can do because now I can
go out and say the party needs a new leader, and I have enough facts to show
why,'' White said from his Langley-Abbotsford riding office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been caucus officer, I've been close to all the action, I've been
involved in all the strategy for over three years. I've probably talked to
Preston Manning more than anyone else. I know what has to be done to get a new
leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   White was reluctant to throw punches yet, however. He says he'll really take
the gloves off during an actual leadership race.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, White has not bee considered among dissident caucus members. ----

	    New Party No Longer Going To Be CCRAP
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- After just a few days of being called CCRAP, the steering
committee for the Canadian Alliance announced Tuesday it's scrapping the name
chosen by delegates on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the committee will formally seek to register the party as the
Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance, CRCA, instead of the Canadian
Conservative Reform Alliance -- CCRAP.
</P>
<P>
	   Elections Canada must approve whatever name the new party adopts and it's
not clear either choice will get the go-ahead.

	    Ottawa Plans $7.5B Infrastructure Project in Federal Budget
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government intends to introduce a new
multibillion infrastructure program in its upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans are being competed to establish a new program that could be worth up
to $7.5 billion over the next five years, The Canadian Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa will set aside $500 million in each of the next five years for
repairs to the country's crumbling roads, sewers and water systems, government
sources say. Provinces and municipalities would be expected to match federal
money as in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   The powerful Commons finance committee, in its pre-budget report in
December, called for $2.5 billion over five years to improve highways, transit
systems and water and sewer systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee, led by Liberal MP Maurizio Bevilacqua, said previous
infrastructure programs were primarily aimed at kick-starting the economy and
creating jobs by improving public works.
</P>
<P>
	   But with unemployment now below seven percent, the new program should focus
simply on fixing infrastructure, the all-party committee suggested. ----

by name -- for its failure to promote sovereignty in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Twins Said Face Higher Cancer Risk  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) --Fraternal twin sisters face more than twice the risk of
developing breast cancer after menopause than women who aren't twins, a Mayo
Clinic researcher reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A study to be published Wednesday in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute found that women who were fraternal twins were 2.1 times more likely
to develop breast cancer than women who were not. The risk for identical twins
was no different from the risk for women born solo.
</P>
<P>
	   For women with a male twin, the risk was elevated but not statistically
significant, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 175,000
women are diagnosed with breast cancer yearly and more than 43,000 die from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 28,659 postmenopausal women in the 10-year study who were single
births, 1,195 or 4.2 percent got breast cancer. Among the 149 who had a
fraternal twin sister, 13 or 8.7 percent got breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraternal twins are produced when the mother releases more than one egg and
both are fertilized. Identical twins, which are less common, come formed when
one fertilized egg splits early in an embryo's development, giving both twins an
identical genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who are twins should not become overly concerned, but should follow
the recommended guidelines for breast cancer screenings including regular
mammograms, said the lead author, Dr. James Cerhan, an epidemiologist with the
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "The importance of this study is that it adds to a small but growing body of
research that suggests that intrauterine exposures may influence later breast
cancer risk," Cerhan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cerhan said the study was motivated by previous studies that found that a
mother's estrogen and other hormone levels are substantially higher when she is
pregnant with twins, and that intrauterine exposure to elevated levels of these
hormones may increase the risk of developing breast cancer as an adult.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said that to their knowledge, their finding that the
relative risk is highest for female fraternal twins has not been reported
previously, though earlier studies have associated being a twin with an elevated
breast cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very interesting," said Chung-cheng Hsieh, a professor of medicine
at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester and adjunct
associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsieh led a study published in 1992 that also found a higher risk of breast
cancer in women who were twins, but noted that he and his colleagues were unable
to determine then if their subjects were fraternal or identical twins.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new study, researchers with the Mayo Clinic, University of
Minnesota, Wake Forest University and the University of South Carolina evaluated
a group of 29,197 postmenopausal Iowa women with no history of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the size of that data set, Hsieh said, the researchers appeared to
have "very good information" to support their conclusions that fraternal twin
sisters face an elevated cancer risk.

<HEADLINE> Report: Toyota Reaches Deal With GM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has reached separate deals with General
Motors Corp. and Volkswagen on sharing design and development systems, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota will set up common computer systems with the U.S. and German
automakers to share information on auto parts development by 2001, the Yomiuri
Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shino Yamada, a spokeswoman for Toyota, said the companies are in talks on
information exchange but said there were no plans to merge development systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, said the companies hope to cut costs
and gain advantages as competition to create new technology intensifies in the
auto industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The three companies may also agree to create a unified design system in the
future, the Yomiuri said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yomiuri said that because the agreement will create a framework for
joint auto development, it could be a step toward a mega-alliance between the
top carmakers in Japan, North America and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico, Pentagon Compromise  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN PERRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- In a televised appeal, President Clinton
called on Puerto Ricans Tuesday to support a deal which paves the way for the
U.S. Navy to resume bombing exercises it says are vital to national defense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Commander in Chief, I must do all I can to ensure that our servicemen
and women get the very best training possible,'' Clinton said in videotaped
comments broadcast by local TV. ``You have never turned your back on your duty
to share in the defense of our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides gave up much in the deal announced Monday: The Navy -- at least
temporarily -- lost the live-fire training it says its sailors and aviators
need. The Puerto Rican government lost a rare political consensus its defiant
stand against the Navy had created by backing away from its ``no more bombs''
pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a solution that holds out the possibility of peace for Vieques,''
Gov. Pedro Rossello said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Exercises were suspended in April after a civilian security guard was killed
in an accidental bombing at the Navy's Vieques training ground. Despite the
Navy's insistence that its premier Atlantic Fleet range was indispensable,
Puerto Rico demanded the bombing range be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's agreement calls for a referendum giving Vieques residents two
choices: let the Navy resume use of the range on its own terms -- including the
use of live bombs -- or require the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003.
Until then, the Navy can resume exercises using dummy bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Most believe Vieques will choose to evict the Navy.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Juan, where authorities removed a large banner inscribed with
``Vieques or death'' from a hilltop Tuesday, Rossello met with top security
officials as he came under fire from rivals and even religious leaders who
accused him of selling out Vieques' 9,300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The pact could also lead to trouble if Puerto Rican authorities are forced
to remove pro-independence protesters who have camped for the past nine months
on a Vieques island bombing range littered with unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy spokesman Scott Bassett said the USS George Washington carrier battle
group was expected to arrive for maneuvers sometime in March. That would require
the protesters to leave the base beforehand.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Marshals said there were no arrest orders yet, but Puerto Rico police
chief Pedro Toledo indicated he was expecting such a move. Justice Secretary
Angel Rotger Sabat called the situation ``quite dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Vieques, activist spokesman Roberto Rabin said the protesters on the
beach would submit peacefully to arrest -- but that the Vieques movement would
try to ``make the Navy's life miserable.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People will be blocking Navy transports. People will be making entry into
military property, the beach bombing area. The Navy will have to be constantly
arresting people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   From the start, the dispute was colored by bitter divisions that
characterize the Caribbean territory's ``commonwealth'' ties to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   When he announced the deal Monday, Rossello -- who wants to make Puerto Rico
the 51st U.S. state -- repeatedly referred to the island as a colony, suggesting
that the Navy would have been less cavalier about bombing Vieques had Puerto
Rico been a full member of the union.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Rican Independence Party, which has been at the forefront of the
protests, has vowed to oppose any renewed military exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a small minority of Puerto Ricans -- 3 percent in a recent vote --
support independence, with the rest about evenly divided between
``statehooders'' and supporters of the commonwealth status quo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vieques accident unleashed a deep reservoir of Puerto Rican nationalism
that could bode ill for the statehood cause. Navy officials rankled Puerto
Ricans by suggesting that as U.S. citizens they should be more concerned about
the national defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents argued that Vieques' residents -- sandwiched on a third of the
island between a munitions depot and the bombing range -- have done their duty
and that the Navy's bombing has scared away tourists and damaged the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not always been good neighbors on Vieques,'' Clinton allowed in
his address. However, he noted that ``for more than 50 years, Vieques has been a
central part of our training for the Atlantic fleet. ... Right now there are no
alternative sites that provide the same combined training opportunities.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Crash Victim Family Waits  </HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH DALZIEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico (AP) -- Saddened relatives and a quickly altered
flight number were some signs Tuesday of a tragedy that unfolded hundreds of
miles northward -- the Alaska Airlines crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunburned U.S. tourists lined up at the Puerto Vallarta airport to board the
Alaska Airlines flight to San Francisco, but it was no longer Flight 261, the
number carried by the MD-83 that crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a move to ease tensions, the airline changed the number to 7201.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, half-dozen tense, red-eyed relatives of Gabriela Chavez -- the
only Mexican citizen known to be aboard Flight 261 -- tried to hold back the
tears as they waited for definitive news about the fate of the 33-year-old
mother of one.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a Puerto Vallarta homemaker, took the flight to visit a sister who
lives in San Francisco. Her husband, who refused to give his name, paced the
airport Tuesday until an Alaska Airlines employee approached him and held his
arm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anything that can be done, will be done,'' Julian Acosta told the man, who
refused to talk to the media. ``If you want to go to Los Angeles, that will be
arranged.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Alaska Airlines ticket counter nearby, American tourists finishing up
their vacations chatted on line while waiting to board their flights home.
</P>
<P>
	   While an official list of the victims has yet to be released, only two of
the 88 passengers and crew aboard Flight 261 were believed to be Mexican --
Chavez and a man officials said was a U.S. citizen of Mexican origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials said the plane took off normally from here Monday at about
1 p.m. The craft had received no unusual maintenance here, other than the normal
preparations to return to San Francisco, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators said Tuesday that the pilots struggled with a sudden
control problem for at least six minutes before the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had heard a pinging
from the ocean, apparently from the flight recorders, which could reveal exactly
what went wrong with the stabilizer.

<HEADLINE> Cohen OKs Training on Gays Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, the nation's military services have
issued written guidelines to ensure that troops who complain of anti-gay threats
or harassment are not themselves investigated.
</P>
<P>
	   The intent is to allow such complaints to be aired without fear of being
drummed out of the service for being homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday the new guidelines on how to
investigate anti-gay threats are incorporated in updated training programs
designed to ensure that the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy on gays is enforced fairly and uniformly throughout the services.
</P>
<P>
	   As a matter of policy, commanders are not to use complaints of anti-gay
harassment or threats as a reason to investigate the complaining person. Instead
the commanders are supposed to investigate the source of the threat or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These plans make it very clear ... that there is no room for harassment or
threats in the military,'' Cohen said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Service members need to understand that harassment for any reason will not
be tolerated, and commanders will take prompt, appropriate actions against
individuals involved in such behavior,'' Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon also announced Tuesday the number of discharges from the
military for being homosexual in the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30 fell to
1,034 from 1,145 in the year-earlier period. Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 83.5
percent of discharges resulted from statements by service members that they were
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the administration's policy, gays may serve in the military as long as
they keep their sexual orientation to themselves. If they state that they are
homosexual, they are supposed to be removed from the service.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, the first full year of ``don't ask, don't tell,'' discharges
totaled 617. They rose every year since until 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Benecke, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Fund, welcomed Cohen's approval of the training guidelines but said such
guidance should have been made available to field commanders years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're glad to see, finally, that the secretary is taking steps to train
people,'' Benecke said. She said her group has found that most service members
who declare their homosexuality, and thereby are removed from the service, do so
because they feel threatened by an anti-gay environment in their workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is needed now is for leaders to enforce the harassment guidelines
with commitment,'' Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen instructed the services to develop new training guidelines last
December amid widening criticism that administration policy on gays in the
military was not working. The criticism sharpened after a court-martial in which
an Army private was convicted of murdering a gay soldier harassed with the
knowledge of his superiors. President Clinton called the Pentagon's
implementation of the administration policy ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also asked each of the service's top civilian and uniformed leaders to
issue statements to their troops reinforcing the policy against harassment of
gays.
</P>
<P>
	   In a joint statement, Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters and the Air
Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael Ryan, said, ``Harassment, threats or ridicule
of individuals or groups based upon their real or perceived differences,
including sexual orientation, have no place in the United States Air Force and
will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Army's statement said, ``We expect commanders at every level to take
appropriate action to prevent harassment of or threats against any member of our
Army.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices were sharply higher Wednesday morning,
boosted by a jump on Wall Street and the recent launch of several investment
trust funds. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average advanced 403.47 points, or 2.08
percent, to finish the morning session at 19,826.85. On Tuesday, the average
closed down 116.32 points, or 0.60 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 108.68 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
up 1.32 yen from Tuesday, and also above its late New York level of 107.85 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders pushed up prices on hopes that newly created
investment funds, including Nomura Asset Management's $9.5 billion fund
established Wednesday, will be strong buyers of Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were also encouraged by a second straight session of strong gains
in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday rose 100.52 points, or 0.9
percent, to close at 11,041.05, building on its 201-point gain Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
36.34 points, or 2.12 percent, at 1,733.49. The TOPIX lost 10.81 points, or 0.63
percent, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose as the gains on Wall Street prompted
buying of greenbacks, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese currency was also hurt by a report Tuesday from ratings agency
Fitch IBCA that expressed concern about Japan's credit outlook as the government
takes on record debt to spur the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 105.47 yen Wednesday morning, above
its level of 103.96 yen late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.7850
from its Tuesday close of 1.7500, driving its price down 0.30 point to 99.27.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Pro-Taiwan Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a veto threat and sharp criticism from China,
the House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to increase American military ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we truly love freedom, we must protect democratic Taiwan,'' said
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas as the chamber sent the bill to the Senate.
Its fate there is less certain.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation, approved 341 to 70, would lift a long-standing prohibition
on direct communication and cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwanese military,
open American military academies to more Taiwanese officers and require annual
Pentagon reports on threats to Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the bill was less hard-edged than an earlier version, the Clinton
administration contends it could undermine stability in Asia while doing little
to help Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
	   The House vote came a day after Chinese Embassy spokesman Yu Shuning
asserted that the bill's passage ``will bring about serious damage'' to
U.S.-Chinese relations. He suggested it would undermine the U.S. commitment to
recognize only one China.
</P>
<P>
	   The House's slap at China came as the administration worked to build support
for a measure to give China permanent trade benefits to accompany its expected
entry into the World Trade Organization. A vote on that measure is expected this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taiwan bill had bipartisan election-year support, and the
administration's Democratic allies put up only token opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill ``will not add one single missile to Taiwan's defense capability,
and it will not take away one single missile from China's,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif. Lantos said it was important to preserve ``the carefully
crafted fiction that there's only one China.''
</P>
<P>
	   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. However, the legislation did not appear to enjoy as
much initial support there.
</P>
<P>
	   While citing his long support for Taiwan, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., cautioned he didn't want to complicate further already tense relations
between the mainland and the island. ``We should proceed with due diligence,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors portrayed the bill as a reaction to the reported buildup of China's
missile arsenal along the Taiwan Strait and continued Chinese human-rights
abuses. They called it an expansion of the landmark 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,
which allows the United States to provide military supplies to Taiwan to use in
defending itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time to act on this promise is now,'' said House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the principal sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   As to its prospects in the Senate, ``I think the Senate never realized the
depth of support in the House. They cannot ignore a huge vote like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, national security spokesman David Leavy said the bill
``would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan security and risk the stability of
the entire East Asian region.''
</P>
<P>
	   If it passes in its present form, ``the president's senior advisers would
recommend that he veto it,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Its present form is a more modest version of a bill by DeLay that originally
would have authorized the sale to Taiwan of specific weapons systems, including
a ballistic missile defense, sophisticated radar warning equipment and
conventional submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the bill, even in its
watered-down form, ``would seriously diminish Taiwan's security and undermine
overall U.S. objectives of stability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
	   While a veto threat has been put on the table, ``We will, in the meantime,
be working hard to persuade the Congress not to enact it into law,'' Foley said.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed in Mexico Strike Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battling with rocks, bottles and sticks, strikers clashed
on Tuesday with students seeking to end a nine-month-old strike at Mexico's
largest university. One person was killed and at least 30 injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The street fighting erupted in the morning when about 200 students opposed
to the strike forced their way onto the campus of a university-affiliated high
school in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   One man was killed by stab wounds to the chest, said ambulance driver
Antonio Ramirez. At least four of the wounded suffered skull fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal police took control of the school late Tuesday to end the
skirmishing. They rounded up the strikers without resistance.
</P>
<P>
	   But strikers remained in control of the university's huge main campus
several miles away, refusing to reopen the 260,000-student National Autonomous
University until officials meet their demands for guaranteed admissions and a
loosening of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   During the fighting, about 150 supporters arrived in two buses in an
apparent effort to help the anti-strikers defend the campus.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, more striking students arrived to back up their comrades. Brandishing
poles and tossing rocks and chunks of concrete.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Argentina to Seek Bodies  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli Cabinet minister said Tuesday that Argentina's
president has promised to help locate the bodies of Jewish dissidents killed
during the South American nation's ``dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diaspora Affairs Minister Michael Melchior said Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua made the commitment when the two met last week in Stockholm at an
international conference on preserving the memory of the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
	   In Buenos Aires, the Argentine government said in a brief statement late
Tuesday night that Melchior's version of the meeting did ``not appropriately
reflect what was said.'' However, the statement did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   During Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship, at least 9,000 leftists
and dissidents vanished after being detained by the junta's security forces,
according to a government report. Human rights groups say the figure is closer
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Argentina's largest Jewish group, the Delegation of Argentine Jewish
Organizations, or DAIA, estimates at least 1,500 Jews ``disappeared'' during the
country's ``dirty war.'' Melchior put the number at 2,000.
</P>
<P>
	   According to human rights groups and survivor accounts, opponents to the
military regime who were Jewish were often singled out for harsher treatment by
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior said de la Rua's offer showed the new president was determined to
``build a new image of Argentina, and to fight against anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The pledge showed courage, Melchior said. ``Coming to Stockholm was not easy
for him,'' he told the Associated Press in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The Argentine government did not return repeated phone calls to confirm
Melchior's version of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior, a rabbi, said he hoped de la Rua's pledge of cooperation could
help some families of the disappeared track down the missing bodies for a Jewish
ritual burial, an act he said he hoped would give them with a sense of closure.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, Argentina's top junta leaders were sentenced to life in prison
after public trials found them guilty of human rights abuses. But the imprisoned
leaders were freed five years later on a presidential pardon signed by
then-President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchior said de la Rua also promised to reinvigorate investigations into
two bombing attacks on the Jewish community in Buenos Aires. A 1992 bombing of
the Israeli embassy killed 29 people, and two years later an attack on a Jewish
community center in the Argentine capital claimed 86 people.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been no major convictions in either case and Israel has
criticized the Argentine authorities' conduct of the investigations as slow and
inept. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has called them ``an open sore.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have blamed Iranian-backed groups for
the bombings, a charge Tehran has denied.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsolved investigations have been a diplomatic stumbling block between
Israel and Argentina, which is home to some 300,000 Jews, the second largest
community in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win in N.H. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain scored a landslide victory
over George W. Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's leadoff primary, puncturing
the aura of inevitability that had buoyed his Republican presidential campaign.
Vice President Al Gore survived a toe-to-toe challenge from Democratic
challenger Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming,''
McCain told cheering supporters. He watched returns with his teary-eyed wife,
Cindy, who put a trembling hand to her mouth and said, ``It really happened.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain rolled up 49 percent of the GOP vote, Bush just 30, a margin that
recast the GOP race for the larger states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was winning 52 percent of the vote, Bradley 47.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field -- state to state, all the
way to victory in November,'' the vice president told supporters, as Democrats
and Republicans alike looked to a five-week stretch of primaries that could
determine the nominees by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   The results damaged Bradley's chances, but he vowed to keep up his
challenge. The former New Jersey senator lost badly in Iowa last week and lost
the lead he once held in New Hampshire polling.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, he found solace in the narrower margin Tuesday night. ``We're
moving forward,'' Bradley told AP and indeed he has enough money to remain
competitive in an expensive sprint of followup primaries, a luxury McCain could
not have afforded.
</P>
<P>
	   AP's delegate analysis showed Gore leading for 13 out of the 22 Democratic
delegates at stake in New Hampshire, with Bradley winning 9.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president cast his victory as a bad omen for Bradley, whose
laid-back style and pledges of political reform were tailor made for
independent-minded voters of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he cannot win here, then that's a devastating blow to him,'' Gore told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly four out of every 10 New Hampshire voters do not declare a party
affiliation, and these independents were a potent attraction to insurgent
candidates McCain and Bradley in a state with a proud history of knocking
front-runners offstride.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain credited his agenda of political and campaign finance reform for his
victory. ``The Republican Party recovered its heritage of reform. And it's the
beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In returns from 80 percent of New Hampshire's 300 Republican precincts,
McCain had 49 percent of the vote compared to 30 for Bush. Millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes was a distant third at 13 percent and former Amb. Alan Keyes was at
6.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was winning 10 out of the 17 GOP delegates at stake, Bush 5 and
Forbes 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Social conservative Gary Bauer barely registered in the returns and was
struggling to survive. ``I'm a fighter but I'm not delusional,'' Bauer said,
before flying home to Virginia to take stock of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had to be disappointed, too, finishing little better than he did in
the 1996, after investing four years and millions of dollars for a second GOP
bid. Yet Forbes said he would stay and fight for conservative voters who might
be tempted to peel away from the suddenly vulnerable Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I make this appeal to those who may have backed others because of
inevitability, I plead with you, please come home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter interviews showed McCain winning in every demographic and income
group. As expected, he was well ahead among independents in a state that allows
its non-partisan voters to cast ballots in either primary. And he defeated Bush
among Republican voters, a constiuency that Bush had expected to dominate.
McCain advantage over Bush among GOP voters bodes well for their next
confrontation in South Carolina, a state that tends to back establishment
candidates like Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's gargantuan victory was certain to raise questions about Bush's
strategy, relying on photo opportunities and scripted speeches while McCain held
dozens of free-wheeling town hall meetings, appealing to finicky New Hampshire
voters who expect a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aired TV ads that said he was the most likely candidate to be elected
president, but voter interviews showed that less than 10 percent of GOP voters
in New Hamphire said they considered a candidates' ability to get elected a top
factor in their decision. Voter interviews showed that the top quality sought by
Tuesday's GOP voters was a candidate who ``stands up for what he believes in.''
Nearly as many voters were looking for a ``strong and decisive leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   After calling McCain to congratulate his rival, a chastened Bush told
supporters, ``I am better candidate for having come to New Hampshire and waging
this campaign and because of this compettion.'' He told AP in a post-primary
interview, ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners and this year will be no exception.''
</P>
<P>
	   After New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to an unprecedented
mountain of primaries from New York to California on March 7. Republicans will
compete in several states before March 7, including Delaware on Feb. 8, South
Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has held a wide lead in South Carolina polls, but McCain has more than
two weeks to chip away at the lead and hoped to marshall support from military
veterans among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizonan invested most of his pre-primary time and money in New
Hampshire, gambling that the state's independent-minded voters would be drawn to
his reform agenda. Though his campaign is more national in scope, Bush also
invested millions of dollars in hopes of winning New Hampshire and stopping
McCain's insurgent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush brought in his parents, former White House residents George and
Barbara, for a sentimental rally that apprently did not resonate.
</P>
<P>
	   The tangible primary yield was 22 delegates to the Democratic convention and
17 delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the totals needed to win
the nominations. The true rewards of New Hampshire are momentum or simply
validation of a candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters seemed to be looking for character more than policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Baron, 51, an accountant from Manchester, accountant, said he
typically votes Democratic but went for McCain. ``I have the sense he's telling
the truth,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley sought to recover his footing against Gore. Advisers said he planned
to challenge Gore to weekly debates through March 7, after refusing for weeks
the vice president's long-standing request for more frequent debates.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, the Democrats shed almost any talk of issues to
exchange bitter personal attacks. Bradley accused the vice president of
stretching the truth on abortion. Gore, a hard-knuckle campaigner himself,
indignantly accused the former New Jersey senator of breaking his promise to run
a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One personal note had political implications: Bradley acknowledged just
before the primary that his irregular heartbeat had required more treatment than
he had previously said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans dueled over taxes, with Bush accusing McCain of offering a
tax-cut plan that resembled President Clinton's. The Arizona senator defended
his program and said Bush was practicing Clinton's brand of ``spin politics.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1.2B For Indian Country  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to ask Congress for $1.2 billion
in new spending on American Indian programs, including hundreds of millions more
to build schools, hire police and improve health care on reservations, a White
House aide says.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the Indian spending initiative in his State of the Union
address last week, but did not include specifics. That plan, to be included next
week in Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, includes new or expanded Indian programs
in nearly every federal agency, said Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on
Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking
about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, a day after
she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new spending in Clinton's proposal is $300 million to build at
least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road
repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million
added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main
agency funding tribal governments, was not as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's anything to have a party over because the needs in
Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to
head the BIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and
chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sen. Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does wonder
why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a look at
Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler acknowledged that Clinton's proposal fell short of meeting the needs
of American Indians, who face far higher rates of poverty, unemployment and
other social problems than the country as a whole. She said the $1.2 billion
plan is the largest increase in Indian funding ever proposed, and anything more
would face stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the
estimated $4 billion backlog of repairs needed for highways through Indian
Country, Cutler acknowledged. An Interior Department report last year
recommended repairing or replacing 170 BIA schools at a total cost of $1.2
billion, far more than the six schools that would be replaced under Clinton's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know half a dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's
a drop,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31
tribal colleges, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be released Wednesday says tribal colleges, which serve 26,000
students in 12 states, have created jobs and helped increase education levels on
the reservations where they operate. The report from the Institute for Higher
Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median
incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster
between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Other details of Clinton's proposal, according to Cutler, include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program to draw companies to
reservation areas.

<HEADLINE> Gore Beats Back Bradley Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Beating back Bill Bradley's once-robust challenge
in New Hampshire, Vice President Al Gore promised supporters Tuesday, ``You
ain't seen nothing yet!'' and both candidates raced on to states whose contests
were up next.
</P>
<P>
	   A shower of red-white-and-blue confetti rained down on Gore as he celebrated
what he called ``a devastating blow'' to his Democratic presidential rival and
predicted the leadoff primary would ripple well beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field from state to state and
coast to coast,'' Gore said before leaving for a 2 a.m. airport rally in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley credited Gore for running a strong race but declared his
determination to fight on. ``We're smarter and better prepared and eager to
continue to fight,'' he said in a speech to supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator surprised Gore with a proposal for weekly
debates starting Sunday and running through the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   With 67 percent of precincts counted, Gore had 48,042 votes or 52 percent to
Bradley's 43,057 votes or 47 percent. That margin would give Gore 13 out of the
22 delegates at stake Tuesday. Bradley would get nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls framed the race as a showdown between experience and candor.
Seven in 10 voters who said they wanted a candidate who ``stands up for what he
believes in,'' chose Bradley. More than 90 percent of voters who picked the
``right experience'' as a presidential prerequisite liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic presidential candidates were plunging immediately into the
five-week race for what Bradley called ``the first national primary'' -- the
March 7 contests in more than a dozen states, including California, New York and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Battered a bit by Bradley's late offensive on abortion rights and campaign
finance, the vice president aired one last radio ad asserting his ``pro-choice
leadership,'' and, with an hour left in the voting, abruptly ordered his
motorcade to make one last stop at a Bedford polling site.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley focused on the days ahead and showed increased interest in debates .
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our attention must turn to the unprecedented national primaries in March
and the means by which we are going to reach millions of voters across the
country in coming weeks,'' Bradley wrote to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane promised, ``It's pretty safe to assume we'll
have a lot of debates.'' But he said Gore still wants twice-weekly debates
coupled with an end to 30-second TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore gave some of the credit for his second win of the nominating season to
the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the nation marked its 107th straight month -- an all-time record
-- of economic expansion. ``If you ask me, I think the timing is just about
right,'' Gore crowed in announcing the milestone.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic prosperity in the Cinton-Gore years clearly resonated with some. In
Manchester, Democrat Richard St. Hilaire, 70, said he knew from the start he
would vote for Gore, even though ``Clinton and his administration have done a
lot of bad things.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' St.
Hilaire explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But accountant Charles Baron, 51, a Democrat who described himself as
generally a Gore supporter, said he was so discouraged by the negative tone of
the Gore-Bradley race that he voted for a Republican, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``lowered himself with the campaign he conducted here,'' said Baron,
who voted in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Education and health care were the most important issues to Democrats.
Bradley was favored by those who cared most about health care; Gore won those
who picked education.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of voters said the most important quality in a candidate is
that he ``stands up for what he believes in,'' and about seven in 10 of those
voters favored Bradley. But having the ``right experience'' was in second place,
with about 20 percent saying it was most important, and more than 90 percent of
these voters liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore planned to defy fatigue and jet lag with a 2 a.m. morning-after rally
at New York's LaGuardia Airport, then fly on to Ohio and finally finish
Wednesday with an evening question-and-answer forum with Los Angeles voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who took time from his morning to tape a new commercial, was
hitting Connecticut and New York, where he is well known from his basketball
career with the New York Knicks. By the early hours of Thursday, he, too, was
due in California.

<HEADLINE> Wiranto Refuses To Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Setting the stage for a showdown between
Indonesia's reformist president and its generals, the powerful security minister
on Tuesday ignored calls to resign over allegations he was responsible for
crimes against humanity in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wiranto came out fighting instead, with intransigence that could bring
to a climax a simmering power struggle between President Abdurrahman Wahid and
generals linked to former dictator Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, meanwhile, called again for Wiranto to step down. Speaking in London
during a stop on his European tour, Wahid said if Wiranto refuses to quit, he
will ``remove him from office'' when he returns home on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The president on Monday raised the stakes in the confrontation when he
called on Wiranto to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesting his innocence, Wiranto criticized a government report that
accused him and five other generals of allowing pro-Indonesian militia gangs and
some troops to kill and burn across East Timor after it voted for independence
on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a soldier, I am going to continue to fight to reveal the truth,''
Wiranto declared after reporters repeatedly asked whether he would step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto, once a close Suharto aide, was commander of Indonesia's armed
forces during the weeks of turmoil after the East Timor ballot results were
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of East Timorese were killed and thousands of building were burned.
Some 400,000 people fled their homes to avoid the violence. The mayhem ended
only with the deployment of international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his election in October as the nation's first democratic head of state
in 44 years, Wahid has tried to reduce the military's role in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   He has gradually eroded the power of Wiranto and other commanders who helped
prop up Suharto during his 32 years in power. Suharto now lives in virtual
seclusion in Jakarta, fending off separate allegations of corruption. Wiranto
and Suharto, like many Indonesians, use one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid ignored coup rumors last week before starting a 16-day European and
Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.N. human rights report on East Timor, released separately Monday, also
condemned Indonesia's military and recommended the creation of an international
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with senior commanders and officials at Jakarta's military
headquarters Tuesday, Wiranto said he wanted to confer with Wahid, who returns
to Indonesia on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly angered by the charges against him, Wiranto, 52, spoke sternly but
confidently for 30 minutes in defending his record of command.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Indonesian investigators of ignoring his efforts to prevent
violence in East Timor before and after the ballot, adding that the referendum
itself had been carried out peacefully.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto said he deployed extra troops, arranged for rival Timorese factions
to sign peace agreements and encouraged civilians to surrender their weapons,
then declared martial law after the violence began.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The commission) does not care about this positive activity at all,'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of Wiranto's legal defense team, Adnan Buyung Nasution, accused the
report's authors of political motives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence, no witnesses and no documents to show that Wiranto
has done anything wrong,'' he said. ``The report reflects a hatred against
military officers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia invaded and occupied the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Over 24
years its military was harshly criticized for widespread human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has lost much of his authority under Wahid, and some analysts say
his position is untenable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wiranto will go in the end,'' said Harold Crouch, an Indonesian military
expert at Australian National University in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he's sacked, I don't think he could do a great deal anyway, he doesn't
have that sort of support in the military as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senior politicians, including parliamentary speakers Akbar Tanjung and Amien
Rais, urged all generals implicated in human rights abuses to quit.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Crash Clues Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- The pilots of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before the
jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard, federal investigators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The last minutes of the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by
pilots aboard four other aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board
was seeking to interview them.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had heard a pinging
from the ocean, apparently from the flight recorders, which could reveal exactly
what went wrong with the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was concentrated on a debris field about 10 miles offshore and
about 40 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport. Coast Guard, Navy and
private vessels were joined by military airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a day after the accident, searchers had pulled four bodies -- one
man, two women and an infant-- from the sea, which is 300 to 750 feet deep in
the area. Hopes dimmed that anyone aboard Flight 261 survived in the 58-degree
water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is still a search for human life,'' Coast Guard Adm. Tom Collins
said. ``The challenge is time. As time ticks off, risks go up.''
</P>
<P>
	   At day's end, 11 relatives and friends of victims huddled on shore Port
Hueneme beach, staring out across the receding tide as the sinking sun painted
the Pacific horizon pink and brilliant orange. Candles left in the sand by
strangers flickered as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
	   A few members of the group scooped water and sand into plastic cups. A
police officer guarding their privacy took a group picture before they left.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, passers-by paused to bow their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just feels so good to stand out here and pray. It sort of cleanses you
out,'' said Diane Adame, 39. ``You don't realize when you put someone on a plane
and give them a hug that you might not see them again. I just feel for the
people who lost their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flight had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and Seattle
with 83 passengers and five crew members. The passengers included three airline
employees, four employees of its sister airline Horizon and 23 relatives or
friends of the employees taking advantage of free standby flights.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt released preliminary transcripts of air
traffic control communications with the airliner. The last routine transmission
came at 3:55 p.m. PST, when the flight was cleared to continue to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:10 p.m. the pilots said they had control difficulties and were
descending below 26,000 feet. A few seconds later they advised they were at
23,700 feet and there was ``some discussion about their ability to control the
aircraft,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next few minutes, the pilots said they ``were kind of stabilized
and going to do some troubleshooting,'' but then said they had a jammed
stabilizer. At 4:16 they were cleared for an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The controllers cleared the plane to 17,000 feet. The crew acknowledged that
in what was the last known transmission from Flight 261, Hammerschmidt said. At
4:21 p.m. the aircraft dropped from radar.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gottschall, 45, a Channel Islands National Park worker, was putting up
a trail sign near the Anacapa Island lighthouse when he heard the jet, looked up
and watched it slam into the water 2 1/2 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane made a quick entry into the water upon impact, and
disappeared,'' Gottshall said in a statement released by the Park Service, which
noted that at the NTSB's request it did not include observations of the plane's
flight path and orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane where I felt
hopeless,'' Gottschall said. ``It had a finality to it that came very quickly.
After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just me and the sea
gulls out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The underwater pinging was pinpointed by a Navy team that joined in the
search effort. Investigators were uncertain whether the pings were from one or
both of the recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   One some planes, the horizontal stabilizer is monitored by the plane's data
recorder. The other ``black box'' records pilot conversations.
</P>
<P>
	   If the data recorder was programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it would
reveal the condition of the device's electrical and hydraulic controls. If not,
officials would have to deduce what happened to the device by studying how other
systems performed before the crash, said Barry Schiff, an aviation consultant
and former TWA pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer typically is controlled by the automatic pilot, but can also
be manipulated in the cockpit. Pilots are trained extensively in what to do
about stabilizer malfunctions. If the problem can't be fixed, the nose of the
aircraft can move up or down uncontrollably until gravity forces the plane into
a dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Both pilots were Alaska Airlines veterans. Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, was hired
in 1982 and had 10,400 flying hours with the company. First Officer William
Tansky, 57, was hired in 1985 and had 8,047 flying hours with the Seattle-based
airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad happy to see
how many people saw him as a father, a brother and a friend,'' said Fred
Thompson, 24, the pilot's son. ``And our hearts and thoughts are with the
families of the Alaska employees and passengers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was being directed by a 10-member NTSB team that arrived
in Port Hueneme early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the NTSB would be interviewing as many as four pilots who
might have seen Flight 261's final minutes from their planes -- a Skywest
flight, a private aircraft, another Alaska Airlines jet and a fourth plane that
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   As search boats moved in and out of Port Hueneme, an artist erected a 7-foot
wooden cross as a memorial to the victims. The cross was adorned with flowers,
and a white plastic angel sat at the base next to a candle in a jar.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria Arjaev, 55, of Port Hueneme, and her sister JoAnne Frank, visiting
from Wisconsin, tossed a bouquet of red carnations into the water off the pier.
</P>
<P>

miracle, that there's some survivor out there. You never know,'' Arjaev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has the image of an Eskimo painted on the tails of
its planes, serves more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five
Western states. Until Monday, the airline had gone 24 years without a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, Alaska Airlines has been the subject of federal grand jury
investigation in Oakland over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report concluded that records were
falsified on two MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999.
Because of the altered records, the aircraft were considered ``unairworthy,''
FAA documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said the plane
that crashed was not one of those involved in the investigation. An airline
spokesman said the investigation focused on record keeping, not the safety of
the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors declined to comment, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA had 44 reports of ``service difficulty'' for the plane that crashed
dating to 1992, when it was built, but most deal with problems involving
emergency lights and sliding windows not opening. In 1995, an engine failed and
the plane landed without incident. The engine was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Evans, an airline spokesman, said the plane had no previous stabilizer
problems.

   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire jolted one front-runner, Republican George
W. Bush, and rewarded the other, Vice President Al Gore, Tuesday night in the
nation's first primary, pivot point of a White House campaign that soon will
become a costly national competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush fell to Arizona Sen. John McCain by a Texas-sized margin that the
winner said would give him the momentum needed to press ahead with his
``national crusade'' against special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, a winner in Iowa's caucuses a week ago, said he had been jostled on
the same ``bump in the road'' that others in his position had encountered in
elections past.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's victory over former Sen. Bill Bradley was narrower, but solid enough,
especially for a candidate who had trailed in the pre-primary polls for several
weeks. ``We're going to march all the way down the field from state to state,''
he said after adding New Hampshire to his Iowa victory last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush thus joined a list of national front-runners tarnished in New
Hampshire. Republican Bob Dole lost the state in 1996 but won the nomination;
Democrat Walter F. Mondale was ambushed but recovered in 1984. Bush's father,
George Bush, was twice embarrassed, in 1980, when he lost after winning the Iowa
caucuses, and again in 1992, when as president, he had to fend off Pat Buchanan
in a closer-than-expected contest.
</P>
<P>
	   While New Hampshire nourished McCain, it made also-rans out of Republicans
Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer. Bauer, running last, may become the
next campaign drop-out.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his victory in the nation's first primary meant his message of
political reform was the right one, adding, ``this will give us the momentum we
needed'' to compete in the primaries ahead. That means next week in Delaware and
Feb. 19 in South Carolina, where the Bush camp claims it has built a
``firewall.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign counters it has a ''50-state strategy,'' and its strength
will have become evident by March 7. That's when the GOP will have 579 delegates
at stake in 12 states, California, New York and Ohio among them, a costly
competition that will stretch McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-term odds still favor Bush, given his overwhelming financial and
organizational resources, pre-positioned around the nation, and Republican rules
that offer few if any delegates to second-place finishers in the primaries
ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent federal reports listed Bush with cash on hand of $31.4
million. McCain trailed with $7.7 million, although $6.2 million is due from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's win, by a double-digit margin, is likely to send ripples of
concern through the party establishment, the members of Congress, governors and
others who have lined up with him, and now find that McCain's message of
political reform has resonated so well with New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polling conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and
television networks, indicated that independents, permitted to cast ballots in
either primary, accounted for nearly one-third of vote in each race. The survey
indicated they tilted strikingly toward the anti-establishment candidates,
McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's critical strategic decision was to stay out of Iowa's costly
caucuses last week, calculating that he would merely be one of the runners-up
there, and not a very strong one. Instead, he camped in New Hampshire and rode
his bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,'' to more than 100 town meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory was striking for its breadth -- polling place interviews
said he led Bush for support in all age groups and income levels; levels of
education and religious groups; and all ideologies except for self-identified
``very conservative'' voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 6 percent of the GOP primary voters listed electability in the fall as
the most important quality in their vote, compared with 12 precent last week in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley said, ``we're ready and eager to continue
the fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the New Jersey Democrat had led in the polls until recent weeks, when
the vice president overtook him, and Gore thus became the first Democrat in two
decades to capture both Iowa and New Hampshire in a contested campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the Republican race, the Democratic campaign is a more even match
when it comes to financing. Recent figures show Gore with $5.7 million on hand,
plus $12.4 million expected from the federal presidential campaign checkoff
fund. Bradley's report listed $8.3 million on hand, with $11.4 million due from
the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   Also unlike Republicans, the Democrats have a five-week period of no
elections, followed by what amounts to a mini-national primary on March 7: 15
states, with 1,623 delegates at stake, awarded proportionally according to the
vote.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, US Clash Over Comments  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's foreign minister on Tuesday lashed
out at a senior U.S. official for reportedly claiming that Venezuela's
government was poorly run.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Vicente Rangel called the comments by Peter Romero, the State
Department's top official for Latin America, ``unfriendly'' and ``threatening''
and demanded an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've extended our hand to (Venezuelan President Hugo) Chavez,'' Romero
was quoted as saying in an interview published Saturday in the Madrid daily ABC.
``But you don't see a government operating, only plebiscites, referendums, more
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday that Romero was expressing
concern over the difficult fiscal and economic situation Venezuela faces.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government believes it is in the interest of Venezuela to move
quickly to enact financial and fiscal reforms and to establish an attractive
investment climate, the department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference, Rangel the elections Venezuela has been
holding over the past year for a new constitution are an essential part of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel met Tuesday with U.S. Ambassador John Maisto and said he asked Maisto
to verify whether Romero made the statements and if he did whether they
represent the official position of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, tensions between the two countries rose when Chavez reversed his
defense minister's decision to invite two U.S. ships with 450 military engineers
who were to rebuild a key coastal road in an area devastated by deadly
landslides in December.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the ships already was en route to Venezuela when U.S. officials
ordered it home.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they were dismayed by the Venezuela's about face.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a left-leaning former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup and was
elected president in December 1998, has refused to allow the United States to
use Venezuela's airspace for anti-drug flights. He often speaks of the need to
reduce U.S. influence in the world and has developed a close friendship with
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela competes with Mexico and Saudi Arabia as the top foreign supplier
of oil to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Gore Beats Back Bradley Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Beating back Bill Bradley's once-robust challenge,
Vice President Al Gore cast his New Hampshire victory as a ``devastating blow''
to his Democratic rival. Both candidates raced toward battleground primary
states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field from state to state and
coast to coast,'' Gore declared before leaving for a 2 a.m. airport rally in New
York, which votes March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley credited Gore for running a strong race but declared his
determination to fight on. ``We're smarter and better prepared and ready and
eager to continue to fight,'' he said in a speech to supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator surprised Gore with a proposal for weekly
debates starting Sunday and running through the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   With 83 percent of precincts counted, Gore had 64,318 votes or 52 percent to
Bradley's 58,554 votes or 47 percent. Gore was winning 13 out of the 22
delegates at stake Tuesday. Bradley was winning nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls framed the race as a showdown between experience and candor.
Seven in 10 voters who said they wanted a candidate who ``stands up for what he
believes in,'' chose Bradley. More than 90 percent of voters who picked the
``right experience'' as a presidential prerequisite liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic presidential candidates were plunging immediately into the
five-week race for what Bradley called ``the first national primary'' -- the
March 7 contests in more than a dozen states, including California, New York and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who spent lavishly at the top of his race, faces the national fight
with a dwindling bankroll. And so, expensive national TV ads are out and Gore
will fight the ad wars state by state, campaign chairman Tony Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, Bradley has a
$2 million edge over Gore heading into the next round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore. It increases his credentials with
the American people and shows him as a fighter. That's the image that's
important,'' Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore was battered by Bradley's late offensive on abortion rights and
campaign finance. On Tuesday, he raced to air one last radio ad asserting his
``pro-choice leadership,'' and, with an hour left in the voting, abruptly
ordered his motorcade to make a final stop at a Bedford polling site. He called
Bradley's New Hampshire loss a ``devastating blow.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the offer to debate, which he called an opportunity ``to reach
millions of voters across the country,'' doubled as a means of increasing his
name recognition outside New Jersey, which he represented in the Senate, and New
York, where he played for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane promised, ``It's pretty safe to assume we'll
have a lot of debates.'' But he said Gore still wants twice-weekly debates
coupled with an end to 30-second TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore gave some of the credit for his second win of the nominating season to
the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the nation marked its 107th straight month -- an all-time record
-- of economic expansion. ``If you ask me, I think the timing is just about
right,'' Gore crowed in announcing the milestone.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic prosperity in the Cinton-Gore years clearly resonated with some. In
Manchester, Democrat Richard St. Hilaire, 70, said he knew from the start he
would vote for Gore, even though ``Clinton and his administration have done a
lot of bad things.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' St.
Hilaire explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But accountant Charles Baron, 51, a Democrat who described himself as
generally a Gore supporter, said he was so discouraged by the negative tone of
the Gore-Bradley race that he voted for a Republican, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``lowered himself with the campaign he conducted here,'' said Baron,
who voted in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Education and health care were the most important issues to Democrats.
Bradley was favored by those who cared most about health care; Gore won those
who picked education.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of voters said the most important quality in a candidate is
that he ``stands up for what he believes in,'' and about seven in 10 of those
voters favored Bradley. But having the ``right experience'' was in second place,
with about 20 percent saying it was most important, and more than 90 percent of
these voters liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore planned to defy fatigue and jet lag with a wee-hours-of-the-morning
rally at LaGuardia Airport, then fly on to Ohio and finally finish Wednesday
with an evening question-and-answer forum with Los Angeles voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who taped a new commercial before leaving New Hampshire, was
hitting Connecticut and New York. By the early hours of Thursday, he, too, was
due in California.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Urges No Bail for Physicist  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee should remain
imprisoned until his trial because he still could reveal some of the nation's
most sensitive nuclear secrets, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has been charged with transferring classified nuclear weapons material
to unsecure computers and to computer tapes. Seven of the tapes remain missing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that numerous countries would be interested in acquiring the
highly sensitive information that Lee downloaded, and could provide safe haven
to Lee, weighs heavily in favor of detention,'' the Justice Department said in
response to Lee's appeal of a Jan. 4 ruling denying him bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The government also said Lee should remain in jail because of his strong
ties to Taiwan, his professional contacts abroad and his ability to speak
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 60, has pleaded innocent to 59 counts under the Atomic Energy and
Espionage acts. If convicted, the former employee of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico could be sentenced to life in prison. A trial may be a
year away.
</P>
<P>
	   The government hasn't been able to confirm statements by Lee and his lawyers
that Lee destroyed the missing tapes after losing his security clearance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After interviewing over a thousand witnesses, examining four terabytes of
information ... and engaging the national intelligence agencies, the FBI could
not find a single piece of evidence that would suggest, much less prove, that
the tapes had in fact been destroyed,'' the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said it had uncovered evidence that Lee had deleted many of
the classified files he downloaded to the unsecure computer, but he didn't begin
erasing them until after the FBI interviewed him on Jan. 17 and Feb. 10 of last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee was fired in March, a month after he failed questions on a polygraph
test that lab officials said asked whether he had passed information and
classified codes to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 29, U.S. District Judge James Parker rejected Lee's request for bail
referring to missing computer tapes containing classified material and citing
the potential for ``enormous harm'' to the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee's attorneys maintained that the prosecution failed to prove Lee was a
flight risk and danger to the community. They have said that during the FBI's
previous interviews of Lee, agents lied to him about his earlier polygraph tests
and threatened him with references to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the only
Americans ever executed for espionage.

<HEADLINE> Networks Excited for Race  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- There was a palpable sense of excitement among television
pundits covering the New Hampshire primary Tuesday: The presidential campaign
wouldn't be over before it began, after all.
</P>
<P>
	   After predictable results in the Iowa caucuses last week -- George W. Bush
and Al Gore were the victors -- the cable news networks were energized by
McCain's GOP primary victory and a close Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we should underestimate how amazing a night this is,''
analyst William Kristol said on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazing or not, the campaign was still essentially a cable TV story in
prime-time. Broadcast networks tried not to let the results disrupt their
schedules. ABC briefly delayed ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for a special
report, and CBS and NBC inserted results within their regularly scheduled news
magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, CNN and MSNBC simultaneously proclaimed McCain the victor when their
coverage began at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Pundits searched for colorful descriptions of how the results punctured the
sense of inevitability in the Bush campaign. Two made references to Bush as the
Titanic hitting an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Clinton aide Paul Begala said on MSNBC that Bush's aides are
``probably as nervous as a porcupine in a balloon factory.'' He said the results
would ``wipe that smirk'' off Bush's face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not yet despair, but it's definitely shock in Washington,'' said Tony
Blankley, a former Newt Gingrich aide working as a CNN analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   MSNBC's Brian Williams admitted to echoing Dan Rather's folksy metaphors in
saying Bush's aides were as ``nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of
rocking chairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   After 30 minutes of describing McCain's victory, CNN's Judy Woodruff
cautioned at 7:30 p.m. that not all the polling places in New Hampshire were
closed and the network didn't want to dissuade people from voting.
</P>
<P>
	   The dangers of putting too much emphasis on exit polling became clear when
networks tried to illustrate how registered Republicans voted, without the
influence of independents. Two networks said Bush had won among Republicans; two
said McCain had.
</P>
<P>
	   The networks said the Democratic race was too close to call until 8:50 p.m.,
when CNN's John King projected that Al Gore would defeat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated competition for viewers among political junkies seemed
briefly to get CNN's Bernard Shaw overheated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been here virtually every hour of your waking day,'' Shaw said,
promising that ``our presidential coverage is just beginning.''

will fight the ad wars state by state, campaign chairman Tony Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, Bradley has a
$2 million edge over Gore heading into the next round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore. It increases his credentials with
the American people and shows him as a fighter. That's the image that's
important,'' Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore was battered by Bradley's late offensive on abortion rights and
campaign finance. On Tuesday, he raced to air one last radio ad asserting his
``pro-choice leadership,'' and, with an hour left in the voting, abruptly
ordered his motorcade to make a final stop at a Bedford polling site. He called
Bradley's New Hampshire loss a ``devastating blow.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the offer to debate, which he called an opportunity ``to reach
millions of voters across the country,'' doubled as a means of increasing his
name recognition outside New Jersey, which he represented in the Senate, and New
York, where he played for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane promised, ``It's pretty safe to assume we'll
have a lot of debates.'' But he said Gore still wants twice-weekly debates
coupled with an end to 30-second TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore gave some of the credit for his second win of the nominating season to
the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the nation marked its 107th straight month -- an all-time record
-- of economic expansion. ``If you ask me, I think the timing is just about
right,'' Gore crowed in announcing the milestone.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic prosperity in the Cinton-Gore years clearly resonated with some. In
Manchester, Democrat Richard St. Hilaire, 70, said he knew from the start he
would vote for Gore, even though ``Clinton and his administration have done a
lot of bad things.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' St.
Hilaire explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But accountant Charles Baron, 51, a Democrat who described himself as
generally a Gore supporter, said he was so discouraged by the negative tone of
the Gore-Bradley race that he voted for a Republican, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``lowered himself with the campaign he conducted here,'' said Baron,
who voted in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Education and health care were the most important issues to Democrats.
Bradley was favored by those who cared most about health care; Gore won those
who picked education.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of voters said the most important quality in a candidate is
that he ``stands up for what he believes in,'' and about seven in 10 of those
voters favored Bradley. But having the ``right experience'' was in second place,
with about 20 percent saying it was most important, and more than 90 percent of
these voters liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore planned to defy fatigue and jet lag with a wee-hours-of-the-morning
rally at LaGuardia Airport, then fly on to Ohio and finally finish Wednesday
with an evening question-and-answer forum with Los Angeles voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who taped a new commercial before leaving New Hampshire, was
hitting Connecticut and New York. By the early hours of Thursday, he, too, was
due in California.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Flock to S.C. College  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Starting with Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday,
Republican presidential candidates are planning to visit a Christian college
that bans interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones University in Greenville has been a popular stop in many campaigns
for Republicans seeking conservative support. And few seem to begrudge the
candidates their visits despite the racial barrier in relationships.
</P>
<P>
	   The fundamentalist school now admits black students but lost its tax-exempt
status in the 1970s for refusing to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   James Gallman, president of the South Carolina Conference of Branches of the
NAACP, said he saw no problem with Republican candidates visiting the college.
``I'm sure that they realize up in that area that there are a lot Republican
votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP nationally is urging a tourist boycott of South Carolina because
the Confederate flag flies over the Statehouse -- an issue most GOP presidential
candidates have dodged by saying it's for the state to decide. Bob Jones III,
the college president, has split with some fellow conservatives and called for
the flag to come down.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans for the Bush visit prompted internal discussion in his campaign. An
aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said there were concerns the
visit wouldn't fit with Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' image.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From our point of view, this is a place where there are a lot of South
Carolina conservative voters,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, denying
there had been an internal debate.
</P>
<P>
	   College spokesman Jonathan Pait said Alan Keyes -- the only black
presidential candidate -- plans to visit Feb. 14, and Steve Forbes is coming
Feb. 17, two days before the Republican primary. A spokesman for Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, said details were still
being worked out for a stop at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Harpootlian, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, found no
fault with the visits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's a bad thing for a candidate to visit Bob Jones or a
Buddhist temple or any institution,'' Harpootlian said. ``If they wholeheartedly
endorse the principles that Bob Jones embraces, some of which I believe were
racially intolerant ... that would bother me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. District Court canceled a planned hearing Wednesday on a
challenge by Democrats against the GOP primary. No new date was set.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have alleged Republicans won't open voting places in predominantly
black areas. Republicans have said they will try to open all precincts.

<HEADLINE> Haider Strikes Power Share Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Outspoken populist Joerg Haider on Tuesday
negotiated a deal to allow his far-right party to share power in Austria's
government -- despite warnings from the United States and the European Union
that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have decided to try this path,'' declared Haider. ``This government
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider and Schuessel offered no details on the composition of their
government or details of their program. But in an attempt to defuse
international criticism, both politicians pledged that tolerance would be high
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence to indicate that anyone is going to have to leave
this country,'' Haider said, referring to charges that his party's stance on
immigration is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so. Haider
and Schuessel planned to meet with Klestil on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate State Department response to the agreement, but
earlier Tuesday, spokesman James Foley said the United States is ``continuing to
keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch,
said it would continue a ``working relation'' with the new government as long as
it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it,'' Italy's left-wing
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Italian radio Tuesday. ``If these are
thrown into question, Europe has a right to speak its mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is only now recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented to
the Austrian ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, said Haider's party ``recalls
the dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the
Nazi regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria has been without a stable government since inconclusive
parliamentary elections Oct. 3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead
of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima's first-place Social
Democrats and the People's Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last
month, paving the way for talks with Haider's group.

<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Peter Forsberg sustained a mild concussion and a cut near his
right eye Tuesday night after being slammed into the boards in Colorado's game
with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche center, who did not return, required seven stitches after Todd
Bertuzzi drove him against the glass early in the second period. Forsberg
crumpled to the ice and removed his helmet before being assisted to the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Bertuzzi received a five-minute boarding major and a game misconduct.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 76ers 101, Mavericks 100  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 29 points, including two free throws
with 17.1 seconds left that capped a rally, as Philadelphia beat Dallas 101-100
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The 76ers, who had lost their last three, trailed by 10 just seconds into
the fourth quarter, but within minutes tied it at 89. A basket by George Lynch
put them ahead 99-98 for the first time in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   New All-Star Michael Finley answered with a jumper at 28.4 seconds and
appeared to be the hero again when he snagged a rebound of an Iverson miss.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials said Cedric Ceballos fouled Iverson on the play and the
league's leading scorer swished his first free throw and bounced the second in
off the front rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Finley had the ball on Dallas' last possession, but he gave it up to Dirk
Nowitzki. As the double-team ran to him, he dumped the ball to Steve Nash, who
didn't seem to be expecting it. An ugly lob that bounced off the rim at the
buzzer reflected that.
</P>
<P>
	   A smiling Iverson ran off the court and hugged coach Larry Brown, who moved
into sole possession of 10th place on the career victory list with 708.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other end of the floor, the Mavericks -- who ended a four-game
winning streak -- were still upset about the foul called on Ceballos. Finley
walked slowly to the scorer's table and gave it a loud whack with his fist.
</P>
<P>
	   Theo Ratliff was a huge inside presence for Philadelphia, scoring a
season-high 25 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas, possibly playing its last game without Dennis Rodman, was
outrebounded 54-39. Rodman was in town deciding whether to sign with his
hometown team.
</P>
<P>
	   Ceballos led the Mavericks with 26 points and 12 rebounds. Finley had 21
points and Shawn Bradley added 17.

<P>
   BETHEL, N.C. (AP) -- A CSX freight train carrying phosphoric acid and other
chemicals derailed and caught fire Tuesday, spewing a plume of acrid, black
smoke that forced authorities to evacuate a wide area.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen cars from the 38-car train left the track and tumbled into a creek
about 10:45 a.m., said Pitt County spokesman Arlen Holt. At least four cars

lungs if inhaled.

<HEADLINE> Algeria: 6,000 Rebels Surrender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Algeria's president said Tuesday that about 6,000 Islamic
militants have surrendered under the terms of an amnesty, aimed at ending an
insurgency that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdelaziz Bouteflika Bouteflika told France's LCI television that
the political violence in the north African nation was nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without making any mistake, the problem has been 99 percent solved both in
terms of arms and in terms of men,'' he claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels were eligible for the amnesty if they gave up their arms by Jan. 13
and were not guilty of rape, murder or bombings. Bouteflika has threatened to
hunt down rebels who did not turn themselves in.
</P>
<P>
	   Algeria has been wracked by violence since 1992, when the military-backed
government canceled legislative elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised
to win. More than 100,000 people have died in the insurgency since then.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the amnesty and peace plan, Islamic militants are still carrying out
sporadic attacks both on military targets and on civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   The radical Armed Islamic Group, the GIA, has not officially accepted the
peace plan.

   AMHERST, N.H. (AP) -- A warning from the vice president of the United States:
Move that black automobile and that red sport utility vehicle from in front of
the school. The police are about to have them towed away.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore said he'd never been assigned to read a message quite like that. But
in New Hampshire, folks don't stand on ceremony. So he was interrupted with a
note from the town policemen as he answered questions before the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are two cars that are about to be towed,'' he said, and read the
license plate numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fair warning.''

primary.

</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Steve Forbes began a bus caravan across the frigid state and
dismissed GOP rivals who, he said, would ``use any words they can to defeat our
program.''

<P>
	   TUESDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in New Hampshire cast ballots in the season's first presidential
primary, handing Sen. John McCain a landslide victory over Gov. George W. Bush
in the Republican race and pushing Vice President Al Gore to a narrow win over
former Sen. Bill Bradley on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republicans, McCain rolled up 49 percent of the GOP vote to Bush's 30
percent. Steve Forbes was a distant third with 13 percent, followed by Alan
Keyes at 6 percent and Gary Bauer, who barely registered with 1 percent.

<P>
	   Gore won 52 percent of the vote, Bradley 47 percent.

South Carolina to campaign for that state's Feb. 19 primary. Gore goes to New
York for a health care event and Columbus, Ohio, to address students before
flying to California. Bradley will be in Hartford, Conn., and then in New York
before flying to San Francisco in the evening.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win in N.H. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain scored a landslide victory
over George W. Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's leadoff primary, puncturing
the aura of inevitability that had buoyed his Republican presidential campaign.
Vice President Al Gore survived a toe-to-toe challenge from Democratic
challenger Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming,''
McCain told cheering supporters. He watched returns with his teary-eyed wife,
Cindy, who put a trembling hand to her mouth and said, ``It really happened.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain rolled up 49 percent of the GOP vote, Bush just 31, an 18-point
margin that recast the GOP race for the larger states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Of necessity, Bush took the long view, telling AP, ``New Hampshire has long
been known as a bump in the road for front-runners and this year will be no
exception.'' After calling McCain with congratulations, Bush told supporters,
``I am better candidate for having come to New Hampshire and waging this
campaign and because of this competition.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was winning 52 percent of the Democratic vote, Bradley 47.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field -- from state to state,
from coast to coast -- all the way to victory in November,'' the vice president
told supporters, as Democrats and Republicans alike looked to a five-week
stretch of primaries that could determine the nominees by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost badly in Iowa last week and surrendered the lead he once held
in New Hampshire polling, but Tuesday night he found solace in the narrower
margin and he vowed to continue his challenge. ``We're moving forward,'' Bradley
told AP and indeed he has enough money to remain competitive in an expensive
sprint of followup primaries, a luxury McCain could not have afforded.
</P>
<P>
	   AP's delegate analysis showed Gore leading for 13 out of the 22 Democratic
delegates at stake in New Hampshire, with Bradley winning 9.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president cast his victory as a bad omen for Bradley, whose
laid-back style and pledges of political reform were tailor made for
independent-minded voters of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he cannot win here, then that's a devastating blow to him,'' Gore told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley shifted strategy immediately. For weeks he refused and ridiculed
Gore's request for frequent debates, but now faltering on Tuesday night he
proposed weekly debates starting Sunday through March 7, Gore aides said the
vice president would look at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly four out of every 10 New Hampshire voters do not declare a party
affiliation, and these independents were a potent attraction to insurgent
candidates McCain and Bradley in a state with a proud history of knocking
front-runners offstride.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain credited his agenda of political and campaign finance reform for his
victory. ``The Republican Party recovered its heritage of reform. And it's the
beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With returns from 86 percent of New Hampshire's 300 Republican precincts,
McCain had 49 percent of the vote compared to 31 for Bush. Millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes was a distant third at 13 percent and former Amb. Alan Keyes was at
6.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was winning 10 out of the 17 GOP delegates at stake, Bush 5 and
Forbes 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Social conservative Gary Bauer barely registered in the returns and was
struggling to survive. ``I'm a fighter but I'm not delusional,'' Bauer said,
before flying home to Virginia to take stock of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had to be disappointed, too, finishing little better than he did in
the 1996, after investing four years and millions of dollars for a second GOP
bid. Yet Forbes said he would stay and fight for conservative voters who might
be tempted to peel away from the suddenly vulnerable Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I make this appeal to those who may have backed others because of
inevitability, I plead with you, please come home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will congratulate John McCain on his victory,'' said Keyes, ``but I
cannot agree with the stands he has portrayed on the issues in this election.''
Specifically, he claimed, ``His heart is not pro-life,'' though McCain says his
voting record has been exactly that.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter interviews showed McCain winning in every demographic and income
group. As expected, he was well ahead among independents in a state that allows
its non-partisan voters to cast ballots in either primary. And he defeated Bush
among Republican voters, a constiuency that Bush had expected to dominate.
McCain advantage over Bush among GOP voters bodes well for their next
confrontation in South Carolina, a state that tends to back establishment
candidates like Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's gargantuan victory was certain to raise questions about Bush's
strategy, relying on photo opportunities and scripted speeches while McCain held
dozens of free-wheeling town hall meetings, appealing to finicky New Hampshire
voters who expect a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aired TV ads that said he was the most likely candidate to be elected
president, but voter interviews showed that less than 10 percent of GOP voters
in New Hamphire said they considered a candidates' ability to get elected a top
factor in their decision. Voter interviews showed that the top quality sought by
Tuesday's GOP voters was a candidate who ``stands up for what he believes in.''
Nearly as many voters were looking for a ``strong and decisive leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   After New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to an unprecedented
mountain of primaries from New York to California on March 7. Republicans will
compete in several states before March 7, including Delaware on Feb. 8, South
Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has held a wide lead in South Carolina polls, but McCain has more than
two weeks to chip away at the lead and hoped to marshall support from military
veterans among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizonan invested most of his pre-primary time and money in New
Hampshire, gambling that the state's independent-minded voters would be drawn to
his reform agenda. Though his campaign is more national in scope, Bush also
invested millions of dollars in hopes of winning New Hampshire and stopping
McCain's insurgent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush brought in his parents, former White House residents George and
Barbara, for a sentimental rally that apprently did not resonate.
</P>
<P>
	   The tangible primary yield was 22 delegates to the Democratic convention and
17 delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the totals needed to win
the nominations. The true rewards of New Hampshire are momentum or simply
validation of a candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters seemed to be looking for character more than policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Baron, 51, an accountant from Manchester, accountant, said he
typically votes Democratic but went for McCain. ``I have the sense he's telling
the truth,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, the Democrats shed almost any talk of issues to
exchange bitter personal attacks. Bradley accused the vice president of
stretching the truth on abortion. Gore, a hard-knuckle campaigner himself,
indignantly accused the former New Jersey senator of breaking his promise to run
a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One personal note had political implications: Bradley acknowledged just
before the primary that his irregular heartbeat had required more treatment than
he had previously said.

<HEADLINE> Networks Excited for Race  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- There was a palpable sense of excitement among television
pundits covering the New Hampshire primary Tuesday: The presidential campaign
wouldn't be over before it began, after all.
</P>
<P>
	   After predicted results in the Iowa caucuses last week -- George W. Bush and
Al Gore were the victors -- the cable news networks were energized by McCain's
GOP primary win and a close Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we should underestimate how amazing a night this is,''
analyst William Kristol said on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   Amazing or not, the campaign was still essentially a cable TV story in
prime-time. Broadcast networks tried not to let the results disrupt their
schedules. ABC briefly delayed ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for a special
report, and CBS and NBC inserted results within their regularly scheduled news
magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, CNN and MSNBC simultaneously proclaimed McCain the victor when their
coverage began at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Pundits searched for colorful descriptions of how the results punctured the
sense of inevitability in the Bush campaign. Two made references to Bush as the
Titanic hitting an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Clinton aide Paul Begala said on MSNBC that Bush's aides are
``probably as nervous as a porcupine in a balloon factory.'' He said the results
would ``wipe that smirk'' off Bush's face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not yet despair, but it's definitely shock in Washington,'' said Tony
Blankley, a former Newt Gingrich aide working as a CNN analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   MSNBC's Brian Williams admitted to echoing Dan Rather's folksy metaphors in
saying Bush's aides were as ``nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of
rocking chairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   After 30 minutes of describing McCain's victory, CNN's Judy Woodruff
cautioned at 7:30 p.m. that not all the polling places in New Hampshire were
closed and the network didn't want to dissuade people from voting.
</P>
<P>
	   The dangers of putting too much emphasis on exit polling became clear when
networks tried to illustrate how registered Republicans voted, without the
influence of independents. Two networks said Bush had won among Republicans; two
said McCain had.
</P>
<P>
	   The networks said the Democratic race was too close to call until 8:50 p.m.,
when CNN's John King projected that Al Gore would defeat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The overheated competition for viewers among political junkies seemed
briefly to get CNN's Bernard Shaw overheated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been here virtually every hour of your waking day,'' Shaw said,
promising that ``our presidential coverage is just beginning.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Beats Back Bradley Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Beating back Bill Bradley's once-robust challenge,
Vice President Al Gore cast his New Hampshire victory as a ``devastating blow''
to his Democratic rival. Both candidates raced toward battleground primary
states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field, from state to state, from
coast to coast, all the way to victory in November,'' Gore declared before
leaving for a 2 a.m. airport rally in New York, which votes March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley credited Gore with running a strong race but declared his
determination to fight on. ``We're smarter and better prepared and ready and
eager to continue to fight,'' he said in a speech to supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator surprised Gore with a proposal for weekly
debates starting Sunday and running through the March 7 primary. Gore said he'd
already been pushing for twice-weekly debates.
</P>
<P>
	   With 90 percent of precincts counted, Gore had 68,346 votes or 52 percent to
Bradley's 62,603 votes or 47 percent. Gore was winning 13 out of the 22
delegates at stake Tuesday. Bradley was winning nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls framed the race as a showdown between experience and candor.
Seven in 10 voters who said they wanted a candidate who ``stands up for what he
believes in,'' chose Bradley. More than 90 percent of voters who picked the
``right experience'' as a presidential prerequisite liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic presidential candidates were plunging immediately into the
five-week race for what Bradley called ``the first national primary'' -- the
March 7 contests in more than a dozen states, including California, New York and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who spent lavishly at the top of his race, faces the national fight
with a dwindling bankroll. And so, expensive national TV ads are out and Gore
will fight the ad wars state by state, campaign chairman Tony Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, Bradley has a
$2 million edge over Gore heading into the next round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore.'' Coelho said. ``It increases his
credentials with the American people and shows him as a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore was battered by Bradley's late offensive on abortion rights and
campaign finance. On Tuesday, he raced to air one last radio ad asserting his
``pro-choice leadership,'' and, with an hour left in the voting, abruptly
ordered his motorcade to make a final stop at a Bedford polling site. He called
Bradley's New Hampshire loss a ``devastating blow.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the offer to debate, which he called an opportunity ``to reach
millions of voters across the country,'' doubled as a means of increasing his
name recognition outside New Jersey, which he represented in the Senate, and New
York, where he played for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane promised, ``It's pretty safe to assume we'll
have a lot of debates.'' But he said Gore still wants the debates to be coupled
with an end to 30-second TV ads, as he proposed earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore gave some of the credit for his second win of the nominating season to
the strong economy, and prosperity in the Cinton-Gore years clearly resonated
with some voters. In Manchester, Democrat Richard St. Hilaire, 70, said he knew
from the start he would vote for Gore, even though ``Clinton and his
administration have done a lot of bad things.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' St.
Hilaire explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But accountant Charles Baron, 51, a Democrat who described himself as
generally a Gore supporter, said he was so discouraged by the negative tone of
the Gore-Bradley race that he voted for a Republican, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``lowered himself with the campaign he conducted here,'' said Baron,
who voted in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Education and health care were the most important issues to Democrats.
Bradley was favored by those who cared most about health care; Gore won those
who picked education.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of voters said the most important quality in a candidate is
that he ``stands up for what he believes in,'' and about seven in 10 of those
voters favored Bradley. But having the ``right experience'' was in second place,
with about 20 percent saying it was most important, and more than 90 percent of
these voters liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore planned to defy fatigue and jet lag with a wee-hours-of-the-morning
rally at LaGuardia Airport, then fly on to Ohio and finally finish Wednesday
with an evening question-and-answer forum with Los Angeles voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who taped a new commercial before leaving New Hampshire, was
hitting Connecticut and New York. By the early hours of Thursday, he, too, was
due in California.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Crash Clues Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- The pilots of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before the
jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard, federal investigators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The last minutes of the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by
pilots aboard four other aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board
was seeking to interview them.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had heard a pinging
from the ocean, apparently from the flight recorders, which could reveal exactly
what went wrong with the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was concentrated on a debris field about 10 miles offshore and
about 40 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport. Coast Guard, Navy and
private vessels were joined by military airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a day after the accident, searchers had pulled four bodies -- one
man, two women and an infant-- from the sea, which is 300 to 750 feet deep in
the area. Hopes dimmed that anyone aboard Flight 261 survived in the 58-degree
water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is still a search for human life,'' Coast Guard Adm. Tom Collins
said. ``The challenge is time. As time ticks off, risks go up.''
</P>
<P>
	   At day's end, 11 relatives and friends of victims huddled on shore Port
Hueneme beach, staring out across the receding tide as the sinking sun painted
the Pacific horizon pink and brilliant orange. Candles left in the sand by
strangers flickered as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
	   A few members of the group scooped water and sand into plastic cups. A
police officer guarding their privacy took a group picture before they left.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, passers-by paused to bow their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just feels so good to stand out here and pray. It sort of cleanses you
out,'' said Diane Adame, 39. ``You don't realize when you put someone on a plane
and give them a hug that you might not see them again. I just feel for the
people who lost their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flight had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and Seattle
with 83 passengers and five crew members. The passengers included three airline
employees, four employees of its sister airline Horizon and 25 relatives or
friends of the employees taking advantage of free standby flights.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt released preliminary transcripts of air
traffic control communications with the airliner. The last routine transmission
came at 3:55 p.m. PST, when the flight was cleared to continue to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:10 p.m. the pilots said they had control difficulties and were
descending below 26,000 feet. A few seconds later they advised they were at
23,700 feet and there was ``some discussion about their ability to control the
aircraft,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next few minutes, the pilots said they ``were kind of stabilized
and going to do some troubleshooting,'' but then said they had a jammed
stabilizer. At 4:16 they were cleared for an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The controllers cleared the plane to 17,000 feet. The crew acknowledged that
in what was the last known transmission from Flight 261, Hammerschmidt said. At
4:21 p.m. the aircraft dropped from radar.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gottschall, 45, a Channel Islands National Park worker, was putting up
a trail sign near the Anacapa Island lighthouse when he heard the jet, looked up
and watched it slam into the water 2 1/2 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane made a quick entry into the water upon impact, and
disappeared,'' Gottshall said in a statement released by the Park Service, which
noted that at the NTSB's request it did not include observations of the plane's
flight path and orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane where I felt
hopeless,'' Gottschall said. ``It had a finality to it that came very quickly.
After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just me and the sea
gulls out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The underwater pinging was pinpointed by a Navy team that joined in the
search effort. Investigators were uncertain whether the pings were from one or
both of the recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   One some planes, the horizontal stabilizer is monitored by the plane's data
recorder. The other ``black box'' records pilot conversations.
</P>
<P>
	   If the data recorder was programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it would
reveal the condition of the device's electrical and hydraulic controls. If not,
officials would have to deduce what happened to the device by studying how other
systems performed before the crash, said Barry Schiff, an aviation consultant
and former TWA pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer typically is controlled by the automatic pilot, but can also
be manipulated in the cockpit. Pilots are trained extensively in what to do
about stabilizer malfunctions. If the problem can't be fixed, the nose of the
aircraft can move up or down uncontrollably until gravity forces the plane into
a dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Both pilots were Alaska Airlines veterans. Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, was hired
in 1982 and had 10,400 flying hours with the company. First Officer William
Tansky, 57, was hired in 1985 and had 8,047 flying hours with the Seattle-based
airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad happy to see
how many people saw him as a father, a brother and a friend,'' said Fred
Thompson, 24, the pilot's son. ``And our hearts and thoughts are with the
families of the Alaska employees and passengers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was being directed by a 10-member NTSB team that arrived
in Port Hueneme early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the NTSB would be interviewing as many as four pilots who
might have seen Flight 261's final minutes from their planes -- a Skywest
flight, a private aircraft, another Alaska Airlines jet and a fourth plane that
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   As search boats moved in and out of Port Hueneme, an artist erected a 7-foot
wooden cross as a memorial to the victims. The cross was adorned with flowers,
and a white plastic angel sat at the base next to a candle in a jar.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria Arjaev, 55, of Port Hueneme, and her sister JoAnne Frank, visiting
from Wisconsin, tossed a bouquet of red carnations into the water off the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to say a prayer that they're in God's hands. And maybe for a
miracle, that there's some survivor out there. You never know,'' Arjaev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has the image of an Eskimo painted on the tails of
its planes, serves more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five
Western states. Until Monday, the airline had gone 24 years without a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, Alaska Airlines has been the subject of federal grand jury
investigation in Oakland over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report concluded that records were
falsified on two MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999.
Because of the altered records, the aircraft were considered ``unairworthy,''
FAA documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said the plane
that crashed was not one of those involved in the investigation. An airline
spokesman said the investigation focused on record keeping, not the safety of
the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors declined to comment, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA had 44 reports of ``service difficulty'' for the plane that crashed
dating to 1992, when it was built, but most deal with problems involving
emergency lights and sliding windows not opening. In 1995, an engine failed and
the plane landed without incident. The engine was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Evans, an airline spokesman, said the plane had no previous stabilizer
problems.

   OTTAWA (AP) -- Civilian sailors who kept the allies supplied with food and
ammunition during World War II are getting compensated for their war-time
service.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran Affairs Minister George Baker said Tuesday that $34 million would be
available for one-time payments of up to $16,400 to the merchant marine seamen
who were declared full-fledged war veterans last year.

   NEW ALBANY, Ind. (AP) -- Gary Bauer's campaign manager said Tuesday he is
trying to find out how allegedly forged signatures ended up on a petition to get
the Republican presidential candidate on the Indiana primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four of the 480 names on the petition submitted to the Floyd County
clerk's office are those of dead people, including two who died more than 25
years ago, said Susan Orth, the county's chief deputy prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-fourths of the signatures appear to be forgeries, said county clerk
Jeannie Freiberger, a emocrat. She alerted county prosecutor Stan Faith about
the signatures on Monday after a worker in her office recognized a name on the
petition as that of a man who had been dead for several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Cannon, Bauer's campaign manager, said he learned of the forgeries
Monday and knew of no problems with signatures gathered in other Indiana
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign won't submit any signatures to the secretary of state's office
until all of them check out, he said.

	   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Reform Party has been having some trouble
deciding where to have a meeting to sort out where to have its convention.

	   Chairman Jack Gargan said Tuesday the party will meet in Las Vegas March
17-19 try to settle a number of disputes, among them the site of August

Gargan said the March meeting would be in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The party is split between supporters of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and
Texas billionaire Ross Perot, Reform's founder.

<HEADLINE> McCain Revels in Decisive Win  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain marveled at his good fortune, calling
his New Hampshire victory a powerful boost toward the Republican presidential
nomination. George W. Bush predicted his loss in the leadoff primary would be no
more than a ``bump in the road'' on the way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, drawing nearly half the vote in a five-man field, attributed his big
win Tuesday to his campaign's emphasis on campaign reform, tax cuts and getting
the special interests out of Washington. He called his New Hampshire victory the
start of ``a great national crusade.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming,'' the
Arizona senator declared at a raucous victory party. ''... It is the beginning
of the end for the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was nothing but congratulatory to McCain, even as he dismissed the
import of the Tuesday's results.
</P>
<P>
	   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for front-runners,
and this year will be no exception,'' he said. ``The road to the Republican
nomination is a long road. Mine will go through all 50 states, and I intend for
it to end at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a concession speech to supporters gathered at Saint Anselm College in
Goffstown, Bush added: ``Mine is a campaign in every state of America, because
mine is a message for every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush spoke, his wife, Laura, smiled over his shoulder, as did his twin
18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, who were making their first appearance
on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain expressed surprise at his margin of victory. ``No one, including us,
expected the size of this victory,'' he told The Associated Press. ``Obviously
the message is what we think worked. ... This will give us the momentum we
needed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes tried to demonstrate his second-place finish in the
Iowa caucuses was no fluke, but he was unable to improve much on his showing in
New Hampshire four years ago, when he drew 12 percent of the vote. Conservative
activist Gary Bauer and former diplomat Alan Keyes sought to justify remaining
in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   With 91 percent of precincts reporting, McCain had 105,777 votes or 49
percent; Bush had 66,519 votes or 31 percent; Forbes 27,932 votes or 13 percent;
Keyes 13,815 votes or 6 percent; and Bauer 1,489 votes or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed McCain was winning 10 out of the total 17 delegates at
stake Tuesday. Bush was winning five delegates and Forbes two.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said New Hampshire showed that no candidate is the inevitable winner
-- or loser. ``I make this appeal to those who may have backed others because of
inevitably, I plead with you, please come home,'' he said. ``Make no mistake,
this fight has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer suggested he might not go the distance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a fighter but I'm not delusional. We'll take it a day at a time,'' he
said. He planned to return to his campaign headquarters in suburban Washington
on Wednesday to gauge his support. Before departing, he said the voters of New
Hampshire ``have not endorsed me, but without hesitation I endorse them as being
great citizens.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes grumbled that it was time that ``every voter of conscience stops
looking for victory and starts voting for what is right.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Forbes had a week earlier in Iowa, McCain largely focused his campaign on
a single state, New Hampshire. His strategy was to score a victory in a primary
that historically has supported political mavericks, then use the momentum to
move on to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   According to interviews with voters at polling places, one-third of
Republican voters thought Bush lacked the ``knowledge to serve effectively as
president.'' Three in four of those voters picked McCain, with Forbes and Keyes
sharing the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also won among those who viewed their finances as better than they
were four years ago -- and among those whose situation is worse. He won among
veterans and those who never served in the military. He took those who are
married -- and those who are not.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, McCain won among people interested in virtually every issue --
moral values, world affairs, Social Security and Medicare. The only group he
lost was those who identified taxes as the most important issue -- the focus of
Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   However, for those voters, their first choice was Forbes, followed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The interviews were conducted by Voter News Service at polling places. VNS
is a consortium of The Associated Press and major television networks and cable
news outlets.

<HEADLINE> Crash Tough on Alaska Air Employees  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Alaska Airlines employees choked back tears and
offered each other hugs as they returned to work Tuesday, hours after Flight 261
crashed off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 88 aboard, more than 30 were company employees, their friends and
families returning home from vacation.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been ``pretty brutal,'' said Alaska spokesman Jack Evans. ``I think the
impact still hasn't hit us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was somber at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as employees
resumed their workdays, checking in passengers and boarding flights for other
destinations.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about Flight 261, which fell from the sky Monday, two employees
at the check-in counter started crying. The airline brought in grief counselors
to talk to employees. Many were instructed not to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from three flight attendants from Seattle, there were three Alaska
employees, four employees from Alaska's sister airline, Horizon, and 25 of their
friends and family. They were all taking advantage of free employee standby
passes for vacations to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Words fail me. Emotions flood. It still seems unbelievable,'' company
Chairman and CEO John F. Kelly said in a statement. ``With our excellent safety
record, we haven't had to deal with an accident such as this in over a quarter
of a century, so this is new to the vast majority of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airline employees were not the only ones grieving. At John Hay Elementary in
Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, the flag was lowered to half-staff in memory
of four students -- three first-graders and one second-grader -- who were on
Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the students was traveling with her parents on the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three Hay students were members of the same family. Blake, Miles
and Coriander Clemetson died along with their 6-month-old brother, Spencer, and
their parents, David and Carolyn Clemetson, in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, friends gathered at the Clemetson home, a two-story, blue wood
frame house with a white porch across the front. Clemetson had remodeled it
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   David Clemetson was a physician who specialized in internal medicine and
infectious diseases. His wife was a stay-at-home mom who within a few weeks of
moving in about three years ago ``knew the names of everyone on the block,''
said Effie Cain, who lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughters Blake and Coriande ``were lively little girls. I could hear those
little patent-leather shoes going up the steps'' to their house, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miles, she said, ``was a nice little guy'' who had saved money earned doing
special chores to buy a long-wanted scooter. He tooled around the neighborhood
on it constantly.
</P>
<P>
	   At Rock Church Northwest in Monroe, the weekly prayer meeting turned into a
time of mourning for the apparent loss of the nondenominational congregation's
spiritual leaders, Linda and Joe Knight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knights were coming home from Puerto Vallarta, where they had been doing
missionary work in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Abandon Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Several hundred Chechen fighters have abandoned
positions in their embattled capital of Grozny and escaped despite a Russian
blockade. Two senior rebel commanders along with scores of their fighters
stumbled into a minefield and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Chechen fighters broke out and tried Tuesday to head south to
join up with fellow rebels, battling federal forces attempting to prevent their
escape with tanks and artillery. Russian reports estimated there were about
3,000 rebel fighters in Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Other rebels stayed in the battered Chechen capital to keep up the fierce
resistance they have mounted to months of air and artillery attacks and a
five-week Russian push to take the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no sign that any of the estimated 15,000-40,000 civilians trapped
in Grozny had left with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two prominent rebel commanders remained in Grozny with their
forces, rebels said. It was unclear how many rebels remained under their
command.
</P>
<P>
	   A large group of rebels got caught in a minefield on the outskirts of Grozny
on Monday, and several prominent Chechen commanders were killed or badly
wounded, witnesses said. Russian artillery then opened fire on the field,
killing and wounding scores more fighters, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev reportedly had his leg torn off when
his car was blown up by a mine as he escaped Grozny; he was spirited away,
rebels said, and his whereabouts was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Chechen commanders reportedly killed were Aslanbek Ismailov, who
had headed Grozny's defenses, Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov, and Grozny Mayor Lecha
Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders denied that the rebels escaped; a main goal of the
Russian offensive had been to wipe out the fighters in Grozny. The rebels who
left Grozny are expected to join thousands of comrades in the south to go on
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said Russian troops clashed with rebels Tuesday in
the Argun and Vedeno gorges, which lead through the mountains. The Interfax news
agency cited a rebel spokesman as saying fighting continued in Grozny on Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev insisted Tuesday that federal forces
were successfully blocking rebels trying to flee Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody will ever allow the rebels to leave the city other than under a
white flag and after laying down their weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels did not announce that they had given up the fight for the
capital. Their strategy in Grozny was to inflict as many losses as possible on
the Russians while avoiding heavy casualties that would harm their ability to
continue the war.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last Chechen war, the rebels lost Grozny in 1995, but kept fighting
until they retook the city in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighters' exodus began Monday as groups of rebels broke out of the
western edge of the city along a railway line. The rebels continued to flee
overnight, rebel commanders and residents of nearby villages said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian commanders insisted they had defeated rebel attempts to break out of
Grozny. A Russian military spokesman confirmed some rebels had been caught in a
minefield as they attempted to reach Alkhan-Kala, a village on the capital's
western outskirts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of these groups hit the minefield, the other was destroyed by our
units' artillery fire,'' said Col. Alexander Veklich.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen of the Chechen wounded who made it to Alkhan-Kala lay on the
snow around the village's small clinic because there was no room for them
inside, residents said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wounded fighters lie almost in piles inside the hospital, and we had to
put dozens more on the snow outside,'' said Baiant Munayeva, who helped care for
the injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is just one doctor, and no medicines, no syringes, no nothing,''
said Munayeva, visibly shaken and pale. ``Dozens have had their legs torn away,
and they lie there covered with blood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel commanders met in Alkhan-Kala to plot their next moves and possible
negotiations with Russian forces over an escape corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   A fighter who attended the meeting said there was no talk of taking a stand
against Russian forces in Alkhan-Kala. Russian forces surrounded and shelled the
village on Tuesday, and skirmishes erupted between the federal troops and
Chechen fighters on the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have been fighting since October to seize Grozny. On Monday,
Russian commanders announced their forces had taken a strategic square that is a
key to the city center after two weeks of combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August, and a series of deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were
blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win in N.H. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain scored a landslide victory
over George W. Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's leadoff primary, puncturing
the aura of inevitability that had buoyed the Texan's drive for the Republican
presidential nomination. Vice President Al Gore staved off a toe-to-toe
challenge from Democratic challenger Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have sent a powerful message to Washington that change is coming,''
McCain told cheering supporters. He watched returns with his teary-eyed wife,
Cindy, who put a trembling hand to her mouth and said, ``It really happened.''
</P>
<P>
	   With returns from almost all New Hampshire's 300 Republican precincts,
McCain had 49 percent of the vote compared to 31 for Bush. Millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes was a distant third at 13 percent and former Amb. Alan Keyes was at
6.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's 18-point margin recast the GOP race for the larger states ahead. He
won 10 of the 17 GOP delegates at stake, Bush 5 and Forbes 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Of necessity, Bush took the long view, telling AP, ``New Hampshire has long
been known as a bump in the road for front-runners and this year will be no
exception.'' After calling McCain with congratulations, Bush told supporters,
``I am better candidate for having come to New Hampshire and waging this
campaign and because of this competition.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was winning 52 percent of the Democratic vote and 13 delegates, Bradley
47 and 9.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field -- from state to state,
from coast to coast -- all the way to victory in November,'' the vice president
told supporters, as Democrats and Republicans alike looked to upcoming primaries
that could determine the nominees by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
	   The night's winners, Gore and McCain, were flying from New Hampshire for
middle-of-the-night victory rallies -- Gore in New York, McCain in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost badly in Iowa last week and surrendered the lead he once held
in New Hampshire polling, but Tuesday night he found solace in the narrower
margin and he vowed to continue his challenge. ``We're moving forward,'' Bradley
told AP and indeed he has enough money to remain competitive in an expensive
sprint of followup primaries, a luxury McCain could not have afforded.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president cast his victory as a bad omen for Bradley, whose
laid-back style and pledges of political reform were tailor made for
independent-minded voters of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he cannot win here, then that's a devastating blow to him,'' Gore told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley shifted strategy immediately. For weeks he refused and ridiculed
Gore's request for frequent debates, but now faltering on Tuesday night he
proposed weekly debates starting Sunday through March 7, Gore aides said the
vice president would look at the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly four out of every 10 New Hampshire voters do not declare a party
affiliation, and these independents were a potent attraction to insurgent
candidates McCain and Bradley in a state with a proud history of knocking
front-runners offstride.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain credited his agenda of political and campaign finance reform for his
victory. ``The Republican Party recovered its heritage of reform. And it's the
beginning of the end of the truth-twisting politics of Bill Clinton and Al
Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Voter interviews showed McCain winning in every demographic and income
group. As expected, he was well ahead among independents in a state that allows
its non-partisan voters to cast ballots in either primary. And he defeated Bush
among Republican voters, a constiuency that Bush had expected to dominate.
McCain advantage over Bush among GOP voters bodes well for their next
confrontation in South Carolina, a state that tends to back establishment
candidates like Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Social conservative Gary Bauer barely registered in the returns and was
struggling to survive. ``I'm a fighter but I'm not delusional,'' Bauer said,
before flying home to Virginia to take stock of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes had to be disappointed, too, finishing little better than he did in
the 1996, after investing four years and millions of dollars for a second GOP
bid. Yet Forbes said he would stay and fight for conservative voters who might
be tempted to peel away from the suddenly vulnerable Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I make this appeal to those who may have backed others because of
inevitability, I plead with you, please come home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will congratulate John McCain on his victory,'' said Keyes, ``but I
cannot agree with the stands he has portrayed on the issues in this election.''
Specifically, he claimed, ``His heart is not pro-life,'' though McCain says his
voting record has been exactly that.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's gargantuan victory was certain to raise questions about Bush's
strategy, relying on photo opportunities and scripted speeches while McCain held
dozens of free-wheeling town hall meetings, appealing to finicky New Hampshire
voters who expect a personal touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aired TV ads that said he was the most likely candidate to be elected
president, but voter interviews showed that less than 10 percent of GOP voters
in New Hamphire said they considered a candidates' ability to get elected a top
factor in their decision. Voter interviews showed that the top quality sought by
Tuesday's GOP voters was a candidate who ``stands up for what he believes in.''
Nearly as many voters were looking for a ``strong and decisive leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   After New Hampshire, Democrats turn their attention to an unprecedented
mountain of primaries from New York to California on March 7. Republicans will
compete in several states before March 7, including Delaware on Feb. 8, South
Carolina on Feb. 19 and Arizona and Michigan on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has held a wide lead in South Carolina polls, but McCain has more than
two weeks to chip away at the lead and hoped to marshall support from military
veterans among Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizonan invested most of his pre-primary time and money in New
Hampshire, gambling that the state's independent-minded voters would be drawn to
his reform agenda. Though his campaign is more national in scope, Bush also
invested millions of dollars in hopes of winning New Hampshire and stopping
McCain's insurgent candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush brought in his parents, former White House residents George and
Barbara, for a sentimental rally that apprently did not resonate.
</P>
<P>
	   The tangible primary yield was 22 delegates to the Democratic convention and
17 delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the totals needed to win
the nominations. The true rewards of New Hampshire are momentum or simply
validation of a candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters seemed to be looking for character more than policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Baron, 51, an accountant from Manchester, accountant, said he
typically votes Democratic but went for McCain. ``I have the sense he's telling
the truth,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, the Democrats shed almost any talk of issues to
exchange bitter personal attacks. Bradley accused the vice president of
stretching the truth on abortion. Gore, a hard-knuckle campaigner himself,
indignantly accused the former New Jersey senator of breaking his promise to run
a clean campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One personal note had political implications: Bradley acknowledged just
before the primary that his irregular heartbeat had required more treatment than
he had previously said.

<HEADLINE> Rains Trigger Mudslides in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Workers rushed to dig ditches Tuesday to prevent mudslides
from damaging the famed Nazca Lines, the mysterious symbols that Indians etched
into the ground in Peru's southern desert centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days of unusually heavy rains triggered mudslides that ripped across the
Pan-American Highway, which borders on parts of the lines.
</P>
<P>
	   One minor line was damaged about nine miles south of the most famous
figures, which include a hummingbird, monkey, heron, whale, spider and flower.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures -- among Peru's main tourist attractions -- are on a desert
plain about 10 miles north of the city of Nazca and 250 miles southeast of the
capital, Lima. They were etched by the Nazca Indians between 300-600 A.D.
</P>
<P>
	   The site has baffled archaeologists, who wonder how ancient cultures
constructed such straight lines and precise figures visible only from the air
without modern tools or airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists and popular writers debate their purpose, offering such theories
as a calendar, a map of underground water supplies and landing strips for space
aliens.

<HEADLINE> No.14 Kentucky 81, No.6 Tenn. 68  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM WHITMIRE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Keith Bogans scored 25 points, including 16 in the
first half, and No. 14 Kentucky extended its winning streak at Rupp Arena to 15
games with an 81-68 victory over No. 6 Tennessee on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats avenged their last home loss, a 47-46 setback to the Volunteers
last season, and took over first place in the Southeastern Conference's East
division.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky (16-5, 6-1) got 17 points from Tayshaun Prince, 14 in the second
half, and a 12-point, five-assist performance from point guard Saul Smith.
Prince and Smith each had six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent Yarbrough scored 17 points and Tony Harris added 16 for Tennessee
(18-3, 6-2), while Isiah Victor had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   With the fired-up Wildcats getting an assist from a raucous Rupp Arena
crowd, Kentucky ended Tennessee's six-game SEC road winning streak, as well as a
two-game winning streak in the series by the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
	   With 1:20 remaining and Kentucky leading by double digits, the Rupp crowd
began chanting, "Over-rated."
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky has won 12 of 13 games since starting the season 4-4 and dropping
temporarily from the national rankings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogans followed a 16-point performance in Kentucky's win over Miami with a
career high against the Vols. The freshman shooting guard was a threat from
everywhere on the court, going 4-of-8 from 3-point range and finishing three
Kentucky fast breaks with layups.
</P>
<P>
	   He was also 5-of-7 from free throw line, handed out two assists and made two
steals, while committing four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Kentucky led by double digits at several points in the second half,
Tennessee kept cutting into the margin, frequently on 3-pointers by Yarbrough
and Harris. Tennessee got within 58-54 with 9:46 left, but Kentucky responded
and effectively locked the game away on Prince's 3-pointer with 3:59 remaining
that made it 74-63.
</P>
<P>
	   For the game, the Wildcats outrebounded the Volunteers 40-33. They also shot
10-of-21 from 3-point range, one of the better long-range performances of the
season for the SEC's worst 3-point shooting team.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee, the league's top long-range team, was just 10-of-27 from beyond
the arc.
</P>
<P>
	   An anticipated matchup between Tennessee center C.J. Black and Kentucky
center Jamaal Magloire, whom Black labeled a "dirty player" in the preseason,
never panned out.
</P>
<P>
	   Black was in foul trouble for nearly the whole game, picking up two early
fouls in each half before sitting down for long stretches. He finished with only
two points.
</P>
<P>
	   Magloire was equally ineffective, missing all three of his field goal
attempts and grabbing only two rebounds in finishing with two points.

	   AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Mark Karcher scored 17 points Tuesday night as No. 21
Temple continued its defensive dominance with a 75-48 victory over
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple, which ranks first in the nation in defense while allowing opponents
53.5 points per game, gave up more than 47 points for the first time in five
games. The Owls (15-4, 8-1 Atlantic 10) outrebounded UMass 48-20 for their sixth
consecutive victory and ninth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Monty Mack scored 14 points to lead the Minutemen (11-9, 5-3), who had their
lowest scoring output of the season and their worst loss ever in the Mullins
Center. UMass lost for just the second time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led 23-19 before posting a 20-2 run that put the game away early. The
Owls held UMass scoreless for 7:32 before Micah Brand made a layup with four
seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minutemen then went scoreless for the first 3:55 of the second half. By
that time, the Owls led 43-21, and it was never close again.
</P>
<P>
	   Mack and Temple's Quincy Wadley, the Atlantic 10's co-players of the week
last week, each had just one basket for most of the first half. But Wadley added
two in the final two minutes of the half and a 3-pointer for the first basket of
the second half to finish with nine points.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple had won just once before at the Mullins Center, which opened in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Crash Clues Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- The pilots of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before the
jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard, federal investigators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The last minutes of the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by
pilots aboard four other aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board
was seeking to interview them.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had detected an
electronic pinger intended to help locate the flight recorders, which could
reveal exactly what went wrong with the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was concentrated on a debris field about 10 miles offshore and
about 40 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport. Coast Guard, Navy and
private vessels were joined by military airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a day after the accident, searchers had pulled four bodies -- one
man, two women and an infant-- from the sea, which is 300 to 750 feet deep in
the area. Hopes dimmed that anyone aboard Flight 261 survived in the 58-degree
water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is still a search for human life,'' Coast Guard Adm. Tom Collins
said. ``The challenge is time. As time ticks off, risks go up.''
</P>
<P>
	   At day's end, 11 relatives and friends of victims huddled on shore Port
Hueneme beach, staring out across the receding tide as the sinking sun painted
the Pacific horizon pink and brilliant orange. Candles left in the sand by
strangers flickered as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
	   A few members of the group scooped water and sand into plastic cups. A
police officer guarding their privacy took a group picture before they left.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, passers-by paused to bow their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just feels so good to stand out here and pray. It sort of cleanses you
out,'' said Diane Adame, 39. ``You don't realize when you put someone on a plane
and give them a hug that you might not see them again. I just feel for the
people who lost their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flight had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and Seattle
with 83 passengers and five crew members. The passengers included three airline
employees, four employees of its sister airline Horizon and 25 relatives or
friends of the employees taking advantage of free standby flights.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt released preliminary transcripts of air
traffic control communications with the airliner. The last routine transmission
came at 3:55 p.m. PST, when the flight was cleared to continue to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:10 p.m. the pilots said they had control difficulties and were
descending below 26,000 feet. A few seconds later they advised they were at
23,700 feet and there was ``some discussion about their ability to control the
aircraft,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next few minutes, the pilots said they ``were kind of stabilized
and going to do some troubleshooting,'' but then said they had a jammed
stabilizer. At 4:16 they were cleared for an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The controllers cleared the plane to 17,000 feet. The crew acknowledged that
in what was the last known transmission from Flight 261, Hammerschmidt said. At
4:21 p.m. the aircraft dropped from radar.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gottschall, 45, a Channel Islands National Park worker, was putting up
a trail sign near the Anacapa Island lighthouse when he heard the jet, looked up
and watched it slam into the water 2 1/2 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane made a quick entry into the water upon impact, and
disappeared,'' Gottshall said in a statement released by the Park Service, which
noted that at the NTSB's request it did not include observations of the plane's
flight path and orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane where I felt
hopeless,'' Gottschall said. ``It had a finality to it that came very quickly.
After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just me and the sea
gulls out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The underwater pinging was pinpointed by a Navy team that joined in the
search effort. Investigators were uncertain whether the pings were from one or
both of the recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   One some planes, the horizontal stabilizer is monitored by the plane's data
recorder. The other ``black box'' records pilot conversations.
</P>
<P>
	   If the data recorder was programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it would
reveal the condition of the device's electrical and hydraulic controls. If not,
officials would have to deduce what happened to the device by studying how other
systems performed before the crash, said Barry Schiff, an aviation consultant
and former TWA pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer typically is controlled by the automatic pilot, but can also
be manipulated in the cockpit. Pilots are trained extensively in what to do
about stabilizer malfunctions. If the problem can't be fixed, the nose of the
aircraft can move up or down uncontrollably until gravity forces the plane into
a dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Both pilots were Alaska Airlines veterans. Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, was hired
in 1982 and had 10,400 flying hours with the company. First Officer William
Tansky, 57, was hired in 1985 and had 8,047 flying hours with the Seattle-based
airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad happy to see
how many people saw him as a father, a brother and a friend,'' said Fred
Thompson, 24, the pilot's son. ``And our hearts and thoughts are with the
families of the Alaska employees and passengers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was being directed by a 10-member NTSB team that arrived
in Port Hueneme early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the NTSB would be interviewing as many as four pilots who
might have seen Flight 261's final minutes from their planes -- a Skywest
flight, a private aircraft, another Alaska Airlines jet and a fourth plane that
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   As search boats moved in and out of Port Hueneme, an artist erected a 7-foot
wooden cross as a memorial to the victims. The cross was adorned with flowers,
and a white plastic angel sat at the base next to a candle in a jar.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria Arjaev, 55, of Port Hueneme, and her sister JoAnne Frank, visiting
from Wisconsin, tossed a bouquet of red carnations into the water off the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to say a prayer that they're in God's hands. And maybe for a
miracle, that there's some survivor out there. You never know,'' Arjaev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has the image of an Eskimo painted on the tails of
its planes, serves more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five
Western states. Until Monday, the airline had gone 24 years without a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, Alaska Airlines has been the subject of federal grand jury
investigation in Oakland over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report concluded that records were
falsified on two MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999.
Because of the altered records, the aircraft were considered ``unairworthy,''
FAA documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said the plane
that crashed was not one of those involved in the investigation. An airline
spokesman said the investigation focused on record keeping, not the safety of
the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors declined to comment, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA had 44 reports of ``service difficulty'' for the plane that crashed
dating to 1992, when it was built, but most deal with problems involving
emergency lights and sliding windows not opening. In 1995, an engine failed and
the plane landed without incident. The engine was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Evans, an airline spokesman, said the plane had no previous stabilizer
problems.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 104, Jazz 96  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 35 points and Vin Baker had a
season-high 33 to lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 104-96 victory over the Utah
Jazz on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics led 90-79 with 5:21 to play, but Utah made things interesting by
cutting the margin to 95-94 on a 3-pointer by Jeff Hornacek with 2:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker hit two free throws and a jumper. Payton missed a 3-pointer, but the
Sonics got the rebound and Shammond Williams buried Utah on a 3-pointer with
35.6 seconds left, stretching the lead to 102-96. Williams finished with 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   The best shot the Jazz could manage in the closing seconds was an airball
3-point attempt by John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone had 26 points and 11 rebounds, and Bryon Russell scored 19 and
gave the Jazz a chance by drawing an offensive foul by Payton with 2:26
remaining, setting up Hornacek's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton and Hornacek each scored 15, but Utah lost its fourth straight.
It's the first time that's happened since January 1997, but the Jazz went on to
reach the NBA Finals that season.

<HEADLINE> Report: GM To Name Wagoner CEO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will name G. Richard Wagoner Jr. chief
executive officer on Wednesday, succeeding Jack Smith, who will remain as
chairman, WXYZ-TV reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   GM spokesman Brian S. Akre said he could not comment on the report, but said
a news conference will be held Wednesday morning. He would not say what the news
conference was about.
</P>
<P>
	   WXYZ-TV attributed its report to an unidentified source.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner, 46, has been president and chief operating officer of GM since
October 1998. Before that, he headed GM's North American operations, the
company's largest and most profitable unit. Wagoner comes from a financial
background rather than the engineering side of the car business.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner was credited with streamlining management of the world's largest
corporation while cutting the number of GM models and reducing design and
manufacturing time.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, 61, gave up the title of president to Wagoner in 1998, but remained
chairman and chief executive officer, titles he has held since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite record demand for cars and trucks last year, GM's share of the U.S.
market dropped to 29.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of GM rose $4.68 3/4 to $85.25 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, after the company announced it was not spinning off its highly
profitable Hughes Electronics unit, but would use shares that track the unit's
performance to buy back GM shares, which will have the effect of raising the
company's per-share earnings.

<HEADLINE> Crash Probe Focuses on Stabilizer  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Early theories on the Alaska Airlines crash focus on the
horizontal stabilizer, a tail-mounted wing that helps point the jet's nose up or
down. But experts said other, still-unexplained factors probably played a major
role, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before the airliner went down, a crew member reported that the
horizontal stabilizer had jammed. Minutes later, the MD-83 jetliner, with 88
people aboard, slammed into the Pacific as it was flying to Los Angeles for an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Problems with the device are rare and can usually be resolved by switching
its motors off, said Barry Schiff, an aviation consultant and former TWA pilot.
The system has not been tied to any other crashes involving the MD-80 series of
jets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This could be precedent-setting,'' he said. ``That's a pretty rugged hunk
of machinery back there, and it's designed not to fail.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 40-foot-wide horizontal stabilizer is used to balance the plane's
up-and-down motion in a process called trimming. A plane can fly without such a
system, but the crew would have to push extremely hard on the yoke to maintain
level flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots routinely train for an unusual scenario called runaway trim, in which
an electrical short or some other glitch causes a loss of control of the
stabilizer, said Dugan Blechschmidt, an Alaska Airlines pilot who checks the
qualifications of the airline's flight crews.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of a sudden the airplane wants to pitch up without any input from the
pilot,'' he said. ``We have procedures to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the 11 minutes between the first call of trouble and the time the plane
disappeared from radar, the crew should have had time to deal with the problem,
including using other controls or even cutting power to the system altogether
without losing control, experts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors, however, could have complicated the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What if something catastrophically occurred back in the tail that rendered
one of these controls inoperative? Then you could have a real problem on your
hands,'' Schiff said. ``Or what if a piece of the tail actually came off and
then jammed the stabilizer?''
</P>
<P>
	   In May, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered operators of MD-80s and
related jets to undergo inspection for signs that hinges connecting parts of the
plane's tail were corroded.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines was in the process of inspecting its fleet and had not
checked out the plane that crashed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline spokesman David Marriott said 10 planes that were inspected showed
``nothing of any significance.'' He said the aircraft involved in the crash had
been scheduled to be checked in June.
</P>
<P>
	   A horizontal stabilizer has the same effect as the feathers on an arrow or
the fins of a dart. It counteracts the aerodynamic effects that cause bobbing
during flight. Another stabilizer controls left-right motion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you fired an arrow and there were no feathers back there, the arrow
would wobble through the air,'' Schiff said. ``So we put tail feathers on an
airplane for the very same reason -- to stabilize the airplane so it doesn't
wobble.''
</P>
<P>
	   The system is controlled by flight-deck switches on the pilot's and first
officer's steering columns. Electrical motors controlled by the switches can
move the stabilizer up or down by 14 degrees, said John Thom, a spokesman for
the Boeing Co., which in 1997 bought McDonnell Douglas, maker of the MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trimming'' the stabilizer is an action a pilot uses to bring it into
balance.
</P>
<P>
	   If the crew lost control of the horizontal stabilizer, it would have no way
to keep the nose pointed at the proper angle up or down, though it is unlikely
there would be a sudden change in the plane's pitch. Aerodynamic forces would
cause the plane to gradually point toward the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that they had at least a few minutes to deal with the situation,
whatever started was probably subtle,'' said William Waldock, associate director
of the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like something happened relatively quickly at the end,'' he
said. ``Whatever it was, it was obviously beyond the capability of the crew to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   It will probably be weeks or months before any conclusions can be made.
Flight recorders will shed light on the condition of the instruments, and radar
tracking data might reveal how quickly the plane dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're doing is interpolating between that comment and the crash
itself to try to create some scenario that would all of this to happen,'' he
said. ``If you have a catastrophic failure in some way, that could lead us to
the accident site.''

   An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire jolted one front-runner, Republican George
W. Bush, and rewarded the other, Vice President Al Gore, Tuesday night in the
nation's first primary, pivot point of a White House campaign that soon will
become a costly national competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush fell to Arizona Sen. John McCain by a Texas-sized margin that the
winner said would give him the momentum needed to press ahead with his
``national crusade'' against special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, a winner in Iowa's caucuses a week ago, said he had been jostled on
the same ``bump in the road'' that others in his position had encountered in
elections past.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's victory over former Sen. Bill Bradley was narrower, but solid enough,
especially for a candidate who had trailed in the pre-primary polls for several
weeks. ``We're going to march all the way down the field from state to state,''
he said after adding New Hampshire to his Iowa victory last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush thus joined a list of national front-runners tarnished in New
Hampshire. Republican Bob Dole lost the state in 1996 but won the nomination;
Democrat Walter F. Mondale was ambushed but recovered in 1984. Bush's father,
George Bush, was twice embarrassed, in 1980, when he lost after winning the Iowa
caucuses, and again in 1992, when as president, he had to fend off Pat Buchanan
in a closer-than-expected contest.
</P>
<P>
	   While New Hampshire nourished McCain, it made also-rans out of Republicans
Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer. Bauer, running last, may become the
next campaign drop-out.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said his victory in the nation's first primary meant his message of
political reform was the right one, adding, ``this will give us the momentum we
needed'' to compete in the primaries ahead. He's skipping next week's primary in
Delaware -- which Bush and Forbes will contest -- and focus on a Feb. 19 primary
in South Carolina, where the Bush camp claims it has built a ``firewall.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign counters it has a ''50-state strategy,'' and its strength
will have become evident by March 7. That's when the GOP will have 579 delegates
at stake in 12 states, California, New York and Ohio among them, a costly
competition that will stretch McCain thin.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-term odds still favor Bush, given his overwhelming financial and
organizational resources, pre-positioned around the nation, and Republican rules
that offer few if any delegates to second-place finishers in the primaries
ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent federal reports listed Bush with cash on hand of $31.4
million. McCain trailed with $7.7 million, although $6.2 million is due from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's win, by a double-digit margin, is likely to send ripples of
concern through the party establishment, the members of Congress, governors and
others who have lined up with him, and now find that McCain's message of
political reform has resonated so well with New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polling conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and
television networks, indicated that independents, permitted to cast ballots in
either primary, accounted for nearly one-third of vote in each race. The survey
indicated they tilted strikingly toward the anti-establishment candidates,
McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's critical strategic decision was to stay out of Iowa's costly
caucuses last week, calculating that he would merely be one of the runners-up
there, and not a very strong one. Instead, he camped in New Hampshire and rode
his bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,'' to more than 100 town meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's victory was striking for its breadth -- polling place interviews
said he led Bush for support in all age groups and income levels; levels of
education and religious groups; and all ideologies except for self-identified
``very conservative'' voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 6 percent of the GOP primary voters listed electability in the fall as
the most important quality in their vote, compared with 12 percent last week in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley said, ``we're ready and eager to continue
the fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the New Jersey Democrat had led in the polls until recent weeks, when
the vice president overtook him, and Gore thus became the first Democrat in two
decades to capture both Iowa and New Hampshire in a contested campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike the Republican race, the Democratic campaign is a more even match
when it comes to financing. Recent figures show Gore with $5.7 million on hand,
plus $12.4 million expected from the federal presidential campaign checkoff
fund. Bradley's report listed $8.3 million on hand, with $11.4 million due from
the FEC.
</P>
<P>
	   Also unlike Republicans, the Democrats have a five-week period of no
elections, followed by what amounts to a mini-national primary on March 7: 15
states, with 1,623 delegates at stake, awarded proportionally according to the
vote.

<HEADLINE> Crash Tough on Alaska Air Employees  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Alaska Airlines employees choked back tears and
offered each other hugs as they returned to work Tuesday, hours after Flight 261
crashed off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 88 aboard, more than 30 were company employees, their friends and
families returning home from vacation.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been ``pretty brutal,'' said Alaska spokesman Jack Evans. ``I think the
impact still hasn't hit us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mood was somber at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as employees
resumed their workdays, checking in passengers and boarding flights for other
destinations.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about Flight 261, which fell from the sky Monday, two employees
at the check-in counter started crying. The airline brought in grief counselors
to talk to employees. Many were instructed not to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from three flight attendants from Seattle, there were three Alaska
employees, four employees from Alaska's sister airline, Horizon, and 25 of their
friends and family. They were all taking advantage of free employee standby
passes for vacations to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Words fail me. Emotions flood. It still seems unbelievable,'' company
Chairman and CEO John F. Kelly said in a statement. ``With our excellent safety
record, we haven't had to deal with an accident such as this in over a quarter
of a century, so this is new to the vast majority of us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airline employees were not the only ones grieving. At John Hay Elementary in
Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, the flag was lowered to half-staff in memory
of four students -- three first-graders and one second-grader -- who were on
Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the students was traveling with her parents on the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three Hay students were members of the same family. Blake, Miles
and Coriander Clemetson died along with their 6-month-old brother, Spencer, and
their parents, David and Carolyn Clemetson, in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, friends gathered at the Clemetson home, a two-story, blue wood
frame house with a white porch across the front. Clemetson had remodeled it
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   David Clemetson was a physician who specialized in internal medicine and
infectious diseases. His wife was a stay-at-home mom who within a few weeks of
moving in about three years ago ``knew the names of everyone on the block,''
said Effie Cain, who lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughters Blake and Coriander ``were lively little girls. I could hear those
little patent-leather shoes going up the steps'' to their house, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miles, she said, ``was a nice little guy'' who had saved money earned doing
special chores to buy a long-wanted scooter. He tooled around the neighborhood
on it constantly.
</P>
<P>
	   At Rock Church Northwest in Monroe, the weekly prayer meeting turned into a
time of mourning for the apparent loss of the nondenominational congregation's
spiritual leaders, Linda and Joe Knight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Knights were coming home from Puerto Vallarta, where they had been doing
missionary work in recent years.

McCain, Gore Win in New Hampshire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain scored a landslide victory
over George W. Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's leadoff primary, puncturing
the aura of inevitability that had buoyed the Texan's drive for the Republican
presidential nomination. Vice President Al Gore staved off a toe-to-toe
challenge from Democratic challenger Bill Bradley. With more than half the
precincts counted, Gore had 52 percent of the vote, Bradley 47. McCain rolled up
49 percent of the GOP vote, Bush 31. The night's winners, Gore and McCain, were
flying from New Hampshire for middle-of-the-night victory rallies -- Gore in New
York, McCain in South Carolina.

McCain Revels in Decisive Win
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain marveled at his good fortune, calling
his New Hampshire victory a powerful boost toward the Republican presidential
nomination. George W. Bush predicted his loss in the leadoff primary would be no
more than a "bump in the road" on the way to the White House. McCain, drawing
nearly half the vote in a five-man field, attributed his big win Tuesday to his
campaign's emphasis on campaign reform, tax cuts and getting the special
interests out of Washington. He called his New Hampshire victory the start of "a
great national crusade."

Chances of Alaska Air Survivors Slim
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Hopes are increasingly slim for finding any
survivors from the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. Searchers have pulled
four bodies -- one man, two women and an infant-- from the calm sea, which is
300 to 750 feet deep in the area. Investigators said Tuesday that the pilots of
the jet struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before
the jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard. The last minutes of
the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by pilots aboard four other
aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board was seeking to interview
them.
