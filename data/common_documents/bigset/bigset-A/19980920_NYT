   Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and
head of the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's affair
with former intern Monica Lewinsky, has a solemn message for
American males over the age of 40. It is:
</P>
<P>
   PARTY ON, DUDES!
</P>
<P>
   Hyde admitted last week that, while a 41-year-old married father
of four, he began a long affair with a married 29-year-old mother
of two. The story was published in the Internet magazine ``Salon,''
and confirmed by those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde responded to the news curtly, saying, ``The statute of
limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a professional writer, I'm not sure I could put into
words what Hyde's remark meant to the generation of men who, like
me, were born during the Eisenhower administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, something close might be, ``Henry _ ``you da man''.'' &QL; 
THE QUALIFICATIONS &QL; 
I once drove a '64 Chevy with no power steering, no seat belts and
an 8-track tape deck playing the Average White Band and yet,
according to Rep. Hyde, I'm still capable of ``youthful
indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw The Doors in concert, twice, watched first-run episodes of
``MASH'' on television, and saw Roberto Clemente _ dead 26 years _
play right field in Forbes Field.
</P>
<P>
   And qualify nevertheless, according to Hyde, as a juvenile
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is 74 years old and says he shouldn't be held accountable
for a little skirt-chasing in his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, it seems he's gone from painting the town red to
looking at it through rose-colored glasses. What he sees,
apparently, is guys like me.
</P>
<P>
   Guys with two kids, a mortgage and a box of Jimi Hendrix, Cream
and Canned Heat albums collecting dust in the attic. Guys who
mistakenly believed, until Hyde corrected us, that the statute of
limitations on ``youthful indiscretions'' expires years before a
man's fourth decade.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, playing Hyde-n-seek with a young woman, while
married, isn't such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   For some, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The man who happened to be married to Hyde's old girlfriend
disagrees. He sees none of the young Dr. Jekyll in the old Mr.
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``These politicians were going on about . . . what a
great man (Hyde) is, how we're lucky to have him in Congress in
charge of the impeachment case. And all I can think of is here is
this man, this hypocrite who broke up my family.'' &QL; 
HE WAS JUST A KID &QL; 
I say, give Rep. Hyde a break.
</P>
<P>
   He was a kid, barely 20 years past the legally established age
to drink liquor and engage in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   What does a person that young know about love?
</P>
<P>
   About relationships?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those four kids he'd fathered by then were exerting a bad
influence on young Henry.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, he's much older now and seems to believe those of
us in our 40s should be permitted a brief indiscretion. Or even one
that goes on for several years.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems to believe we shouldn't admit to an affair until
we get caught. And then we should try to divert attention from it
by saying the disclosure was an attempt ``to intimidate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Delay, deny and distract.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone else been accused of using that strategy recently?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out President Clinton was a man in his 40s when he was
alleged to have made improper advances to Paula Jones. From what
I've read, Rep. Hyde has never described that particular incident
as a ``youthful indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all this talk about personal responsibility and
moral authority and impeachment confuses me. Like many Americans,
I'm having trouble telling the difference between the defendant,
the prosecutor and the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what do I know?
</P>
<P>
   I'm just a kid. &QL;

IT'S EASY TO FORGET RODRIGUEZ'S YOUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Somewhere between his .320 batting average
and the wild swings he sometimes takes at the plate sits the real
Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between his cannon of a throwing arm and the pitches
he sometimes takes ``off,'' you'll find the real ``Pudge.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, in so many ways, the most valuable of all the first-place
Rangers. But he is also the hardest to understand.
</P>
<P>
   On a team of even-keel personalities, he is easily the most
volatile. He brandishes his emotions like a forearm tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But as a leader in the clubhouse, Rodriguez falls somewhere
behind Will Clark, Mark McLemore and Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, you have to remind yourself, is just 26 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, he has already risen to the top of his profession. He
has been in seven All-Star Games. He has more than 1,100 hits.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he is roundly taken for granted by fans and media who
have come to expect ... well, more. The defense of a Charles
Johnson, maybe. The hitting prowess of a Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone on this playing field takes him for
granted,'' manager Johnny Oates argued before last night's 8-4 loss
to the Oakland Athletics. ``Our pitchers certainly don't. In his
arm, we realize we have a weapon that no one else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his youth betrays him. Rodriguez is 26, but looks even
younger. He is Pudge, having a helmet-slamming temper tantrum in
the dugout, and yet he is Pugsley _ the oh-so-cute Beanie Baby
bulldog that honored him in a Ballpark giveaway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays with uncommon emotion. But his teammates have
suggested that his occasional self-directed tantrums could be
better spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten much better,'' a teammate said. ``You have to
remember _ he's still a young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays hard. But when a slider in the dirt slips past
him, the critics wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let those critics come out here and squat behind the plate as
much as he has this year,'' said Oates, the former catcher. ``Don't
be a critic if you haven't done it, because you don't know how
tough it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there in the heat, humidity and all the pressure, and
Tim Crabtree is skipping one to him at 92 miles an hour. Believe
me, he's moving as fast as those stocky little legs can move.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates presents an eloquent argument. For 131 games this year, he
has penciled in Rodriguez's name behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge is as good a five-tool player as there is in the major
leagues _ hitting, hitting for power, defense, running and
throwing,'' Oates summed up. ``He can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The asterisk that always seems to attach itself to Rodriguez's
numbers is named Charles Johnson, now catching for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``C.J. is a lot more defense-oriented,'' said the Rangers' Rick
Helling, who got to pitch to Johnson when both were with the
Florida Marlins. ``He leaves everything he's got defensively on the
field, and whatever he does offensively, it's a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pudge takes his offense more seriously. If he's struggling
offensively, it bothers him.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Helling said he has absolutely no problem with an
All-Star like Rodriguez behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, lest we forget, is just 26.
</P>
<P>
   If he is selfish, as the temper episodes used to suggest, his
generosity over the past year suggests otherwise. His charitable
work included donating $50,000 to construct a badly-needed youth
ballpark in North Fort Worth. In the off-season, Pudge plans to
personally deliver stuffed Pugsleys to kids in area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers honored Rodriguez on Friday with the Roberto
Clemente Man of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special,'' Rodriguez said. ``Because not only was
Roberto Clemente my favorite player, but the award is for not only
for baseball but for things you do in the community. I want to do
this for kids, to keep them happy and, hopefully, so they'll stay
out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez saw enough of the temptations of trouble when he was
growing up on the streets of Vega Baja in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   For Pudge, the way out was baseball. He signed with the Rangers
at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   He is 26 now. Young and precocious. Still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on us. Sometimes we take him for granted.

VENTURA COUNTY DEPUTIES BUST UP 870-PLANT MARIJUANA FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMIT, Calif. _ Ventura County Sheriff's Department narcotics
teams dismantled the largest outdoor marijuana farm in Ventura
County found this year, but a man seen cultivating the plants
evaded arrest and is at large.
</P>
<P>
   A narcotics team worked most of Saturday to pull two truckloads
containing 870 marijuana plants out of two sites off Highway 150
between Summit and Ojai.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Bob Garcia of the sheriff's narcotics division said the
area was not conducive to naturally growing the plant, but the
sites were structured well enough to yield an impressive crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is mountainous with heavy vegetation and very little
water. It's hot,'' Garcia said Saturday. ``The site was very
elaborate. They had their own irrigation system, and it was well
maintained. The plants were some of the better marijuana plants
I've seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing sites were originally spotted by a sheriff's
helicopter pilot on a routine fire safety check of the area with
Ventura County Fire Department personnel Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the pilot, Officer David Nadon, had worked in the
narcotics division before and was able to identify the area from
above.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find cultivations in this area periodically here, and on
the other side of Ojai,'' Garcia said. ``It was a really good job
on the pilot's part. There were certain characteristics you can see
from the sky that led us to believe there was marijuana there.''
</P>
<P>
   The growers had used tarps and trees as screens and had painted
their equipment in camouflage colors to hide the sites.
</P>
<P>
   When narcotics investigators staked out the area Friday night,
they spotted a man harvesting, loading and transporting marijuana
to another area at about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They watched him make three trips to unload the plants before he
noticed them. He evaded capture in an all-terrain vehicle and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Work to dismantle the first site, which contained 520 plants,
began at 6 a.m. Saturday morning, and a second site was found later
in a neighboring canyon. That site had 350 plants.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said there was no doubt the plants were being grown for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Prop. 215-type deal,'' he said of the
controversial medicinal marijuana initiative approved by voters in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said the plants on the site were 2 to 10 feet tall and
had likely been there since April or May, when the growing season
began.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was probably not the first time the area has been
used by suspects to grow the drug.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the most recent growing sites found in Ventura
County were indoor farms discovered in the spring. The sites raided
Saturday, he said, yielded the largest number of plants this year. &QL;

FOR GLENN, RISK IS PART OF THE POINT
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fit, trim and tan at age 77, John Glenn just grins
and gives a thumbs up when asked whether he's worried about the
health consequences of being the oldest astronaut ever.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists and aging experts admit they are ``holding
their breath'' about the Oct. 29 flight's risks, which they say
could include a heart attack or stroke _ even for a superathlete
such as Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Many worry because there are no data on whether anyone Glenn's
age can withstand some of the chal lenges of this ride in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even his family members aren't thrilled, but they know who he
is _ he lives for that kind of stuff _ he's an old test pilot,''
said Richard Sprott, the former chief biological scientist for the
National Institute on Aging who helped Glenn pull to gether the
scientific data needed to justify the flight.
</P>
<P>
   But the risks don't daunt the Ohio senator, the first American
to orbit Earth, who has maintained a rigor ous workout schedule for
most of his life and scoffs at the idea that old folks should slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, people thought that when you turned 60 or 65,
you would retire and turn into a couch potato,'' Glenn said during
an inter view on Capitol Hill recently. ``But if you live by a
calendar like that, you diminish what you can do. Every day you've
got to do what you can to your limit.''
</P>
<P>
   All the worrying is just another instance of ``back to the
future'' for Glenn. Danger is Glenn's familiar friend. In 1962,
strapped into a Mercury capsule only a little larger than a
refrigerator, he shot into orbit atop an Atlas rocket and into
American mythology as a risk taker and an adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   The three-orbit flight in Friend ship 7 wasn't without drama.
During the tense five-hour flight, signals indicated that his heat
shield had come loose. It was feared that Glenn would die in a
fiery death upon his return to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the upcoming ride on the space shuttle Discovery
will be less stressful if all goes as planned, but the G-forces of
takeoff and re-entry have them worried, as does after-effects of
nine days in weightless orbit.
</P>
<P>
   A robust man with bright blue eyes, Glenn is about 5-foot-10 and
fitter than you would expect some one his age.
</P>
<P>
   But then his routine lately hasn't exactly been routine. Ever
since NASA announced nine months ago that the senator would be the
subject of the first geriatric study in space, Glenn has been
shuttling between Capitol Hill and Johnson Space Center in Houston.
He calls it having ``two day-jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's NASA and office press handlers have been trying to keep
reporters away from the senator before the big trip but they aren't
always successful, in part because he is eager to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour walk and talk through halls of several office
buildings, he described to two reporters, from The Arizona Repub
lic and New York's Newsday, the challenging training now behind him
_ rappelling from the shuttle escape hatch was the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped once to greet a family of tourists and let them
photograph him with their little boy. On a tough day for male hero
figures in Washington _ the Starr report was about to be released
to Congress _ the tourist family had managed to find a good one.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for NASA and for those who hope Glenn's
flight will shatter old stereotypes about aging and pave the way
for more opportunities for elders.
</P>
<P>
   If the flight is successful, ``no one will look at their
grandparents in the same way again,'' said noted gerontologist
Robert Butler of New York City, that night at a dinner in
Georgetown honoring Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner sponsored by the Alliance for Aging Research,
Butler described Glenn as one of the 20th century's greatest
explorers.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns over his age make Glenn recall the first flight,
when he was already 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then I got letters telling me I was too old to go up in
space,'' he said. ``And there were questions like, could you
swallow in space and would the human eyeball change shape in
weightlessness so you wouldn't see clearly.'' No end of things to
worry about, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there will be more than 80 research projects aboard the
shuttle, making it one of the most scientifically rich flights to
date. As a payload specialist, he'll have chores, but he also is
one of the experiments, and will be sprouting with measuring
instruments and tubes monitoring his heart rate, respiration, body
temperature, blood pressure, blood chemistry and more.
</P>
<P>
   He will wear a catheter in his arm, allowing easy access to a
vein for measurements of immune func tion and protein levels. He is
happy to go back up as a guinea pig, or under any circumstances: He
has never let go of the idea of returning to space.
</P>
<P>
   Though the former astronaut wanted to fly again after his 1962
flight, his request was denied. Some years later, he was told that
Presi dent Kennedy pressured NASA to keep him on the ground.
America didn't want to lose its biggest space hero in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a career in the heart of Washington power
politics proved to be Glenn's only way back up. It took only 36
years _ not long in celestial time.
</P>
<P>
   While a member of the Senate Committee on Aging, he heard
testimony and read reports that made him realize the parallels
between physical changes in young astronauts on spaceflights and
older people on Earth. There are more than 50 such changes,
including disrupted body clocks, sleep disor ders, bone
demineralization and repressed immunity to diseases.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the Senate two years ago this month, Glenn spoke
on the need for more space-based aging research. He brought about a
meeting the following February of more than 20 respected
scientists, who compiled a list of possible research projects, many
involving older humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Huber Warner, a scientist at the National Institute on
Aging, cautions that just because Glenn could do it doesn't mean
other 70-somethings can. Glenn going up is a ``compromised
experiment,'' Warner said. ``It will measure how one very exemplary
77-year-old specimen does in space.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Glenn's mission is a success, it could open the door to
the experiment scientists believe would be more useful _ a whole
shuttle mission designed specifically to address aging issues,
perhaps involving crew members across the whole adult lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will there be other older astro nauts? Sure,'' Glenn said.
``If I bring back good information, there is no doubt that using
older people will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has its own reasons for studying aging and similar proc
esses that occur in space. Longer spaceflights and extended tours
of duty on space stations will cause problems that must be
understood and solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to go to Mars, we need to work on osteoporosis
(bone loss),'' said Sprott, and to look seriously at osteoporosis
you would need 30 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   Training in Houston, Glenn said, has not left him sore, thanks
to his normal daily exercise routine.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was always easy, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you train every day to your limit, you don't get sore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says that his wife gives him vitamin pills to take each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie gives me a whole fistful every morning. She gave NASA a
list of what she gives me, and I expect I'll be taking them up
there each morning, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mercury he used to jog five miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in really great shape,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Seven or eight years ago a doctor told him he could get as good
an aerobic workout, with less stress on his joints, if he did more
fast walking instead of jogging. He does that at least five times a
week, for two miles or more per morning. He has always lifted
weights but more regularly in the past few years to prepare for
going up in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had done more stretch ing over the past 25 years,''
he said, explaining that he is not as flexible as the other six
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   He's famous in Washington for his determined approach to
fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Determined or not, the roller coaster up, followed by nine days
of floating and the roller coaster down, will put tremendous
pressure on his heart and on the small blood vessels serving his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Sprott, who now heads his own foundation funding aging research,
is well aware of the risks, some known and others unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has an accident of some kind _ one that is clearly
age-de pendent _ then the second-guess ing will be that we should
never have let him go up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprott believes that risks are what courage is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Glenn personifies a will ingness to take risks, and that
seems to be rapidly disappearing from our culture. We have become a
risk-averse society. We need people like Glenn if we are to
continue to take on challenges. If you don't take challenges, you
don't make gains,'' Sprott said. &QL;

DESPITE OSHA, THERE IS LITTLE RECOURSE FOR FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It'snot easy to place a value on human life.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have set its worth in the millions. Philosophers argue
that life is priceless.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, however, a worker's life is worth a little less _
about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's the median fine paid by Arizona companies for safety
violations that contributed to the death of a worker, according to
a computer analysis of Occupational Safety and Health
Administration records by ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-month investigation, the paper examined hundreds
of records and interviewed company owners, victims' families and
state officials. The findings:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona companies frequently escape large OSHA fines even when
serious safety violations are found. Fines are low because of legal
limits on penalties and a complex appeal system.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of 1992 to mid-1997, 79 of the 134 worker
deaths in Arizona investigated by state and federal OSHA officials
led to citations for serious safety violations. Just 12 fines
totaled more than $10,000. The highest during that period was
$103,000, levied against four companies in connection with the 1994
death of a worker at TRW's air-bag manufacturing plant in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Fines are often reduced significantly upon appeal. In the fatal
accidents where safety violations were found, fines were cut by
about 40 percent, saving the companies involved more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranks last in the United States in workers' compensation
benefits paid to surviving spouses. In the best-paying state, Iowa,
widows and widowers can collect up to $817 a week. In Arizona, the
maximum is $183.75.
</P>
<P>
   You can't sue successfully, even if conditions are unsafe.
Workers' compensation laws prohibit employees and their families
from suing employers over workplace injuries or deaths, except in
cases where an employer intentionally tries to injure a worker.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say laws originally set up to benefit workers now
provide an almost impenetrable shield for employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our laws work, they're protecting the companies,
they're not protecting the workers,'' said Judy Powell, whose
husband, Cory, was killed in a freak garbage-truck accident in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be a lot of help for the good guy out
there, the small man.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell receives $530 a month from workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty sad the way we handle these types of
situations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that although OSHA found serious safety violations in
her husband's case, his employer paid a fine of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a human life,'' Powell said. ``He was 35 years old, he
had long time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OSHA's small fines are no deterrent for unsafe practices,
others say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Catholic nun with a &UR; ruler is more threatening than OSHA,
because they are the consummate slap on the wrist,'' said J.
Tyrrell Taber, a lawyer representing the family of Daniel Weber _ a
worker killed while building Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In Weber's case, Taber was able to file a negligence lawsuit
because the &UR; project involved several companies other than Weber's
direct employer, a subcontractor on the stadium project. The case
was settled in July for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``A construction zone is not a war zone,'' Taber said. ``It is
not part of doing business that people have to lose their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   David Vail, a safety director for Perini Building Co., the
general contractor on BOB, said the dollar amount of most OSHA
fines are financially meaningless to companies like Perini, which
posted sales of $1.3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Vail said safety-related fines can still damage a company's
bottom line, by increasing insurance costs and causing bad
publicity that drives away potential partners. That motivates
companies to strive for clean safety records, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are cited with a violation, (it becomes) public
record,'' Vail said. ``Anybody has access to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hughes, a spokesman for a business group, the Arizona
Association of Industries, said OSHA doesn't need higher fines. He
said most companies try to avoid the lost productivity, bad press
and high insurance rates associated with an unsafe workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be fined by OSHA,'' Hughes said. ``Nobody
wants to have an OSHA inspector come into the workplace. . . . The
fines may not be as large as some people think they should be, but
they send a negative signal about that business, one that companies
want to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail said OSHA ``just wants people to pay attention,'' and if
companies are willing to work with the agency, fines likely will be
reduced. He said inspectors often impose the maximum sanction
because they know it will be reduced later, after company officials
meet with OSHA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to walk away with a 30 to 40 percent
reduction in the fine, and probably a good chance of getting the
fine dropped one category,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Etchechury, director of the Arizona Industrial Commission,
which oversees state OSHA, agreed that fines don't have a big
financial impact on large companies, but said OSHA penalties still
carry weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penalty has the effect of getting someone's attention,''
said Etchechury, who has been with OSHA since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone's attention. The power of OSHA extends only so
far. The agency does not investigate workplace accidents involving
railroads, airlines, motor vehicles or criminal acts. A separate
agency also investigates mining accidents, and the Environmental
Protection Agency deals with air pollution and toxic releases.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, OSHA's authority is divided, but the state OSHA
office handles most accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Federal OSHA inspectors cover Indian reservations, federal
agencies and Fort Huachuca. At other military bases, federal OSHA
investigates accidents involving federal employees. ``The
Republic'' analysis included both state and federal OSHA cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by higher fine limits, OSHA has cracked down in recent
years. Fines levied by the commission have risen almost threefold,
to $1.8 million in 1997 from $645,000 in 1995. The average fine per
violation increased to $539 in 1997 from $198 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairwoman Gay Kruglick said those numbers reflect a
newfound attitude _ more and more, commissioners are ordering high
fines and stipulating that they not be reduced in the settlement
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is, you just cannot put a price on a life,'' she
said. ``The true value of a life, it's very difficult to come up
with things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases we would like it to be higher, much higher, but
we're limited as to what we can do in following the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Etchechury said the increase also reflects a change in tactics:
OSHA now targets companies that have high rates of workers'
compensation claims, meaning inspections are more likely to turn up
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't think you're ever going to find a
situation where you're looking at penalties that are going to equal
the value of a human life. . . . I just don't think in terms of the
political environment that's out there that you're going to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA fines are limited by law. The agency can fine a company up
to $7,000 for each ``serious'' safety violation, and $70,000 for a
``willful'' violation.
</P>
<P>
   Serious violations involve unsafe conditions that could lead
to &UR; injury or death. Willful violations involve dangerous conditions
that are known by the employer but go uncorrected.
</P>
<P>
   If a willful violation is particularly egregious, it can be
referred to the county attorney or the state attorney general. Such
cases are rare; no one has been convicted under the law in recent
memory, Etchechury said.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA also can seek court injunctions to prohibit an employer
from exposing workers to certain hazards. OSHA rarely takes such
extreme action, but when it does, most employers correct the
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Congress changed the law in 1992, the highest penalty for
a serious violation was $1,000, and $10,000 for a willful
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the limits have been raised, the system is set up to
trim them down.
</P>
<P>
   When an Arizona OSHA inspector first calculates a fine, he puts
it through a formula that gives discounts for the company's size,
safety program and record with OSHA. Smaller companies with good
safety programs and no OSHA rap sheets see the highest discounts,
up to 95 percent. And that's not the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   The company can appeal several times before actually paying the
fine. Along the way, the amount is often reduced and citations
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   All the horse-trading is done administratively, without input
from the five commissioners, who are appointed by the governor and
come from backgrounds in medicine, insurance, small business and
labor. Depending on a company's sophistication and the skill of its
lawyers, savings can be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on July 9, 1996, a maintenance man working for
Doubletree Guest Suites in Phoenix was electrocuted while working
on an air conditioner in a guest room, OSHA records show. The man,
Robert England, apparently forgot to turn off the power while
installing a part.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA cited Doubletree for a willful safety violation for not
providing adequate safety training for employees who work on air
conditioners. The company was also cited for two other serious
violations. Total proposed fine: $61,250.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of negotiations, state officials agreed to drop the
willful violation against Doubletree, and settle for a fine of
$5,250 _ less than one-tenth of the original sanction. There was a
catch, though: Doubletree agreed to pay $25,000 to England's widow.
</P>
<P>
   In official OSHA records, Doubletree's fine is listed as $5,250.
The $25,000 is not considered to be a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Doubletree's corporate headquarters were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Company owners who can't afford lawyers also have ways of
avoiding fines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, two men working for Allied Painting in Phoenix were
electrocuted when their aluminium ladder touched a high-voltage
power line. OSHA cited Allied for four willful safety violations,
and fined the company $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   The then-owner, Lorne Williams, appealed, but he didn't hire a
lawyer. In a deposition, he told OSHA officials that he planned on
filing bankruptcy and appealed so he'd have time to hide his
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought myself five or six months,'' he said in the
deposition. ``And the fine will be _ will go back up to $60,000 or
whatever is, and it doesn't matter. I don't have $47,000 and I
don't have 60 (thousand), so it don't matter which they try to
collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams followed his plan, filed personal bankruptcy, and never
paid the fine. Today, he says he was making empty threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get them to back off,'' Williams said in
an interview. ``They wouldn't. They didn't care. (Bankruptcy) was
the only recourse I had.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, even with serious violations, OSHA can't levy
fines.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Grand Canyon National Park trail-crew member
Randy Thompson was working near Tapeats Creek, a remote area along
the Colorado River, when workers above him dislodged a 200-pound
boulder. It rolled 150 feet before hitting Thompson in the back,
killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Federal OSHA investigated the accident and found three willful
safety violations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators cited park officials for allowing trail-crew
members to work below an area where boulders were being dislodged.
According to OSHA reports, two workers had been injured previously
under similar conditions.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA also cited park officials for having inadequate emergency
communications for employees working in remote areas and for having
no detailed emergency rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   The park did not contest the citations; a spokeswoman said
management is committed to improving safety.
</P>
<P>
   The three willful violations _ the toughest sanction OSHA has _
could have resulted in a fine of $210,000.
</P>
<P>
   Total fine paid by the Park Service: $0.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies are exempt from OSHA fines.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies, however, are not exempt. And state industrial
commissioners have the option of keeping fines high, in any case.
</P>
<P>
   When levying a fine, commissioners can stipulate that it is not
subject to reduction; then, administrators can't cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Etchechury said, the Industrial Commission also wants
to change the workers' compensation law, to provide more benefits
for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who suffer, essentially, are the widows and
children of widows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, commissioners wrote a letter to the Legislature,
noting that workers' compensation premiums have dropped 37 percent
since 1995. Benefits, however, have not increased in six years.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum weekly check available through workers' compensation
is $322. The state's average weekly wage is $506.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an agency we see more and more cases of injured workers and
their families losing their homes and personal transportation,''
the commissioners wrote, ``as a result of the dramatic changes in
lifestyle caused by their injuries and the static nature of
Arizona's benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, chairman of the health and insurance committee for
the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, said business and labor have
talked about legislation to raise benefit levels, but there is
little pressure to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the economy is as good as it is, it's not going to
be Number 1 on people's priority list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Huggins, secretary-treasurer for the Arizona AFL-CIO, said
his organization has been asking legislators to raise benefit
limits for several years, without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership doesn't see the need,'' Huggins said. ``They
see it as raising the cost of doing business, and they're afraid it
may drive business people out of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said he'll continue to press his case and may gather
petitions to put the matter to a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good system if business really, in fact, did their
half,'' Huggins said. ``The trade-off was, you don't sue us, and
we'll pony up the money to take care of you and your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evolved into, we don't sue them but they don't take care
of the family.'' &QL;

TYSON POINTED TO THERAPIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson's future could be in the hands of a
psychiatrist he has yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission voted to postpone for two
weeks its decision on whether to relicense the former champion and
directed him to see an independent therapist to prove he's mentally
fit to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which revoked his license after he bit off a
portion of Evander Holyfield's ear in 1996, will reconvene on Oct.
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say he's normal and can fight again, then we have the
responsibility to maybe, probably, license him to fight again,''
said commission chairman Elias Ghanem, who oversaw the
sometimes-contentious six-hour hearing at a minor-league ballpark
here.
</P>
<P>
   The decision doesn't mean Tyson is guaranteed a license even if
he receives a glowing mental evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners remain concerned about an incident in a
Washington D.C. suburb in which Tyson was accused of punching one
man and kicking another, which might indicate a continued inability
to control his temper. A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has denied any wrongdoing and his attorneys stressed at
the hearing that he's innocent until proven guilty. Commission
members will monitor the case and it will be a factor in their
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it's a touchy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still concerned,'' commissioner James Nave said. ``I don't
want to do anything without strongly considering it. We still have
two weeks to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also don't want to do something that could give anyone an
opportunity to file a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's advisers and the commissioners verbally sparred on
occasion but, while Tyson was testy at times, he generally kept his
composure.
</P>
<P>
   He again expressed remorse over the biting incident, saying,
``Trust me, this won't happen anymore. I've learned, man. I'm so
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   And he opened the door to the commission's decision to continue
the hearing when he agreed to waive doctor-patient confidentiality
when he is examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in my life is private,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   His temper flared only when he was asked how many contracts he's
signed in his long career. He asked how he could possibly know such
a thing and said, ``You are humiliating me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's lead attorney, Dale Kinsella, tried to minimize an
alleged altercation with two women in May and the punch he's
accused of throwing in D.C. by submitting testimony from witnesses
saying they never occurred. However, he failed to mention the
kicking allegation, which irked commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella tried to illustrate the financial impact of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client lost $50 million to $60 million since he lost
his license and is having financial difficulties in good part
because of questionable management in the past, which could prompt
him to fight elsewhere if he is rejected.
</P>
<P>
   And, most significant, he had two therapists who have examined
Tyson speak on his behalf. Both said he's stable and mentally fit
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough for the commissioners, who want to be as
certain as possible that Tyson will not go berserk again in the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Ghanem suggested that the commission select three therapists and
have Tyson select one. The fighter and his handlers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella said he was pleased with the decision, which surprised
many who believed Tyson's application would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's still a possibility with the D.C. incident
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern over the incident will be diminished if a
physician says he's capable of fighting in the ring,'' said Don
Haight, chief deputy attorney general. ``... He's innocent until
proven guilty. You can't take that away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean his license can't be revoked again if he's
convicted, though.''

SWITCH COULD HAVE SAVED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One button could have saved Cory Powell's life.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, a 35-year-old trash collector from Mesa, was decapitated
in 1994 while working in the bed of a garbage truck. He left behind
a wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA investigators said Powell might have survived to take care
of his family if his employer had bothered to maintain its trucks
or train its workers. The OSHA penalty: $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Powell said the punishment doesn't fit the crime. The
manner of Cory's death _ decapitation _ made it that much harder to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gruesome,'' she said. ``He was really into donating,
like blood and plasma, and he was on a bone marrow list. And the
way he died, he couldn't do it. It was just very tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1994, Cory Powell was driving a garbage truck on his
usual route in Mesa when he stopped to fix a problem with the
truck's ``ram'' _ a large, bladed device used to compact garbage in
the truck's hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was working with a helper, who was on his first day on
the job. The man watched Powell climb into a pit behind the ram and
fiddle with a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the ram started to move. Powell's tinkering had set it
off.
</P>
<P>
   According to an accident report, the helper ``reached for the
victim to help him out, but the victim turned away from him and
reached for something inside the pit. The victim then became
animated and appeared to be unable to make up his mind which way to
get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's partner frantically hit all the buttons on the side of
the truck. Nothing helped. The emergency stop button failed. The
ram continued forward.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was killed.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA investigators found mechanical problems with the safety
systems on the garbage truck, and the company that owned it, Apache
Sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   According to OSHA reports, the company kept no maintenance
records, had no formalized training for drivers and did not inspect
its trucks. And the emergency shutdown switch _ which might have
saved Powell's life _ did not work properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The switch would operate only if hit very firmly with the heel
of the hand, and then only after two or three whacks,'' the OSHA
report said. ``Normal finger or hand pressure did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona workers' compensation laws preclude Judy Powell from
suing Apache Sanitation, which has since been bought out by another
company.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' compensation insurance pays Powell a surviving-spouse
benefit of $530.79 per month. Arizona ranks last in death benefits
paid to surviving spouses, and Powell said the laws need to be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair the way our laws work,'' she said. ``They're
protecting the companies, not the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said her husband's death left her devastated and
financially strapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my house, I had to move into a room,'' she said. ``It
changed my life totally. It made me into somebody that can't
actually have a house by themselves anymore. . . . I can share, but
I can't have my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, and I have nobody to talk to.'' &QL;

NO FINES PAID DESPITE 2 DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Painters Robert Redden and Greg Gauthier were probably in a
hurry on that Christmas Eve in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Their foreman was on his way to the bank to get their paychecks,
and they had last-minute shopping to do. Both had big plans.
Redden, 22, was getting married in a week. Gauthier, 19, was
studying to get his general equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   They were finishing up, taking down a 40-foot aluminum ladder.
Suddenly, it began to topple, falling toward a 7,200-volt power
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow that ladder got away from them,'' recalled Lorne
Williams, former owner of Allied Painting. ``They grabbed the
ladder and tried to catch it. It was aluminum, and it hit them
wires and cooked them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men were killed.
</P>
<P>
   State OSHA inspectors came down hard on Allied Painting and
Williams, who had already been fined $500 in 1991 for not having a
ladder properly secured.
</P>
<P>
   This time, OSHA fined Williams and his company $47,000 for
violations that included allowing the men to work near a live
high-voltage line and allowing them to use an aluminum ladder
around electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fine was hefty, Williams has never paid a dime.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed, and in a deposition conducted by state lawyers,
said he planned to hide his personal assets and declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lose all my life savings over something like
this,'' Williams said in July 1993. ``And now it's someplace where
no one will find it. Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Williams declared bankruptcy, claiming
liabilities of $47,200 (the amount of the OSHA fine and court
costs) and assets of $2,000. OSHA never collected anything.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Etchechury, director of the Arizona Industrial Commission,
which oversees state OSHA, said it is difficult to collect fines
from a company that declares bankruptcy. The agency must stand in
line with the other creditors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Williams, 66, says he never had any assets to hide, but
was ``just trying to get (OSHA) to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his son, John, served as his foreman and had
cautioned the painters to stay away from the power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave them safety classes,'' Williams said in an interview.
``He warned them. They knew to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said there was no way he could pay the OSHA fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to lose everything I worked for my whole life
over this thing,'' he said. ``I had to declare bankruptcy. . . . At
my age, I'm kind of old to be starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden's fiancee, Jennifer Pruyne, isn't satisfied with
Williams' explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't even supposed to be using those aluminum ladders,''
said Pruyne, who now lives in Rochester, N.Y. ``He was supposed to
be using wood. This guy gets off scot-free . . . and two people
lost their lives as a result of his carelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruyne, the mother of Redden's 6-year-old son, said the workers'
compensation burial benefit didn't even cover the cost of a
headstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is out there buried with no gravestone at all. . . .
Things like that make me angry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Redden's death sent Pruyne's life into a tailspin. Because she
wasn't married to Redden, she didn't get workers' compensation. And
Redden had no life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' she said. ``I was only 21 years old. I had
a 6-month-old baby. I didn't have a job, and I had no way to pay
the bills anymore. If it was not for my family . . . I'd probably
be living on the street somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier's death made for some tough family relations. Williams,
who owned Allied, is related to Gauthier by marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst thing that ever happened to me,'' Williams
said. ``That was bad. The whole fam &UR; if

<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Opportunity was knocking. Momentum had been
established with two victories, the second an inspiring
final-minute rally to defeat TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma had the chance to start 3-0 for the first time in five
seasons and properly celebrate the school's 1,000th college
football game. Instead, the Sooners went from in sync to down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   California (2-1), executing a clutch fourth-quarter drive, made
enough plays to record a 13-12 victory last night. The Sooners
(2-1), hampered by an ineffective passing attack for the third
consecutive game, walked away wondering what went wrong _ again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts bad,'' Oklahoma defensive tackle Kelly Gregg said.
``Our offense scored right off the bat. We're supposed to hold them
to nothing. Losing at home by a point ... terrible. Yuck. It makes
you sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal's Tim Wolleck kicked his second field goal of the game, a
27-yarder with 5 minutes, 56 seconds remaining, to stomp on the
Sooners' hearts. OU didn't threaten on its final two possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners have lost 12 of their past 16 games at Memorial
Stadium. A sellout crowd (74,235) whooped it up early but started
booing late in the first half _ angered by OU's stuttering offense
and the play of quarterback Brandon Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners entered the game ranked 103rd nationally in passing;
they are likely to drop. Daniels and last-series reliever Jarrod
Reese were a combined 3 for 10 for 77 yards with one interception.
OU's only touchdown was a 58-yard screen pass from Daniels to Matt
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma coach John Blake, who was confident a return to the
option would solve his team's problems, said the lack of a passing
game did not concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several times we could have made some long runs,
but we didn't get a key block or the right read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma had 16 plays resulting in no gain or negative yardage.
With no passing threat to concern them, the Bears crowded the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to pass early and it didn't work,'' said Cal coach
Tom Holmoe, whose team survived 16 penalties for 130 yards.
``They're committed to the run and they're going to whip some teams
with that offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels was unavailable after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was noncommittal about Daniels' performance. Late in the
third quarter, the fans began chanting ``Fletch-er, Fletch-er.''
They wanted sophomore walk-on Patrick Fletcher, the hero of the
Sooners' first two victories, to replace Daniels. Fletcher did not
play.
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons under Blake, mistakes have been plentiful.
Oklahoma missed two field-goal attempts, lost a fumble that set up
Cal's only touchdown and committed a holding penalty, ruining a
drive at the Bears' 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to come away with something, at least a field goal,
when you get that close,'' Blake said. ``It's like throwing punches
and missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake came after the Sooners' touchdown. Kicker
Jeff Ferguson, who later became ill and was replaced by Matt
Reeves, missed the extra-point attempt, the difference in the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners hoped a 3-0 nonconference record would boost their
chances for a bowl game. Now, they head into Big 12 Conference play
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to go into the conference 3-0,'' Gregg said.
``Losing by one point at home will kill your confidence.''

LIGHT INSTALLATION TURNS DEADLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Macario Garcia feared the one thing that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after climbing an 8-foot ladder to install
fluorescent lights in a renovated office building, an electric
shock hurled Garcia to the concrete floor. He died 16 hours later
from head injuries. He was 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once told my younger brother that it gave him chills to get
up there,'' said Marilyn Chavez, Garcia's sister. ``I wish I had
known that before.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA inspectors cited Garcia's employer, Keystone Electric,
$6,500 for unsafe working conditions and inadequate training.
Keystone appealed and eventually paid $2,625.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was too small for the Garcia family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Chavez said. ``That's the value of my
brother's life?''
</P>
<P>
   Keystone owners Jay and Lori Schrock did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the state denied Garcia's family survivor benefits
because he was not married and did not have children. But
eventually, it agreed to pay Garcia's mother, Reyna, 15 percent, or
about $300 a month, of her son's salary as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The money did little to ease the family's grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's taking it one day at a time,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's death was felt throughout the 4,000-resident community
of El Mirage where he had served on the City Council and the Dysart
Unified School District board.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia had worked for Keystone Electric periodically for about
five years, but had planned to leave to sell real estate.
</P>
<P>
   As an apprentice, Garcia was not allowed to work on electrical
wiring, according to OSHA. But foreman Brian Drye told
investigators that Garcia may have been trying to tighten some
loose wire nuts on an energized emergency light circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's co-workers heard him yell, ``Whoa!'' and when they
turned, they saw him falling off the fiberglass-framed ladder. His
head and shoulders struck the concrete floor, and he died later,
after his brain swelled.
</P>
<P>
   His sister said the family took the accident hard. She had
already lost her father and her oldest brother. In March, she lost
her 3-year-old nephew to a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a lot,'' Chavez said. ``I guess our faith
is the only thing that keeps us going.'' &QL;

DODGERS BOMB AT 3COM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Dodgers awoke Saturday with nothing to play
for, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 12 hours after they were eliminated from the National
League wild-card race, the Dodgers played their worst game in 31
years, an 18-4 pounding by the San Francisco Giants that was so
grim, reliever Mark Guthrie threw up his arms at one point as if to
say, ``Will someone come get me?''
</P>
<P>
   No one was that lucky. Not Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes, who
threw 86 pitches in less than three innings and allowed nine hits
and seven runs. Not rookie Mike Judd, who had a chance to open some
eyes and unfortunately did by giving up six more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say there was a letdown after yesterday, but
this has just been a frustrating year overall,'' shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek said. ``But you still have to go out and show that you
are a Dodger. There still are games left in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were among the crowd of 41,671 at 3Com Park or a
Giants player clinging to some playoff hopes, that is not a good
thought.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which pulled within three games of the wild-card
lead, hit two grand slams _ by Bill Mueller in the third and Jeff
Kent in the fourth _ for the first time in one game since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who finished with 19 hits from 13 different players,
added home runs by Brian Johnson and Doug Mirabelli _ the first of
his 10-game major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the Giants' top player, Barry Bonds, who won
Friday's game with a home run, went just 1 for 2, but he did steal
a base with a seven-run lead that led to Judd hitting Kent with a
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ever came of the incident. The Dodgers did not have the
energy. It wasn't like last season when they lost 14-0 to Atlanta
and came back to win their next four games. It was more like like
May 20, 1967 when the Chicago Cubs scored 20 runs against the
Dodgers. That was the first year after Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy
Koufax retired, and like this season, the Dodgers weren't going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Malone, the new general manager who took his staff to
dinner after the game, was trying not to dwell on the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of games happen to every team,'' he said. ``Our
goal is to make sure they don't continue happening next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (10-10) wasn't sharp in his previous start but showed a
lot of guts in eight innings last Sunday to beat NL West champion
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In this game, he scuffled from the first inning even though the
Giants didn't score until the third. He stranded five runners in
the first two innings and even retired Bonds to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   But doubles by Kent and J.T. Snow began the avalanche. Valdes
got the second out but walked the seventh and eighth hitters, then
allowed a single to Giants starter Russ Ortiz (3-4). He walked
leadoff hitter Marvin Benard to load the bases, then gave up the
slam to Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   When Bonds followed with a single, Valdes was replaced by Judd,
the second of six Dodgers pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Bonds, who earlier this month tried to steal a base
with the Giants trailing 14-0, took off for second. Judd hit Kent
on the left shoulder, but Ortiz did not retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Judd was one of the young pitchers former general manager Fred
Claire protected in last November's expansion draft. He spent most
of the year at Triple-A Albuquerque. Saturday, it seemed as if he
spent the rest of the year trying to get out of the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Giants batted around and again it was the bottom of
the Giants order that got it started.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks, Johnson and Rich Aurilia, the Nos. 6-7-8 hitters,
opened with singles to account for the Giants' eighth run. Two
walks forced in another run and kept the bases loaded. Kent homered
to left to make it 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   For Kent, it was the seventh grand slam of his career. It also
gave him 119 RBI in 128 games this season. He missed a month with a
knee injury. In this series, Kent is 5 for 8 with four doubles, a
home run and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one of those days,'' said new senior vice president Tom
Lasorda, who was part of the dinner group with Malone. ``Just bad.
Bad.''

ATHLETICS BLAST RANGERS, SELE, 8-4
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Aaron Sele is much more concerned about
helping the Rangers win a division title than he is about becoming
a 20-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't help either cause last night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Sele was hammered by the Oakland Athletics in his
shortest outing of the season and the Rangers' four-game winning
streak came to an end in an 8-4 loss before 46,036 at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez thrilled the crowd with his 300th home run of his
career. But that and a three-run homer by Mike Simms came after the
Rangers trailed 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made bad pitches,'' Sele said. ``Every pitch they hit
was well over the plate. You can hang this L on me. I didn't feel
good from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Rangers only one game ahead of the Anaheim
Angels in the American League West with eight games to go. The
Angels defeated the Seattle Mariners, 5-3, last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still be in first place,'' outfielder Rusty Greer said.
``We can't let a loss distract us from what we have to do in our
eight remaining games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele lasted only 31/3 innings, giving up four runs on eight hits
and two walks. The loss drops his record to 18-11 with one
scheduled start left, on Thursday against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much eliminates the possibility of a 20-victory
season, but Sele said: ``That doesn't mean a thing. We need to win
ballgames; what I do personally takes a back seat to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele's trouble started when he walked Rickey Henderson to lead
off the first. Ryan Christenson followed with a run-scoring double
into the left-field corner, and Jason Giambi slammed a run-scoring
single up the middle, giving Oakland a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sele got out of that inning but his own fielding led to trouble
in the third after Henderson led off with a single. Christenson
dropped a sacrifice bunt too hard, giving Sele a play at second.
But he first hesitated, then bounced his throw past shortstop Royce
Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bunted the ball, and I figured if they were (sacrificing)
there, Rickey probably had it made,'' Sele said. ``Pudge
(Rodriguez) yelled two, and I didn't have a good grip on the ball.
But it's still an error. If I had made any kind of a throw, he's
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The play cost Sele. He struck out Jason Giambi and got Matt
Stairs to fly out. But Ben Grieve singled home one run, and Mike
Macfarlane's double made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great atmosphere for baseball here,'' Macfarlane said.
``This is our playoff so we wanted to play with a little more
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics kept it up against the Rangers' bullpen with four
runs in the final five innings. The home runs by Gonzalez and Simms
off Oakland starter Jimmy Haynes made it 6-4 in the sixth inning.
But Stairs doubled home a run off Danny Patterson in the eighth and
Eric Chavez had a run-scoring double off Xavier Hernandez in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen just couldn't put zeros up,'' manager Johnny Oates
said. ``I really thought we had a shot after we made it 6-4, but
they added a run right away, and that made it tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has allowed 12 runs in his past 10 appearances, and
Hernandez has given up 10 runs in his past 12 outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two are not throwing as consistently as they did in the
first half of the season,'' Oates said. ``But they'll be fine. They
brought us this far; they'll carry us the rest of the way.''

FUMBLE RECOVERY SAVES TEXAS TECH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ What Texas Tech linebacker Kyle Shipley saw at
the goal-line was nearly inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   A free ball. In the air. The game hanging on the line.
</P>
<P>
   And what Shipley, a former Martin High School standout saw, he
took.
</P>
<P>
   The junior grabbed Fresno State tailback Jaime Kimbrough's
fumble with 48 seconds remaining, then stepped over the goal line
from a yard out to complete Tech's frenzied 34-28 victory last
night before 40,035 at Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to keep them down on the goal line,''
Shipley said. ``The ball just popped out in midair and I just
grabbed it and ran it in. It was a candy-hop. Sometimes it's better
to be luckier than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech finished nonconference play 3-0 for the first time since
1989 and Fresno State fell to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley's defensive play, aided by defensive back Reagan Bounds
who hit Kimbrough, capped a remarkable final five minutes that
included three lead changes and two defensive touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore standout Ricky Williams had another workhorse night,
gaining 250 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 42 rushes.
Williams, who had a career-high 72-yard burst on his first carry of
the game, now has 665 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's 18-point halftime lead completely vanished with 4:04
remaining when senior quarterback Matt Tittle's pass was
intercepted along the sidelines by Justin Johnson and returned for
a 33-yard touchdown. Tittle, a Marcus High School graduate, had an
up-and-down start finishing 8-for-17 with 109 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the hardest things I've been through,'' said
Tittle, making his second career start. ``I was just pacing up and
down the sidelines ready to get the ball back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   After Tittle handed Fresno State a 28-27 lead, the Raiders
bounced back. On the ensuing kickoff, Tech sophomore John Norman
burst 86 yards from 3 yards deep in his own end zone. Norman, a
Midland Lee grad, shook tackles and even balanced himself on the
ground with his hands while breaking loose to stay on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down,'' said Fresno State coach Pat Hill. ``He put the
ball on the ground and spun around. Just look at the film. But you
have to give the kid credit. He made a great play when it
counted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the odds were turning against us,'' Norman
said. ``I had to make a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's big play was just a start to this game's craziness in
the waning minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams in the backfield, Tech appeared safe. But the
running back tried for an extra yard at the 1-yard line and was hit
hard by the Bulldogs. He fumbled and Fresno took control at its own
1. But then Shipley's opportunistic play saved the Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just made an awful big play when he had to,'' Tech coach
Spike Dykes said of Shipley. ``I admire our guys. They hung in
there when it looked like it was all over with.'' Extra points
All-Big 12 defensive end Montae Reagor became the school's career
sack leader with 19.5 after recording two sacks last night. He
finished with a team-leading 11 tackles. ... The Raiders drew over
40,000 for the second time this season. Its the first time since
1981 the Raiders have drawn 40,000 or more in their first two home
dates. ... Wide receiver Donnie Hart passed Donny Anderson on
Tech's career touchdown reception list with 13 and is seven away
from tying record-holder Lloyd Hill.

 &HT;    Bean earns a bushel of respect
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There never seemed to be much to Vaughn Bean. He came
into Saturday night's heavyweight championship bout against Evander
Holyfield as a virtual unknown, although ranked as the No. 1
contender by the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed a personality that was embraceable, but hardly
captivating. And he wore a red turban and a girth around a waist as
soft as a jellybean.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn left the ring at the Georgia Dome far more impressive and
compelling than when he entered, a winner in defeat. Like the guy
who breaks your lamp at a house party, Bean was looking to spoil
Holyfield's self-promoted championship event.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Holyfield won a 12-round unanimous decision, but
Bean was a heroic contestant.
</P>
<P>
   By the 10th round _ a time when Holyfield expected to be on his
way to a party he threw at the World Congress Center _ a chant of
``Bean, Bean, Bean'' rose from a small but rowdy contingent near
ringside. The challenger took that as a cue to get busier, but it
did not work out too well. After Holyfield slung him into the
ropes, Bean was dropped by a right as he was still trying to gain
his footing _ a transgression that incensed Bean's corner.
</P>
<P>
   He survived the round, but was not nearly as effective the
remaining two rounds, although he did land at least six blows to
Holyfield's surgically repaired ear. When it was over, Holyfield's
hand was raised, but perhaps Bean's stock rose higher.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Bean, who fights out of Philadelphia, faced
extreme odds, starting with his marginal talent against a noble
champion and ending with the the record-setting crowd
overwhelmingly against him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bean opened the fight seemingly unfazed about the odds.
He entered the ring to music claiming ``This is it!'' and did not
back down or away from the champion. With promoter Butch Lewis and
former heavyweight champ Michael Spinks, among others, screaming
encouragement, Bean plowed ahead aggressively if not effectively.
</P>
<P>
   He hit Holyfield with a flush right that had to heighten his
esteem. Ditto for an uppercut and a solid body shot. Also, he took
some crisp blows from Holyfield, something that had to concern his
corner.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Bean took the steps in gaining respect. He
received some punishment on the ropes, but he pushed his way out.
Later, he found an effective ally _ a looping overhand right. Bean
used it repeatedly and scored some blows that concerned the crowd,
if not the champion. And those punches and a creditable chin
carried him the distance.
</P>
<P>
   This Bean from nowhere who was supposed to be the prop in a
Holyfield hometown tribute suddenly was in territory few expected.
He had his moments against the champion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the official announcement of his defeat, Bean donned his
red turban and raised his right fist to the crowd. He received an
appreciative ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Bean professed to have learned from defeat in his title fight in
March 1997 against Michael Moorer, saying he would not let the
magnitude of the moment overwhelm him. Bean didn't. He lost, but he
won, too.

 &HT;    Duke can't handle Seminoles' speed
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ The No. 11 Florida State Seminoles separated
themselves from last week's stunning loss at N.C. State the only
way they know how _ running as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Speed has helped them rule the ACC for six years and it was
plenty to shake off a Duke team that was winless in its previous 18
ACC games and had not come within 24 points of the Seminoles in
their six meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils (2-1) have improved and Florida State may have
declined, but that didn't matter in the Seminoles' 62-13 thrashing
Saturday night. That final, combined with N.C. State's 33-30 loss
to Baylor, has last week's Seminole loss looking flukish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke really caught us at a bad time,'' Florida State coach
Bobby Bowden said. ``You never know how you're going to respond,
but we responded the way I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden simplified his offense early, allowing 26-year-old rookie
quarterback Chris Weinke to recover from his six-interception
embarrassment against the Wolfpack, work his way into the game and
let the skill players around him use their quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried a lot of things with our quarterback to see if he was
ready,'' Bowden said. ``He looked like a different quarterback than
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke looked more like the quarterback who played well in the
opener against Texas A&AMP;M, finishing with 241 yards on 11-of-19
passing for three touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles (2-1) ended their drought of four scoreless
quarters with 24 points in the second quarter and 28 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Using two turnovers in the second quarter, Florida State blew
open the game with a pair of touchdown passes, a 97-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown by Laveranues Coles and a 35-yard field goal
by Sebastian Janikowski to take a 24-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly it was star receiver Peter Warrick who was the first
to make a play look easy for Florida State. Following a Spencer
Romine interception by Sean Key, Warrick blew past Lamar Grant and
sprinted under a perfectly thrown 30-yard touchdown pass to the
back corner of the end zone.

 &HT;    Glavine's 20th is Braves' 100th
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX_ On a stat freak's dream night, Tom Glavine reached 20,
Atlanta reached 100 and the Braves reached a franchise home run
record Saturday night. Unwitting participants to the proceedings
were the Arizona Diamondbacks, riddled for 11 hits in a 5-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams, batting .375 this month, hit a two-run homer
two at-bats into the game and Glavine took care of the rest to
become the major leagues' first 20-game winner this season at 20-6.
He retired the first 10 men he faced and 16 of the first 17 to up
his road record to 12-2.
</P>
<P>
   The victory marked the fourth time in his career Glavine has
reached 20 wins, his first since 1993. He is the only active
pitcher in the majors with four 20-win seasons for the same team.
</P>
<P>
   The team also improved to 100-56, the best record in the
National League by two games over NL Central champion Houston. The
Braves have now recorded consecutive 100-win seasons and three in
the last four completed full seasons dating to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise record of 104 wins, set in 1993, is well within
reach with six games remaining to play. Not since the Philadelphia
Phillies of 1976-77 has an NL team recorded back-to-back 100-win
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had accumulated eight hits by the sixth and hit
Arizona starter Brian Anderson hard throughout. The first 18 outs
included eight line-outs, one a suspended-animation leap by
shortstop Tony Batista that took away a single from Andruw Jones in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to a run in the first two games of this series
(Atlanta's lowest production in consecutive games since May 8-9,
1997), Williams made up for the shortfall with one swing in his
first at-bat. With Ozzie Guillen on first after a leadoff single,
Williams launched an 0-1 fastball over the Diamondbacks' bullpen
down the left field line for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, Williams' ninth overall and his fourth in six starts,
gave the Braves 207 this season, tying the Atlanta record set in
1966, the team's first season at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
Anderson was a likely candidate to help the Braves tie the mark.
The homer was the 38th he has yielded this season, most in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves still weren't finished in the first. Andres
Galarraga hit a cue-shot double down the right field line, his
first extra-base hit in seven games, and Andruw Jones followed two
batters later with a double in the right-center alley, driving in
Galarraga for a 3-0 lead.

 &HT;    CLOSE CALL!
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Promoters billed the evening as, ``The Champ Hits
Home,'' and it goes without saying Evander Holyfield climbed into a
boxing ring at Georgia Dome Saturday night with some distinct
advantages. He owned the heavyweight title. He owned Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, he didn't own Vaughn Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Bean, the obscure and much lampooned heavyweight contender, did
what Mike Tyson couldn't: He gave Holyfield a challenge. Bean took
Holyfield's best punches early and late and survived a
controversial knockdown. Holyfield won a unanimous decision but not
before an overflow crowd of 41,357 at the Georgia Dome wondered
what happened to the guy who so easily dismantled Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very awkward,'' Holyfield said. ``I didn't come in
overconfident. I hit him with good shots. He also hit me with good
shots, so you have to respect that. He's a good fighter and nobody
gave him credit. He fought a smart fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you break a person's rhythm like that, it means (your
opponent) fought a good fight. What I didn't do was put punches
together like I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges' scorecards had a decided tilt: 116-111, 117-110 and
117-110. But knocking Bean off balance wasn't as easy as some
projected. Turns out the opponent, whom Holyfield trainer Don
Turner insisted ``is no joke,'' gave the IBF and WBA champion fits.
Bean's punches didn't carry enough whallop to get Holyfield in
trouble, but he connected enough times and dodged enough to last
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The only knockdown, in fact, was set up by an unfair advantage
for Holyfield. Holyfield dominated the early rounds but could not
deliver a knockdown punch, and Bean seemed to gain confidence with
each passing round. Some ringside fans actually started to chant,
``Bean, Bean, Bean'' in the 10th round when the fight turned ugly
with Bean leaning on Holyfield, the champion sidestepped Bean and
appeared to push him through the ropes. As Bean started to get up,
Holyfield knocked him down with a right to the head before referee
Brian Garry could get between them. Bean got up and lasted the
round, but Bean's corner went crazy, yelling expletives at
Holyfield and Garry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me when I was down,'' Bean said. ``The ref didn't do
his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean shook off the controversy and the punishment. He hung with
Holyfield in the 11th round and actually landed the stronger blows
in the 12th as the final bell sounded.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bell nobody thought would be run that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I won the fight _ same song,'' said Bean, who lost a
majority decision to Michael Moorer last year. ``I hit him with a
lot of punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King said later, ``See what I mean about Mr. Bean?
Can't ever tell what's going to happen when you step into the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not Holyfield's first fight in Atlanta, just his most
significant. All previous ring appearances came either as an
overlooked amateur, not expected to make the U.S. Olympic team, or
as a popular but underappreciated professional. Even as heavyweight
champion in 1991, Holyfield entered the Omni against Bert Cooper
perceived as only second-best in the world to an Indiana inmate
named Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Not Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield strolled down a walkway to ``Spirit of Jesus,''
the crowd rose and recognized him as the probable winner of not
only this fight but the owner of his era. He had destroyed Mike
Tyson twice to claim and defend one title belt and flattened
Michael Moorer to add another, rendering WBC champion Lennox Lewis
into almost an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield wasted little time going after Bean. He pressed the
attack in the first round, landing three consecutive shots to
Bean's belly a minute into the fight and connecting with an
overhand right to the chin in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Bean, who weighed in at 231 pounds,19 pounds heavier than he
weighed for his last title shot against Michael Moorer 18 months
ago, spent much of the time backing up, trying to catch Holyfield s
he was coming in. But he landed his best shot late in the second
round while standing in the center of the ring, knocking Holyfield
back with a left to the top of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield came out in the third round on his toes, intent on
boxing Holyfield. Bean, however, stayed back and stayed clear of
Holyfield's jab. The two eventually stood flat-footed exchanging
combinations. Holyfield finished with a flurry toward the end of
the round but was unable to land a significant blow.
</P>
<P>
   Bean started to tire in the fourth. As his cornerman yelled,
``Hang on, Vaughn,'' Holyfield connected with a right to the head
and a left to the chin. Bean escaped further damage but was
breathing heavy at the end of the round.
</P>
<P>
   The night was not over any time soon, though. Bean landed a
strong uppercut in the fifth round and seemed to gain momentum in
the sixth, taking the best of Holyfield's punches and firing back.
</P>
<P>
   And he kept it up for six more rounds.

UCLA STUMBLES TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The UCLA Bruins arrived in this steam bath by
Galveston Bay as four-touchdown favorites, ranked fourth
nationally, feeling wiser and better than their years would
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   They left Saturday evening without big-play receiver Freddie
Mitchell, lost for the season with a broken leg, without talented
defensive lineman Kenyon Coleman, out at least three weeks with a
knee injury, and looking every bit their age.
</P>
<P>
   Don't book those Fiesta Bowl tickets just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' 42-24 victory over Houston, before 19,540 Saturday
at Robertson Stadium, was delivered in the most atypical wrapping.
From Cade McNown's fumbled snaps to Chris Sailer's missed field
goals, from spotty defense to myriad penalties, this was UCLA's
worst performance since the first half of the Tennessee game 54
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston came to play, and as far as us matching their
intensity, we didn't do a good job,'' Bruins cornerback Marques
Anderson said. ``Even though we're the No. 4 team in the nation, we
still have a lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a winless team they smashed 66-10 last season, the Bruins
started slow, yielded 442 yards and played exactly like a team with
two senior starters on defense. Houston quarterback Jason McKinley
looked like David Klingler at times, as UCLA's blitzers failed to
penetrate the Cougars' line and its cornerbacks failed to slow a
less-than-stellar receiving corps.
</P>
<P>
   Even McNown seemed out of sync, despite his 315 yards.
Mitchell's injury stripped the Bruins of their best big-play threat
and made them look unusually slow.
</P>
<P>
   While tailback Jermaine Lewis tied a school record with four
touchdowns, UCLA's ground game never took charge against Houston's
stingy defense, ranked second in the nation against the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars also delivered a series of late hits designed to
rattle the young Bruins and frustrated McNown, who suffered minor
sprains of both ankles and appeared to absorb more blows that
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little concerned about some of the late hits on
Cade,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``And I wasn't particularly
pleased with how (the officials) controlled the game. I don't think
(Houston coach) Kim Helton was, either.''
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, the 2-0 Bruins are victims of their own success.
They've been so dominant during their school-record 12-game winning
streak that anything less than 50-10 seems a death struggle. This
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Closer than expected? Perhaps. Sloppier than expected?
Absolutely. The Bruins committed 12 penalties for 90 yards. But
Houston never stood on the brink of an upset, never got closer than
11 points in the second half and never made the Bruins sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave an excellent effort,'' UCLA guard Andy Meyers said.
``It was probably the best game they'll play all year. But we
showed a lot of poise. It can't get any more adverse than it was,
and we responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have beaten Texas 66-3 last year, but we beat these
guys 66-10, and they were equally vengeful. They wanted our
(butts), and they got the best piece they could get. But good teams
find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins found it not with meticulous execution, but with a
slew of big plays that turned a 6-0 first-quarter deficit into a
35-14 third-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   McNown connected with receiver Brian Poli-Dixon for the first
strike, a 61-yard touchdown pass that gave UCLA a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's ensuing drive stalled after three plays, and Tod
McBride, the third-string safety with two bad knees, charged around
left end and blocked Joey Saavedra's punt. A minute later, Lewis
bulled for his first score and a 14-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one play I could have back, I wish that we could
take back that blocked punt,'' Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took command early in the third quarter with two
touchdowns in less than a minute. Linebacker Santi Hall intercepted
McKinley's pass at the Houston 26, and with 9:55 remaining, Lewis
plunged for another scored.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Ryan Roques intercepted McKinley's pass in
the left flat and charged 17 yards for a touchdown.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Somewhere between his .320 batting average
and the wild swings he sometimes takes at the plate sits the real
Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between his cannon of a throwing arm and the pitches
he sometimes takes ``off,'' you'll find the real ``Pudge.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, in so many ways, the most valuable of all the first-place
Rangers. But he is also the hardest to understand.
</P>
<P>
   On a team of even-keel personalities, he is easily the most
volatile. He brandishes his emotions like a forearm tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   But as a leader in the clubhouse, Rodriguez falls somewhere
behind Will Clark, Mark McLemore and Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez, you have to remind yourself, is just 26 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, he has already risen to the top of his profession. He
has been in seven All-Star Games. He has more than 1,100 hits.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he is roundly taken for granted by fans and media who
have come to expect ... well, more. The defense of a Charles
Johnson, maybe. The hitting prowess of a Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone on this playing field takes him for
granted,'' manager Johnny Oates argued before last night's 8-4 loss
to the Oakland Athletics. ``Our pitchers certainly don't. In his
arm, we realize we have a weapon that no one else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his youth betrays him. Rodriguez is 26, but looks even
younger. He is Pudge, having a helmet-slamming temper tantrum in
the dugout, and yet he is Pugsley _ the oh-so-cute Beanie Baby
bulldog that honored him in a Ballpark giveaway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays with uncommon emotion. But his teammates have
suggested that his occasional self-directed tantrums could be
better spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten much better,'' a teammate said. ``You have to
remember _ he's still a young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez plays hard. But when a slider in the dirt slips past
him, the critics wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let those critics come out here and squat behind the plate as
much as he has this year,'' said Oates, the former catcher. ``Don't
be a critic if you haven't done it, because you don't know how
tough it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there in the heat, humidity and all the pressure, and
Tim Crabtree is skipping one to him at 92 miles an hour. Believe
me, he's moving as fast as those stocky little legs can move.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates presents an eloquent argument. For 131 games this year, he
has penciled in Rodriguez's name behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge is as good a five-tool player as there is in the major
leagues _ hitting, hitting for power, defense, running and
throwing,'' Oates summed up. ``He can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The asterisk that always seems to attach itself to Rodriguez's
numbers is named Charles Johnson, now catching for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``C.J. is a lot more defense-oriented,'' said the Rangers' Rick
Helling, who got to pitch to Johnson when both were with the
Florida Marlins. ``He leaves everything he's got defensively on the
field, and whatever he does offensively, it's a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pudge takes his offense more seriously. If he's struggling
offensively, it bothers him.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Helling said he has absolutely no problem with an
All-Star like Rodriguez behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, lest we forget, is just 26.
</P>
<P>
   If he is selfish, as the temper episodes used to suggest, his
generosity over the past year suggests otherwise. His charitable
work included donating $50,000 to construct a badly-needed youth
ballpark in North Fort Worth. In the off-season, Pudge plans to
personally deliver stuffed Pugsleys to kids in area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers honored Rodriguez on Friday with the Roberto
Clemente Man of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special,'' Rodriguez said. ``Because not only was
Roberto Clemente my favorite player, but the award is for not only
for baseball but for things you do in the community. I want to do
this for kids, to keep them happy and, hopefully, so they'll stay
out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez saw enough of the temptations of trouble when he was
growing up on the streets of Vega Baja in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   For Pudge, the way out was baseball. He signed with the Rangers
at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   He is 26 now. Young and precocious. Still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on us. Sometimes we take him for granted.
</P>

ARIZONA STATE PREVAILS OVER AROUSED UNT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Less than two minutes had passed, 117 seconds to
be exact, and Arizona State already had a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun Devils squad favored by 36 1/2 points appeared ready to
swallow frustration from an unexpected 0-2 start along with a
struggling North Texas team in a single gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead UNT engaged them in an impressive game of keepaway, and
Arizona State had to settle for a less gaudy 34-15 victory.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason UNT remained within spitting distance of Arizona
State was a also a big reason UNT had looked hapless in Weeks 1 and
2.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, an offense that ranked 112th among Division I-A programs
coming into last night's game finally showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles finished with 368 yards in total offense against
Arizona State. They had a two-game total of 264 coming in. The
Eagles finished with 25 first downs. They had a two-game total of
13 coming in.
</P>
<P>
   And when sophomore quarterback LaDarrin McLane tossed a 9-yard
touchdown pass to a wide-open Ron Sterling, it ended a streak of 31
consecutive possessions without scoring a touchdown. The last
touchdown? It came on the Eagles' first drive against Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   UNT then followed it up with a touchdown on its next drive, a
4-yard run by tailback Tubby Coleman. He finished with 26 rushes
for 74 yards and his first-career touchdown. His previous numbers
were 104 yards on 29 carries _ in his career.
</P>
<P>
   UNT coach Darrell Dickey had promised a better attack coming in,
and he delivered with an I-formation that featured two tight ends
in an effort to jump-start a running game that had looked lethargic
at best this season.
</P>
<P>
   So the problem was?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is UNT's defense.
</P>
<P>
   A strength in Weeks 1 and 2, UNT's defense proved to be a
problem against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   They had allowed 433 yards by game's end, and began by allowing
Arizona State a yard every 2.1 seconds on that opening drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils went 57 yards in six plays capped by a 13-yard
touchdown jog by tailback J.R. Redmond. He finished with 15 rushes
for 122 yards with a career-high three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State scored quickly and on big plays, a 60-yard
touchdown pass from Ryan Kealy to Kenny Mitchell, a 24-yard run by
Redmond, a 9-yard pass from Kealy to Lenzie Jackson and another
13-yard run by Redmond. Extra points UNT safety Ramone Archie
suffered a separated right shoulder in the third quarter, and
didn't return. He had been UNT's leading tackler coming into this
game with 26 tackles. ... UNT earned a $400,000 paycheck for last
night's game, according to Eagles athletic director Craig Helwig.
... UNT's defense snagged a pair of interceptions, by Archie and
Phillip Littlejohn. UNT's two interceptions lands them with five on
the season, tying last season's 11-game mark. ... Littlejohn
returned to action after missing last Saturday's game against Texas
Tech with a pulled hamstring. ... Eagles place-kicker Garrett
Courtney's 42-yard field goal marks his ninth straight of 40 yards
or better. ... Courtney had a 35-yard field-goal attempt blocked
earlier. UNT has allowed a pair of field goals and an extra point
blocked so far this season. ... UNT hadn't started a season 0-3
since 1982.

RANGERS' GONZALEZ HITS 300TH HOME RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JEFF SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ In this, the year of the home run, Rangers
right fielder Juan Gonzalez quietly found his way into the history
books last night at The Ballpark in Arlington by becoming the 81st
player in major-league history to hit 300 career home runs.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the opposing pitcher was the Oakland Athletics'
Jimmy Haynes, the inning was the sixth, the count was 1-0 and the
distance of the home run was 390 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, less than one shy of his 29th birthday, became the
sixth youngest player in major-league history to accomplish the
feat, joining four Hall of Famers and Ken Griffey Jr. Only four
players _ three Hall of Famers and Mark McGwire _ have hit their
300th home run in fewer at-bats than the 4,239 it took Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, all right, but we lost a very important game, and I'm
more concerned with losing than home runs,'' Gonzalez said. ``I'll
have more chances for home runs, but losing a game is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Gonzalez's 44th of the season, which is the
third-highest single-season total in club history, behind his own
marks of 47 and 46 in 1996 and '93, respectively. On the Rangers'
career home-run list, Gonzalez is 144 ahead of Dean Palmer, who
ranks second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see him hit number 300, and I wish him well
in getting 300 more,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The home run also gave Gonzalez his 154th run batted in of the
season, tying him for the major-league lead with Sammy Sosa. The
former minor-league teammates are the first players since Boston's
Vern Stephens and Ted Williams, who each had 159 RBI, in 1949 to
drive in more than 153 runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers vice president-public relations John Blake said that the
ball was returned to Gonzalez after the game in exchange for an
autographed bat.
</P>
<P>
   And while the ball was a nice present to leave the ballpark with
last night, Gonzalez easily would have exchanged it for a victory.

HOLYFIELD LOOKS SLUGGISH IN BEATING BEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield looked like a 35-year-old boxer
Saturday night, and a rusty 35-year-old fighter at that.
</P>
<P>
   In what was supposed to be a joyously easy homecoming for
Atlanta's favorite son, some 42,000 fans at the Georgia Dome
watched in near disbelief as Holyfield struggled mightily before
finally defeating the unknown Vaughn Bean in a unanimous 12-round
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have knocked him out in the first round, I would
have,'' said Holyfield, who opened the fight with a flurry. ``But I
couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield did knock Bean down once _ with 45 seconds left in the
10th round _ but even that was controversial. Holyfield had pushed
Bean into the ropes and, as the challenger had one arm draped on
the ropes, referee Brian Garry stepped in to separate the fighters,
while Holyfield uncorked a short and powerful right that sent Bean
to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me when I was down,'' said Bean. Butch Lewis, Bean's
promoter, was so incensed at the move that he jumped onto the ring
apron and screamed at Garry, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the boxing game,'' said Holyfield of the
knockdown. ``You've got to take advantage of any chance you get.
You've always got to take advantage of any chance you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry saw it this way: ``Bean was pushed into the ropes and I
stepped in to separate them, but Evander was already in the process
of delivering his right hand. It was a knockdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry counted to eight and Holyfield, in his neutral corner,
seemed stupified that Bean could get up. ``I wasn't through,'' said
the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the question that should be asked is, `Is Holyfield on
the downward slope after this performance?' If anything, this bout
may have showed how much Mike Tyson has slid, because Holyfield
looked far from the fighter he was in his two easy wins over Tyson.
When he doesn't fight Tyson, Holyfield often struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there was no way Bean could win a decision over
Atlanta's favorite son in Atlanta. So it was no surprise that two
judges scored the bout 117-110 for Holyfield, and the third had it
at 116-111. The Globe scored the fighter closer, giving Holyfield
the decision by 115-112.
</P>
<P>
   Bean kept Holyfield off balance by pushing him away, something
Tyson could never do against Holyfield. ``My corner was shouting at
me, `Why aren't you jabbing?''' said Holyfield. ``But he slipped
some jabs ... he's a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield delivered a solid uppercut that stunned Bean in the
first round and all in the Georgia Dome were confident it was only
a matter of time before Bean was done for the night. But the
challenger held his own, and then took the fifth round, which he
punctuated with a solid overhand right.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it was Holyfield's experience that carried this day
because the champ took the seventh, eighth, and ninth rounds, even
though he did next to nothing in the first two minutes of each
round. But Holyfield knew enough to attack in the final 30 seconds
of each round, and he took all three with late flurries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 12th round, when the Georgia fans were screaming for
a knockout, Holyfield was spent. So much so that Bean took the
round, leaving Holyfield to answer the obvious question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the champ said, ``I wasn't overconfident.''
</P>
<P>
   Just old.

WINNING NOT ENOUGH FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution have discovered a winning touch too
late to salvage their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   They took a 3-0 victory over Tampa Bay Saturday night to become
the first Major League Soccer team to record three successive
shutouts this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution were eliminated from playoff contention by
Miami's win over D.C. United, and must defeat Chicago Wednesday and
the New York/New Jersey Met-roStars Saturday to avoid having the
worst season in their three-year history.
</P>
<P>
   With Walter Zenga in charge, almost anything seems possible.
Since Zenga was named coach late last month, the Revolution have
played seven impressive halves, including 280 consecutive scoreless
minutes, a radical turnaround in a season that included a nine-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two games are games for the future,'' Zenga said.
``They are for the players to show they are not the worst team in
the league. You will read in the newspaper that we are in the fifth
or sixth position in the standings, but this is not right. We are
not the worst team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good team here with professional players. I feel good
about this team, and we will work to make this a big team next
year. The last games are not to finish the 1998 season; I invite
everyone to the New York game because that is our first game of the
1999 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has quickly stamped his mark on this team, organizing the
defense, injecting confidence into the players, and reinvigorating
the offense. The Revolution lost to Miami, 3-2, in his debut Aug.
30 but have outscored the MetroStars, Columbus, and Tampa Bay, 7-0,
in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any doubt over who is the overwhelming symbol of the
Revolution's recent success, it was provided by the vocal greeting
from fans as Zenga arrived for the post-match press conference.
Zenga answered questions, then signed dozens of autographs outside
the Stadium Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the Revolution's three years, they have won only 29
regular-season matches, 14 with Zenga playing goalkeeper last year
and coaching this year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Mutiny provided little resistance,
practicing self-destruction by leaving goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli on
the bench because of a contract problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution tested Ravelli's replacement, Doug Petras, with
some long drives. Edwin Gorter drilled a shot over Petras and off
the crossbar from 40 yards in the 12th minute, and 12 minutes later
Joe-Max Moore sent a 30-yarder that Petras tipped over the bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th minute, New England capitalized on a defensive error
by Jan Eriksson to take the lead, as Raul Diaz Arce headed a Mike
Burns cross to Imad Baba, who scored into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay attack seldom appeared threatening, though the
Revolution seemed prepared to stop Liberian striker Musa Shannon,
who had scored three goals at Foxboro Stadium May 10.
</P>
<P>
   And the Revolution presented an aggressive, confident offense
that expected to be in scoring positions.
</P>
<P>
   The match was played at a frantic pace, and the Revolution
should have controlled the tempo better in the second half. But
they capitalized on their momentum, and after a 35-yard Gorter
drive was easily blocked, he regained possession and set up Moore,
who one-timed a shot off the far post for a 2-0 lead in the 59th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's final goal was also somewhat accidental, as
Petras punched a Paul Keegan cross off defender Chad McCarty's head
for an own goal in the 65th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution deserved most of their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has to continue playing with this mentality,'' Zenga
said. ``I don't know if we can continue playing this way, but I
would hope to and I would like to.''

ANGELS GAIN GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels insist they don't watch the scoreboard to
see how Texas is doing.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, when the Texas Rangers game was on TV late Saturday
afternoon, most of the Angels preferred to watch a tape of Seattle
Mariners pitcher Mac Suzuki, who started Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it couldn't hurt to see the scoreboard and know
that Oakland beat Texas, the Rangers' first loss in five games.
With a chance to gain ground on the AL West-leading Rangers, the
Angels responded with a 5-3 victory over the Mariners before a
sellout crowd of 42,833 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are now one game behind Texas with eight to play,
including three against the Rangers in Anaheim on Monday through
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got clutch performances from all over Saturday, which
is exactly what got them here. Jack McDowell, pitching with a sore
elbow that will probably force him to retire at season's end, went
61/3 innings to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Holtz entered with the game on the line in the
seventh inning. With two on and one out, Holtz was called on to
face Ken Griffey and Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz got Griffey to hit into a force play, then struck out
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters, who had an ERA of 18.00 on the last road trip,
retired the Mariners 1-2-3 in the eighth. And Troy Percival set
down the Mariners in order in the ninth for his 41st save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got a couple timely hits _ missing in Friday
night's loss _ from two unlikely sources. No.7 hitter Matt Walbeck,
hitting .251 entering Saturday's game, and No.8 hitter Troy Glaus,
hitting .220, came up with back-to-back RBI singles in the sixth
inning off Mariners reliever Paul Spoljaric, breaking a 3-3 tie and
giving the Angels a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a first-inning lead on Alex Rodriguez's solo
homer, his 40th of the season. With 40 homers and 43 stolen bases,
Rodriguez became the third player in major-league history to join
the 40-40 club. The others are Jose Canseco (1988) and Barry Bonds
(1996).
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners increased their lead to 3-0 in the third on Ken
Griffey's two-run double. Griffey went to third on the play on
center fielder Jim Edmonds' error, but was thrown out in a rundown
between third and home when Raul Ibanez grounded to first.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got two runs back in the bottom of the third on Randy
Velarde's two-run double, then tied it in the fourth after Tim
Salmon doubled and scored on a single by Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Saturday's victory, the Angels have slumped in
September _ they are 6-10 this month. But Angels manager Terry
Collins will not use Darin Erstad's hamstring injury or any other
injury as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too easy to say I don't have enough bullets,'' Collins
said before the game. ``I have enough. We've got 36 or 37 guys
here. What we've got to do is maximize our chances, and we're not
doing that. I'm well-aware of what we've got going, we've got a lot
of guys hurt. My point being we've still got to do the little
things and we're not doing it. We're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only Angel who has been hitting is Edmonds, who is
hitting .371 (23 for 62) with four homers and 16 RBI this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without him, in the last week we might've been shut out three
times,'' Collins said. ``But I don't think at this time of year one
guy can carry you. Baltimore's too good, Texas is too good,
Seattle's too good for one guy to carry you. You have to spread it
out.''

   LAS VEGAS _ Evander Holyfield is still haunting Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Holyfield's willingness to undergo a battery of
medical examinations at the Mayo Clinic a few years ago to prove
his fitness to fight in Nevada following what was misdiagnosed as
heart problems in his odd loss to Michael Moorer came back to haunt
Tyson Saturday at his relicensing hearing.
</P>
<P>
   After more than six hours of questioning and legal wrangling,
the Nevada State Athletic Commission elected to continue its
deliberations into Tyson's relicensing hearing until an independent
psychological evaluation is done on the former heavyweight
champion.
</P>
<P>
   For the evaluation, the commission will pick three psychiatrists
by Monday and Tyson will choose one of them and be examined no
later than Sept. 28. The hearing will then reopen Oct. 3, at which
time a vote will be taken on whether to lift the revocation of
Tyson's license that went into effect after he twice bit Holyfeld's
ears on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A private polling of the five commissioners indicated that four
would have voted against Tyson's application had a vote been taken
Saturday, with commissioner Luther Mack abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Mack was particularly concerned about an incident three weeks
ago in Maryland in which Tyson is accused of hitting one man in the
face and kicking a second in the groin after a fender-bender
freeway accident in stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A car was struck from behind, lurched forward, and rear-ended
the car of Tyson's wife, after which Tyson is alleged to have
atttacked 50- and 62-year-old men from the other cars. Tyson is
charged with misdemeanor battery and also had a civil proceeding
filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   When Tyson's lead attorney, Dale Kinsella, tried to argue that a
Maryland police officer had issued a statement exonerating his
client of one of the charges, an angry Mack asked if there was not
a second person involved, and Kinsella conceded there was.
</P>
<P>
   Mack then asked where the police report said that person was
upon the arrival of the police. Kinsella sheepishly said, ``I
believe the report said that person was on the ground ... but ...
for ... for this panel to presume he got on the ground because of
anything Mike Tyson did would be unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack went on to ask Kinsella if it was true the police report
also said the person was ``teary eyed,'' ``bruised,'' and alleged
he'd been kicked in the groin by Tyson. Kinsella conceded that was
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, what happened in Maryland three weeks out (from
Saturday's hearing) is the key to this whole thing,'' Mack said.
``It was insulting to my intelligence to leave out that they found
one man with his eyes watering and kicked in the groin. That's why
I wanted to make sure that was on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Maryland is a major condition. When the 3d comes, I'll
ask the same questions. It would have been nice to hear in addition
to the psychological tests they're going to take care of the
Maryland questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack did not get those assurances, just as Tyson was given none
that he would be relicensed if he gets psychological clearance,
although that seemed to be assumed by his squadron of 19 advisers,
friends, and protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella spent much of the time sparring with Mack and
commissioner James Nave, a Las Vegas veterinarian who was openly
skeptical of many of the arguments made by Kinsella and Shelly
Finkel, Tyson's de facto manager.
</P>
<P>
   Nave several times caught Finkel lying about specific issues,
such as whether Finkel had ever been sued by a fighter or had filed
with the commission every contract he'd had with a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Holyfield haunted Tyson, as Finkel at first said he
had, then had to admit that as Holyfield's manager for many years
he never filed any of their contracts with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate stumbling block turned out to be the
psychotherapists who appeared on Tyson's behalf. After Norton
Roitman and Larry Curry claimed Tyson was ``psychologically fit to
fight'' and had undergone treatment for anger management, Nave
asked how much time they had spent with him.
</P>
<P>
   Between them and two other psychiatrists, the total was 19
hours, much of it coming only weeks before the hearing. That was
not nearly enough to satisfy the commission's concerns that Tyson
might repeat the fouls his advisers claim have cost him $50 million
to $68 million in lost purses and fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason I feel like Norman Bates up here with all
these doctors,'' Tyson remarked at one point. ``I've learned I am
sorry. Sooo sorry. Phew.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry or not, Tyson ultimately was forced to wave his
doctor-patient privilege to privacy, despite Kinsella's protests.
The commission demanded it be provided all medical and treatment
records resulting from the psychological study despite the fact
they could become public.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson turned the tide by saying, ``Nothing about my life is
private. What do you want to know?''
</P>
<P>
   He soon waived his privacy, and with that the motion to continue
was passed and Tyson was rushed out of the meeting room at Cashman
Field in silence to await another chance to resume his boxing life.

ERSTAD DUE BACK MONDAY
</HEADLINE>

BY JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Manager Terry Collins all but guaranteed first baseman
Darin Erstad will start Monday's game against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has just three at-bats since he strained his left
hamstring Sept. 2 in Cleveland. Going into Saturday's game, the
Angels were 4-9 since he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real good chance he's going to play Monday,''
Collins said. ``Because I'm running out of time. If I wait too
long, I might not have him anyway. We're running low of
opportunities to get him in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   A-Rod sees 40-40: The Mariners' Alex Rodriguez became the third
player in major-league history to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases
in a season when he homered off Jack McDowell in the first inning
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who hugged Ken Griffey after crossing the plate,
joined Jose Canseco (42 homers, 40 steals in 1988) and Barry Bonds
(42 homers and 40 steals in 1996) in the 40-40 club. Rodriguez has
40 homers and 43 steals.
</P>
<P>
   Reshuffling rotation: Chuck Finley and Steve Sparks will
flip-flop in the rotation, Finley being moved back to start
Tuesday's game against the Rangers on five days rest and
knuckleballer Sparks being moved up to start Monday on three days
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks made only 53 pitches in his last start Thursday at Texas;
Finley made 126 pitches in his start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Steve didn't throw many pitches, and Chuck threw a
lot of pitches,'' Collins said. ``(Sparks) can come back on short
rest, maybe that will help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's starter for the third game of the Texas series is up
in the air, though Collins said Ken Hill is tentatively slated to
get the call.
</P>
<P>
   Hill lasted only 32/3 innings in Friday's loss to Seattle and
still has discomfort in his surgically repaired right elbow.
Collins' candidates to replace Hill if needed are plenty _ Jeff
Juden, Jason Dickson, Allen Watson and Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   But Dickson seems to be the leading candidate should Hill be
unable to go. Dickson retired all 11 batters he faced on Friday in
relief of Hill and has looked good since being called up from
Triple-A Vancouver on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter's back: With Phil Nevin suffering from a sprained left
ankle, the Angels acquired catcher Chad Kreuter from the White Sox
for cash considerations. He joined the club Saturday and will back
up Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad's a guy we know can catch and throw,'' Collins said of
Kreuter, who played for the Angels last season before being
included in a deal for Tony Phillips. ``He did a good job for us
last year and he's having a good year this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Very superstitious: In an effort to change the team's fortunes,
Saturday's starting lineup was posted in the clubhouse upside down.

GUTHRIE RIPPED IN RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark Guthrie has had worse days at 3Com Park.
Last season he allowed a 12th-inning, game-winning home run to
Brian Johnson on Sept. 18. The victory moved the Giants into a
first-place tie with the Dodgers with nine games to play.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday's anniversary of that homer, the Dodgers were
eliminated from the National League wild-card race. Saturday,
Guthrie made his return after missing 20 games with a sprained
ligament in his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The results were disastrous. Guthrie came on to pitch the
seventh inning of the Dodgers' 18-4 loss to the Giants and allowed
four runs.
</P>
<P>
   The big hit was Doug Mirabelli's first major-league home run and
a throwing error by rookie shortstop Alex Cora led to another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shape to pitch, but not to compete,'' said Guthrie,
who has not missed this much playing time since 1993 when, as a
member of the Minnesota Twins, he underwent surgery to remove a
blood clot from his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But as the inning continue to unravel, Guthrie became
frustrated. After Joe Carter, the ninth batter in the inning,
singled to left, Guthrie threw up his hands in disgust. Later, he
refused to rip the decision by manager Glenn Hoffman to leave him
in, but he clearly had been embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was I supposed to do, walk off the mound?'' he said. ``I
probably would never have gotten another batter out ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman knew that Guthrie hadn't pitched in more than three
weeks. That was the reason Hoffman left him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the minor-league season is over and there are
no rehab assignments,'' Hoffman said. ``You have to put the score
out of your mind and make your pitches. That's what we were
watching. We weren't going to leave him out there to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie is in the final week of a multi-year contract that paid
him $1.6 million this season. He is eligible for free agency and is
not expected back. Although he did not mention Guthrie by name, new
GM Kevin Malone said revamping middle and setup relief roles will
be a priority this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits: The day wasn't a washout for everyone. Damon
Hollins, acquired Sept. 9 from Atlanta in a minor-league deal, had
his first major-league hit, a two-run single in the seventh. Jeff
Kubenka, a rookie left-hander, struck out the side in the ninth....
Mark Grudzielanek left the game after six innings. He has been
suffering from tendinitis in both Achilles' tendons since joining
the Dodgers on July 31. Mirabelli, a 27-year old rookie, who hit
his first major-league homer Saturday, played parts of the past two
seasons with the Giants.... The last time the Giants scored this
many runs in a game was June 8, 1990 when they defeated the Atlanta
Braves 23-8.... The stolen base by Barry Bonds with the Giants
leading 7-0 in the third was his 26th. He is four short of reaching
the 30-30 mark for home runs and stolen bases for a record sixth
time.

EDMONDS SAVES PAIN FOR OPPONENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Loosening up physically and mentally before
the Angels' pennant-drive game with the Seattle Mariners Saturday
night, Jim Edmonds pointed up at the inflated ``No. 26'' jersey on
top of the concession stands beyond left field and asked teammate
Pep Harris, ``Think I can throw a ball off that thing?''
</P>
<P>
   They were standing in center field during batting practice,
staring at this weird monument 200 feet away, some sort of tribute
to Angels founder and 26th man Gene Autry. ``You probably can't,''
Harris said. ``No, !ital!you!off! probably can.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a couple of tries, but he did it. ``Hit Gene Autry right
on the arm,'' Harris laughed later.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds isn't bound by the usual constraints, physical and
mental.
</P>
<P>
   He'll bounce off outfield walls, bury himself in the turf in
pursuit of fly balls. He'll throw a ball to the rim of the stadium
on a dare.
</P>
<P>
   And in a September when Angels all around him are slumping,
turning a four-game lead over the Texas Rangers on Aug. 26 into a
two-game deficit Saturday, Edmonds refuses to be dragged down with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, the center fielder rises above this
ballpark-wide funk. One man can't carry a team, but if anybody were
doing it right now it would be him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last week,'' manager Terry Collins was saying in the
dugout, ``without him, we might have been shut out three or four
times.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, the Angels lost to Seattle 5-3, and Edmonds
scored or drove in all three runs, hitting his 24th homer of the
season. The night before that, the Angels lost in Texas 7-6, and
Edmonds drove in half their runs, hitting his 23rd homer.
</P>
<P>
   His weekly averages, starting with the last week of August, go
.391, .368, .381 and .421. The rest of the Angels are batting .216
this week, and the pitching, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   We'll bore you with more numbers only because Edmonds cares
about them so much. He told writers recently exactly how many of
his fly balls at Edison Field would have been home runs but for the
10-feet-higher wall in right field: seven.
</P>
<P>
   He has already set a career high for hits (175) and the big
reason is that he has set a career low for days spent on the
disabled list (0).
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time he has avoided a major injury in a 162-game
major-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one guy we've been lucky with,'' said Collins, who
began the night without Darin Erstad and Dave Hollins, with Tim
Salmon limping and with speculation swirling about the arm of
closer Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies' Larry Walker told Edmonds once, ``If you
want to have a big year, you've gotta stop running into walls and
diving for balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Which had been Edmonds' stock in trade. The only way he could
have topped some of his ESPN moments last season would have been to
actually knock down a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds tried to save himself _ and the walls of the American
League _ a little wear and tear this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a couple of times where I probably could have
caught a ball but I slowed up so I wouldn't hit the wall,'' he
admits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, between his own aggressive instincts and the new concrete
backing on the Edison Field wall, he managed to hurt his ribs, just
not enough to go on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Collins to tick off the list of minor injuries
Edmonds has played through just to get to September: ribs, back,
arm, wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's having the September of his life. And wondering if
he'll get his first shot at October. He won't if other Angels don't
follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like our position (in the AL West race) as well as I
did a week ago,'' Edmonds said. ``But we have to deal with it. And
we're running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do some guys slump in July, as Edmonds did, and others in
September? He doesn't try to figure it out, afraid of jinxing
himself, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He knows one thing that helped him stay strong all the way to
September: hitting the weights a little more, hitting the wall a
little less.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, a player learns what works for him, said
Edmonds, 28.
</P>
<P>
   As we talk in the clubhouse, Edmonds sits and rubs his left
elbow, the one that nailed the inflatable Gene Autry a few minutes
earlier. He's in a little pain, just not enough to keep him out of
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also learning,'' he said, ``not to throw the ball out of
the ballpark.''

MARTINEZ, WILLIAMS BLAST UMPIRE AFTER RED SOX LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Before his interrogation began, Jim Evans, the man who
ejected Red Sox manager Jimy Williams Saturday and whose competence
later was ridiculed by pitcher Pedro Martinez, had a question for
reporters following the Red Sox' 5-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this going to be subpoenaed by Starr?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   There is no room for an independent prosecutor in a playoff
chase, but both Williams and Martinez made their case that there's
no place for an umpire and his crew to have an apparent vendetta
against the Red Sox, either, an accusation a lot less funny than
Evans's one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've done something to that umpire,'' said
Williams, tossed during a heated exchange following the third
inning, after Martinez came off the mound barking at Evans and the
umpire took a couple of steps his way. ``I really don't know. I
don't know if this goes back to the '80s, but we've had our
confrontations all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does the American League president choose to have that
group be with us? I don't know. It would probably be wise and be a
benefit for him and for us if we didn't have that crew the rest of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Evans, a 27-year veteran, has been assigned to work
the American League Championship Series, Martinez responded with
comments that could lead to his wallet being lightened in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge mistake by the league _ huge,'' said Martinez,
who 11 days ago tipped his cap in mocking fashion to plate umpire
Mark Johnson, a member of Evans's crew. ``I don't care how much
experience he has. If he's going to call the games like he called
this game for me, he doesn't deserve to call those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing about it is, nobody seems to be doing anything
about it. There should be a supervisor to check on these guys.
Sometimes it seems like they're in the middle of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost for the second straight time to a White Sox rookie
pitcher in less than 24 hours, the Red Sox aren't going anywhere
fast, either. They had 10 hits Saturday, but left 11 men on base
and didn't score until Darren Lewis's two-run home run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With nine games left, their magic number to clinch the wild-card
spot in the AL playoffs was reduced to four when both Toronto and
Texas lost Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who gave up a three-run home run to light-hitting
(.211) Mike Cameron in the second inning, then issued two straight
walks and a wild pitch that led to two more runs in the third, has
now lost three straight decisions for the first time in three
years. He lost Saturday to rookie John Snyder, who has beaten the
Red Sox twice this season, first as vanquisher of Korean rookie Jin
Ho Cho, now of Martinez, whose hopes for a second straight Cy Young
Award may have evaporated along with his composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cameron hit that home run, that was really a deflating
thing for Pedro,'' said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel, who was a
coach with the Expos for three of Martinez's years in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost a little bit of his edge. He lost his swagger. Then
came those questionable calls, and the frustration set in.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration boiled over after Martinez walked Ray Durham and
Mike Caruso, which brought a visit from Williams, who normally
doesn't venture to the mound unless he's making a pitching change.
On his way back to the dugout, Williams made a detour toward the
plate, but Evans said he was unaware whether the manager had
something to say at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's first pitch after Williams's visit, to Frank Thomas,
was wild, advancing both runners, who scored in succession on
Thomas's infield out and Albert Belle's deep drive to left field,
which stayed in the ballpark only because Troy O'Leary made a
terrific leaping catch at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   When Robin Ventura struck out swinging to end the inning,
Martinez walked toward the first-base dugout, talking to Evans the
entire time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Is that what I have to do to get a
strikeout?''' said Martinez, upset that Evans was ``consistently
missing pitches the whole game. It's OK to miss one pitch or two,
but it's not OK to miss the whole game consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is convinced that Evans was planning to eject him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to throw me out,'' Martinez said. ``No doubt. He
told Hattie (catcher Scott Hatteberg) not to get involved. Why
doesn't he want him to get involved? Do we have something going?
</P>
<P>
   ``He moved his arms like, `Say it, so I can throw you out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was asked why he stepped toward Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked off the mound, he was saying something to me,
and I had no idea what he was saying,'' said the umpire. ``I took a
step or two to ask him what he was saying, and by that point,
(third base coach) Wendell Kim was there. He did a good job
(pulling away Martinez).''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was there, too, but not for long. He was ejected for
the fourth time this season, and it was the second time in 13 days
that he has kicked dirt onto the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like getting thrown out of games,'' he said. ``It's
not smart. It was kind of dumb on my part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's probably better me than the pitcher. I can't play. I
couldn't play when I did play. It's better me than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans dismissed the suggestion that he carries a grudge against
either Williams or Martinez. And while the manager hopes he doesn't
see this crew again this season after Sunday, he had a different
response when he heard that Evans would be at the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, I hope I see him again,'' he said.

   A good number of the parents at the Heights this weekend are
forking over $30,000 per year to pay for young Patrick or Mary
Ellen's college education, but 85 lucky families have sons getting
a free ride; they are the parents of the scholarship football
players, and their ranks include Ethel and Charles Cloud of
Portsmouth, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel didn't make it to the game Saturday, but proud papa
Charles was there to see his youngest son, Mike Cloud, run for a
cumulus 196 yards and three touchdowns. The third score was a true
beauty, as Cloud ran a draw up the gut for 85 yards, breaking
through the line, then touching nothing but cool, crisp air and
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much better than this at BC. The Eagles are 3-0
for the first time in seven years, and though they may not yet have
designs on the Fiesta Bowl, there is a renewal of football spirit
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien said, ``It seems like there's a bonding going
on, the way the students are supporting the team. It hasn't been
here in a while, it certainly wasn't here last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, a fifth-year senior with all the psychological scars of
any BC player who experienced the depths at the Heights in '96,
said, ``I think the last couple of years the football players shied
away from students. But now we see them on campus and in the dining
hall and it feels great to hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the students abandoned the team, BC players still had their
parents' backing. Charles Cloud sits in Section T and never misses
a game. An Army sergeant who served 18 months in Vietnam, Cloud
retired from the service 13 years ago and today works in the
commissary at the NETC Newport Naval Base. Mike is the third of
three Cloud sons, and the family does not take Mike's scholarship
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big savings for us,'' said the tailback's dad.
``It was something that we never thought would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been huge for my family,'' added Mike. ``We didn't have
the money to send me to a school like this. I know all the players
here appreciate getting a great education and the opportunity to
play Division 1 football.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a Division 1 program is staggering. Take 85
scholarships at $30,000 per year for four years and you've got a
tab of more than $10 million before staff, equipment, food, and
travel costs. But when 40,000 fans pour through the gates and go
home happy, there is great return on the investment.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be many days better than Saturday. Boston enjoyed
perfect San Diego weather, and the Eagles toyed with the visitors
from Philadelphia. Nobody had it better than Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old tailback has run for 552 yards and seven
touchdowns in three games. He's averaging 184 yards and 29 carries
per game. Before the season, he announced that he planned to go for
2,000 yards, and now the comment doesn't sound preposterous. In the
words of his coach, ``He's a heck of a back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing to be a parent and watch your son please
everyone,'' said the dad. ``The first three years he played, it was
exciting but not overwhelming. This year, I couldn't wait. I knew
good things were going to happen for him. And today I saw him bust
through that line and get the one he'd been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cloud's chest was practically busting through his BC
shirt as he talked about his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him we're waiting outside, please,'' said the dad. ``His
dad and his brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Mike Cloud was talking with reporters and BC athletic
director Gene DeFilippo was leaving for home so he could listen to
the James Madison-Villanova game on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo's son, John, is quarterback at James Madison. For 50
cents a minute, the BC AD can enlist a service that provides
play-by-play. It's pricey, but who could resist? Especially on
parents weekend.

BC LEAVES TEMPLE WITH RUN-DOWN FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two minutes remained in Boston College's 31-7 victory
over Temple Saturday when the sum total of Mike Cloud's day _ 27
carries, 196 yards, three touchdowns _ flashed across the jumbo
screens at both ends of Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At the sight of those numbers, the members of BC's starting
offensive line rose from the bench to exhort the coaches to put
Cloud back into the game. They wanted to see their teammate break
the 200-yard mark for the second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to rush for 2,000 yards,'' Cloud said afterward,
referring to the objective he set at the beginning of the year.
``The offensive line knows that, and they're rooting for me. When
they looked up at the scoreboard and saw that I had 196 yards, they
were kind of teed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The line wanted more for Cloud _ 4 more yards, to be exact. But
was Cloud capable of supplying the demand? Well, not exactly. Cloud
acknowledged afterward that he had emptied his tank on a dazzling
85-yard sprint on a draw play that made it 31-7 with 7:06 to go. It
was the longest TD run of Cloud's career and the third-longest in
BC history.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, who has carried 88 times for 552 yards and scored seven
touchdowns, is off to the best three-game start in Big East
history, surpassing the 442 yards (on 77 carries) that West
Virginia's Amos Zereoue had last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were encouraging me,'' Cloud said, ``but the coaches
wanted to give the other guys a chance to play, which was a great
call by the coaches. Like I said, right after that (85-yard) play I
was kind of done for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, were the Owls.
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, BC spotted its opponent a 7-0
lead. Temple (0-3 overall, 0-1 Big East) capitalized on Jermaine
Walker's fumble on the opening kick, scoring two plays after taking
over on the 19. After a 16-yard gain on an option, the Owls took
the lead on Stacey Mack's 3-yard burst.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, however, bounced back behind a withering offensive
attack that amassed 443 yards, 206 rushing and 237 passing. BC's
defense, meanwhile, succeeded in holding Temple, which boasted the
nation's No. 4 rushing attack (298.5 yards), to 297 yards of total
offense, just 151 rushing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, BC improved to 3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big East.
BC will travel to Louisville next weekend for a nonconference
matchup against the Cardinals, 35-9 winners over Illinois Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 3-0, that's the good news,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien.
``As I said coming in, I thought that this would be a great
challenge for this football team. You look at the athletes of
Temple and the size of some of those guys _ this was the most
athletic team that we've played yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm glad that we played them at this point of the season.
I'd hate to play them later in the year if they ever get this thing
going. That's a tough offense to defend. Our defense did a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Once BC's defense ``caught up to the speed of this game,''
O'Brien said, the Eagles put the clamps on slippery Owls
quarterback Kevin Harvey, holding him to 12 carries for 58 yards
and 3-of-8 passing for 25 yards before knocking him out of the game
in the third quarter with an injured left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who entered the game as the No. 2 rusher in the Big East
(108 yards per game), was held to 27 yards on eight carries.
</P>
<P>
   On its last three possessions of the first half, the Owls ran 32
plays and gained 125 yards, but came away empty-handed. They missed
a field goal, threw an interception, and had time expire.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to punt after driving to the Temple 23 on their first
possession, the Eagles rebounded to score on their next four
red-zone opportunities. Cloud tied it, 7-7, when he capped a
10-play, 80-yard drive with a 2-yard run with 52 seconds left in
the first quarter. Then quarterback Scott Mutryn, who completed 17
of 22 for 237 yards, capped a blitzkrieg three-play, 72-yard drive
by hitting Anthony DiCosmo with a 10-yard strike that gave BC a
14-7 lead with 10:50 to go before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud extended BC's lead to 21-7 with a 1-yard plunge in the
third, before John Matich made it 24-7 with a 35-yard field goal.
Cloud then capped his day with the 85-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Mike Cloud _ and I've been around a lot of
great backs: Mike Cloud is a determined runner,'' said Temple's
first-year coach, Bobby Wallace. ``He's got speed and strength. He
is a hard runner, meaning he is going to break a lot of tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace wasn't the first coach this season to lavish Cloud with
such praise. And, after Cloud's effort Saturday, he likely won't be
the last.

UCLA'S MITCHELL OUT FOR YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Freddie Mitchell knew the gruesome truth quicker than
anyone else. And why not? It was his thigh that collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I BROKE MY LEG,'' Mitchell yelled after landing awkwardly on
his left leg at the end of a 47-yard kickoff return in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, Mitchell was carted off Robertson Field
and whisked to Methodist Hospital, where he underwent successful
surgery Saturday evening. Doctors placed a stabilization rod
alongside Mitchell's fractured femur (thigh).
</P>
<P>
   He will miss the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation went very well,'' said Dr. Gerald Finerman,
UCLA's team physician. ``It was a pretty clean break.''
</P>
<P>
   A redshirt freshman receiver, Mitchell will remain in Houston
for several days. Finerman was with him Saturday night; his
parents, Freddie and Joyce, are flying in from Lakeland, Fla., for
the rest of Mitchell's stay.
</P>
<P>
   Finerman expects the recovery to take 4-5 months. But when asked
if Mitchell will be ready for spring practice, he declined to give
an exact return date.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good chance he'll recover and be as good as he
was,'' Finerman said after UCLA's 42-24 victory over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was eerily reminiscent of former linebacker Anselmo
Zamano's injury two years ago at Michigan. While Mitchell's doesn't
appear as severe _ Zamano almost lost his leg and might never play
again _ it will have a greater impact on UCLA's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was UCLA's best big-play threat and its top punt and
kickoff returner. In his college debut last week against Texas, he
gained 233 total yards and threw a 34-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have receivers who can pick up the slack, but I don't know
if they have Freddie's big-play dimension,'' offensive coordinator
Al Borges said. ``Freddie gave us more confidence that we could
strike any minute, and that's a nice feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's injury leaves UCLA with only three proven receivers:
Danny Farmer, Brad Melsby and Brian Poli-Dixon. That means Jon
Dubravac, a true freshman, and Saugus' Cody Joyce, a redshirt
freshman, must increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Borges and Toledo will decide this week if strategic or
personnel changes are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might do things a little different,'' Borges said. ``We'll
have to be more cognizant of getting the ball to players who can
score touchdowns.''

UCLA'S SUPPORTING CAST EARNS RAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A few minutes before kickoff, UCLA freshman linebacker
Santi Hall visualized the first start of his career. He saw
alignments, he saw assignments, he saw tackles and blitzes and even
a sack.
</P>
<P>
   But an interception?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through all the plays, but it never crossed my mind
that I'd get a pick,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his third-quarter interception, which set up UCLA's fourth
touchdown, was one of several big plays from supporting players in
the Bruins' 42-24 victory Saturday at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   With only two senior starters on defense _ and four listed on
the two-deep chart _ UCLA's season may hinge on continuing
contributions from unlikely sources. Effective as they are, as many
plays as they make, seniors Larry Atkins and Brendan Ayanbadejo
can't do it all every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rely on those (younger) guys,'' Bruins coach Bob
Toledo said. ``They've got to continue to get better. They'll grow
and mature each week. But we've got to continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan Roques, who climbed the depth chart when Damian
Allen quit last week, typified the inconsistency that comes with
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, he allowed a 34-yard touchdown.
Early in the third, he returned an interception 17 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gratifying for me to make the play,'' said Roques, a
junior who converted from tailback last season. ``I'm just glad I
was able to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who started for the injured Michael Wiley, had three
tackles and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   End Travor Turner, a pass-rush specialist, had three
tackles-for-loss and deflected the pass that eventually landed in
Hall's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Inside linebacker Ryan Nece, who switched from safety in the
spring, had four tackles and a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom-used outside linebacker Billy Pieper _ No. 43, in case
you couldn't put a name with the number _ had a sack.
</P>
<P>
   End Steve Sua, linebacker Ali Abdul-Azziz, nose guard Micah
Webb, linebacker Cheyane Caldwell, safety Jason Stephens _ the list
of unexpected playmakers went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Even senior Tod McBride, a third-string safety, chipped in. His
blocked punt in the second quarter helped turn the game after
Houston had dashed to a surprising 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough out there,'' McBride said. ``Houston came to
play. They weren't going to hand it to us. But emotionally, we got
it together and made some big plays. Without them, the game would
have been a lot closer.''

DE LA HOYA IS ONE FIGHTER WHO CAN TAKE HIS LUMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Golden Boy showed the president how to handle a
crisis of confidence last week.
</P>
<P>
   Like President Clinton, Oscar De La Hoya was recently outed for
a sexual escapade that hardly fit his squeaky-clean image. Above a
story on De La Hoya in the Aug. 28 Los Angeles Times, a headline
read ``He's No Angel.'' The article outlined an incident last
spring in Cabo San Lucas, a Mexican resort town, in which De La
Hoya was publicly drunk and found dancing on tables with nearly
naked women. He was spotted by the son of the story's author,
boxing writer Steve Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The story went on to report on De La Hoya's previously
well-documented gambling and the existence of a 6-month-old son
born out of wedlock to a woman he does not date.
</P>
<P>
   That none of this seemed to fit the image that promoter Bob Arum
has been creating for the 1992 Olympic gold medalist was a
potential headache both for De La Hoya and the many businesses that
have rushed to hire him as a spokesman. But De La Hoya made all the
right moves in response to the article, acknowledging its accuracy
and thanking the Times for giving him a ``reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened my eyes,'' De La Hoya said during a lengthy
interview in his suite with sportswriters last week. ``It's really
been a reality check. It made me think. If I want to become the
best fighter out there and make history and keep being a role model
for kids and stay positive, then I have to cut this out and focus
on boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the article when I first read it, but after I
read it a few times it helped me. I think it was positive. I was
kind of glad it came out, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of carrying his sport at a time when so many
denigrate it has mounted on De La Hoya as his celebrity has grown
to vast proportions. He is not just a fighter anymore but a
cultural phenomenon who has been embraced by an expanding
Hispanic-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with a clear example of bad judgment, De La Hoya made
no attempt to split hairs, use either of the two languages he
speaks to create a semantic escape route, or deny the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he conceded that he likes to gamble a bit too much and
so he went along with Arum's decision to ask Las Vegas casinos to
keep him at a $25,000 limit after he made and then lost more than
$300,000 one evening playing baccarat. He conceded that he likes
the young women who seem to follow him everywhere and at times has
treated them with something less than chivalry. Most of all, he
conceded that his behavior had to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human,'' he said. ``I'm a 25-year-old guy. Who at 25 could
handle all this? I'm not just a fighter, I'm an enterprise that
supports a lot of people. It's impossible to handle all this
pressure and not blow up sometimes, but it showed me I need to stay
focused on my boxing because I was doing something wrong. If you're
doing something wrong, stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, no, I can't just be a regular 25-year-old guy.
That's obvious. But I don't want to be. My job is to fight, stay
focused, and be a role model. I feel I draw a different fan to
boxing, a female fan, which is why my (pay-per-view) numbers are
climbing the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Times article, that climb continued when his fight
with Chavez became the first to sell out the 14,000-seat Thomas and
Mack Center and threatened to break De La Hoya's non-heavyweight
record for pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   He is arguably the most popular fighter in the world today, and
he knows it. When he fought in El Paso this year, for example, a
young Hispanic woman was overheard at a pay phone telling a friend
how thrilled she was to have been standing under De La Hoya's hotel
window to catch a T-shirt that he signed and threw to her.
</P>
<P>
   That is rock-star idolatry, and it is in evidence whenever he
appears in public. His fan club, which is operated through his
personal website at OscarDeLaHoya.com, has hundreds of thousands of
members and has grown so large that he had to hire a company to
handle the volume of requests. Everywhere he goes he is surrounded
by an army of security guards with small wires in their ears and no
smiles on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   His is a life of celebrity gone wild and with it, he knows,
comes intense scrutiny. You cannot have the one without the other,
so he sees no unfairness in it, only an obligation to live up to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 32 years I've been promoting, Oscar De La Hoya is the
most disciplined athlete that I've been associated with and the
nicest young man to be around,'' Arum said during a recent phone
conversation. ``He's a young man and he has to be able to conduct
himself like a young man but he knows, in the words of his sponsor
(Budweiser), when to say when.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stops and goes back to being the disciplined athlete that
he is. Oscar's not some cardboard figure who marches like a robot.
That's why this was a terrific article.''
</P>
<P>
   On some levels it humanized De La Hoya, who had been criticized
by some in the Mexican-American community for seeming ``too white''
because of his obsession with golf and the suburban life. Now found
to have boxing shoes at least partially made of clay, his
popularity has grown, not lessened, because of his handling of his
life in and out of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what Oscar's ceiling is,'' Arum said. ``He's the
most popular guy in the sport. He just keeps expanding his base.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya did that again last week not by denying the
undeniable but by embracing it. People in high places could learn
something about crisis management from that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It pays to be on a jury that acquits  &UR; Don King &LR; . This weekend in
Atlanta, King hosted members of the jury that in July found him not
guilty of insurance fraud in a New York federal court. King took
the jurors to the  &UR; Evander Holyfield-Vaughn Bean  &LR; fight, after
first flying them to the Bahamas last weekend for a vacation. ``We
had a great barbecue,'' King boasted. ``It was in a beautiful
flower garden. Then we had dinner. I'm doing this as a gesture of
those who lived the process. You've got to show the people
appreciation for the process. I enjoyed doing it like the Second
Coming. I told my bookkeepers, `Don't even tell me the cost.''' The
guests also included the jurors' families and the staff of the two
law firms that defended King. King's largesse is not without
precedent. He did the same thing when he was found not guilty of
tax evasion several years ago, taking that jury to London for the
 &UR; Frank Bruno &LR; - &UR; Tim Witherspoon  &LR; fight ... What had been rumored for
weeks finally came true last week when heavyweight prospect  &UR; Hasim
Rahman  &LR; pulled out of Saturday's fight with  &UR; David Tua  &LR; on the
undercard of  &UR; Lennox Lewis's  &LR; defense of the World Boxing Council
heavyweight title. Efforts to replace Rahman with  &UR; Razor Ruddock
 &LR; and former cruiserweight champion  &UR; Orlin Norris  &LR; failed, as both
claimed they were not prepared. Word is that Tua's handlers, the
Duvas, turned down a chance to avenge Tua's only loss by fighting a
rematch with comebacking  &UR; Ike Ibeabuchi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; although they claim it
was Ibeabuchi's demand for a $500,000 payday that killed the fight.
Rahman signed a deal with King in May despite still being under
contract to South African promoter  &UR; Cedric Kushner  &LR; until Oct. 31.
Kushner now claims Rahman also signed an extension with him and
took a $200,000 signing bonus after he'd surreptitiously signed
with King, then pulled out of the Tua fight after King told him
that if Tua was still standing at the end of the fight he'd get the
decision. Kushner plans to sue Rahman for breach of contract, and
Tua may be out of a date. Meanwhile, HBO has downgraded the show to
a one-fight extravaganza, Lewis- &UR; Zeljko Mavrovic &LR; , &UR;  &LR; although Tua
will still appear on the card at the Mohegan Sun Casino ...  &UR; Erik
Morales  &LR; looked sharp and  &UR; Junior Jones  &LR; looked shot last weekend
in Tijuana when Morales TKO'd the two-time world champion in four
rounds to retain the WBC junior featherweight title. Word is Jones
may retire to train fighters or possibly move to the radio booth,
working HBO shows in a job once held by trainer  &UR; Teddy Atlas &LR; . That
opening came about because Atlas has been selected as the ringside
commentator for ESPN2's new weekly boxing series. Atlas replaces
 &UR; Al Bernstein &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was dumped by ESPN after 18 solid years ...
 &UR; Gerry Penalosa's  &LR; loss of the WBC superflyweight title on a split
decision in Seoul to  &UR; Joo Cho  &LR; Aug. 29 becomes odder the more we
hear about it. Word now is that judge  &UR; Dalby Shirley  &LR; claimed after
the fight that he had voted for Penalosa mistakenly thinking he was
Cho and wanted his score reversed. How can you be a world-class
judge and not know the Filipino fighter from the Korean? The WBC
refused the request but has already ordered Cho to defend his title
vs. No. 1 contender  &UR; Joel Luna Zarate &LR; , &UR;  &LR; with the winner giving
Penalosa a rematch ... Holyfield grossed more than $6 million
Saturday night for an inconsequential title defense vs. Bean fought
in the champion's hometown. More than 20,000 tickets were sold for
the bout at the Georgia Dome. Meanwhile, De La Hoya became the
first fighter to sell out the Thomas and Mack Center at UNLV for
his rematch with Chavez. Those sales are good signs that boxing is
not as dead as its critics would like you to believe.

   Former world champion  &UR; Pernell Whitaker  &LR; quietly had his
suspension for failing two drug tests lifted last week. He has been
training lightly in his native Norfolk, Va., and told his promoter,
 &UR; Dino Duva &LR; , that he does not want a tuneup fight before a proposed
December bout with International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR;  ... In an unusual bit of advertising,
King was promoting  &UR; Christy Martin's  &LR; fight Saturday night as the
women's pound-for-pound championship. Her opponent? TBA! To Be
Announced is a busy opponent these days but unlikely to be ready
for a pound-for-pound title ... The IBF may have created headaches
for itself by bowing to pressure from King to let  &UR; Robert Allen
 &LR; fight  &UR; Abdula Ramadan  &LR; Saturday night for the interim
mid-dleweight title held by injured  &UR; Bernard Hopkins &LR; . On the
surface it might seem fair enough since Allen's fight with Hopkins
ended in a no-contest when Hopkins slipped and fell out of the
ring, injuring his ankle. But rather than wait for Hopkins to heal
for a rematch, the IBF rushed Allen into an interim title fight.
These things always lead to problems.

USC EYES MCGWIRE VISIT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's a little busy at the moment, but USC
officials are trying to convince St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark
McGwire to appear at the Notre Dame game this November at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   USC would like McGwire to participate in the pregame coin toss.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also would be honored for breaking Roger Maris'
single-season home run record. There is still no word on whether
McGwire will accept the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The USC baseball team, which won the NCAA championship in June,
will also be honored during a game later this season.
</P>
<P>
   Making history: USC coach Paul Hackett became just the third
Trojans coach since 1915 to win his first three games. Hackett
joins Jess Hill, who went 7-0 in 1951, and Howard Jones, who was
4-0 en route to an 11-2 season in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Line firms up: The USC offensive line, which had shuffled
several players in and out of most positions the first two games,
had considerably less substitutions against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   The core group consisted of Brent McCaffrey, David Pratchard,
Jason Grain, Travis Claridge and Matt Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Time for Iacenda: USC fullback Ted Iacenda got to do more than
block for a change in the first half. Iacenda had a 6-yard run and
caught a 16-yard pass. He also started his second straight game.
First-game starter Brennan Ochs played behind Iacenda and No.2
fullback Marvin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Fox debuts: With starter Antoine Harris nursing a sore ankle,
former quarterback John Fox made his first appearance of the season
at tight end. Fox was inserted during a double-tight end formation.
</P>
<P>
   Early visitor: Among those on the Coliseum field before the game
was Alemany High quarterback Casey Clausen. It's a little too soon
to ponder Clausen's future, however, since he is only a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Run of the night: The longest play of the game occurred in the
second quarter, when a dog appeared in the north end zone and
sprinted the length of the field before departing through a fence
behind the south end zone. Play was briefly stopped during the run.
</P>
<P>
   California touch: Oregon State has 49 players from California.
USC has no players from Oregon. &QL;

USC STRUGGLES PAST OREGON STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every time USC schedules a night game, there's the
complaint that East Coast viewers (and poll voters) never get a
chance to watch the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it turns out to be a blessing. Like Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans struggled mightily with usual patsy Oregon State at
the Coliseum, before defeating the Beavers 40-20 before 45,629.
</P>
<P>
   After defeating Oregon State 24 straight times since 1967, the
Trojans were in real danger of ending their Pacific-10 Conference
record streak for consecutive victories over an opponent. Worse,
the Beavers had not actually defeated USC at the Coliseum since
1960.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the end result, it was clear that this was no normal
Oregon State team that former USC assistant Mike Riley brought to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   That especially became apparent when ex-quarterback Tim
Alexander returned the second-half opening kickoff 100 yards to tie
the game, 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most USC-Oregon State encounters, this one had a
competitive feel the entire way.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had to take advantage of a fumble by Oregon State's
Ken Simonton on a punt return just to forge ahead 20-17 with 11:03
remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Adam Abrams added another field goal, this one from 33
yards, at the start of the fourth quarter to give USC a 23-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Other than tailback Chad Morton, who rushed for more than 100
yards for the second time in his career against Oregon State, USC's
offense was inconsistent. The special teams were forced to provide
a lift for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a 7-7 tie early in the second quarter, walk-on Danny
Bravo broke through the line and blocked Mike Fessler's punt. The
ball rolled into the end zone and was recovered by Rashard Cook to
give the Trojans a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game the Trojans blocked a punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' special teams also rebounded in the kicking game,
as Adam Abrams converted a 33-yard field goal in the second quarter
to stretch USC's lead to 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who was 2 for 2, had gone 0 for 3 on field goals last
week after making 12 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State answered by driving 63 yards before stalling at the
USC 11-yard line. Jose Cortez kicked a 28-yard field goal with 47
seconds left in the half to cut the lead to 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-0) appeared to have ended that drive when Cook
intercepted a pass in the end zone, but the Trojans were penalized
for roughing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, USC head coach Paul Hackett inserted freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer with just under seven minutes left in the
first half, but Palmer got little protection in his opening series
and failed to complete a pass.
</P>
<P>
   There was no electrifying start for USC wide receiver R. Jay
Soward, either, after he thrilled fans last week in his 256-yard
debut against San Diego State. Soward fumbled a punt return in the
first quarter and Oregon State's Darnell Robinson recovered at the
Trojans' 27-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Nine plays later, Oregon State quarterback Terrance Bryant found
James Battle in the end zone on a 5-yard touchdown pass to tie the
game, 7-7. Cook actually tipped the ball in the end zone before
Battle caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Soward's turnover, the Trojans had been off to a
flawless start.
</P>
<P>
   USC needed less than two minutes to start the scoring. After
Hackett said the Trojans needed to throw deep more often, they did,
as Mike Van Raaphorst hit Larry Parker on a 47-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   It was Parker's first career touchdown in four seasons, and gave
USC a 7-0 lead just 1:42 into the game.

DOLPHINS OFF TO RUNNING START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The Super Bowl will be played in Miami's Pro Player
Stadium on Jan. 31. The Dolphins would love to be there. Home-field
advantage for a Super Bowl? Sounds like enough motivation for Jimmy
Johnson. And Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday's third game of the season, against
Pittsburgh, the Dolphins (2-0) are certainly on the right track,
though in three of the last four years the Dolphins started 3-0 and
it meant little. Yet this year there's a new-found hope that
Johnson is close to establishing the running game that he wants. He
won two championships in Dallas because he had the best offensive
linemen in the world, and at that time, Emmitt Smith was the best
running back on Earth. The ground attack took the heat off
quarterback Troy Aikman, who became exceptionally accurate as a
passer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also had a defense that could shut down the opposition
and leave the offense in good field position.
</P>
<P>
   But in four years in Miami, he's had none of this. Miami fans
expected miracles when Johnson took over from the legendary Don
Shula, but they are still waiting for a team that could even be
thought of as a Super Bowl contender. The coach has taken more than
a few hits for this.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's start has begun to change some of that. In their
first two games, the Dolphins were a running team. Marino, who
traditionally has had to put the ball in the air most of the time,
suddenly finds himself in an offense that really is thinking about
running first and throwing second.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, how long will this last? After all, the wins came
against the Indianapolis Colts and Buffalo Bills, not exactly the
brawn of the AFC. The offense also sputtered at times. But there
are good trends, and if they continue Sunday against the Steelers,
it will be time to consider whether Johnson has finally pulled it
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it would be at least one month into the season
before we were in sync,'' said Johnson in his weekly
teleconference. ``I don't know that our running game is going to
scare anybody. Hopefully there'll be a day here that people are
concerned about it. I am happy we've run the ball better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Buffalo, the Dolphins were able to keep the
ball for seven minutes late in the game to salt away a 13-7 win.
They had only 12 yards rushing at the half but managed to finish
with 116 as Karim Abdul-Jabbar found a good rhythm with an
offensive line that has become far more conscious of run-blocking.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dolphins keep this up, it could lengthen Ma-rino's
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' said Marino, 38, during his teleconference. ``I
look at it this way: I'll take it one year at a time. Maybe if we
run more I won't take as many hits. It comes down to the health
factor. I think if any quarterback my age had a major injury it
would be tough to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the advent of Terrell Davis and a run-oriented
offensive line has helped rejuvenate John Elway in Denver. It's not
that Marino doesn't like to drop and fire; he's done that better
than any quarterback in history, and he says that aspect of his
game is still alive and well _ if the Dolphins need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still capable if we want to throw it more,'' said Marino,
who has two touchdown passes and no interceptions this season.
``It's what Jimmy is trying to get accomplished _ to be more of a
physical team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as throwing the football, I feel fine. My legs give me
problems during the week but that's because of the operations I've
had in the past few years. As for my ability, I feel I can still
play at a high level in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with passing is that Marino is running out of
receivers. The team's No. 1 pick two years ago, Yatil Green, was
supposed to emerge as a big-play guy, but he is out with injuries
for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, a Dolphin coach criticized Marino for not being
able to get the ball to his receivers and said he might be looking
for veteran O.J. McDuffie a little too often.
</P>
<P>
   If Marino can deal with that kind of occasional motivational jab
and the running game continues to develop, he could play to 40 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' said Marino. ``I'm looking at this
week right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would definitely not be the next Steve DeBerg, who is
playing at 44, but he seemed confident that the Dolphins are a team
that is going to the playoffs ``and we're going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino said boldly, ``I'm going to be one of the reasons for
that. There's no reason for me to give up because I'm not playing
at the level I did 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he's standing when many younger quarterbacks in
the league have already gone down with injuries is significant. He
seems to be part of a trend around the league that sees older
quarterbacks getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys who can still play and have been successful for
a long time,'' he said. ``It comes down to ability and the types of
schemes they're in and the people around them.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the people around Marino are doing a good job
protecting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're playing now, we're running the ball better and
protecting Dan very well,'' said Johnson. ``Dan is still an
outstanding quarterback in this league, and if we can do the things
to protect an outstanding quarterback, we'll be on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also likes the fact that his defense is much more
aggressive and that he keeps finding big-time players such as
defensive end Jason Taylor, who has ``great quickness,
intelligence, and a knack for the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of these good feelings could end Sunday. The
Steelers have blitzed Marino to death in the past. If they can stop
the run, they'll begin their assault on the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the Dolphins have their eye on staying home in
January.
</P>
<P>

   The $17 million and change the Patriots will receive as their
share of the Cleveland Browns expansion fee will go toward signing
bonuses for some of the players whose contracts are about up. The
Patriots are trying to finish off  &UR; Troy Brown's  &LR; four-year deal,
and then they'll look to  &UR; Dave Wohlabaugh &LR; , &UR; Ty Law &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Lawyer
Milloy &LR; . &UR;  &LR; Law is expected to command big money, given his rising
stature and the shortage of All-Pro caliber cornerbacks in the
league ... If you're a sports fan and your vote for governor was
based on which stadium plan the candidates backed (the House/ &UR; Tom
Finneran  &LR; plan or the Sen-ate/ &UR; Thomas Birmingham &LR; / &UR; Robert Kraft
 &LR; plan), you'd have a problem because neither  &UR; Paul Cellucci  &LR; nor
 &UR; Scott Harshbarger  &LR; will speak specifically on the issue. All that
their spokespeople would say was that each candidate wants to keep
the Patriots in Massachusetts. The difference between the two
plans, basically, is that in the Senate version, the state would
purchase the land from Kraft, then lease it back to him. Last
September, Cellucci filed legislation to provide $50 million in
infrastructure on a renovated Foxboro Stadium that would include
the purchase of 316 acres of land around the stadium. That
indicates that he isn't opposed to the Senate version, though the
plan has gone from a renovation to a new stadium since then ... In
major league baseball, coaches and managers share licensing money
with players and receive medical and retirement benefits. In
football, coaches have been on their own. But former Patriots
offensive coordinator  &UR; Larry Kennan  &LR; is now executive director of
the NFL Coaches Association and has made strides toward taking care
of retired coaches. ``There have been some legendary coaches who
have incurred so many medical bills they're practically broke,''
said Kennan, who last week struck a deal with the NFL Players
Association for the use of office space and support systems.
``We've been able to increase health care for coaches, who can now
get with a plan in which they pay some with their former team.''
Things still aren't perfect, though. Kennan says coaches can't
receive their pensions until age 65, but few work until that age;
only 7 percent of the coaches in the league are over the age of 55,
and most of them are with  &UR; Dick Vermeil  &LR; in St. Louis. Kennan said
there were nine coaches who were forced to retire last season
because none of them (eight of them were over 54) were rehired.
Kennan, who is being paid by the Patriots this year after he was
replaced as the offensive coordinator and refused to take a paycut
for a lesser position, expects he won't be one of the statistics.
``I think I have a good enough reputation where I'll be able to
hook on next year. Either that or I'd be very interested in a head
coaching position for a major college team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Northeastern quarterback  &UR; Jim Murphy &LR; , who spent training
camp and preseason with the Patriots, is calling offensive plays
for Bentley coach  &UR; Pete Yetten  &LR; (who pounded this reporter into
shape during his days at Whitman-Hanson High), as former Waltham
High and Northeastern legend  &UR; Bob Connors &LR; , Yetten's offensive
coordinator, has taken ill. Murphy is still attempting to hook on
with an NFL team and hopes to play in NFL Europe. In the meantime,
in exchange for a little coaching, he gets to work out and use the
facilities at Bentley to stay in shape. Murphy made a lot of
friends during his time with the Patriots; offensive coordinator
 &UR; Ernie Zampese  &LR; and quarterbacks coach  &UR; Jack Reilly  &LR; called to tell
him he was let go only because the Patriots needed spots for other
positions ...  &UR; Jimmy Hitchcock  &LR; will tell you that leaving the
Patriots can be painful. Hitchcock, a starting right cornerback for
Minnesota, had a tough first game but picked off a key pass the
next week in a victory over the Rams. That was after he'd severed
part of his little finger in an accident earlier in the game.
Hitchcock underwent surgery to save the finger. An update on other
ex-Patriots:  &UR; Sam Gash  &LR; hasn't played much for the 0-2 Bills
because they've gone to so many three-receiver sets; Jets
cornerback  &UR; Otis Smith  &LR; has often been seen chasing receivers after
getting beat; Jets special teams captain  &UR; Corwin Brown  &LR; is still
fairly productive;  &UR; Keith Byars  &LR; looks like an aging fullback and
 &UR; Curtis Martin  &LR; has had two stinkers for the Jets;  &UR; Brian Stablein
 &LR; is in a backup role in Detroit; and  &UR; Dave Meggett  &LR; is a student at
Towson State again ... Kennan said Martin seems to be lacking a
little explosion on his first step, but he was unsure whether that
is a result of the abdominal injury.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the Jets are having quarterback problems,  &UR; Neil O'Donnell
 &LR; leads the NFL in completion percentage (72.1) for the 2-0 Bengals
... Why do players say stuff like this? `` &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; is going
to line up and play smash-mouth football. That's been him over the
years.'' Those were the words of Colts linebacker  &UR; Jeff
Herrod &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and they would have been true about 10 years ago.
Parcells's Patriots threw the ball more than any team in history.
Jets QB  &UR; Glenn Foley  &LR; leads the AFC in passing yardage, and the
Jets are 29th in rushing. Parcells was a smash-mouth guy with the
Giants. He has been Air Parcells ever since ... Some teams have bad
luck at certain positions. The Jaguars' albatross is defensive
linemen. When  &UR; Jabbar Threats  &LR; went down this past week with a knee
injury, it left the Jaguars with seven healthy linemen. ``I don't
know why this team is so snake-bit on the defensive line,'' said
tackle  &UR; John Jurkovic &LR; . The Jaguars already have lost  &UR; Don Davey
 &LR; (knee),  &UR; Jeff Lageman  &LR; (biceps),  &UR; Tony Brackens  &LR; (high ankle
sprain), and  &UR; Seth Payne  &LR; (dislocated shoulder) ... Remember,
 &UR; Charlie Batch &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the rookie quarterback starting  &UR; today &LR;  for
Detroit, was a player draft guru  &UR; Mel Kiper Jr. &LR;  said was taken too
high (second round) by the Lions out of Eastern Michigan ... From
the growing Just Doesn't Get It File: Bills All-Pro guard  &UR; Ruben
Brown  &LR; lashed out against the Buffalo-area media last week in an
embarrassing tirade: ``There are a certain few media people out
there who won't get the opportunity to talk to myself and the rest
of the guys. We know who you are. We know who you scumbags are who
are trashing us and treating us like garbage.'' ... Among the
venues where the Patriots and Oilers have played through the years:
Nickerson Field, Jeppesen Stadium (Houston), Fenway Park, Rice
Stadium, Boston College's Alumni Stadium, the Astrodome, and
Schaefer/Sullivan/Foxboro Stadium.

CAN YOU SAY CY? GLAVINE WINS HIS 20TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Say what you will about Greg Maddux and his four
straight National League Cy Young Awards from 1992-96, but the
pitcher who might mean more to the Atlanta Braves is Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   By defeating the Diamondbacks, 5-0, on Saturday night at Bank
One Ballpark, the left-hander became the first pitcher in the
majors this season to win 20 games (20-6) and allowed the Braves to
reach 100 victories for the second straight season (100-56).
</P>
<P>
   He also enhanced his chances to win the second NL Cy Young Award
of his career (his first was in 1991) by scattering six hits,
walking one and striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   The only serious threat by Arizona (62-94) came in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the roof of Bank One Ballpark open for the first time since
June 27 against Seattle, Kelly Stinnett led off with a single and
Karim Garcia sent a double over the head of Andruw Jones in center
field. After pinch-hitter Andy Stankiewicz popped out to second,
Glavine walked Andy Fox but struck out Jay Bell looking and retired
Devon White on a grounder to second for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret in what he (Glavine) does,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He locates his fastballs in places
where the umpires call strikes. That's the name of the game. He's
been doing it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   After being shut out by Arizona right-hander Andy Benes and two
relievers on Friday night, the Braves took an aggressive approach
against left-hander Brian Anderson (12-13).
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen led off with a single to left-center, and Gerald
Williams followed by launching an 0-1 pitch over the fence in left
for a home run. It was the 38th home run allowed by Anderson this
season, tops in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball was off the plate and in at his (Williams')
shoulders. How he hit it, I don't know. Give him credit. I thought
it was a pretty good pitch,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got Chipper Jones to foul out to Travis Lee at first
base, but Andres Galarraga connected for a double to right field,
the first of his four hits on the night.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Lopez hit a line drive to Bell at second base, and it
appeared Bell stepped on the second base bag just before Galarraga,
which would have ended the inning, but umpire Eric Gregg ruled
otherwise. Andruw Jones followed with an RBI double to right to
make the score 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I pitched tonight the way I have the last five games
(four wins and a no-decision),'' Anderson said. ``The balls fell
for them, and they didn't fall for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, of course, had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who set the standard (for left-handers),''
Anderson said. ``I think he and I pitch in a similar manner. We're
not overpowering, but we use our location to get guys out. You
can't argue with what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt about the game's outcome, the Braves made
sure of it with a couple of insurance runs in the eighth inning off
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Williams singled to left with one out, his third hit of the
night, Chipper Jones singled and Galarraga singled. Showalter
brought in right-hander Felix Rodriguez, who gave up a single to
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Williams once played for Showalter with the New York Yankees.
Showalter wants him to have success, but not at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got him, he was right out of Grambling
(University),'' Showalter said. ``He was raw, but aggressive. He's
come a long way. He's a solid player and a solid guy. He plays hard
and he can play all three outfield positions.'' &QL;

LEE FOCUSES ON PROGRESS, NOT AWARD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Due in part to a two-week stay on the disabled list in
late July and early August, the odds are casting a long shadow on
Travis Lee's chances to win the National League Rookie of the Year
award.
</P>
<P>
   While he would be thrilled if enough votes carry his name, the
Diamondbacks first baseman won't consider it a sour season if it
doesn't happen. He seems to be focused more on long-term success
than short-term gratification.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his first season in the major leagues, which ends a
week from today, ``has been a dream come true and a learning
experience at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the level, he said, ``baseball is a game of
confidence, but at the major league level, it gets tested a lot
more. The physical part of it is about the same. When you're on,
you can hit anybody. When you're not, you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said his confidence was a bit shaken after returning from
the disabled list (strained groin). He had only 17 hits in his
first 107 at-bats (.159) and saw his average drop from .288 into
the low .260s.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown signs of coming around of late. He got an infield
hit off Atlanta left-hander Tom Glavine on Saturday night to extend
his hitting streak to seven games and 10 of his last 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed in my numbers,'' he said. ``I never
really got back on track. That's the mental part you have to deal
with. You think you can come back pretty much the same, and I
hadn't seen live pitching in a while. It was 0 for 10, 0 for 12 or
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to doubt myself. I thought my swing was no
good. I called home (to his parents in Olympia, Wash.) quite a few
times. But things are gradually starting to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said that Lee may not agree
with him, ``but I think a little bit of adversity has been good for
him. It's good for him to be exposed to as much of this game as he
can, so he'll know how to handle himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody in the organization could be more
pleased with the way he's handled himself this year, in both good
times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that the numbers he has this year (.267, 20
home runs and 69 RBIs) will be the lowest he'll have in his career.
He has a lot of strikeouts (122), but I doubt he'll have 100
again.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been occasions when Lee has received help on his
strikeouts from the umpires, who have tested him just like opposing
pitchers. &QL;

KINGS WIN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Kings are using the early games of the nine-game
exhibition schedule to evaluate their young players, and two in
particular stood out Saturday night in the exhibition opener, a 3-2
shootout victory over the Colorado Avalanche before a crowd of
6,721 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Rosa scored at even strength and Olli Jokinen assisted on
veteran Glen Murray's goal with a two-man advantage. The Kings also
got a strong effort in goal by reserve Manny Legace, who has a shot
at a spot on the roster at least as long as Jamie Storr remains
unsigned. Legace stopped 25 of 27 Colorado shots. Sandy Moger
scored the winning goal in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche goals were scored by Chris Drury and Milan Hejduk.
The teams meet again at 5 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The game was more notable for who was out of the lineup than for
who played. Among those Kings not in the lineup were defensemen
Steve Duchesne, Rob Blake and Garry Galley, and forwards Luc
Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel (who has a twisted ankle).
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche lineup was a bit more representative. Patrick Roy
played the entire game in goal, and star center Joe Sakic also
played, though Peter Forsberg sat out.
</P>
<P>
   Berg signs in Finland: The agent for restricted free agent Aki
Berg said that the 21-year-old defenseman has signed a one-year
contract with TPS, his former team in his native Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kelly of Ottawa said Berg scored a power-play goal for TPS
on Saturday, and added that the chances are ``slim'' that his
client will return to the Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised,'' Kelly said. ``He certainly went back
intending to play in Finland for one year, and probably two.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly said a clause exists in Berg's contract that would
allow him out of the Finnish deal if he signs with the Kings by
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he does not plan to initiate further discussions with
Kings general manager Dave Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to call, he knows where to reach me,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he is planning to speak with Kelly again about Berg,
who was the third player chosen in the 1995 NHL draft. He also said
there has been no new progress in efforts to reach contract terms
with the Kings' other unsigned player, goalie Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds: The odds on the Kings winning the 1999 Stanley
Cup are 30-1 at the MGM Grand sports book, the same as the Mighty
Ducks and Wayne Gretzky's New York Rangers. The Avalanche is 10-1.
The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings are
the favorites, at 7-2. The expansion Nashville Predators are 350-1.

IT'S ONLY A START FOR SUN DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The Great Mercenary Bowl is over. The check has
changed hands. And now we can resume a college football season
already in progress.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what $370,000 will get you these days? For that much,
you should be able to buy back your Top 10 ranking. Or purchase a
new ending against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All it got Arizona State was a hollow victory, a padded box
score and a chance to break a sweat. Nothing less, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Forget a 34-15 victory over North Texas, a football program that
will lick your wounds and feed your ego if the price is right. Need
a sparring partner? Give 'em a call. Except they're already booked
for this season, busy earning a cool $1.28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they Mean Green. And apologize for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, there was a cheap feel to this victory. Sort of
like paying for something you can't get on your own. Which would go
a long way in explaining the half-empty stadium, a reminder that
turnstile apathy isn't always confined to Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at the bright side. But this is a football team
that teased you with talk of a national championship, and, yes, we
all inhaled. A football team that lost its first two games, killing
off the euphoria in a matter of eight days. A team still looking
for its first meaningful victory.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, redemption isn't always the next game on the schedule.
In the case of the unranked Sun Devils, nothing will matter until
they beat someone worthy.
</P>
<P>
   They will have their chance in the next four weeks. A pretty
good outfit from Oregon State pays a visit. Then it's off to Troy
for a road game with O.J.U. Armageddon at home against Notre Dame,
the biggest mercenary of all. A home game with Stanford, which
upset North Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In four weeks, the season might look a whole lot better. The
defense could grow up, a leader might appear, and the offense could
very well mature into the juggernaut you expected. And in the year
of the upset, no telling what the Bowl Championship Series will
look like come November.
</P>
<P>
   Hope is not lost. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is how we play the game of football, what we
do, how we do it,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``That's what the
deal is. Not whether we play Washington or BYU or North Texas. We
have to play up to our standards. We have to take care of ASU.''
</P>
<P>
   Impossible to tell whether that occurred on Saturday. North
Texas outgained the Sun Devils, 118-101, in the first quarter. Ryan
Kealy, one of the main culprits in the stink bomb against Brigham
Young, threw two interceptions. Chad Elliot, a cocky, redshirt
freshman who has a faction of supporters on the team, was looking
more and more like a viable option. And on two consecutive series,
the offense walked to the sideline under a chorus of boos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the grief was temporary. Kealy caught fire. J.R.
Redmond buzzed along like the one indestructible piece in a game of
electronic football. The receiving corps was splendid, hauling down
everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the defense is still suspect. North Texas moved the ball
surprisingly well, and who knows how many points it would've scored
if not for a rash of second-quarter mistakes? All of which
illustrates the inexperience and growing pangs, neither of which
are likely to disappear anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the parade of flags. In three games, ASU has 32
penalties for 309 yards. More than a football field per game in
free yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Against North Texas, it was a formality, not a liability.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, this would've been the ideal opponent to start
the season, the perfect springboard for an team still unsure of
itself. In a sport that doesn't have an exhibition season, the
early stages of the schedule can be a risky proposition. In a
conference without a balanced schedule, the margin for error is
slim. Both have hurt the Sun Devils this season.
</P>
<P>
   At least they have a victory. Now they can work on regaining a
bit of respect. &QL;

ASU FINDS ITS PULSE IN 1ST WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - ``Thump. Thump. Thump''.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just what Arizona State did to North Texas Saturday
night. It's also the sound of a team finding its pulse after
flat-lining for two straight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Whew. There. Behind J.R. Redmond's three touchdowns, the Sun
Devils finally felt what it's like to win again with a 34-15
victory in front of an announced crowd of 61,158 at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the heart to win nine more games,'' ASU cornerback
Courtney Jackson said. ``You can't win nine until you get the
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. This was not a great effort by ASU. The defense
yielded 373 yards after the Mean Green managed just 264 in two
games. North Texas rolled up 192 rushing yards after posting just
44 against Texas Tech last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' Sun Devils Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``I don't
believe North Texas should have gotten 15 (points).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a confidence builder. ASU's offense was much
sharper and the dropped passes that plagued this team a week ago
were practically non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond had 15 carries for 122 yards and 191 all-purpose yards.
Quarterback Ryan Kealy was 16 of 24 for 207 yards, two touchdowns
and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas shouldn't be embarrassed by the effort. It
capitalized on ASU's shaky defense after scoring just nine points
combined in its first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASU has a lot of firepower,'' Mean Green Coach Darrell Dickey
said. ``We didn't have that much power.''
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that ASU's revival was led by one of its
spiritual leaders, wide receiver Kenny Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The senior is one of ASU's best athletes and most charismatic
personalities. But there has been a lingering sense that he's never
quite lived up to his potential.
</P>
<P>
   If this proves to be his breakthrough game, then his timing, a
key element for his position, was perfect. Mitchell had five
catches for 88 yards, including a 60-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome to watch,'' Kealy said. ``To see him break the
first tackle, then second . . . then score. It's great.
</P>
<P>
   The game had plenty of subplots:
</P>
<P>
   _Gerald Green, the 5-foot-9 tailback with the compelling life
story, played much of the second half and had nine carries for 35
yards. With the loss of Marlon Farlow to academics, the Sun Devils
needed a third back behind Redmond and Davaren Hightower. They
found him.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Hightower sprained his knee in the game and
will be examined today.
</P>
<P>
   _The coaching staff had an opportunity to look at a variety of
players. Junior college transfers Junior Ioane and Erik Flowers
started and saw significant minutes on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils still have issues to address, and most have to do
with their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's apparent that we have a ton of things to work
on,'' Snyder said. ``But in saying that, I want to really emphasize
that this week of practice, the amount of work that went into this
week, was really, really important.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU sent a message on its opening drive. It went 57 yards in
under two minutes behind the legs of Redmond and arm of Kealy, who
was 3 for 3 during the drive. Redmond scored on a 13-yard run to
put ASU ahead, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas' offense didn't appear intimidated during its first
possession. It drove to the Sun Devils' 18-yard line, but Garrett's
Courtney's field-goal try was blocked by Steve Campbell. That's
right, the ``quarterback,'' who has found new life on special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney's next attempt was successful, a 42-yard effort with
10:53 remaining in the second quarter that closed the Mean Green to
within 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils executed their next drive flawlessly. Redmond and
Hightower combined for 20 yards on four plays and Kealy and
Mitchell capped the possession with a 60-yard scoring play. The 6-3
Mitchell shed several tacklers after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond increased ASU's lead to 21-3 with 4:54 remaining on a
24-yard run that made Mean Green players look as if they were
wearing lead boots.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has catches in 28 straight games, gave the Sun
Devils another touchdown on a 9-yard reception. Green carried seven
times for 31 yards during the series.

ARIZONA RINGS UP IOWA, STAYS UNBEATEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ On its surface, Arizona's 35-11 victory over Iowa on
Saturday night in front of 52,634 at Arizona Stadium would leave
the impression that the Wildcats went unchallenged in their home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes were one play, one vicious hit, from making things
interesting Saturday. The Iowa faithful no doubt will be asking two
questions of Coach Hayden Fry today: Why did you go for a touchdown
on fourth and goal at the Arizona 2? And what's a 69-year-old man
doing wearing white pants on the sideline?
</P>
<P>
   Iowa (1-2) had its chances to upset the 16th-ranked Wildcats
(3-0). In the first half, Iowa had a touchdown called back because
of a penalty and were intercepted deep in Wildcats territory. But
the most deadly failure came in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 14-3, the Hawkeyes had a first and goal at the Arizona
5 but didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona linebacker Marcus Bell made the play of the game on the
goal-line stand. After two running plays and an incomplete pass
gained just three yards, Fry elected to go for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kyle McCann drifted back to pass and was dancing
around when Bell sprinted in and dropped McCann on his can for a
7-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The hit seemed to sap Iowa's resolve. On Arizona's next series,
quarterback Ortege Jenkins found receiver Jeremy McDaniel for a
76-yard gain down to the Iowa 2.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Kelvin Eafon, following a pancake block by guard
Yusuf Scott, scored on the next play to give Arizona a 21-3 lead.
Eafon also scored on a one-yard run in the fourth quarter to finish
the Wildcats' scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were inconsistent for much of the game, with their
occasional flashes of excellence well-separated by stretches of
floundering.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona looked sharp to open the game. With Keith Smith starting
his second straight game at quarterback, the Wildcats used a
no-huddle offense on their first possession and drove to the Iowa
25.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith then had a pass tipped at the line of scrimmage and
intercepted by linebacker Raj Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa also was occasionally exciting on offense. Behind McCann
and running back Ladell Betts, both freshman, the Hawkeyes proved
difficult at times for Arizona to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Betts, 5-11, 204, rushed for 49 yards on 11 carries in the first
half. But Iowa was usually done in by penalties (four for 36 yards
in the first half) or turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona scored first when running back Trung Canidate capped a
69-yard drive with a 1-yard run, giving the Wildcats a 7-0 lead
with 4:21 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes answered immediately behind McCann's arm and Betts'
legs, driving to the Arizona 18. But a run that lost 3 yards and
two incomplete passes ended their hopes for a touchdown, and they
settled for a 40-yard field goal as the first quarter ended.
</P>
<P>
   On its next possession, Iowa had a 29-yard touchdown pass from
McCann to Bashir Yamini called back because of holding.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be a fatal mistake. The Arizona offense woke out of
its slumber, and with Jenkins at quarterback, drove 40 yards to the
Iowa 39. Jenkins was a huge factor in the drive. With the Wildcats
facing third and 14, Jenkins threw a perfect pass to Dennis
Northcutt for a 25-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, who missed all of preseason camp with a stress
fracture in his right foot, then showed that he is completely
healthy. On a second down at the Iowa 39 he took a handoff up the
middle, took a jab step left to fake out a Hawkeyes defender and
sprinted for the touchdown, giving Arizona a 14-3 lead with 8:23
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt, too, proved to be a deadly weapon, catching four
passes for 113 yards in the first half alone. He wasn't perfect,
however. Northcutt should have scored in the first quarter on a
screen but inexplicably cut into the path of an Iowa defender. And
he fumbled a punt in the second quarter, giving Iowa possession at
the Arizona 42. &QL;

CAREY'S SAYS GOAL IS ATTAINABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Bruins began their exhibition season Saturday
night against the Canadiens, and Jim Carey saw action in goal.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought it?
</P>
<P>
   Carey came into the game with 10:09 left in the second period,
the Bruins trailing, 3-0, and allowed two goals and made 11 saves
in Boston's 5-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just a season ago, after posting a 2.90 goals against average
and throwing back-to-back shutouts at Anaheim and Vancouver, Carey
fell into disfavor and was demoted to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   It was an embarrassment for the 1996 Vezina Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   He initially balked, but when he finally decided to head down
Route 95, he took his problems with him. In 10 games, he was
anything but spectacular, compiling a 2-7-1 record and a 3.97 GAA.
</P>
<P>
   A shoulder injury and the ensuing surgery ended his season in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Ill will between Carey and Bruins management surfaced and there
was speculation that the club would buy out his contract in June.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened and Carey, eager to make a fresh start,
reported to training camp on time and healthy, intent on proving
that he again can be a top-notch goalie.
</P>
<P>
   So he's getting a close look from management. But with Byron
Dafoe and Rob Tallas generally considered the top two goalies in
camp, Carey knows he's in for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Carey said, ``I don't know of any coach that doesn't
want a good player,'' and it appears coach Pat Burns will give him
a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Carey acknowledged that he's surprised he's still a Bruin but he
also knows that his fate is out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard, playing the best that I can, and just hope I
can make this club,'' said the Weymouth native and former Catholic
Memorial star. ``Either that or maybe someone else sees that you're
healthy and gives you a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about what might happen. Will I be here, will I be
traded, will I go to Providence? All the options are out there and
out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey was expected to be the Bruins netminder for many years
when he was obtained from the Washington Capitals in March 1997,
but things didn't pan out as he, or the Bruins, thought.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 games, he had a 5-13 record with a 3.82 goals against
average. He acknowledged that the pressure of playing before the
hometown fans was perhaps greater than he had anticipated. For one,
he wasn't prepared for the chorus of boos he received after a poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A return to his 1996 form would change the jeers to cheers.

A BLOCK OF DETERMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It has been quite the journey for Steve Campbell,
taking him along all sorts of pathways and detours, leading him to
a destination he never intended nor expected to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all things considered, he's happy to be there. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   In only a year, the fifth-year senior has gone from Arizona
State's starting quarterback contender to backup to Sun Bowl
starter and winner to third-stringer to flag bearer to, of all
things, special teams as a designated kick blocker. Of all things.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the same Steve Campbell who filled in for an
injured Ryan Kealy and passed for 109 yards in ASU's 17-7 win over
Iowa in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31, the same Steve Campbell who did
what even the legendary Jake Plummer couldn't do _ be the
quarterback of record in an ASU bowl win _ blocked Garrett
Courtney's 34-yard field goal attempt for North Texas in the first
quarter at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ASU won, 34-15, in a game that proved nothing except that the
manner in which the Sun Devils defense has been shredded so far is
no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell lost the quarterback derby to Kealy last summer and
then fell to No. 3 behind Kealy and redshirt freshman Chad Elliott
this season. At 6 feet 8, he is on the kick-blocking unit because
of his height after telling assistant coach John Pettas, ``I want
to do ``something.''''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to swat away anything airborne, like King Kong on
the Empire State building. But Campbell didn't leave his feet. In
fact, he wasn't even upright. With Albrey Battle and Junior Ioane
moving blockers aside, Campbell slanted through the line _ ``got
skinny,'' he said _ and got a hand on the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do all the work, and I get all the glory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the same type of glory Campbell might have expected
when he began his ASU career in 1994, but he'll take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me something to look forward to,'' he said.
``That's the role the team needs. They told me they wanted to give
Elliott playing time and get ready for the future. I understand
that. I just have to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My major role is to be a leader. Maybe block a field goal and
do what the coach asks me to do. Do what the team needs me to do.
Be a leader and do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder so appreciates Campbell's attitude and
willingness to pitch in that he bestowed upon him the honor of
leading the Sun Devils onto the field hoisting the school flag.
</P>
<P>
   As another token of appreciation, Snyder put Campbell in at
quarterback for a series in the fourth quarter with the Sun Devils
comfortably ahead, 34-15. He scrambled and got knocked a little
woozy, and Elliott mopped up.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder wasn't totally satisfied with how his team played, but he
has no ambivalence about Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him at the beginning of the season, and I'll say it
now. He is as much a glue to this whole outfit as anyone,'' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I admire him. I trust him. He's doing something
that's harder than what guys like Jake or Pat Tillman did, because
they played. It's really admirable. If I was in private business,
I'd hire him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Campbell said he has no regrets. Or very few, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' he said. ``I love the people I've come in
contact with. Would I like to be the starting quarterback? Of
course. But not everyone can be a starter.'' &QL;

NAU TAKES BIG TUMBLE IN 1ST LOSS  
 NORTHRIDGE HAS EASY TIME IN BIG SKY OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - A summer of discontent in 1997 convinced
Marcus Brady that the Naval Academy was not the place for him. It
only took a few months of the structured life to make the
quarterback homesick for California.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the redshirt freshman is loving the free-wheeling life at
Cal State-Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Brady stunned and frustrated Northern Arizona on Saturday night
as he led the Matadors to a 41-10 victory in a Big Sky Conference
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who said his academy experience ``is a moment in my life
I want to forget,'' had a night to remember. He threw for three
touchdowns, completing 20 of 26 passes for 236 yards. He also wound
up with 49 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt comfortable out there,'' Brady said. ``I could see
my receivers, and I was able to read the defense because we saw a
lot of film.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said the bye week for the Matadors (1-1) helped him get a
little healthier after taking a pounding in a 26-13 loss to Boise
State two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   NAU (2-1, 0-1), ranked No. 13 in Division I-AA, played without a
quarterback who might have given Brady a fight. Travis Brown, who
injured his elbow a week ago, remains week to week. Clay Brown did
a fair job filling in, but he was overmatched and perhaps was
trying too hard to carry the team. He ran for a team-high 91 yards
but was only 9 for 26 passing for 78 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Even a momentary bright spot for the Lumberjacks _ a sizzling
65-yard run by Tavon Cooper to set up a touchdown in the third
quarter _ was negated when Brady came right back to lead his team
to another score. The key play in that drive was his 50-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Brady completed 14 consecutive passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That quarterback is extremely elusive,'' Lumberjacks Coach
Jerome Souers said. ``We couldn't contain him.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU's defense managed to corral Brady four times, but it was
neither enough nor at the right times.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's game rubbed off on his teammates, who seemed to do
little wrong, as evidenced by a 93-yard touchdown run on a
recovered fumble late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the first in the head coaching career of Ron
Ponciano, and he's the first to admit that inheriting Brady was a
stroke of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the blind squirrel finding the nut,'' he said.
``He's a talented guy, a tough rascal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws back across the field, he places the ball in just
the right place. There isn't a coach in America who coaches that
kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cooper, it was a nice return. He injured his shoulder in the
season opener and has played sparingly. Cooper, a former star at
Peoria High School, seems to be in a good spot to give the
Lumberjacks a solid running back for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   NAU was the highest-ranked team that Cal State-Northridge has
ever beaten. It was also the Matadors' first win in Flagstaff since
1968. &QL;

STORMY SEAS SURROUND ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's plenty of strife and uncertainty on Long Island
these days. The Islanders have a $10 million lawsuit pending
against Spectacor Management Group, the company that manages the
26-year-old Nassau County Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   New York Sports Ventures, which purchased the club in February
for $195 million, claims that the hoists that hold the scoreboard
in place are unsafe and it wants to nullify the lease with SMG,
which runs through 2015.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real reason for the power struggle appears to be
the owners' desire to terminate their relationship with SMG so that
when a new arena is finally built, SMG would not run the
advertising, concessions, parking, and skyboxes.
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain whether the club will play home games at the
Coliseum this season, but a restraining order has been issued,
preventing them from playing anywhere else pending a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   This dispute is the latest crisis for a team that has missed the
playoffs the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   There was the John Spano disaster in which the former owner
fooled all of the people most of the time until he ultimately was
revealed to be a financial fraud. And there have been contract
disputes, most notably with star forward Zigmund Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Dennis Vaske, who had spent his entire career in the
Islanders organization before signing as a free agent with Boston,
said he has seen it all on the Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I start?'' he said. ``Spano was supposed to be the
knight in shining armor. He had everyone believing that was going
to happen. What's happening now is rather surprising, but I think
they're doing things from a business perspective. They have to do
what they have to do to make ends meet. The fans have had enough
negative things in the area there. I think it was time for a big
positive and this definitely isn't going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaske said the Coliseum is outdated by new rink standards but
what made it a tough place to play in were the small crowds,
between 6,000-10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough market,'' said Vaske. ``In the same respect, I
think, as a fan, you have to kind of look at what you're spending
and what you're getting, too. We had some lulls in there. We had
some really bad starts and some awful years. There are fickle fans
everywhere and I don't blame them. Everyone loves a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruins captain  &UR; Ray Bourque  &LR; is among those mesmerized and
excited by the home run race between  &UR; Mark McGwire  &LR; and  &UR; Sammy
Sosa &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game was on TV from 58 on and I was watching every one
of them when (McGwire) hit 58, 59, 60, 61, and 62 with (son)
 &UR; Christopher &LR; ,'' said Bourque. ``It was quite an event. We'd all
sit down and watch it together. It was quite a feeling watching him
accomplish that. Just having those two guys going head to head like
that. I hope they finish tied. I'd hate to see one guy win it
because who knows when one of these guys is going to have this type
of year again? If McGwire or Sosa hits 67 and the other one hits
66, it's no fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, a classy ambassador for his sport for 20 years, is
impressed by the way McGwire and Sosa have handled the pressure and
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had fun with it, Sosa a little bit more than
McGwire,'' said Bourque. ``It seems like the last month and a half,
McGwire has had a blast with it. Really, you could see a change in
how he approached the media and everything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be tough. McGwire has been hearing it from the
opening day of camp. You're going out there and trying to win games
and play for your team and all they're talking about is your
home-run streak. It's quite an accomplishment with the pressure of
going through that. It's phenomenal. Both these guys are really
humble and love the game. That's why it's been so much fun to
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Bourque has been enjoying baseball, Flames forward  &UR; Marty
McInnis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a former Boston College standout, has been biting his
nails as the Red Sox go down to the wire in the wild-card race.
``It's tough being a Sox fan,'' said McInnis. ``I've got to say
that '86 was really hard to take.  &UR; Billy Buckner  &LR; took the heat for
letting the ball go through his legs but there was a passed ball
just before that. There were a lot of goats. Right now, though,
it's looking pretty good for the playoffs. I think we're going to
get there.'' ...  &UR; Alexandre Daigle  &LR; didn't do himself any favors
with his sad time in the Flyers' 10-kilometer run, which was part
of the team fitness testing. He ran the route in 53 minutes 50
seconds, among the worst of the 55 players. Daigle has been under a
microscope since signing a four-year, $12.25 million deal the day
he was drafted by Ottawa with the first overall pick in 1993, and
has been widely viewed as a chronic underachiever. ``We need more
consistent play out of Alexandre,'' said Philly GM  &UR; Bob Clarke &LR; .
``He can give you five or six games where he shows you his
greatness and then he gives you games where you couldn't find him
with a program. When players are inconsistent in their performance,
it's hard for coaches to trust them.'' Daigle, who aspires to be an
actor, made news off the ice this summer when he was reported to be
dating former ``Baywatch'' star  &UR; Pamela Anderson Lee  &LR; ... Last
Monday, Senators star  &UR; Daniel Alfredsson  &LR; said his major objective
was to stay healthy. On Wednesday, Alfredsson tore the medial
collateral ligament in his left knee during a scrimmage and could
be out as long as eight weeks. It isn't the first key injury for
the Senators. Defenseman  &UR; Janne Laukkanen  &LR; is recovering from a
groin surgery that will likely sideline him three months ... Nice
decision to hold the 2000 All-Star Game, the NHL's 50th, in
Toronto. It's scheduled to take place at the new Air Canada Centre,
now under construction and due to open Feb. 20. It will be the
first time since 1968 that Toronto has hosted the festivities ...
The weather in Feldkirch, Austria, hasn't exactly been what the
Lightning are used to. The Lightning, along with the Buffalo Sabres
(who view the weather in Austria as relatively tropical), are
staying in the mountain village as part of an exhibition trip. It
has been a raw 45 degrees, accompanied by a steady rain. ``I'm
never going to complain about the weather in Florida again,'' said
Lightning GM  &UR; Phil Esposito &LR; . ``I used to complain every time it
rained and about how hot it was. No more. This place is beautiful,
but it's sooooo cold.'' Food also has been a challenge. The players
haven't been able to get away from Wiener schnitzel. ``If I eat one
more Wiener schnitzel,'' said forward  &UR; Sandy McCarthy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``I'm
going to puke.'' ...  &UR; Todd Bertuzzi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was considered a big
bust with the Islanders, has been a force early in Vancouver's
training camp. The 23-year-old forward, who was taken with the
Isles' first choice in 1993 (No. 23 overall), is finally using his
6-foot-3-inch, 230-pound frame. ``The whole point of having size is
you have to use it,'' said Bertuzzi, who was dealt to the Canucks
Feb. 6. ``I'm going to drive the net. I'm not going to go out there
and kill people or anything, but I am going to finish my checks
whenever I can. This is a fresh start. This is a new team.'' ... As
expected, the Canucks suspended disgruntled forward  &UR; Pavel Bure
 &LR; for his failure to show up to camp. Bure has demanded a trade and
GM  &UR; Brian Burke  &LR; said he won't ship off Bure until the right deal
comes along. If Bure sits the whole year, he stands to lose about
$8 million in Canadian funds ... A youngster who has caught the eye
of Bourque is 23-year-old forward  &UR; Andre Savage &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who also is a
client of Bourque's close friend  &UR; Steve Kasper &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Bruin
coach. ``I'm very impressed how he takes the puck to the net and
always gets there,'' he said. ``He's kind of like a
( &UR; Steve &LR; ) &UR; Heinze  &LR; but he doesn't clean up the ice as much as
Heinzey. (Kasper) told me he really goes to the net good. He's got
nice, quick hands. He's finished some nice plays and has made some
nice passes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blackhawks captain  &UR; Chris Chelios &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who turns 37 in January, is
hoping that after such a miserable season last year _ Chicago
missed the playoffs for the first time in 29 years _ the additions
of  &UR; Doug Gilmour &LR; , &UR; Paul Coffey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Eddie Olczyk  &LR; as well as
tough guys  &UR; Mark Janssens  &LR; and  &UR; Doug Zmolek  &LR; will ease some of the
burden. Despite rumors to the contrary, Chelios said he didn't have
a big problem with coach  &UR; Craig Hartsburg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was fired in favor
of  &UR; Dirk Graham  &LR; in the offseason. ``I have argued with every coach
at every level,'' said Chelios. ``Just because I looked at him
funny sometimes doesn't mean I didn't respect him.'' The Hawks are
still without Group 2 free agent  &UR; Eric Daze &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is haggling with
management over a contract ... Ducks defenseman  &UR; Fredrik
Olausson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who turns 32 next month, is undergoing tests because of
an enlarged spleen, which was diagnosed during a physical last
weekend. This isn't Olausson's first health problem. He also has
had an irregular heartbeat and inflammation of the colon. He
suffers from Crohn's disease, an inflammation of the digestive
tract ... Defenseman  &UR; Tommy Albelin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 34, was deemed the fittest
athlete in Calgary's camp. He attributed it to an unfavorable
climate in his native Sweden, where he spent the offseason. ``You
couldn't go outside so you would have to do something inside,''
said Albelin. ``I went to the gym.'' ... Kings defenseman  &UR; Aki
Berg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; LA's first pick in the 1995 draft, is planning to fly home
to Finland this weekend to join a club team rather than accept the
Kings' latest contract proposal. Berg had eight assists and no
goals in 72 games last year. A much bigger problem was solved when
captain  &UR; Rob Blake &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a Group 2 free agent, came to terms Friday.
After winning the Norris Trophy in June, Blake got three years and
$15.8 million ... Former Bruin forward  &UR; Sergei Zholtok  &LR; is
currently listed as the No. 2 center behind  &UR; Vincent Damphousse  &LR; in
Montreal's camp. Zholtok, who was released by Ottawa, had three
goals during a scrimmage last week ... Wings enforcer  &UR; Joey Kocur
 &LR; is a best bet to be among those exposed for the waiver draft.
Reportedly, Kocur would retire rather than go to another city ...
The locals are making a big splash in Edmonton's training camp.
Massachusetts natives  &UR; Tom Poti &LR; , &UR; Brad Norton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Dan LaCouture
 &LR; all are making impressive runs at jobs on the big team, which
already has Bay Staters  &UR; Bill Guerin &LR; , &UR; Joe Hulbig &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Mike
Grier  &LR; ... Forward  &UR; Trent McCleary &LR; , &UR;  &LR; released by the Bruins, made
an early impression during his tryout with the Canadiens, getting
into a scrap with veteran defenseman  &UR; Igor Ulanov &LR; . McCleary, who
couldn't come to terms with the Bruins last year and wound up
playing for Las Vegas in the IHL, could find a home in Montreal
since the Habs had three unsigned forwards going into the weekend
and  &UR; Shayne Corson  &LR; is holding out ... 20 days to opening night.

USC SHOWS ITS CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You're not supposed to get excited about handing a
team its 13th consecutive Pac-10 loss. In the hierarchy of bragging
rights, that's right there with knocking down a Julio Cesar Chavez
who's way past his prime or embarrassing the defending World Series
champion Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there's definitely momentum in the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, more than the headline-grabbing upset victory
it's ho-hum wins such as the one the USC football team gutted out
against upstart Oregon State Saturday that augur promise.
</P>
<P>
   Because any team can work itself into an inspired frenzy against
an opponent that it isn't supposed to defeat; the motivation then
is as easy to muster as one's next breath. The teams that are
talked about past November are the ones that don't allow themselves
to get tripped up by opponents they're expected to beat, summoning
the motivation to succeed from deep within themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans faced a couple of critical gut checks in the second
half of their Pac-10 opener. That they came back to overpower the
Beavers 40-20 in front of a Coliseum crowd of 45,629 says something
of their collective character.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, USC is in a position to elevate themselves in the
national rankings with a headline-grabbing win this week against
favored Florida State in its first road game, at Tallahassee,
because it weathered a 54-minute first quarter that could have
lulled them to sleep, then stubbornly refused to let a
much-improved OSU team derail them in the pivotal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If there was an individual player who personified the team
effort it was senior running back Chad Morton, who finished with
123 yards rushing on 23 carries despite missing most of the week of
practice because of a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me so much tonight,'' said first-year Trojans coach
Paul Hackett. ``He's as tough as nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Alexander tested the Trojans' mettle when he returned the
second-half kickoff yards for the score that tied the game at 17.
It took Alexander, the Beavers' one-time quarterback, only 16
seconds to go _ untouched _ where neither Purdue nor San Diego
State had gone before him in the second halves of their games
against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's sprint was a kick in the stomach to a Trojans team
that had taken no small pride in the fact it had outscored the
Boilermakers and Aztecs 31-0 over the final 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the play of our football team after they
ran back that kickoff,'' Hackett said. ``That was a very tough pill
for us to swallow. We did an outstanding job of not letting us
affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (3-0) recovered their collective breath, though it
took a huge play from junior Pat Swanson to enable everybody to
exhale. After the Trojans answered Alexander's score with an
indifferent drive, OSU Ken Simonton promptly fumbled the ensuing
punt.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson swooped in to recover the ball, setting up a 26-yard
drive that culminated in a 28-yard field goal by Adam Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chip shot for the senior placekicker but by no means a
given; before he could make it, Abrams had to dig deep down, past
the memories of his three missed field goals against the Aztecs.
You could say he put his sad Saturday behind him; his four field
goals were a career high.
</P>
<P>
   The USC defense took up where Abrams' foot left off. On the
Beavers' next possession, they worked the ball into Trojans
territory. But on a third-and-7 play at the USC 35, the
cardinal-and-gold covered quarterback Terrance Bryant like a tidal
wave. He had no choice but to hurry his throw and it fell
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers had the temerity to tread into Trojans' territory on
their next series but, again, a USC player rose to the challenge.
This time it was David Gibson, who recovered a fumble by Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers fell apart after that, the final score hardly
indicative of the scare they gave a USC team that was supposed to
win if only because no Trojans squad has lost to OSU since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Under the second-year tutelage of former USC assistant coach
Mike Riley, Oregon State looks much better than the squad that was
shut out by the Trojans 23-0 last year on its way to a 3-8
conference record.
</P>
<P>
   But then, so, too, does USC.

SQUEEZE IS ON SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Though the Sydney organizers insist there's room for
only 10,200 athletes under their big tent, the Lords of the Rings
keep coming up with new sports and events for the 2000 Olympic
program.
</P>
<P>
   Besides tacking on triathlon, taekwondo, trampoline, tumbling,
and women's water polo, the International Olympic Committee has
added the women's pole vault and hammer throw plus two wheelchair
events to track and field. To keep from having athletes camp in the
hallways, the IOC is reducing entries in sports such as boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salt Lake City, which already has 70 medal events
with the inclusion of pursuit events in biathlon and an expanded
field (from six to eight) for women's ice hockey, may put on the
brakes. Odds are it won't add skeleton sledding and women's ski
jumping; women's bobsledding is still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Superb showing by the US rowers, who won nine medals at the
recent world regatta in Cologne and barely missed topping the
table. Most impressive performance was by the men's eight, which
came out of fifth place to become the first US big boat to retain a
global crown and the first in seven years (since Germany) to
repeat. The women's lightweight double of Worcester's  &UR; Christine
Collins  &LR; and  &UR; Sarah Garner  &LR; also claimed a gold, with silvers
coming from the women's eight (with East Bridgewater's  &UR; Wendy
Wilbur  &LR; aboard), the men's lightweight eight, and the women's
lightweight quad (with Cambridge's  &UR; Terry Paige &LR; ), and bronzes from
the men's coxed pair and lightweight quad and women's pair and
lightweight pair. With a bit of luck, the Yanks could have had a
couple more medals. But the pair of  &UR; Adam Holland  &LR; and
Newburyport's  &UR; Cy Beasley  &LR; missed a bronze by .03 seconds and
sculler  &UR; Jamie Koven &LR; , the defending world champ, popped his
oarlock in the semis and missed making the final. As expected, the
host Germans (10 medals) led the standings. Great Britain's
legendary  &UR; Steven Redgrave  &LR; won a record eighth world title in the
uncoxed four, and Canada's  &UR; Marnie McBean  &LR; made history by winning
a global medal (a silver in the four) in her sixth different event
... No excuses from  &UR; Marion Jones  &LR; after she'd lost the World Cup
long jump to Germany's  &UR; Heike Drechsler  &LR; in Johannesburg's cold
rain last Sunday for her only defeat of the year. ``It's the same
for all of us,'' Jones said. ``It's not as if it got cold just for
me.'' Jones still won the 100 and 200 to lead the US women to the
team title after pocketing nearly $700,000 in bonuses at the
previous weekend's Grand Prix final in Moscow. Word now is that the
international federation will rejigger the schedule for next year's
world outdoor meet to let Jones try for gold in both the 100 and
long jump, whose qualifying rounds now conflict ... Could be the
end of the line for Olympic sprint champion  &UR; Donovan Bailey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
ruptured his Achilles' tendon last week in a pickup basketball game
in Toronto. Ironically, Bailey walked away from a car wreck last
year with only a sore neck ... Yes, that is China's  &UR; Wang Junxia
 &LR; jogging around the Colorado State campus this fall. The Olympic
distance champion is paying her own way as a student. No word on
whether she'll be doing any cross-country for the Golden Ram
varsity.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the International Skating Union vows it won't open the
Olympics to all figure skaters, it's clearly heading in that
direction with its new Grand Slam, which has most of the top
eligibles and ineligibles going head-to-head in front of ISU
judges. Next weekend's inaugural in Charleston, S.C., features the
last three men's Olympic gold medalists ( &UR; Ilia Kulik &LR; , &UR; Alexei
Urmanov &LR; , &UR; Viktor Petrenko &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; and world champions  &UR; Alexei
Yagudin &LR; , &UR; Kurt Browning &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Todd Eldredge &LR; , &UR;  &LR; plus women's world
titlists  &UR; Michelle Kwan &LR; , &UR; Chen Lu &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Yuka Sato &LR; . Winners
receive $40,000. Though Kwan has her high school diploma in hand
(from Rim of the World HS in Lake Arrowhead, Calif.), she's putting
college on hold until next fall while she continues to focus on
skating ... As expected, the ISU has raised the bar for male
skaters in the short program, allowing a quadruple jump. Though the
quad is optional, it'll soon become all but compulsory for anyone
who wants a medal. The ISU has also made a throw jump (double or
triple) one of the required elements for pairs ... Terrific field
for next month's Evening With Champions benefit at Harvard's Bright
Center: Yagudin,  &UR; Oksana Baiul &LR; , &UR; Paul Wylie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; world pairs champs
 &UR; Elena Berezhnaya  &LR; and  &UR; Anton Sikharulidze &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the new dance
combo of Olympic champ  &UR; Evgeny Platov  &LR; and former medalist  &UR; Maya
Usova &LR; . Dates are Oct. 23-24-25; call 617-493-8172 for details ...
New coach for the Russian hockey team is the legendary  &UR; Alexander
Yakushev &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won two Olympic gold medals with the Big Red
Machine and also played in the historic 1972 showdown with Team
Canada ... How does the international soccer federation plan to
raise the level of the Olympic tournament? By raising the number of
over-23 players on each team from three to five and massaging the
European club schedule to make better players available. Though the
IOC would love to have the best playing the best, as it now does in
basketball and hockey, FIFA doesn't want to diminish the importance
of the quadrennial World Cup ... Lots of new faces on US
Speedskating's coaching staff for the next quadrennium.  &UR; Dan
Immerfall &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a three-time Olympian and 1976 bronze medalist, will
be overall technical coordinator.  &UR; Finn Halvorsen  &LR; will direct the
long track program, with  &UR; Bart Schouten  &LR; handling all-arounders and
 &UR; Dave Besteman  &LR; sprinters.  &UR; Pat Wentland  &LR; will coach the short
trackers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Improved showing for the US freestyle wrestlers, who finished
third at the recent world championships in Tehran after placing
sixth last year.  &UR; Sam Henson  &LR; won the gold medal at 119 pounds, and
 &UR; Cary Kolat  &LR; (138) and  &UR; Lincoln McIlravy  &LR; (152) each took bronzes.
The host Iranians won the team title ahead of the Russians ...
Since it's not known when the Olympic qualifying tournament will be
(it determines whether pros will be available), USA Baseball has
scrubbed this autumn's tryouts for next year's national team. The
federation still will choose an all-collegian squad next year for
international games _ just in case ... If you have Greek
grandparents and you can hit the breaking ball, you can make it to
Olympus. Since Athens is hosting the 2004 Summer Games, Greece has
automatically qualified for the baseball draw. Problem is, the
Greeks have no team and only one diamond in the entire country. So
they're looking for Americans of Greek extraction. Where have you
gone,  &UR; Harry Agganis &LR; ?

SOSA, CUBS STRIKE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Cubs fans are expected to pack Wrigley Field Sunday
for the Sammy Sosa Celebration. It would be nice if his Chicago
teammates chip in a much-needed victory as their contribution.
</P>
<P>
   While Sosa has been doing all he can to remain in the home run
chase with Mark McGwire (he's still one behind the St. Louis
slugger, who went 0 for 4 against Milwaukee Saturday night),
Chicago has been losing ground to the New York Mets in the National
League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 7-2 loss to the Reds, coupled with the Mets'
4-3 victory over the Marlins, Chicago and New York are even in
their quest for the postseason with identical 87-69 records.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's final regular-season game at Wrigley against
Cincinnati, the Cubs go on the road for five games, two in
Milwaukee and three in Houston. After Sunday's game against
Florida, New York has two more at home against Montreal, and closes
on the road against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, Sosa went 0 for 4, and Saturday
struck out three times.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 63 home runs, 35 have come at Wrigley Field. With his
mother and 40 friends and family members on hand Sunday for the
celebration, Sosa might wind up pressing even more in the finale
than he has in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I'm a human being,'' he said. ``Not every day
will be a good day. For the last couple of days they have been
pitching me real great. I want to do something every day to help my
team win. But I can't do it alone. I think people understand.
Tomorrow will be much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere, using an assortment of pitches, had Sosa's number
three times, and in the ninth inning, righthander Danny Graves
induced the Dominican star to hit into a game-ending double play.
In all four at-bats, Sosa showed a lack of patience. He went down
swinging in the first and seventh innings, and was caught looking
in the fourth. This was not the Sammy Sosa who has carried the Cubs
on his shoulders since last June. The Cubs don't need home runs;
they need Sosa to be himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I swung at so many pitches,'' said Sosa. ``I never feel
pressure. But I understand that not every day you're going to feel
great. If I was a superman, I'd hit a home run every day. If I
don't do it today, perhaps tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nunnally homered twice and had four RBIs for the Reds and
that was more than enough for Bere, who gave up just two hits in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said the ceremony won't be a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy whatever happens. I think I deserve to be
happy. When the game starts, everybody knows I will be there and
will be ready. This is my job. Whatever happens to me and to Mark
happens. We are chasing history. We both know that 60 home runs
don't happen every year.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to stay ahead of the Mets doesn't happen every year,
either. Sosa said he does not do any scoreboard watching. But he's
perhaps the only one at Wrigley Field who hasn't been looking
skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our situation, we cannot afford to think about what happens
in New York,'' he said. ``We have to think about what's happening
in Chicago. We have to come here to play our game. We don't want to
lose. We talked to each other about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon said his pitchers have no secret
formula to stopping Sosa. Good pitching stops good hitters. The key
is to keep them off balance, working both sides of the plate and
changing speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a good job against him,'' said McKeon. ``Sure, he's
gotten to us for a few home runs, but not in our park. We throw him
fastballs and breaking balls. The thing we don't want to do is hang
one of them. I'm pulling for both of them. They put on a great
show. I hope they end up tied ... at 66.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa says he has no idea what his final total will be. But he's
pretty sure he won't be seeing many strikes the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is right when he said they're not going to give us
anything over the plate to hit,'' said Sosa. ``There is nothing you
can do about it but try to be patient. I love Mark McGwire. We have
a lot of respect for each other. If he's going to win, he's going
to win. I feel satisfied with what I've accomplished.''

SKIP AWAY RUNS AWAY IN WOODWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is no longer a question of greatness; Skip Away
demonstrated again Saturday that he is great. The quest now is to
see whether he is among the best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with four top foes in the most talented field assembled
this year, Skip Away simply ran them all into the ground as he
powered his way to a convincing victory in the $500,000 Woodward
Stakes at Belmont Park on a beautiful fall Saturday, designed to
showcase a super racehorse. The victory was Skip Away's ninth in a
row, his seventh straight this year, and the $300,000 winner's
share moved him to $9,596,552 in earnings in his relentless pursuit
of Cigar's all-time mark of $9,999,815.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's some horse, the best there is,'' said Sonny Hine, who
trains Skip Away for his wife, Carolyn. ``He's one of the best I
have ever seen. He is so brilliant. The horse makes the trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Jerry Bailey, who won his fourth Woodward and third in
four years (Sultry Song in 1992 followed by Cigar in '95 and '96),
Skip Away broke third as the even-money choice ($4.20 to win), but
quickly went up after front-runner Coronado's Quest, the only
3-year-old in the field, and Pat Day. Skip Away took over through a
quarter in :223/5, then sizzled through a half in :452/5, and three
quarters in 1:09, rendering Coronado's Quest, who finished fifth
and last, rubber-legged.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, the 3-2 second choice, made a run under Chris
McCarron, but was done turning for home and faded to fourth.
Gentlemen and Corey Nakatani chased Skip Away home after a mile in
1:341/5, but last year's handicap champion had plenty left and
prevailed by a 1 3/4 lengths in 1:474/5 for the 1 1/8 miles.
Running Stag, a 48-1 shot from Europe, came up the rail with Ray
Cochrane to pick up the pieces and get third, 6 lengths farther
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coronado's Quest always breaks so well that it might have made
it look like we were off a little slow,'' said Bailey. ``But I just
tapped him once and he did his thing and got back in the race. He
does what he has to do. If they try to stay with him, it costs them
a little bit off their finish. If they let him go, he just runs
away. As long as he keeps running like this, I can't see a chink in
his armor.''
</P>
<P>
   This field was considered so strong that Gentlemen, who had not
been higher than 9-5 in his previous 10 races, was 7-1. The veteran
campaigner, now age 6, beat Skip Away in the Pimlico Special last
year but he was no match Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse ran his heart out,'' said Nakatani. ``He ran great.
He made a nice move at the top of the stretch but Skip Away was
just much the best out there. I thought Coronado's Quest would
press Skip Away on the lead but it didn't happen. We just got
outrun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward, witnessed by a crowd of 20,237 that gave Skip Away
a rousing ovation upon his return to the winner's circle, was a
major disappointment for Free House, who had won both his races
this year, and Coronado's Quest, who had captured five in a row
against horses his own age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real happy with my position and then Free House just
stopped trying,'' said McCarron. ``There was something amiss with
him, not in the soundness sense, but something was definitely wrong
with him. I can't put my finger on it. The bottom line is it just
wasn't his day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coronado's Quest took me right out there,'' said Day. ``He was
comfortable on the backside, although we were moving quickly.
Approaching the three-eighths pole, I got no response from my colt.
I asked him to kick on and he faltered. It just wasn't meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Skip Away will be the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup
at Belmont Oct. 10, run at 1 1/4 miles, which he has won the last
two years, defeating Cigar in '96 _ when Skip Away was a 3-year-old
_ and scoring an easy tally last year, which began his winning
streak. The $600,000 victor's purse of the Jockey Club would give
Skip Away the earnings record but it is still expected he will try
to take his second straight Breeders' Cup Classic, a $4 million
race run this year at Churchill Downs Nov. 7, to go out in a blaze
of glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for three in a row in the Jockey Club, we've been
planning on that all along,'' said Hine. ``We'll retire him after
the Breeders' Cup. He's given us four years. It's time. God forbid
we should see him out on the racetrack someday broken down or being
beaten by inferior horses. Why not quit when you're on top?''

BEAVERS ARE UNWANTED GUESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This wasn't your father's Oregon State football
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers showed up at the Coliseum on Saturday night carrying
a 24-game losing streak to their hosts and a 35-year string without
a bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers went home to Corvallis with a 25th consecutive loss
to USC, the look of a team which could bring the bowl game back to
the program and plenty of respect from USC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the comfortable 40-20 final margin, don't think for a
minute that No. 25 was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Oregon State was better than they had been,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said. ``I said that all week and it proved to be true.
Oregon State gave us a real push. Until the game ended, I didn't
relax one moment.''
</P>
<P>
   USC entered Saturday night with a No.16 or No.18 national
ranking, depending on your poll of choice, and are a week away from
jetting to Tallahassee in an attempt to put its name into the
national picture.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State, which lost for the first time in three games,
nearly ruined all the Trojans fun of taking a 3-0 record into that
matchup with No.11 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Beavers performed their role as willing victim early
during this Pac-10 opener for both teams. It took the Trojans only
four plays to move 63 yards after accepting the opening kickoff
with Larry Parker gathering in a perfectly thrown 47-yard strike
from Mike Van Raaphorst for the score.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Beavers spent a good portion of the evening
acting as pesky guests. USC didn't always help itself _ amassing
102 yards on 11 penalties, fumbling away a punt and roughing
quarterback Terrance Bryant to nullify what appeared to be a
drive-ending interception by Rashard Cook in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The fumbled punt by R. Jay Soward led to a 27-yard Oregon State
scoring drive, culminating with a 5-yard scoring toss from Bryant
to James Battle. Oregon State's Tim Alexander then ran back the
second-half kickoff 100 yards for a game-tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the play of our football team after they
ran the kickoff back,'' Hackett said. ``It was a very tough pill to
swallow, particularly right at the start of the second half. I
thought our defense got stronger as the second half went on. Once
again, we played our best football in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's offense never really got comfortable in the second half
thanks to a swarming Oregon State defense. But USC's defense, which
allowed only a field goal in the second half, made sure the Trojans
went home happy.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans now they can set their sights on Florida State,
which beat the Trojans 14-7 in last year's season opener. And USC
can move on with the knowledge that 3-0 starts tend to mean bowl
game appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The last USC team to begin the season 3-0 was the 1995 Rose Bowl
championship team and that happens to be the last Trojans bowl
squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rule around here we get to enjoy this one for 24
hours,'' Hackett said. ``I think we're ready to take a look against
a team which is clearly one of the top in the country.''

FIRST-STRIKE CAPABILITY NOT ENOUGH FOR OWLS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It took Temple 22 seconds to silence the Boston College
faithful Saturday at Alumni Stadium. The visitors capitalized on a
BC fumble on the opening kickoff to take a surprising 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls struck quickly by showcasing the nation's
fourth-leading rushing attack. Their first play was an option run
that went for 16 yards. The second went for 3 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The quick strike was just what Temple wanted _ to unsettle the
unbeaten Eagles with its option attack and take advantage. The Owls
hoped to then further surprise BC with speed and quickness and ride
that momentum to their first win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Great plan. But the execution soon began to falter. Before long,
it was the Owls who appeared to be unsettled, bothered by the fact
they couldn't finish a drive. After the early touchdown, BC took
back the momentum and never relinquished it in a 31-7 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought pressure and we really didn't handle the pressure
well,'' said Temple coach Bobby Wallace, whose team entered the
game averaging 298.5 rushing yards but amassed just 151, including
only 20 after halftime. ``We didn't protect very well and execute
very well under the pressure. Really, that is the first time we
have seen that kind of pressure live and not on the practice
field.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring, Temple managed to move the ball inside the BC 35
five times. Three of the five drives ended with turnovers, another
with a missed field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started shifting their defense to the strength of our
offense,'' said Temple tailback Stacey Mack, who had only 27
rushing yards after eclipsing 100 yards in each of his first two
games. ``There were a lot of mental breakdowns in our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first drive, the only time Temple's quickness caught
the Eagles off guard was in the second quarter, when quarterback
Kevin Harvey shook the grasp of a tackler on third and 8 and
scampered 23 yards to the BC 42.
</P>
<P>
   The play was the seventh on a 15-play, 55-yard drive that ended
with Harvey being intercepted by DuJuan Daniels in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wallace, ``I thought when Kevin broke the tackle and made a
great individual effort _ because they brought the pressure one
time and hit him in the backfield _ and he ended up running it, I
was hoping that would scare them out of bringing it some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a plan that should stop (defensive pressure), but we
just didn't do very well with it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that after Temple's touchdown BC shifted its
defensive front and backs, moving the strong safety over a few
times to Temple's left side, which is where the 16-yard rush on its
first drive was run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would catch them by surprise with our
quickness,'' Wallace added. ``When they put their strong safety
over there, we went back trying to execute the quick passing game
where the strong safety used to be, and we overthrew it badly. It
was a matter of a little execution here and there, and that's
probably what made that first drive look so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   BC defenders, however, said they did not change a thing after
Temple's first scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to make the play at the time and I just didn't,''
said free safety Pedro Cirino. ``That's something I take full
responsibility for. We just made up for it the rest of the game.
Everyone stepped up.''

HARVARD BASHED BY LIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ They decided to designate Saturday's opening game
as their Homecoming bash at Wein Stadium at Baker Field here at the
uppermost tip of Manhattan, and Columbia marked the occasion by
ambushing favored Harvard to give the alums and undergrads
something to celebrate. The Crimson had won their last seven games
a year ago, and completed their first unbeaten and untied Ivy
League season with a victory in Yale Bowl to go 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   This one was no contest as the Lions ran through the Crimson
defense, passed into their zones, and completely shut down their
offense, which was led by returning quarterback Rich Linden and
running back Chris Menick. One needed only to look at the halftime
statistics. The Crimson had just three first downs, a net 12 yards
in rushing, and Linden had been intercepted. The Lions had 112
yards rushing, 10 first downs, and had the ball for 19:43. The
Crimson crossed midfield just once, on an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse as the Lions roared to a 24-0 triumph, the
first time the Crimson had been shut out since the Penn game of
1994. Just consider this sequence in the fourth quarter of the
Crimson's longest day in a few years. The Crimson fielded a punt at
their 45. Linden was caught for a loss of 1 on the first play from
scrimmage. Linden threw an incompletion but the Crimson were called
for holding. First and 40. By the time the Crimson's John Patton
punted it was fourth and 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, who finished 4-6 overall last season and were
hammered, 45-7, by the Crimson in Harvard Stadium, ended up with a
15-8 edge in first downs, ran off 70 plays to 55 for the Crimson,
and enjoyed a 298-169 edge in total offense before a joyous crowd
of 11,175 on a warm, sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it a lot,'' said Columbia coach Ray Tellier. ``We
played a full four quarters. I felt we dominated the game. I can't
remember the last time we controlled things physically up front
like that. Five years ago maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got outplayed every step of the way today,'' said Linden,
who never was able to direct the Crimson offense over midfield. The
only time they made it was on Kane Waller's interception of a Paris
Childress pass and a Clint Killar fumble recovery on the last
sequence of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't get together,'' Linden added. ``We didn't
have 11 guys on the same page today. Their defense played very
well. Their secondary played very well, but obviously turnovers
(one fumble, one interception) hurt us. They won the game. They
stopped us.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress, a senior out of New Orleans, completed 11 of 22
passes for 102 yards, and exciting freshman Jonathan Reese of St.
Louis carried 11 times for 72 yards. The Lions wasted little time
setting the tempo of the game, moving 53 yards in 11 plays on their
second possession and finishing it when wishbone quarterback Jason
Bivens rolled left on a fourth-down call, cut back, and took it in
from the 1 at 4:58 of the first. Before the half, the Lions had
forged a 10-0 lead when Neal Kravitz kicked a 36-yard field goal.
The drive consumed eight minutes and two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the Crimson were bottled up on their first possession of
the second half, the Lions went to work on their second possession
when Reese broke over right tackle and raced 30 yards for a first
down on the 31. After a penalty, Childress saw Mark Cannan wide
open in the left corner of the field and hit him with a pass on the
1. Cannan simply stepped into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions had opened a 17-0 lead, and when Paul Roland
intercepted Linden's first pass on the next sequence and returned
it 35 yards to the 1 it set up a 1-yard plunge by Norman Hayes to
make it 24-0. Twelve points in 27 seconds, and it summed up the
Crimson's day.

PENN, FINN SLIP BY DARTMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; HANOVER, N.H. _ Dartmouth was slipped a Finn Saturday. Not a
take-you-down Mickey Finn, but a put-you-down Jim Finn, the
University of Pennsylvania senior running back. Finn and Co.
claimed a nail-biting 17-14 verdict over the Big Green, in weather
that was more like July's than September's.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-0 at halftime, Dartmouth almost came back. It scored
twice within a four-minute span in the third period for a 14-10
lead. But it was done in by Finn, a first-team All-Ivy League
selection last season, when he scored from a yard out in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Finn, who wears lucky No. 7 very well, was a force as the
Quakers snapped Dartmouth's modest two-game win streak over them.
The 6-foot-1-inch, 215-pounder from Bergen Catholic in Fair Lawn,
N.J., sent a message to league foes as he carried 41 times for 151
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Finn started at strong safety against Dartmouth last year and on
offense carried once for 2 yards. He was switched to running back
full time in October, and ran for 797 yards, second best in the
league to Harvard's Chris Menick.
</P>
<P>
   Finn didn't do it alone. Other contributors were senior
quarterback Matt Rader and a swarming defense. Last year Rader
threw for 206 yards against Dartmouth. Saturday he threw for 161.
</P>
<P>
   Penn scored on its first possession when Finn bulled over from
the 6-yard line with 9:29 left in the first. That capped a
seven-play, 68-yard drive, and Jason Feinberg kicked the point
after. Rader tossed 15- and 27-yard passes to Doug McNeill and
David Rogers, respectively, and Finn had 20 yards on three carries.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's second possession ended 1:38 into the second quarter when
Feinberg kicked a 24-yard field goal. A key play was a 15-yard pass
from Rader to Rogers. In the first quarter Dartmouth had minus-4
yards on offense, while Penn had 97 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second Penn drove from its 28 to the
Dartmouth 27 when a Rader pass was picked off by Green safety Brad
Eissler. But Dartmouth had to punt again and Penn's Joe Piela
returned it 41 yards to the Dartmouth 28. Feinberg's 40-yard field
goal attempt was a shade short.
</P>
<P>
   Penn put together a late 41-yard drive to the Dartmouth 18, but
a 35-yard Feinberg attempt was wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth had 4 yards of total offense in the first half, while
Penn had 194.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my kids at the half that we couldn't let up and that
Dartmouth wasn't going to quit,'' said Penn coach Al Bagnoli.
``Dartmouth just doesn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also saw the first half as a good news-bad news thing,'' he
said. ``We played very well and were up only 10-0. I feel we should
have been up 21-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth got on the board eight minutes into the second half
when Mike Coffey rolled right and hit Damon Ferrara with a
26-yarder in the end zone. Alex Csizinszky kicked the point-after.
That score was set up by a 71-yard Wayne Schlobohm punt to the Penn
1, and a fierce defense that forced a poor Penn punt.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went wild at 12:14 of the third when Coffey capped a
seven-play, 42-yard drive with an up-the-middle keeper from the 13.
The kick made it 14-10. A key play was a 17-yard pass from Coffey
to Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities and played a great third quarter,''
said Darmouth coach John Lyons. ``It was a great effort by our
offense to come back like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Quakers took the lead again, 17-14, at 3:31 of the
fourth when Finn capped a 14-play, 61-yard drive from the 1, or
more accurately fourth and 6 inches. He carried five times for 18
yards on the drive and caught a pass for 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't tired at all in the first half (17 carries),'' said
Finn. ``I was a bit tired in the second half on that long drive.''
</P>
<P>
   On scoring the winner, which took two tries, Finn said, ``I
wasn't sure where the line of scrimmage was on the first carry. The
offensive line was great on the second. The line was great all
day.''

TEAM HELPED BY NELSON'S BACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILTON, Mass. _ The speech wasn't in the ``Win one for the
Gipper'' category, but it wasn't bad. And more importantly, they
were buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You own them,'' Steve Nelson was telling his Curry College
team just before the second half of Saturday's game against Maine
Maritime. ``You're going to win the game. And you're going to do it
because you're a better team. But you've got to play smart. No
mistakes. No penalties. I want you to go and knock them on their
butts. Every time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson, with a resume that includes a career as an All-Pro
linebacker for the Patriots as well as a second career as a media
personality on WEEI and on Patriots pre- and postgame reports, it
was as much hope as it was hunch.
</P>
<P>
   For so long, Curry football had a negative taint to it. But now,
a game and a half into his career as the Colonels coach, it was
time to take a step in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonels could have been forgiven if they raised their
eyebrows just a little. After all, winning was something that had
not happened to a Curry football team for the past 17 games, dating
back two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The streak _ matching the longest in school history and the
fourth longest in Division 3 _ was one of the reasons Nelson had
soft-pedaled his desire to win for most of the early part of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't push them too hard,'' he told his assistants in their
pregame conference. ``We don't want to ruin their confidence if
something bad happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this home opener, with a party-like atmosphere
surrounding D. Forbes Will Field, not much bad was happening. Even
when they found themselves trailing at halftime, 8-6, Nelson and
his staff could sense a growing confidence in the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me 30 more minutes,'' Nelson told them. ``Thirty minutes
of football the way I know you can play and they're going to be
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass. Final Score: Curry 19, Maine Maritime 8.
</P>
<P>
   On the Richter Scale of college football results, it probably
wasn't even a blip on the chart. Division 3 football is a different
world from most games played on Saturday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of Curry and Steve Nelson it was one of those
moments that you savor, from the opening minutes to the obligatory
water container shower Nelson received from his players with 33
seconds left, when the victory finally was secure.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had spent most of the early part of his day being Nellie,
which is less fire and brimstone and more easygoing nice guy, which
characterized his career with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the morning joking with his assistants, all part-time
employees doing this more for fun than for fame or fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' said Nelson, sitting around an equipment
room/coaches office just off the Curry locker room earlier in the
morning. ``There are so many little things that you just don't
factor in. Like one day in practice, one of my players comes up to
me and says, `Coach, someone stole my spikes.' I was kind of
surprised that something like that could happen and I asked him why
would anyone want to steal his shoes and he said it wasn't the
shoes. Someone had actually taken the spikes off the shoes and
stolen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before kickoff, Nelson was on the phone,
trying to find a rental car agency that could provide
transportation after the game for Maine Maritime coach Mike
Hodgson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson came to Curry on a whim. After his Patriot playing days,
he had spent a year as an assistant with New England in the
pre-Bill Parcells/Pete Carroll era, but then had gone off into
other areas, primarily radio and television duties.
</P>
<P>
   But he still wanted to get into coaching. He asked around and
through some friends had an interview set up with Curry president
Ken Quigley. ``It was supposed to be a short introductory
conversation,'' said Quigley with a smile. ``And it turned into a
three-hour luncheon. Steve is perfect for this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson brought in other ``volunteers,'' such as former Patriot
teammate Ronnie Lippett to coach the defensive backs and former NFL
offensive lineman Jim Rourke. Other friends and acquaintances soon
joined ranks, including former Curry coach John Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long way to come,'' said Nelson, who lost his opener
at Norwich two weeks ago. ``But you can see the attitude starting
to change. They're starting to believe in the things we want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the belief was given a big-time booster shot. The
defense, urged on by the vocal support of defensive coordinator
Mark Pizziferri, came up with three turnovers in the second half,
and Curry first had the lead and then a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys played like men today,'' said Nelson, gripping a game
ball presented to him by his team. ``You overcame a lot of
adversity to get here. Today was the first of many (wins).''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was over _ for the moment. Nelson shook hands, posed for
pictures, signed autographs, and made his way back to the locker
room, stopping for a postgame hamburger provided by the father of a
Maine Maritime player.
</P>
<P>
   In the coaches room, sitting around over a bucket of chicken and
some cold beverages, Nelson looked around with a smile of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said quietly. ``Tomorrow at 4:30. We'll look at tape
of Framingham State.''

USC IMPROVES TO 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every time USC schedules a night game, there's the
complaint that East Coast viewers _ and poll voters _ never get a
chance to watch the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it turns out to be a blessing. Like Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans struggled mightily with usual patsy Oregon State at
the Coliseum before defeating the Beavers 40-20 before 45,629. It
was a lot closer than the score indicated _ USC added its final 17
points in the last 2:11 of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   After defeating Oregon State 24 straight times since 1967, the
Trojans (3-0) were in real danger of ending their Pacific-10
Conference record streak for consecutive victories over an
opponent. Worse, the Beavers had not actually defeated USC at the
Coliseum since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the end result, it was clear that this was no normal
Oregon State team that former USC assistant Mike Riley brought into
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   That especially became apparent when ex-quarterback Tim
Alexander returned the second-half kickoff 100 yards to tie the
game, 17-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough pill for us to swallow and I felt we did an
outstanding job of not letting that affect us,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``Once again, in the fourth quarter, I thought we
played our best football. I thought our defense played very, very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most USC-Oregon State encounters, this one had a
competitive feel the entire way until the Beavers got desperate and
made some mistakes in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel kind of bad how the game got away at the end,'' Riley
said. ``We were trying to steal one at the end and we had an
opportunity to still go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had to take advantage of a fumble by Oregon State's
Ken Simonton on a punt return, just to forge ahead 20-17 with 11:03
remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Adam Abrams added a field goal, this one from 33 yards,
at the start of the fourth quarter to give USC a 23-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beavers cut the deficit to 23-20, before the Trojans ran
off the final 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Other than tailback Chad Morton, who rushed for 123 yards, USC's
offense was inconsistent. The special teams were forced to provide
a lift early for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a 7-7 tie early in the second quarter, walk-on Danny
Bravo broke through the line and blocked Mike Fessler's punt. The
ball rolled into the end zone and was recovered by Rashard Cook to
give the Trojans a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game the Trojans blocked a punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' special teams also rebounded in the kicking game,
as Abrams converted a 33-yard field goal in the second quarter to
stretch USC's lead to 17-7.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who was 4 for 4, had gone 0 for 3 on field goals last
week after making 12 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (2-1) answered by driving 63 yards before stalling
at the USC 11-yard line. Jose Cortez kicked a 28-yard field goal
with 47 seconds left in the half to cut the lead to 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   USC appeared to have ended that drive when Cook intercepted a
pass in the end zone, but the Trojans were penalized for roughing
the passer.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Hackett inserted freshman quarterback Carson Palmer
with just under seven minutes left in the first half, but Palmer
got little protection in his opening series and failed to complete
a pass.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't an electrifying start for USC wide receiver R. Jay
Soward, either after he thrilled the fans in his debut against San
Diego State when he tallied 256 total yards. Soward fumbled a punt
return in the first quarter and Oregon State's Darnell Robinson
recovered at the Trojans' 27-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Nine plays later, Oregon State quarterback Terrance Bryant found
James Battle in the end zone on a 5-yard touchdown pass to tie the
game, 7-7. Cook actually tipped the ball in the end zone, before
Battle caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Soward's turnover, the Trojans had been off to a
flawless start.
</P>
<P>
   USC needed less than two minutes to start the scoring. After
Hackett said the Trojans needed to throw deep more often, they did,
as Mike Van Raaphorst hit Larry Parker on a 47-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   It was Parker's first career touchdown in four seasons, and gave
USC a 7-0 lead just 1:42 into the game.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Sept. 12,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

   &UR; TOWARD THE END OF TIME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Updike. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Walden'' gone haywire is the spiritual journal of a
ruthlessly intelligent narrator, 66-year-old Ben Turnbull, who
lives in a bourgeois country mansionette and is given to making
flinty observations about nature and philosophy. The novel,
selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books
of 1997, dwells on both the world of the next century and the
wandering of Ben's wits. ``As memento mori and its obverse, carpe
diem, `Toward the End of Time' could scarcely be bettered,''
Margaret Atwood said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOYHOOD: SCENES FROM PROVINCIAL LIFE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By J.M. Coetzee. Penguin, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   The South African novelist, growing up in a middle-class
Afrikaner household near Cape Town in the 1940s and '50s, was
racked by guilt and fear, and developed an intense sensitivity to
the brutal transactions of power in his tormented country. Last
year our reviewer, Rand Richards Cooper, called this a ``terse,
gritty memoir'' by an author with ``a special gift for dread.'' The
same publisher has reissued a characteristically disturbing novel
by Coetzee,  &UR; AGE OF IRON &LR;  ($12.95), which focuses on a terminally
ill professor who awakens to her complicity with the crumbling
apartheid regime and the rage of a new generation of black youth.
The story ``emerges from its smoky, apocalyptic images as a finely
wrought prophecy ... whose truths cut to the bone,'' Lawrence
Thornton wrote here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABUSE OF POWER: THE NEW NIXON TAPES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Stanley I. Kutler. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17.
</P>
<P>
   In these transcripts of 201 hours of Oval Office tapes released
in 1996, it becomes perfectly clear that Watergate indeed emerged
from Nixon's vindictiveness and that he and his advisers were
strictly amateurs as crooks. ``It makes for spellbinding reading,
and plunges us back into that sordid, astonishing world like
nothing else,'' Joseph Finder said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Francine Prose. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   There is little peace on display in these 11 mordant forays into
the weird jungle of modern life, but several uneasy truces between
characters who are eager to feel something even if they're not sure
what it should be. In 1993 in the Book Review, Ron Carlson called
this ``a smartly observed, deftly written book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUSSIA: PEOPLE AND EMPIRE, 1552-1917 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey Hosking. Harvard University, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   A historian argues that the building of the Russian Empire
impeded the growth of a strong national identity. In other words,
Russians have difficulty feeling Russian unless they rule others.
``The problem Mr. Hosking raises is not new, but he is the first to
explore it in depth,'' Richard Pipes said here last year.  &UR; RUSSIA'S
WAR &LR; , by Richard Overy (Penguin, $14.95), maintains that the
crucial Soviet victory over Nazi Germany was due to the tough
Russian spirit, forged by a bitter climate, harsh working
conditions and Stalin's purges. Earlier this year our reviewer,
Chris Patsilelis, called this a ``penetrating and compassionate
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GROOMING, GOSSIP, AND THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Robin Dunbar. Harvard University, $14.
</P>
<P>
   We are a species of chatterers and snoops, a psychology
professor asserts, and gossip is the human version of primate
grooming -- in fact, without it we might never have bothered to
become social creatures. This is a ``fresh and witty book,''
Natalie Angier wrote here last year. ``Dunbar is a clear thinker
and a polymath.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAGICIAN'S TALE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Hunt. Berkley, $7.50.
</P>
<P>
   In this eerie thriller, written pseudonymously by William Bayer,
a color-blind art photographer combs San Francisco by night to find
the killer of a street hustler who was her only friend. The
heroine's surreal perspective ``shows us light and dark, truth and
deception, reality and illusion ... in ways we never imagined,''
Marilyn Stasio wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BODY PROJECT: AN INTIMATE HISTORY OF AMERICAN GIRLS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Joan Jacobs Brumberg. Vintage, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting 100 years of adolescent true confessions and media
images, the author shows how the concerns of American girls and
their response to their bodies reflect larger cultural changes.
``This is the kind of glorious inside dope that your history
teacher never told you,'' Peggy Orenstein said here last year.
``Women and girls should read this fine book together.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF MAINE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Hood. Picador USA, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne, Elizabeth and Claudia are three ex-hippies whose
impulsive behavior in the 1980s is shaped by their experiences in
the late '60s. The Vietnam War era is ``vividly captured ... in
this accomplished'' first novel, Mary-Ann Tirone Smith wrote here
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OCEAN OF WORDS: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ha Jin. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These tales by a Chinese poet and veteran of the Chinese army
are set along China's border with Russia in the 1970s and feature
soldiers struggling to keep their humanity within the confines of
Maoist ideology. In 1996 our reviewer, Andy Solomon, called the
stories ``powerful in their unity of theme and rich in their
diversity of styles.''

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-UN _ NEW YORK _ As the nation gets ready to judge more
Starr evidence, President Clinton prepares to tell UN General
Assembly how nations must work together to combat global terrorism.
(Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ All Americans will have a chance
to judge whether President Clinton committed perjury in his Aug. 17
testimony to grand jurors on the Monica Lewinski affiar. As a White
House aide calls the new release a ``garbage dump,'' a prominent
senator calls for Clinton to go before the House Judiciary
Committee to tell his story. (Glass, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MORALS _ ATLANTA _ It's not just the President. All
Americans have slipped morally, or so we believe, according to some
recent polls and statistics. That's why we're not as upset about
Clinton as we might be, say ethicists. ``Jesus said it best, let
him without sin cast the first stone,'' says Atlanta area retiree
Larry Travis. But are our standards really lower? We talk about the
perception of a moral dis-ease in the United States, and how it
influences our feelings about the events in Washington. (And we
offer a quick test, to see if your own diet is high in moral
fiber.) (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

<P>
   MEDSCHOOL-ELDERLY (Baltimore) _ A new approach to geriatrics at
Johns Hopkins Medical School has students making house calls and
taking the time to get to know patients. It is far from the high

residents in internal medicine at Hopkins. By Sara Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   AMERINDIAN-TOURISM (Umatilla Reservation, Ore.) _ American
Indian reservations, long considered economic deserts amidst a

only rocked Moscow's political establishment. It has also stirred

Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-POLITICS (Hanover) _ If Gerhard Schroeder has tried to
communicate anything during his long quest to unseat Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, it is that he is worldly and modern. But with
elections just one week away, Schroeder's past is coming back to
haunt him. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-IMAGE (Tokyo) _ Japan is often seen abroad these days as

Congress may step in. By Joel Brinkley.

   ONLINE-MUSIC (Undated) _ After experimenting with audio, video,
live ``webcasts'' and other multimedia technologies, the vanguard
of the new-media recording industry says it is poised to employ the
Internet to radically alter the way tomorrow's artists will be
sold, promoted and even discovered. But like everything on the

</P>
<P>
   PUBLISH-MEDIA (Undated) _ By rather brief tradition, the
literature of choice at the year-old Public Affairs publishing
house, started by Random House refugee Peter Osnos, is intelligent

seeking best-seller profits. So how did it end up with ``The Starr
Report''? By Dorren Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GOODMORNING-MEDIA (Undated) _ For the better part of a
decade, from 1985 to 1995, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' was the
most-watched show in the 7-to-9-a.m. weekday time period. But in
the past two years, it has seen its Nielsen ratings plummet, losing
more than 25 percent of its viewers. The drop hurt ABC's prestige,
but the financial pain is far worse. The downturn at ``Good Morning
America'' came almost directly from efforts to improve it, by
making it newsier and more sophisticated, in keeping with changing
American habits and interests. A look at a show in trouble. By
Lawrie Mifflin.

NEW BRITISH LIBRARY WINS OVER CRITICS

 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``As far as history, there is no history here,'' said
Doris Fletcher, speaking of the new British Library, the sparkling,
soaring building that recently opened near King's Cross to replace
the old library, which oozed tradition in the heart of Bloomsbury.
``We are starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   What Miss Fletcher and others who hold the sought-after reader's
passes to the new library's reading rooms have been pondering since
their surprisingly emotional move across town is this: How do you
weigh history against efficiency? What is better, fading glamour
(and the ghosts of Karl Marx and Virginia Woolf) or modernistic
beauty and a fighting chance of getting the book you need in an
hour, instead of three days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition and history might be helpful,'' said Andrew Wyllie,
who uses the library to study gender in postwar British theater.
``But to have the space to work and easy access to the papers and
books you need is infinitely better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyllie (pronounced WHY-lee) was full of trepidation about the
move, which has been taking place in stages since last fall. He
loved the atmosphere at the old library, which occupied a number of
rooms in the British Museum. He loved the majestic dome in the
Round Reading Room, where he did most of his research and where
Dickens, Thackeray and George Bernard Shaw did much of their
research, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great shame to abandon a purpose-built
library like the one in Bloomsbury,'' he said the other day as he
left the Humanities Reading Room, the replacement for the old Round
Reading Room, in the new library. ``This could have turned into a
disaster. But it's infinitely better. It's light. It's comfortable.
It's cool. And most importantly, it takes an average of an hour
between ordering and getting a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyllie and the library's thousands of other readers were
understandably worried about the new building, which during the 36
years and $843 million from conception to completion often seemed
on its way to becoming one of the biggest white elephants London
had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The library had been buffeted over the years by changing public
tastes, cost overruns, horrendous delays and a cacophony of
complaints, including Prince Charles' sneering dismissal several
years ago when he asked: ``How can you tell it is a library? It has
no character to suggest it is a great public building.''
</P>
<P>
   But the project has undergone an almost complete reversal of
fortune in the last couple of years, and it opened to glorious
reviews. (Parts of the library opened last fall, others in the
spring; the official opening was in the summer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The library is, quite simply, awesome; a great public building
that graces its surroundings, provides us with a unique resource
and even offers a new rendezvous for lovers in London,'' wrote the
usually skeptical author Will Self in The Times of London in May.
He said it made him feel young again. ``Trust me _ say to her/him:
`Meet me at the British Library in King's Cross.' And everything
will go swimmingly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mostly Praise, for the Interior
</P>
<P>
   Visitors have embraced the much-maligned architecture, although
the consensus still seems to be that the red-brick exterior fails
to do justice to the building's glorious interior. ``There's no
real denying that the outside of the building looks like a Tesco,''
said the writer Alain de Botton, referring to one of Britain's
largest supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the architect, Colin St. John Wilson, feels more than
vindicated by the positive response. Prince Charles took a private
tour of the library and was very encouraging (although he failed to
publicly air his compliments, an omission that most likely
irritated Wilson, who attributed his decision last year to close
his design company to the public criticism he had endured over the
library).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the building is beginning to speak for itself,'' said
Wilson, caught by chance the other day as he took some friends on a
tour of his building. ``I never had a doubt, but all the same, it
was a bit like someone coming and spitting in your face. What has
been most gratifying is the way people come up to me and say they
loved the old library and dreaded coming here, and now this is
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of history tells me that the British always do this
to architects,'' he said. ``Wren was put on half pay and sacked
before he finished St. Paul's,'' he said, speaking of Sir
Christopher Wren. ``And that also took 36 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone has been impressed by the imagination and
attention to detail within the building. ``It's a wonderful space,
devoted entirely to a library,'' said the author Lady Antonia
Fraser. ``I think if a library works as a library, that's the
important thing. You don't necessarily have to sit there thinking,
`I'm part of a great tradition.' You would do better to think about
your own work.''
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Spaces, Online Service
</P>
<P>
   One quality that the new library has in spades is space. The
public spaces are enormous, rising up over several levels with
surprising turns and features on each one. Of the four reading
rooms (divided into 11 discrete ``reading areas''), the most
spectacular is the Humanities Reading Room, built on three levels
and lighted, as much of the rest of the building is, by daylight
filtered through the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial lights inside adjust automatically to the amount
of daylight coming in. And, as befits a building devoted to the
written word, there are modern, well-run exhibition galleries to
replace the rather haphazard rooms that used to make up the library
in the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can see one of the four original Magna Cartas, a
Gutenberg Bible and the Diamond Sutra, which dates to A.D. 868 and
is said to be the oldest surviving printed book. They can hear,
using headphones set up around the room, thrilling audio snippets,
including James Joyce reading a passage from ``Finnegans Wake'' and
the earliest known tape of a bird call, from 1889.
</P>
<P>
   And in the exhibition ``Turning the Pages,'' they can
electronically read, for instance, a complete Leonardo da Vinci
notebook, putting their hands on a special computer screen that
flips from one page to another, magnifies and explains key
passages, and even shows what the passages would look like if they
were written the right way around rather than in Leonardo's
trademark mirror writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the old viewing rooms were gloriously jumbled and musty,
the new setting is as sleek and efficient as the inside of an IBM
mainframe,'' wrote Stephen Amidon in The Sunday Times of London
recently. ``The average viewer will find it lends ready access to
items so canonical as to be otherwise unapproachable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the reading rooms, new technology has arrived with a
vengeance. Instead of using the old card catalogs _ thousands of
entries printed out and pasted, quite quaintly, into thick books _
readers order their books from a computer that can tell them if,
for instance, the book they want is already checked out.
</P>
<P>
   When books arrive, delivered by a mechanized system that sends
them from deep within the library on a conveyor belt, readers are
alerted by lights flashing at their desks. The whole thing seems a
great deal easier, even to traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is online and the service is much more efficient,''
said Patricia Demers, a Canadian who has worked in the library for
nearly 20 years, researching English writing in the 16th and 17th
centuries. ``I still yearn for the old creaks, though, and the old
leather-bound printed catalogs. It's just nostalgia, really.''
</P>
<P>
   A Place to Work, Not Gossip
</P>
<P>
   The hardest change to get used to, it seems, is in ambiance. The
new reading rooms seem colder to some, as if intimacy and
weightiness had been lost along with tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't like the fact that the desks seem smaller and
that there are no partitions separating readers. Others grumble
that readers are now allowed to use personal computers (there are
no-computer areas reserved for people who object particularly
strongly). And every reader is worried that the library, running at
a deficit, might have to start charging for reader's passes.
</P>
<P>
   The writer David Lodge misses the old ways. ``I've been
convinced that the new facilities in the library and the ability to
store books safely are a huge improvement over what the old library
could offer,'' he said. ``But I have great nostalgic affection for
the old reading room and fond associations and memories of it. It
was a superb space, and there was something sort of majestic and
appropriate about that great dome, which the more utilitarian
design of the modern building _ though it's elegant and
high-quality _ doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Fletcher said its aura sometimes worked against the old
library, particularly in the reading room devoted to rare books,
where she does her research. The old one, she said, was a
``genteel, exclusive place'' that was used by some people as little
more than a private club.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to come in, not to work, but to gossip and
complain,'' she said. ``In the new library, I don't know why, but
they have disappeared, thank goodness. Now I can sit and put my
nose in my book and study.'' (The old reading room and other spaces
will be absorbed by the British Museum.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, efficiency has won over sentiment. ``I never
understood the mythology of the old library,'' de Botton said. ``It
was extremely inconvenient in terms of getting a book, with all the
endless bits of paper shuffling around. The old room was fantastic,
but it wasn't efficient. When you do research, at the end of the
day, what makes something beautiful is whether or not it works.''

Internet, there is no roadmap to profits in online music. On the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts, two very different pioneers are
blazing divergent paths to the future.

the past two years, it has seen its Nielsen ratings plummet, losing
more than 25 percent of its viewers. The drop hurt ABC's prestige,
but the financial pain is far worse. The downturn at ``Good Morning
America'' came almost directly from efforts to improve it, by
making it newsier and more sophisticated, in keeping with changing
American habits and interests. A look at a show in trouble. By

`BAG OF BONES': DEATH, TERROR AND WRITER'S BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King seems to me most frightening when the monsters in
his stories are psychological instead of supernatural, when they
haunt the subconscious instead of the cellar. (See ``Misery,''
``Dolores Claiborne,'' ``Gerald's Game'' and several of his
novellas and short stories.)
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, his latest tale of horror, ``Bag of Bones,''
gets off to a most promising start. On a very hot day in August
1994, Mike Noonan, a best-selling novelist, casually says goodbye
to his wife, Johanna, as she leaves their house in Derry, Me., to
run a shopping errand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I saw her, she was on TV,'' Noonan, the novel's
narrator, reports. ``That's how you identify the dead here in Derry
_ no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles on the
walls and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out
of a chilly drawer on casters; you just go into an office marked
PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope.'' Jo has died
suddenly of a brain aneurysm, and, almost as bad, she turns out to
have been newly pregnant with the couple's first child, a girl they
would have named Kia.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is naturally devastated by his loss. Jo was his best friend
and they had tried for a long time to conceive a child. He finds
himself weeping uncontrollably and even after the normal mourning
period he remains uninterested in making new friends. Worse, he can
no longer write the novels that have made him a modest millionaire.
(His genre is ``Lovely Young Woman on Her Own Meets Fascinating
Stranger.'')
</P>
<P>
   Every time he sits down in front of his word processor he is
seized with such terror that he sometimes even vomits. He hides his
problem from his agent and his publisher and to keep up with their
demands he's forced to draw on the surplus of manuscripts he has
stored in a bank vault. After four years of this he begins to think
his writing career may be over. ``The bookberry tree had died,'' he
reflects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag of Bones'' is full of references to writers, nearly 40 of
them by my rough count, from Daphne du Maurier to George Seferis,
Guy de Maupassant to Mary Higgins Clark, Tom Clancy to Somerset
Maugham. Even King's title, ``Bag of Bones,'' is partly a literary
reference. Although Noonan has never confirmed the attribution, he
believes that it was the English novelist Thomas Hardy who said,
``Compared to the dullest human being actually walking about on the
face of the earth and casting his shadow there, the most
brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones.'' (Of
course this has a more macabre and literal meaning in the novel as
well.)
</P>
<P>
   So you quickly come to expect that Noonan's block is the prelude
to a major exploration of the writer's unconscious, which would be
particularly fascinating coming from King, considering the terror
of his turn of mind and the rate at which its material spills out.
You think it most significant that one of the novel's epigraphs
comes from Melville's ``Bartleby,'' the novella about a scrivener
who lays down his pen and utters the famous words, ``I prefer not
to.''
</P>
<P>
   As events turn out, this is not the direction in which ``Bag of
Bones'' is headed. Instead, Noonan begins to have a repeated awful
nightmare about the lakeside house called Sara Laughs that he and
Jo used to summer at in western Maine. When he decides that the
only way to solve his block and end his nightmare is to go back to
Sara Laughs, he becomes embroiled in everything supernatural from
poltergeists to telepathy to telekinesis to time travel.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at his summer home, Noonan meets a charming 3-year-old
girl named Kyra (a name too close for comfort to that of his own
unborn Kia). Mysterious forces seem to want to kill her to avenge
some community crime in the distant past involving the black woman,
Sara Tidwell, for whom Sara Laughs was named. As Noonan confronts
these forces, the story rises to a powerful crescendo in which the
most far-fetched plot contrivances willingly do King's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as impressive as it may be, the story leaves you with the
feeling that it is an afterthought tacked on as a way of avoiding
whatever the novel's subject started out to be. Underneath and a
little off to the side is the theme that King has introduced but
never quite comes to grips with, namely the sources of the impulse
to write and whatever stimulates or impedes them.
</P>
<P>
   These are touched on repeatedly: in several more references to
Melville's ``Bartleby''; in an account of how Hardy ``stopped
writing novels himself after finishing `Jude the Obscure' and while
he was at the height of his narrative genius,'' and in several of
Noonan's comments about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrives at Sara Laughs, he finds that Jo had been there
before she died and that, unbeknown to him, she had been writing
something of her own. This both disturbs him and enables him to
begin writing again. But he does so without much pleasure. ``I
wrote until midnight came,'' he reports. ``By then the thunder had
faded away but the heat held on, as oppressive as a blanket. I
turned off the IBM and went to bed . . . thinking, so far as I can
remember, nothing at all. . . . The writing had burned off all
thoughts of the real world, at least temporarily. I think that, in
the end, that's what it's for. Good or bad, it passes the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a typically out-sized performance by King, this ambivalence
toward his craft pervades mysteriously. It makes you wonder if with
Melville's Bartleby he is saying about his work, ``I prefer not
to.'' It makes you wish that he had confronted in ``Bag of Bones''
what his novel seems really to be about.

AUTHOR QUESTIONS THE EXISTENCE OF `DEEP THROAT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man known as Deep Throat is a singular figure in American
culture, credited with being the source of explosive articles
written by the reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they
unraveled the Nixon administration's abuses of power. Named for a
pornographic movie, this furtive truth-teller may be the first
pseudonymous American hero not conceived in a comic book.
</P>
<P>
   Unmasking the man who met Bob Woodward in underground garages in
the book and the film version of ``All the President's Men'' has
been an intermittent journalistic quest.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Obst, the former literary agent for Woodward and
Bernstein, writes in a new book that Deep Throat was a composite, a
plot device to fit the narrative needs of the book and the film.
Deep Throat's information was often bad, Obst said, and his
melodramatic warnings that Woodward and Bernstein's lives were in
danger were fantastical.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to get people talking. Obst, who has been a Hollywood
screenwriter, writes in his book ``Too Good to Be Forgotten,'' that
Deep Throat ``has still not come forward to be hailed as a great
American hero. He can't, because he does not exist.'' Deep Throat,
he writes, was not mentioned in the original book proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The thinly defended claim is a minor part of ``Too Good to Be
Forgotten.'' In an interview, Obst said, ``I am not a Watergate
scholar.'' But renewing questions about Deep Throat, in a year of
another wrenching presidential crisis and of numerous journalistic
missteps, is likely to get more buzz than the author's adventures
as a protester at the 1968 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Obst's claim is less important than his real contributions, such
as supporting the journalist Seymour Hersh's efforts to bring the
My Lai massacre to light when Obst was head of the Dispatch News
Service. But it is a better sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, asked about Obst's claims, said, ``Everybody should
have their say.'' He added, ``We are in a culture where everyone
who was at some event becomes an insider with a theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Obst was in a hotel across town. He never saw the drafts
of the book. He was never consulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward added that Obst ``was using his standing as our former
agent to say this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately you would think, `He's an insider, close to
everything, involved in everything.' He wasn't,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   Obst is now a visiting scholar in religious studies at the
University of California at Santa Barbara. He said he wanted his
say, 24 years after the book came out, because ``if there wasn't a
Deep Throat, a great disservice has been done to a generation of
kids who got into journalism for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got angry,'' he added in an interview, ``because I went back
and watched ``All the President's Men.'' And I said to myself,
``Here's a whole generation of kids who believes that the United
States government went after Carl and Bob. I think it's just wrong
to make a group of kids think that the government does things like
that. We have so much cynicism in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being cynical about the government, he is cynical
about journalists. Obst, when asked about his evidence for saying
the two reporters engaged in manipulative deception, said: ``I do
not have a smoking gun. But I have a lot of hot pistols.''
</P>
<P>
   These include the difficulty of seeing from the street the
apartment balcony where Woodward kept the flowerpot used to signal
his need for a meeting with his source. He also said that another
of his clients, John Dean, flatly denied Deep Throat's report that
President Nixon personally threatened Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the dramatic contours of the book and the film have
been called distorted by those with front-row seats on the early
coverage of the Watergate scandal. Barry Sussman, the former city
editor of The Washington Post who wrote ``The Great Coverup'' said
in an interview: ``The importance of The Washington Post in the
Nixon demise was exaggerated. It served a clear and important role,
just not as much of a role as was given it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the myth that Deep Throat was so important,''
he added, ``there was not much to what we did except being
stenographers.'' Still, Sussman does believe that this ``bit
player'' was real.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's irritation at his old friend Obst is clear.
``Probably David was at his best when he was on acid,'' he said
acidly. (In the book, Obst writes that he had been fed a
hallucinogenic drug just before he persuaded the former Simon &AMP;
Schuster editor Richard Snyder to buy ``All the President's Men.'')
</P>
<P>
   Woodward added that Obst ``only raised one good point: Why don't
we know now, so many years later, who it is?''
</P>
<P>
   At a separate moment, he said: ``I would love to tell you who
the source is. But the arrangement is no. I can't and I'm not going
to'' until the source releases Woodward from his pledge of
confidentiality, or dies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given the hunger of news outlets for audiences, the controversy
attendant on Obst's debunking of Deep Throat may be irresistible.
Like a spaceship using a large planet's gravity as a slingshot,
accelerating it to speeds it could not achieve on its own, Obst
gets a boost from the sheer heft of the history he sets out to
amend. That he makes only a glancing effort to prove his case will
probably matter little.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the short chapter containing these claims, Obst
said, ``The basic concern regarding Deep Throat, however, is best
stated by Friedrich Nietzsche, who warned us that those who fight
monsters should see to it that in the process they do not become
monsters themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As less profound minds have said, ``Right backatcha.''

SPEAKING OF REEKING: LOUD MUSIC STINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of things you can get at Seattle's Bumbershoot
Festival besides an acute hearing disorder.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn about art, poetry, nutrition and history. And that
is true despite the fact I was not able to purchase a 40-clove
garlic chicken sandwich from The Stinking Rose on Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were other food vendors shoveling out garlic by the
bushel. And with each bite, garlic lovers learned a bit more about
art, literature, nutrition and history. Culture was oozing out our
pores.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when I purchased my garlic chicken sandwich from
The Stinking Rose booth, I also received a garlic fact sheet from
the San Francisco eatery of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that the prophet Mohammed recommended garlic as a cure
for snake and scorpion bites. Laborers who built the pyramids were
fueled by radishes, onions and garlic. And garlic was entombed with
King Tut, along with a jillion dollars worth of jewels.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks believed garlic promoted supernatural powers.
The residents of Transylvania swear that garlic wards off vampires.
Our colonial ancestors put garlic in the shoes of whooping cough
sufferers. Other adherents insist garlic improves the voice, the
intellect, the complexion and the union of fractured bones and
kills intestinal worms.
</P>
<P>
   What I really wanted to know during Bumbershoot weekend is
whether garlic does anything for the kind of temporary deafness
caused by electric guitars amplified by speakers the size of cargo
containers.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, recipes like these might help.
</P>
<P>
   King Tut's Chicken
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 pounds chicken pieces, skinned
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 grinding of black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 cups plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half teaspoons turmeric
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   Rub the chicken pieces with garlic, oregano and pepper. Combine
remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken and moosh around
until all the pieces are covered with some of the marinade. Cover
and refrigerate for a day.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 hours, if the hungry customers are still standing in
line, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove chicken pieces from
marinade and place in single layer of a large oven dish or pan.
Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Remove foil, turn pieces and
bake 30 minutes more, basting occasionally, until lightly browned.
Serves four to six.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic-chicken Fried Rice
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound fillet of chicken breast
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup low-fat ham, cut into thin sticks
</P>
<P>
   4 cups cooked white rice, cooled
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, cut into thin sticks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen peas
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced ginger root
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   Combine the broth, soy sauce and vinegar in a small bowl and
will somebody please turn down that infernal hi-fi? You can't
properly eat or cook Chinese food within five city blocks of an
electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a pot of water to a boil. Put the carrot sticks in a sieve
and immerse in the hot water for 30 seconds. Remove and drain. Put
the peas in the same sieve and dunk into the boiling water for 10
seconds. Remove and drain. Add some salt to the boiling water and
drop in the chicken breast. Reduce heat and poach the chicken until
the meat is no longer pink inside when sliced in half. Remove and
cut into cubes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the oil,
then toss in the ham sticks and stir-fry for a minute or so. Add
the garlic and ginger and cook 15 seconds. Add the rice, green
onions and carrot. Cook 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in the beaten egg in a thin stream and stir. Add the
soy-vinegar sauce. When the rice has absorbed most of the liquid,
stir in the chicken and peas. Stir-cook another 30 seconds until
hot. Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   As they say around the Stinking Rose: ``It's chic to reek!''

TV NETWORKS UNDER MORE PRESSURE AS SEASON BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For network programming executives, the start of a new
television season is always intense because the stakes are so high.
But to hear them tell it, the debuts of 36 new series this season
have become something akin to the landing on Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like the opening scene of `Private Ryan,''' said
Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment. ``You have
to keep your head down and move carefully and with consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving forward is what the season, which officially begins
Monday night, is all about for the six networks now squeezing shows
onto the already densely crowded landing area of prime time.
Crunched by escalating costs for programming and the drift of
viewers to cable channels and other entertainment choices, the
executives in charge of programming recognize the urgent need to
show some sign of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   That may be all that determines the condition of their networks
when the ultimate tally of the success or failure of this season is
made next June by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Last June they committed about $6.5 billion to the network
prime-time schedules being introduced this month, but that was
little or no increase over the previous year. It was, however,
considered a good showing in light of the widespread expectations
that the networks, with their ever-declining audience shares, would
finally start to see some fall-off in their annual take from
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   As the new season begins, concerns about where the business is
heading are everywhere. One senior network executive, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``I've told people at the network
that the next 18 months will be the ugliest in the history of this
business. What there is in the air is desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The desperation, the executive said, is reflected in deals like
the $13 million an episode Time Warner's Warner Bros. was able to
get NBC to pay for more episodes of ``E.R.,'' television's biggest
hit _ as well as by the fact that of the six networks spending
millions on programs to catch the increasingly diverted attention
of viewers, only one, NBC, a unit of General Electric, has been
taking in significant profits.
</P>
<P>
   But even NBC announced cost-cutting measures last week,
including 200 to 300 layoffs because of an anticipated drop in the
$500 million the network made in profit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the enormous price increase for ``E.R.'' (NBC had only
been paying about $2 million an episode for the series) NBC faces
its first season in almost a decade without ``Seinfeld.'' It also
will not have the World Series or Super Bowl this season as it did
last. All of which is reason for Littlefield to assert that if NBC
holds its own this season, it will be ``a remarkable achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC had an enormous margin over any other network in terms of
both the total viewers and the 18-to-49-year-old group that
dominates most television advertising budgets, so even finishing
flat for the year would mean the network had a successful year.
</P>
<P>
   For every other network, however, a flat year will not be good
enough. ``Improvement'' is the word most used by the executives
responsible for the prime-time schedule this season. Publicly they
are trying to bury that erosion story. Three network program
executives _ Stu Bloomberg at ABC, Leslie Moonves at CBS and Peter
Roth at Fox _ said, more or less, that there is no way they won't
be better this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg predicted flatly that Walt Disney's ABC, which has
slid sharply the last three seasons, will end the season up from
last season, citing the earlier start of ``Monday Night Football,''
which gives it three hours of prime time; the reconstruction of
Sunday night around two shows, ``20/20'' and ``The Practice,''
instead of a movie, and enhanced programs on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Moonves went out on a limb, saying CBS will
``definitely do better'' among the younger viewer categories
important to advertisers _ an area where that network has suffered
in recent years. He cited the network's acquisition of professional
football, a new Monday lineup of shows, and ``Martial Law,'' about
a Chinese police officer who is a martial arts expert, which he
hopes will be a cult hit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Roth noted that Fox, a subsidiary of News Corp., will have the
World Series and Super Bowl this season. His plan for improvement
also includes establishing some new comedies, especially ``That
'70s Show'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no network is more confident of improving fortunes than
WB, which made major strides last season by introducing ``Dawson's
Creek,'' a hit with teen-agers. Jamie Kellner, that network's chief
executive, said, ``We've had a three-year record of growth, 63
percent in audience over that time and we think we'll easily keep
that up this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons: ``Felicity,'' the season's most highly
publicized new series, which is expected to score another bulls-eye
with that network's youthful target audience.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the other would-be new network, UPN, whose
president, Dean Valentine, said, ``The goal is to change the trend
line and get it pointing upward.'' He is counting on dramas like
``Legacy'' and ``Seven Days'' to change the image of the struggling
UPN _ a joint venture of Viacom and Chris-Craft, which he said,
``has gotten a reputation for being synonymous with bad programming
_ not a brand I'd like to develop.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the hope for hits springs eternal. The executives also know
that the business has to change in some fundamental ways. ``There
is a very serious quest to find a new economic model,'' said Jamie
Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment. Mainly, she said, the
networks have to find programs that cost less.
</P>
<P>
   Finding ways to add new programs in summer has become a crusade
of sorts for Roth of Fox, who noted that the way networks introduce
shows, with a big glut in the fall, is a self-defeating
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   Fox tried introducing more of its shows before this week with
mixed results. UPN has pushed most of its premieres off into
October. Some shows like ``The X-Files'' won't be back with new
episodes until November.

CLINTON URGED TO CONFRONT IMPEACHMENT PANEL
</HEADLINE>
 BC-  By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Democratic senator called on President
Clinton Sunday to respond to the airing of his videotaped grand
jury testimony on Monday by going before Congress and directly
facing the question of whether he should be impeached for having
lied to the nation about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, who is weighing his own run for the White House in
2000, said Clinton should ``rapidly'' explain to the House
Judiciary Committee ``exactly what he did and exactly what he was
thinking'' in triggering the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's vote and let's move on one way or the other,'' Kerry
added, ``but the nation is being ill served by this political water
torture that's taking place in a highly calculated, highly partisan
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's call to lance the White House crisis by an early
confrontation Capitol Hill came as four cable news channels
prepared to run the full unfiltered footage of Clinton's Aug. 17
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN, CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC each announced they
would show a complete tape of the testimony, which runs more than
four hours, simultaneously with its release, at about 9 a.m. (EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Along with the grand jury tape _ whose release marks a historic
turning point in the annals of politics and television _ the
Republican-led House panel voted to make public seven volumes of
supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   It will be uploaded to Internet sites, which already feature the
initial 445-page impeachment report to Congress by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, and several rebuttals by Clinton's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The new material becomes available even as 69 percent of
respondents to a CBS News poll released on Sunday said it was
unnecessary to make the videotape public and with 59 percent
feeling the House panel weighing impeachment acted to embarrass the
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CBS survey, 56 percent of Americans believe
Clinton should be censured by Congress, while 37 percent favor his
resignation _ a slight rise from last week's numbers. The poll had
an error margin of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents are expected to include:
</P>
<P>
   _ More evidence on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton, which led to the current presidential crisis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transcripts of Lewinsky's appearances before the grand jury
and her roughly 20 interviews with the FBI, as well as a record of
her visits to the White House, the gifts she and the president
exchanged and the phone calls they made to one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excerpts from Lewinsky's personal diary and a detailed lab
analysis of the tests that identified the president's semen on
Lewinsky's navy blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's chief defenders, White House deputy chief
of staff John Podesta, predicted on ``Meet the Press'' that this
fresh outpouring of evidence would disgust most Americans and spawn
a political backlash against the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided that rather than just doing a document dump, they
would do a garbage dump on Monday, and I think people are going to
wonder about that,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr noted in his original report, Clinton in his testimony
repeatedly falls back on a prepared statement that White House
lawyers have given to several news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Starr maintains was an overt act of perjury, Clinton told the
prosecutors and grand jurors:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in
early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was
wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse, they
did not constitute sexual relations as I understood that term to be
defined at my January 17, 1998 [Jones'] deposition. But they did
involve inappropriate intimate contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These inappropriate encounters ended at my insistence, in
early 1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that what began as friendship came to include this
conduct and I take full responsibility for my actions. While I will
provide the grand jury whatever other information I can, because of
privacy considerations affecting my family, myself and others and
in an effort to preserve the dignity of the office I hold, this is
all I will say about the specifics of these particular matters.''

MARKET GYRATIONS CAUSE ANXIETY IN SILICON ALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In contrast to politics, in the world of
entrepreneurs, going public has fabulously positive connotations.
Many founders of start-ups set their sights on taking their
companies public before even filing their incorporation papers.
</P>
<P>
   Going public is how their investors make back their money _ and,
hopefully, then some. It is how entrepreneurs achieve real wealth,
if only on paper. It is how they will be judged for years to come.
It is the consummate measure of business success or failure.
</P>
<P>
   So consider the anxiety of Silicon Alley entrepreneurs like Jack
Hidary, Todd Krizelman, Stephan Paternot and Alan Andreini. All
four run high-profile Internet companies that filed papers in the
summer with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public.
All have, to this point, capitalized on the innovation and
excitement of the Internet and helped to define the amorphous New
York new-media industry that has come to be known as Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   But as the stock market continues to vacillate, all these men
face a quandary: to go or not to go. They have arrived at the ball
only to discover that the orchestra is taking a break.
</P>
<P>
   In all, six new-media companies in the New York area have filed
for public offerings, including Hidary's Earthweb, Krizelman's and
Paternot's theglobe.com and Andreini's Interworld, plus two New
York companies, Multex and Net Grocer, and All-Tech Investment
Group of Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Under the SEC's quiet-period rules, the executives of those
companies are prohibited from discussing their situations, but
speculation in the Alley has been rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that are in registration now will wait if they can do
so,'' predicted John Siracuse, vice president and head of East
Coast Internet banking for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
``They don't want to be the first to test the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the go/no-go question, Siracuse observes,
is that the window of opportunity is diminishing as the holiday
season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for small-cap companies to get the investors'
attention between Thanksgiving and Christmas,'' he said. If
companies wait until the new year to go public, he continued, they
will have logistical issues, like having to update their
prospectuses, but more important, they will have to wrangle with
the perception that they were not ready to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perception is reality,'' he said. ``And there will be the
perception they couldn't get the deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cohen, head of Internet research at Merrill Lynch,
believes many companies will turn to mergers and acquisitions. He
notes that mergers and acquisitions have been increasing in the
last six to 12 months anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And while there have been virtually no technology offerings in
the last few weeks, Cohen said, ``The landscape for Internet IPOs
has shifted, but the window is still open for high-quality
companies with compelling business models _ models such as
community and e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to see properties with components of high
functionality and high intellectual property,'' he said, saying
that theglobe.com is an example of a community site where users
create a wealth of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists see the recent correction in technology
stocks as a much-needed dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hirschfeld, a principal at Patricof &AMP; Co. Ventures Inc.,
which has interests in Alley-based Medscape Inc. and New
Jersey-based Audible Inc., says that the current market has not
diminished his firm's interest in the Internet and new-media
start-ups. But, he added, ``It does have an impact on price
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the market, Hirschfeld says, brings a sense of
sanity to private market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   But it also leaves pre-public Silicon Alley companies in a
precarious position. If they are hard-pressed for cash, they may
have to turn to their original investors or go for a private
placement. They may have to pull their public offerings altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Siracuse adds that delayed initial public offerings can cause
problems back at the office. ``Employees who have other
opportunities may decide to leave the company,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A big issue for Silicon Alley is the fact that it is still being
judged by the number of successful public offerings. Each one is
tallied as younger companies continue to try to lure venture
capital from the West Coast, and to garner the respect of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Siracuse agrees with Cohen that while the outlook may not be
peaches and cream, neither is it liver and onions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still an appetite for Internet stocks,'' he said.
``What the market needs is a high-profile Internet stock to go out
and do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock needs to sell out at its offering, Siracuse said, and
then continue to sell well in the after market.
</P>
<P>
   As for those companies that had already gone public, many
star-struck entrepreneurs and their option-holding employees found
out what their investors already knew: What goes up must come down.
Double Click Inc., an Internet advertising network and an Alley
favorite, watched its stock drop from more than $50 a share in July
to $23 last week. It closed Friday at $19.69.
</P>
<P>
   Double Click's chief competitor, 24/7 Media Inc., TFSM went
public in mid-August, opening at $18.50 and closing at $20.25. Last
week, its stock was selling below $12. It closed Friday at $11.56.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Alley stocks that saw their share prices drop into
single digits were N2K Inc., the owner of Music Boulevard, and
Cyber Shop Inc., an online mall.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cohen, who has been following Silicon Alley companies
for the last three years, first as an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, then at the Union Bank of Switzerland, remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Alley has come to be populated with good companies and
intelligent people and will continue to be a source of investment
ideas going forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Music to the ears of New York's high-technology entrepreneurs.

CLINTON URGED TO CONFRONT IMPEACHMENT PANEL
</HEADLINE>
 BC- LEDE   Includes minor editing fix in 17th graf 
 By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Democratic senator called on President
Clinton Sunday to respond to the airing of his videotaped grand
jury testimony on Monday by going before Congress and directly
facing the question of whether he should be impeached for having
lied to the nation about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, who is weighing his own run for the White House in
2000, said Clinton should ``rapidly'' explain to the House
Judiciary Committee ``exactly what he did and exactly what he was
thinking'' in triggering the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's vote and let's move on one way or the other,'' Kerry
added, ``but the nation is being ill served by this political water
torture that's taking place in a highly calculated, highly partisan
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's call to lance the White House crisis by an early
confrontation Capitol Hill came as four cable news channels
prepared to run the full unfiltered footage of Clinton's Aug. 17
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN, CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC each announced they
would show a complete tape of the testimony, which runs more than
four hours, simultaneously with its release, at about 9 a.m. (EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Along with the grand jury tape _ whose release marks a historic
turning point in the annals of politics and television _ the
Republican-led House panel voted to make public seven volumes of
supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   It will be uploaded to Internet sites, which already feature the
initial 445-page impeachment report to Congress by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, and several rebuttals by Clinton's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The new material becomes available even as 69 percent of
respondents to a CBS News poll released on Sunday said it was
unnecessary to make the videotape public and with 59 percent
feeling the House panel weighing impeachment acted to embarrass the
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CBS survey, 56 percent of Americans believe
Clinton should be censured by Congress, while 37 percent favor his
resignation _ a slight rise from last week's numbers. The poll had
an error margin of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The new documents are expected to include:
</P>
<P>
   _ More evidence on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton, which led to the current presidential crisis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transcripts of Lewinsky's appearances before the grand jury
and her roughly 20 interviews with the FBI, as well as a record of
her visits to the White House, the gifts she and the president
exchanged and the phone calls they made to one another.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excerpts from Lewinsky's personal diary and a detailed lab
analysis of the tests that identified the president's semen on
Lewinsky's navy blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's chief defenders, White House deputy chief
of staff John Podesta, predicted on ``Meet the Press'' that this
fresh outpouring of evidence would disgust most Americans and spawn
a political backlash against the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided that rather than just doing a document dump, they
would do a garbage dump on Monday, and I think people are going to
wonder about that,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr noted in his original report, Clinton in his testimony
repeatedly falls back on a prepared statement that White House
lawyers have given to several news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In what Starr maintains was an overt act of perjury, Clinton
told the prosecutors and grand jurors:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in
early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was
wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse, they
did not constitute sexual relations as I understood that term to be
defined at my January 17, 1998 [Jones'] deposition. But they did
involve inappropriate intimate contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These inappropriate encounters ended at my insistence, in
early 1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that what began as friendship came to include this
conduct and I take full responsibility for my actions. While I will
provide the grand jury whatever other information I can, because of
privacy considerations affecting my family, myself and others and
in an effort to preserve the dignity of the office I hold, this is
all I will say about the specifics of these particular matters.''

PENDING ACCOUNTING CHANGES COULD COST STUDIOS MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's accounting rule makers have tentatively approved
new financial reporting standards for the film industry that could
cost some Hollywood studios hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, movie studios have been able to use the
current accounting rules to create their own special effects.
Almost like magic, the rules have allowed some studios to show
profits even when films flop. Often, they do this by postponing the
recognition of advertising or film production costs far into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules _ still subject to final approval from the
Financial Accounting Standards Board and from the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants _ would have the biggest
impact on studios that have been most aggressive in their
interpretations of the accounting rules. Those studios include
Columbia Pictures, which is owned by Sony Corp.; Paramount
Pictures, owned by Viacom Inc.; 20th Century Fox, owned by News
Corp., and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, owned by the billionaire Kirk
Kerkorian.
</P>
<P>
   The rules would also apply to the producers of television shows,
but not to cable companies or broadcasters, which follow other
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies would not have to adopt the new rules until 2000.
But David Londoner, an entertainment industry analyst at Schroder
Inc. and a member of the group that wrote the new rules, said he
expected many studios to begin following them next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rules ``will essentially place all film companies on an
equal footing,'' said Londoner, who has been pushing for the
changes for a decade. The present rules have frustrated analysts
because one movie studio cannot easily be compared with another and
because the studios have been able to use the accounting to
accelerate revenues and delay expenses _ practices not allowed in
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspicions about film accounting will finally be
eliminated,'' Londoner said.
</P>
<P>
   Most studio executives said they could not yet comment in detail
about the proposed rules, which the Financial Accounting Standards
Board gave preliminary approval to on Friday. But some executivs
disputed Londoner's estimates that the movie industry as a whole
would be forced to write off $2 billion and each major studio would
write off $150 million to $450 million when the new rules are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any estimates of the impact are inaccurate, premature and very
speculative,'' a spokesman for Paramount Pictures said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, movie studios, unlike almost all other businesses, can
spend millions of dollars on advertising and spread those costs
over a number of years, avoiding an immediate dent in their bottom
lines. The studios have been often able to argue that the films
have useful lives of many years, even if the movies bomb at box
offices in the United States. After all, they argue, foreign
audiences are bound to love the film and there is always money to
be made selling home videos or the syndication rights to
television.
</P>
<P>
   But the studios are also able to avoid showing losses for film
projects that executives simply decide to abandon. Under the
current rules, the studios can call the costs of those abandoned
films ``overhead'' and gradually charge those costs to future
movies.
</P>
<P>
   And when a studio sells the syndication rights to a film or
television show to another broadcaster, it can report all of the
revenue almost immediately, even though it may be years before the
cash is received, the shows are broadcast and all of the film
production expenses are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Such syndication contracts are often worth hundreds of millions
of dollars. For example, Warner Brothers, which is owned by Time
Warner Inc., is expected to book more than $200 million in the near
future from the syndication of the television show ``Friends,''
Londoner said. If the new rules were already in place, much of that
amount would not be earned this year.
</P>
<P>
   The studios now have three months to comment on the rules, which
were written by a task force at the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants. That group and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board have been critical of the movie studios' delays in
posting advertising expenses, so it is unlikely that the companies
could argue against the proposed rule change that would force them
to write off promotional expenses within three months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the new rules become effective, the companies will have to
write off most of the advertising costs that remain on their books.
And, they will also probably have to reverse any revenue for the
syndication rights of films that have not yet been broadcast on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Howells, chief financial officer at Sony Pictures
Entertainment, said the company was concerned about portions of the
proposal, especially the change in the accounting for the sale of
syndication rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Howells refused to comment on Londoner's estimate that the
new rules would cause Sony to take a one-time charge of more than
$250 million against its earnings and reduce earnings for Sony's
Columbia and Tri-Star studios by as much as 10 percent in the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   And Sony, as have the other studios being criticized for their
aggressive accounting, says that it is doing nothing wrong. ``There
is not anything in our accounting that is in violation of current
pronouncements.'' Howells said.
</P>
<P>
   The current accounting rules for the film industry were written
in 1981. And, at first, the rules worked, with most studios quickly
reducing revenues for the costs of producing a film. But later, the
studios began to interpret the accounting rules in a way that
allowed them to spend lavish amounts on items like advertising and
then delay for years the effect on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just got out of hand,'' Londoner said.
</P>
<P>
   The perils of this accounting were very evident at Livent Inc.,
the theater company that brought shows like ``Ragtime'' and
``Showboat'' to Broadway. Livent, which is based in Toronto,
follows Canadian accounting rules that are very similar to those
now used by the Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Livent executives have repeatedly surprised
investors with announcements that they would have to reduce their
income by tens of millions of dollars. Those amounts consisted of
advertising and production costs for shows that were not selling
enough tickets to recover their lavish expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Several small, troubled movie studios, among them Carolco
Pictures and Orion Pictures, also took advantage of the current
rules in the 1980s to try to inflate their profits.

FTC `LOSING PATIENCE' WITH BUSINESS ON WEB PRIVACY

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a year of heated debate within the
government, the Federal Trade Commission has all but decided that
it is going to part company with the Clinton administration over
the contention that business can regulate itself when it comes to
Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing patience with self-regulation,'' David Medine,
an associate director in the commission's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said in an interview, reflecting the larger agency
opinion on this issue. ``It's too bad, but I think industry has
lost the opportunity to show that they will do it on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   What was the last straw? Within the FTC, they called it ``the
Big Surf.''
</P>
<P>
   From all corners of the agency's headquarters in the spring,
dozens of lawyers trooped to special training rooms equipped with
personal computers and high-speed Internet connections. And for two
weeks, they spent their days trolling the World Wide Web, searching
for privacy problems.
</P>
<P>
   Their intention was to find Web sites that collected personal
information from visitors but neglected to post any notice about
how that information would be used. The presumption was that many
of the companies sold the information _ some of it highly personal
data on health, income and personal preferences _ to Internet-list
brokers, merchants and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``surfers'' had no idea what they would find; no one had
ever dedicated the time and manpower needed for this sort of
targeted survey of the vast, tangled, largely unfathomable network
that is the World Wide Web. But the Big Surf produced startling
results published in a report this summer. More than 90 percent of
the roughly 1,400 sites examined collected personal information
from visitors, but only 14 percent of them disclosed how that
information would be used, convincing the FTC that formal
regulation would probably be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Clinton White House had been saying
that businesses using the Internet should be allowed to regulate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever an arena that should be market driven, this is
it,'' Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's adviser on Internet
issues, said as the White House announced its Internet policy last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the White House was formulating this strategy, a few
blocks away at the FTC _ an independent federal agency not beholden
to the administration _ agency officials were conducting hearings
and workshops on Internet privacy, listening to complaints from
members of Congress and interest groups. They were also installing
up-to-date computer equipment so the agency could carry out the Big
Surf and add the Internet to the list of business arenas subject to
FTC scrutiny and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with results from the Big Surf and the industry's reaction
to it in hand, several senior FTC officials said, the agency will
give industry just a few more months to respond to the
recommendations in its report by demonstrating that it is
effectively regulating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Medine said he would expect the industry to conduct a survey
like the Big Surf and hand over the results. If, as most commission
officials expect, industry does not provide such proof, the FTC
will draft a bill calling for clear Internet privacy standards and
ask Congress to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent agency, the commission does not have to get
permission from the Clinton administration to do this. And, given
Congress' repeated statements of concern about Internet privacy, a
bill would probably get the votes needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our intention to over-regulate,'' said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the agency's consumer protection bureau.
``We don't want to chill new technologies.'' But, she added, Web
sites must begin ``telling consumers if they are collecting
personal information, what they are going to do with it and how the
consumers can get out of it, if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, that means posting a privacy statement that answers
these questions. But since the results of the Big Surf were
published in June, commission lawyers have begun to believe that
some Web sites are actually choosing not to post privacy
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's now a perverse, reverse incentive,'' said Ori Lev, an
FTC official involved in Internet enforcement. ``If you don't post
a privacy policy, we can't go after you.''
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last month, after the commission reached a
settlement with Geocities, a popular site on the World Wide Web
that the commission had accused of lying to its 2 million
subscribers. The site offered a privacy statement that promised not
to give out personal information collected during registration
without permission. But the commission found that Geocities was
selling the information anyway. That supposed deception was the
basis for the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   If Geocities had not promised to keep the information private,
then it would probably not have run afoul of the FTC. As a result,
Medine said, ``clearly there are a lot of corporate lawyers
advising their Web clients not to do anything now'' _ not to post a
privacy statement or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Connie LaMotta, a senior vice president with the Direct
Marketing Association, calls that idea nonsense. ``It's a very
bureaucratic way of thinking,'' she said. ``It's upside down.
Businesses want to post privacy statements to establish good
customer relationships and customer service. Industry is stepping
up to the plate on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaMotta said she and others in the industry agreed with the
FTC's stated Internet privacy goals. But Ms. LaMotta added that she
was certain that businesses could accomplish the task on their own.
``It's our experience that, when you tap them on the shoulder,
change happens. They say: `Oh, gosh. OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   With just a few minutes' effort, most anyone can find a Web site
that collects personal information from visitors, in registration
or order forms, without disclosing how that information will be
used. But how those sites respond when asked about this can differ
markedly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A site called Soccer Patch (www.soccerpatch.com) is a trading
post for soccer-playing children who want to trade team patches. It
lists the names, e-mail addresses and in some cases the hometowns
of children who want to trade patches. That is a red flag for FTC
enforcers. They worry that child molesters can use the information
to find victims.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as a reporter asked Philip Rubin, president of Edge of
Chaos, the company that manages the site, about this, he
immediately promised to change the policy. And a few days later, he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now require all contributors to provide us with signed
permission letters before e-mail addresses/and or names can be
posted,'' he said. ``Contributors under the age of 18 must provide
a form signed by their parents or guardians.'' And the Soccer Patch
site posted the form so that it can be printed out and mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal Honda, a Washington area car dealer, had a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The company, like many car dealers, posts a pre-qualification
form for auto loans, requesting a variety of personal information,
including income, debt load and the amount of rent or mortgage
payments. Nowhere on the site does the company say how that
information will be used. And when asked about that, the company
issued a statement saying, ``We will look at the issue with our Web
developer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked two weeks later what had come of this, Rosenthal Honda did
not respond.
</P>
<P>
   FTC officials say they are investigating other Web sites and
will almost certainly file charges against other companies, as the
agency did with Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Forbes, 31, an FTC lawyer, found the Geocities problem and
spends most of his time working on Internet privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally we get ideas from reading the trade press,'' he
said, as well as from ``looking at who is linking up with list
brokers; we get tips from interest groups, usenet news group
postings _ and complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, for one, disagrees with the idea that a Web site can
escape trouble if it simply decides not to post a privacy policy.
``If you don't make a visible statement,'' he said, ``that does not
mean there isn't an implied claim.''
</P>
<P>
   But while his agency and the rest of the government figure out
whether to push for new rules on Web privacy, Forbes sees a bit of
improvement on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying everything's great,'' he said. ``But there is
movement.''

RECORDING-INDUSTRY VANGUARD TURNS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER EVERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With revenue of $12.36 billion in 1997, profits in the music
business have been essentially flat for the last few years. So,
lured by an online music market that the research firm Jupiter
Communications predicts will reach $2.8 billion a year by 2002, the
record industry, from producers to retailers, has struggled with
how to take advantage of Internet technologies to realize better
margins.
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with audio, video, live ``Webcasts'' and
other multimedia technologies, the vanguard of the new-media
recording industry says it is poised to employ the Internet to
radically alter the way tomorrow's artists will be sold, promoted
and even discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But like everything on the Internet, there is no road map to
profits from online music. On the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, two
very different pioneers are blazing divergent paths to the future.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, N2K Inc. was formed in 1996 as a complete online
music and entertainment endeavor with a huge retail music store,
its own record label and magazine-type content organized around
communities of shared musical tastes and interests _ jazz,
classical, rock and country.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most start-ups in the Internet world, N2K is headed not
by youngsters with more vision than experience but by respected
longtime players in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Across the county and in another universe financially _ but just
a mouse click away on the Web _ is Red Button, a San
Francisco-based company founded last spring as a platform for
unknown bands to distribute their music. Recently, the company
shifted into recording and artist management.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing these two companies have in common is a
desire to make a business out of music and an unwavering belief
that the Internet is the place to do it.
</P>
<P>
   N2K's leaders were adapting new technologies to the recording
business long before there was an Internet. Its chief executive,
58-year-old Larry Rosen, founded GRP Music, the label that
introduced all-digital recordings for CDs in 1982. It was sold to
MCA Inc. in 1990 for $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the company's creative force stems from Phil
Ramone, one of the recording industry's premier producers. The
first to use Dolby four-track discrete sound in 1976, two decades
later Ramone was the first to use a fiber-optic system known as
EDNet to record simultaneous performances at different locations
for the Frank Sinatra Duets I and II albums. This month, Ramone
moved into a senior executive position on the corporate side of
N2K. In his new role, he will use the promise of Internet
distribution and promotion to attract established artists.
</P>
<P>
   N2K's mainstay is Music Boulevard, an online music store that
has evolved into the nexus for a network of online music channels,
including Rocktropolis, Jazz Central Station and Classical
Insights, not to mention myriad sites of major artists, including
Stones World and the Miles Davis site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about dealing with more and more artists,'' Rosen said.
``Recently, we signed Wynton Marsalis, exclusively for the
Internet, for his performances online.''
</P>
<P>
   Though N2K did not sign Marsalis, the Grammy award-winning jazz
trumpeter, to a conventional recording contract, it will manage his
online presence and produce his cyberconcerts. The Internet, Rosen
said, is ``a new place for artists to expand _ and not in conflict
with a recording contract'' with another label.
</P>
<P>
   Music Boulevard, the major source of N2K's $17.14 million in
revenue for the first half of this year, is among the most
successful online music retailers, offering some 300,000 titles.
While the company had an operating loss of $30.14 million for the
half-year, Rosen says that N2K is on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investors are in for the long run,'' he said. With 80.2
million page views and 130,000 new customers in the second quarter,
Rosen said he expected to turn a profit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the company's original label, N2K Encoded, which
markets its recordings through traditional retail outlets, it
recently created an imprint, Digital Artists, which will record
established artists who the company feels can best benefit from
online marketing, promotion and digital delivery, in addition to
traditional retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said the plan was to construct a suite of recording,
distribution and online environments to cultivate tomorrow's stars,
not one-hit wonders. N2K broke new ground last year selling the
Tragically Hip's album ``Live Between Us'' solely online. On Sept.
21, Musicblvd.com will debut and sell Dave Stewart's ``Sly Fi
Mission Control'' album exclusively on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Red Button is a shoestring start-up led by
Jake Sloane, 51, who recalls that the company was originally
developed ``to play independent artists' music to the World Wide
Web audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Using an electronic distribution method similar to Music
Boulevard's ``e-mod'' online music delivery system, Red Button
sells CD-quality downloads over the Internet using a technology
known as Liquid Audio. However, the company's primary direction
quickly changed, recognizing opportunities in the electronic world
to begin redefining traditional roles in music.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Braden Merrick, Red Button's 26-year-old vice
president for marketing, decided to invest start-up capital in a
new San Francisco band called Brando. Upon signing a two-year
management contract for 20 percent of Brando's revenues, Red Button
evolved instantly from an online music store to an artist
management company and an independent label.
</P>
<P>
   For an investment in Brando of $16,000, Red Button first placed
the band on its Web home page, offering Liquid Audio singles of
just two songs. The money paid for an eight-track tape recorder, a
mixing console and some microphones, plus a small contribution to
the quartet's living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after the band's Web site went live and
Brando finished recording six new songs, the quartet came to the
attention of 26-year-old Gary Savelson, who four months earlier had
started a free e-mail newsletter called ``Demo Diaries'' devoted to
chronicling unknown bands that he discovers, often on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Each Monday, Savelson focuses on two bands that he believes show
promise and e-mails his newsletter to some 300 people at
established record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week of Savelson's profile of Brando, Red Button's
office fielded calls and e-mailed inquiries from some 40
established record labels, including Geffen, Arista, Reprise and
Dreamworks, said Red Button's Merrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Liquid Audio singles were sold,'' Sloane said. But in one
measure of how far the industry is from accepting online
distribution, he added, ``All the labels received CDs in the mail,
at their request.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Loftus, Brando's lead singer and song writer, said of Red
Button: ``We're the guinea-pig band _ willingly. This is just an
opportunity for all the good bands out there not to have to wait
for a record deal.''

STUDIES DIFFER ON INTERNET'S IMPACT ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, are eyes starting to wander?
</P>
<P>
   With tens of millions of people using the Internet every day,
more and more advertisers and media executives are starting to
wonder whether active surfers are watching less television.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several surveys have found that heavy Internet users say
their time online eats into their television viewing more than any
other activity, although they also say they spend less time
reading, talking to friends and sleeping. One widely reported study
by Nielsen Media Research for America Online last month found that
households that had Internet access watched 15 percent less
television than those that did not.
</P>
<P>
   But the America Online study stopped short of proving that
Internet use was the cause of the lower television use. And a lot
of other research appeared to show the opposite _ that people were
still watching more television even as they increasingly surfed the
Internet. Such research indicates that many people perform both
activities at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A new study scheduled for release Monday, commissioned by
Discovery Networks, the operator of science-oriented cable
television channels and a unit of Discovery Communications Inc.,
takes the side of those who contend that net-surfing does not cut
down on the time devoted to channel-surfing.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery study, which probed deeper into the same Nielsen
data that America Online used, concluded that as households began
to use the Internet, television use by teen-agers dropped but use
by everyone else increased.
</P>
<P>
   That was consistent with a study commissioned by MTV Networks, a
unit of Viacom Inc., and released in June. ``We see media
consumption leading to more media consumption,'' said Betsy Frank,
executive vice president for research at MTV Networks. ``People
don't quit watching television because they go online. They do more
of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV study asked 25,000 people to keep diaries of their media
use. Those who said they were heavy Internet users also said they
watched more cable television than average and read more books than
the average respondent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many studies are now finding an increase in what has
become known as multitasking _ surfing the Internet, watching
television, cooking dinner and talking on the telephone, all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frank said this phenomenon was confirmed on May 14, the
night of the last episode of ``Seinfeld.'' That evening the
television audience surged, but Internet use increased as well,
according to measurements by Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other seeming threats to television use _ the videocassette
recorder and video games, for example _ have been found not to
reduce the amount of network and cable television that people
watch.
</P>
<P>
   People use VCRs to record TV programs they otherwise would miss,
which offsets whatever decline in television watching may come from
people watching prerecorded movies, said Paul Lindstrom, a vice
president of Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of video games was even more surprising: They
increase the number of televisions in a household as well as
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before video games, kids would watch ``The Flintstones'' or
whatever, after school in the family room,'' Lindstrom said. ``When
a family gets a video game, they often buy a television set for the
kids' bedroom. That means the kids can watch TV whenever they want
to and the parents can watch what they want in the afternoon,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in such findings are high for the television
networks, for the Internet services and for the advertisers who
must choose where to place their messages. Television, after all,
has proved to be the most powerful medium in history for selling
products. And the idea that the rapid growth of the Internet might
pull people away from their sets is frightening to many commercial
interests, especially since advertisements online have yet to prove
effective for sales of many consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use is certainly taking a big chunk of Americans' time.
The 13 million members of America Online, for example, log an
average of 45 minutes daily. That is why the America Online study
that showed lower television use in Internet homes received such
attention. But many media experts said it glossed over important
demographic variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet user base is more upscale than the rest of the
population,'' said Lynn Bolger, senior vice president for media at
APL Digital, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. ``And
traditionally that is a group that is not a heavy viewer of
television.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online concedes that its study was limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think online time is eating into television time,'' said
Marshall Cohen, the senior vice president for brand development of
America Online. ``If you say prove it, I say the definitive study
has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The best study, of course, would monitor people's use of
television before they signed up for the Internet and then after
they started to go online. So far, that research has not been done,
but the Discovery study with Nielsen came close. In October 1996
and again in October 1997, it measured television use in 2,218
homes that are part of Nielsen's continuing television rating
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen did not ask participants whether they had Internet
access in 1996, so the study could not differentiate longtime
Internet users from those homes that signed up for the Internet for
the first time between the two measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Internet use was increasing nationwide during that
period, Discovery estimates that 40 percent of the people who had
Internet access in 1997 first went online after the 1996
measurement. Households that told Nielsen in 1997 that they had
access to the Internet increased their television use by 1.8
percent over the previous year, compared with a 1.3 percent
increase over all for the whole sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a perfect measure,'' said Steve McGowan, Discovery's
research director. ``But if the Internet was taking time away from
television, you should have seen viewership decline, but in fact it
went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery did find that sort of decline for viewers between the
ages of 12 and 24. In homes with Internet access, television use by
those younger viewers declined by 6.8 percent from 1996 to 1997.
Television use by young people without Internet access remained
constant.

MEDIA TALK: `E.R.' GAMBLE PAYS OFF; BARNICLE'S NEW DEFENSE;
MARRYING RICH  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After agreeing to pay $13 million an episode for ``E.R.,'' which
returns for a new season Thursday night, NBC may be feeling like
one of the patients on a gurney in the series. But it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, NBC was able to cash in on ``E.R.'' in
spectacular fashion, taking immediate advantage of a rare
opportunity to make advertisers pay for their own inability to
recognize a big hit when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the year ``E.R.'' arrived to anchor NBC's Thursday
night lineup, CBS thought it had found the answer to breaching the
fortress of success NBC had built on Thursdays. ``L.A. Law,'' which
had faded badly, was coming off the air as NBC's 10 p.m. entry. CBS
had a new hospital drama called ``Chicago Hope,'' created by a new
television drama wunderkind, David Kelley, and decided to use it to
go after NBC on Thursday at 10.
</P>
<P>
   That June, during the so-called up-front season, when
advertisers decide how much money they will commit to the new
network prime-time schedules, based on how they estimate shows will
perform, advertising agency executives looked at the pilots for
``E.R.'' and ``Chicago Hope'' and could not decide which of them
had greater potential to emerge as a hit. Mainly they expected the
two doctor shows to cancel each other out, so they estimated that
neither would get more than 21 percent of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   NBC wanted to be paid for at least a 25 share _ 25 percent of
viewers watching in its time slot _ and when it could not get that
price, Don Ohlmeyer, the head of NBC's West Coast entertainment
division, made a daring decision. He refused to sell more than 40
percent of the commercial time in the show before the season began
_ an unheard-of figure in a business in which shows routinely sell
at least 80 percent of their time during the up-front season.
Ohlmeyer was betting that the time would be more valuable later if
``E.R.'' did hit that 25 share.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that season, ``E.R.'' had eclipsed a 40 share.
Because NBC had retained more than half the commercial time left to
sell, it was able to charge prices commensurate with that level of
success. If advertisers had been willing to assign the show even a
25 share at the start, they would have enjoyed an enormous free
bonus audience.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, everyone knows what a hit ``E.R.'' is, and the
show is in huge demand with advertisers, so NBC sells almost all
the time in the show during the up-front season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also able to package sales in ``E.R.'' with sales in many
other shows, squeezing as much leverage as it can out of the status
of ``E.R.'' as the highest-rated show on television _ though $286
million a year (the cost for 22 episodes of ``E.R.'') represents an
awful lot of squeezing.

   Globe's Ex-Columnist Defends His Work
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barnicle, the former Boston Globe columnist, said Friday he
hoped to buy a full-page ad in the Globe to defend the
authenticity, if not the accuracy, of the 1995 column that led to
his forced resignation last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has refused to run Barnicle's defense on its op-ed
page. ``It didn't bring anything new to the table,'' said Richard
Gulla, a spokesman for the newspaper, which is owned by New York
Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's disputed 1995 column told the story of two boys _ one
white, one black, both with cancer _ who bonded at Children's
Hospital in Boston in 1994. He wrote that after the black child
died, the parents of the white boy sent his family a check for
$10,000. He quoted from a letter that accompanied the check. In
August, he said that a nurse had passed along the story and he had
never been in touch with the families.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Gulla said: ``If you make up quotes
from people you've never met, that's fabrication. We do not allow
anyone to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle recently went to Springvale, Maine, to interview Pat
Shairs, whose son Joshua died of heart disease. At the Children's
Hospital's cardiology unit in 1987, Joshua befriended Lacey
Ringwelski, a girl from Wisconsin. Both were white. After Joshua's
death, Lacey's grandmother sent Joshua's parents a check for
$5,000, which they gave to a scholarship fund for nurses, according
to both families.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal Tribune in Biddeford, Maine, published an article
about Pat Shairs on Aug. 25; The Globe followed suit. In his new
defense, Barnicle avoids saying his 1995 column was about the
Shairses. But he quotes Pat Shairs saying, ``This is our story.''

   A Forbes List Maker Makes the List
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Forbes ASAP's annual listing of the 100
wealthiest people in technology, which will be published Monday,
and you will learn some of the secrets of getting rich quick these
days. They include selling technology for the Internet and selling
things on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is marrying into Internet wealth. One of the 28
Internet executives on this year's list happens to be the husband
of the list maker.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rutter, a senior editor at Forbes ASAP, who was in charge
of this year's list and the accompanying articles, is married to
Jim Clark, the 54-year-old co-founder of Netscape Communications
Corp. He is No. 28 on the list, with total assets of $412.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rutter, 44, an information-technology journalist, met Clark
in 1989 while he was still running Silicon Graphics Inc. and she
was editor of Upside Magazine. They married in 1990. She is now a
part-time staffer for ASAP, a bimonthly supplement to Forbes
magazine, working from the couple's homes in Silicon Valley and
Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rutter, whose job includes editing most of the magazine's
``list'' stories, says she no longer writes the kinds of in-depth
industry articles she used to because of the potential for
conflicts of interest. And she said the magazine is careful not to
involve her in stories even remotely related to any of her
husband's businesses. The ``Technology's Wealthiest'' list is an
exception, she said, because the facts speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be married to No. 28 on the list,'' Ms.
Rutter said in an interview from her California home. ``It's not a
bad position for a reporter to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list that Ms. Rutter compiled are the industry's old
guard, led once again by Bill Gates of Microsoft Corp., with a net
worth of nearly $59 billion, and his co-founder, Paul Allen, with
$16.98 billion. Among executives of Internet companies, Jeffrey
Bezos, of Amazon.com Inc., joined the billionaires' club at No. 9
with $2.14 billion, along with David Filo of Yahoo, No. 15 with a
little over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet may be hot, it should be noted that the
Forbes ASAP list was calculated on Aug. 3, well before the market's
huge slide. As of last week, the net worth of the group of 28
Internet executives was down $1.8 billion since the calculations
were made. And, yes, that means Ms. Rutter's net worth is down,
too.

STAR TREK FANS TAKE NOTE: THE FUTURE MAY BE HERE 
PERSONALIZING A BOOK WITH A GIVER'S PHOTO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fans of the television show ``Star Trek'' know that one of the
wonders of the science-fiction future is the starship sensor. With
it, crew members can detect the exact location of living bodies on
a planet they are orbiting. If mankind does someday develop those
fantastic sensors, they might have their roots in inventions of
today.
 &HT;    A German inventor has patented a device that uses
electromagnetic signals to detect the presence of living bodies.
The invention is intended to help find people buried by rubble in
earthquakes or other disasters, like the many who were trapped in
the recent bombings of American embassies in Africa.
 &HT;    Gerd Jurgen Schmidt, from Frankfurt, intends for his invention
to replace both search-and-rescue dogs, which cannot distinguish
between survivors and the dead, and listening devices, which cannot
pinpoint unconscious victims.
 &HT;    In his patent, Schmidt says, ``Living bodies generally
surprisingly influence high-frequency electromagnetic signals, even
over relatively long distances, by virtue of their heartbeat and
respiratory activity.'' For human beings, the influences fall in a
characteristic frequency range.
 &HT;    Schmidt designed a diode direct receiver to pick up and
demodulate, or convert, the electromagnetic signals emanating from
human bodies. The system works like the method used to send and
receive television signals, transmitting signals through the air
and recapturing them. At the end of the process a monitor displays
heart and lung activity.
 &HT;    Schmidt says his device can detect up to four people buried in
one spot and can pick up heart and lung signals up to three yards
away. He received patent 5,790,032.

   Books are a popular gift, and many gift givers personalize a
book by writing an inscription or dedication inside the cover. Marc
Salzberger, an inventor in Middle Village, N.Y., thinks givers and
receivers would enjoy the gift even more if givers could add their
pictures or favorite photos to the book jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberger has patented a process that lets a book buyer add a
portrait and an inscription to the jacket when buying a book.
</P>
<P>
   A bookstore would install a camera, a computer and a printer.
Publishers would supply the store with software to use in creating
the jacket covers of books. The jacket designs would include blank
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting a book, a customer would pose for a video or
still camera, and the picture would then be scanned into the
computer. Or a buyer could bring in existing pictures, like old
family photos or school portraits, or substitute a drawing made on
an electronic pad.
</P>
<P>
   The customer could also type a caption to accompany the photo.
Then the book-jacket data would be entered into the computer and
the buyer's chosen artwork would be added to the book jacket. The
jacket would be printed and wrapped around the book.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberger received patent 5,782,598.

   NEW YORK _ She used to be ``Cybill.'' Now she's Cybill again.
Leaving behind the sitcom and the little screen, Cybill Shepherd
will appear in the flesh in a singing, storytelling cabaret
engagement beginning Tuesday night and continuing through Oct. 4
high over Manhattan at Rainbow and Stars. In her first such New
York appearance since 1994, Ms. Shepherd will reminisce in a light
vein about her 30-year career as model and movie and television
star, offering up standards like ``Tennessee Waltz,'' ``Walkin' the
Dog,'' ``But Not for Me'' and ``St. Louis Blues.'' Information:
(212) 632-5000.

   Silver Servings
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years have passed since Seiji Ozawa became music
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In anticipation of his
silver anniversary and the orchestra's 118th season, which is to
begin on Wednesday, subscribers were asked what music they would
most like the maestro to conduct again. The answer: Beethoven's
Ninth. Not only will the symphony open the season, it will also be
performed by Ozawa and the orchestra again on Sunday in a free
concert at 4 p.m. on the Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
   Romance
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Kidman makes her London stage debut Tuesday night at the
Donmar Warehouse, playing not one but five roles. If the movie
star's presence was not enough to focus attention on the 250-seat
theater, the vehicle happens to be a piece written by David Hare
and directed by Sam Mendes, fresh off his New York triumph with
``Cabaret.'' The play, ``The Blue Room,'' is Hare's modern take on
``La Ronde,'' by Arthur Schnitzler. The co-star with Ms. Kidman in
the two-actor play is Iain Glen. Information: 011-44-171-369-1732.
</P>
<P>
   Venetian Roue
</P>
<P>
   As everybody knows, love's magic spell is everywhere, and these
days it is notably potent in Venice, where the 200th anniversary of
the death of that immortal libertine, aristocrat and adventurer
Giovanni Giacomo Casanova de Seingalt has inspired an exhibition at
Ca' Rezzonico, the Museum of the Venetian 18th century. Running
through Jan. 10, the show, ``The World of Giacomo Casanova: A
Venetian in Europe, 1725-1798,'' attempts to evoke the spirit and
style of his time.
</P>
<P>
   It is divided into themes suggested by Casanova's life: Europe
and its great cities, 18th-century Venice, European courts, science
and alchemy, theater, gambling and, of course, seduction. Paintings
by artists of the day, including Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard and
the Venetian masters Canaletto, Longhi and Guardi illustrate these
themes. In addition, jewelry, furnishings and documents illuminate
the era. Information: 011-39-041-520-4036.

JAZZ AT THE WHITE HOUSE: A METAPHOR FOR DEMOCRACY (AND A HELP TO
THE BOSS)
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was everywhere, rustling through conversations
the way a breeze moves through trees, in the smirks and jokes of
some, in the extended, slightly nervous ovation the president and
Mrs. Clinton received as they walked into the East Room of the
White House on Friday night for a Millennium lecture on jazz. It
was the President's Problem, and it colored the event. The
musicians onstage spent much of their time, as did the audience,
analyzing the way the president and his wife interacted, how they
played their public roles, how, in the middle of a Greek tragedy,
they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Problem was on the president's mind. When asked
casually, at the reception after the music and the lectures, what
role public art plays in a democracy, the president said, ``Art is
part of our better selves.'' Then he took a deep breath. ``So much
of public life is destructive nowadays,'' he said. ``Things like
this allow us to show our better side, not the dark, evil part of
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert and lecture, the fourth this year in a series
planned by the White House to bring together experts on a
particular subject, had the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and pianist
Marian McPartland as hosts. The audience of about 100 included
Czech President Vaclav Havel; Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright; Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich.; and William Ivey,
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, along with some of
jazz's more important figures. The saxophonist Wayne Shorter showed
up, as did the bassist Ron Carter; the saxophonist and band leader
Illinois Jacquet; the head of the Institute of Jazz Studies, Dan
Morgenstern; and social critic Stanley Crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Put together by a coalition of Jazz at Lincoln Center and the
Thelonious Monk Institute in Washington, and broadcast on VH-1 and
C-Span, the lecture included speeches by the president (who talked
about how influential a whole series of musicians had been on his
life, including Charlie Parker, Monk and John Coltrane), Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Havel. Marsalis and Ms. McPartland spoke, as did
two jazz educators, Dr. Billy Taylor and David Baker. Ms.
McPartland, Marsalis and Taylor played music that underscored their
points. And a big band, made up mostly of members of the Jazz at
Lincoln Center Orchestra, did some roaring.
</P>
<P>
   The show was meant to put jazz in its national and international
context. At the end, questions were taken on the Internet from
Britain, Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There was some suspicion that the event had been put together to
show that the president could continue with the life of the country
despite the Problem. The event, organizers said, was planned some
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this event falls exactly in the place that Clinton has
steadfastly maintained everything will fall,'' said Conyers. ``He
has said that the personal attacks will not keep him from executing
the rest of the term the way he wants to, which is to keep the
nation going the way it should.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some extraordinary moments, as well, that were
nonmusical and not about the Problem. Havel, frail and a bit shaky,
stood up and talked about how jazz had been a symbol of freedom in
Czechoslovakia, how first the Nazis, then the Communists, had
driven the music underground. ``Music,'' he said, ``is the enemy of
totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had given a short lecture and demonstration of
be-bop, heard something in what Havel was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an American says something like that,'' he said, ``we seem
like we're patting ourselves on the back. But he's lived through
something extreme, where the music was actually dangerous. We need
to remember how powerful the music has been and how much resonance
it has had internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were some strong moments musically, too, with the big
band performing Duke Ellington's ``Harlem Airshaft,'' swinging it
thoroughly. Marsalis opened the musical portion of the lecture with
a duet with Ms. McPartland on ``St. Louis Blues'' that had him
tossing burred notes throughout the piece; it all led to his
thesis, which bubbled through the entire lecture, that jazz is
perfectly emblematic of democracy. The balance, goes the thesis,
between the individual desires of the soloist and the necessity of
the group is democracy in esthetic action.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Irby, an alto saxophonist in the big band, was watching
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at his eyes,'' he said. ``And I saw he was just
another person, a regular man with lots of pressure on him. He's
normal and has his failures. But I also saw that he truly loved the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Other musicians felt the same way. After the performance, a
small group of musicians in the dark outside the White House waited
for a ride back to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the hippest president we've ever had,'' said Eric Lewis,
the pianist in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and asked me what kind of a saxophone I was
playing,'' said Victor Goines, also in the orchestra. ``I said to
him, `It's a Julius Keilwerth, from Germany,' and he said, `I have
one of those.' Really, we're in our heyday. When he mentioned John
Coltrane in his speech, he really meant it. I saw his script before
the show, and John Coltrane wasn't even mentioned. We're in our
heyday. We'd better appreciate it, because it may not last.''

Starr evidence, President Clinton prepares to tell UN General
Assembly how nations must work together to combat global terrorism.

   CLINTON-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ All Americans will have a chance
to judge whether President Clinton committed perjury in his Aug. 17

him without sin cast the first stone,'' says Atlanta area retiree
Larry Travis. But are our standards really lower? We talk about the
perception of a moral dis-ease in the United States, and how it

fiber.) (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So, are eyes starting to wander?
</P>
<P>
   With tens of millions of people using the Internet every day,
more and more advertisers and media executives are starting to
wonder whether active surfers are watching less television.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several surveys have found that heavy Internet users say
their time online eats into their television viewing more than any
other activity, although they also say they spend less time
reading, talking to friends and sleeping. One widely reported study
by Nielsen Media Research for America Online last month found that
households that had Internet access watched 15 percent less
television than those that did not.
</P>
<P>
   But the America Online study stopped short of proving that
Internet use was the cause of the lower television use. And a lot
of other research appeared to show the opposite _ that people were
still watching more television even as they increasingly surfed the
Internet. Such research indicates that many people perform both
activities at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   A new study scheduled for release Monday, commissioned by
Discovery Networks, the operator of science-oriented cable
television channels and a unit of Discovery Communications Inc.,
takes the side of those who contend that net-surfing does not cut
down on the time devoted to channel-surfing.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery study, which probed deeper into the same Nielsen
data that America Online used, concluded that as households began
to use the Internet, television use by teen-agers dropped but use
by everyone else increased.
</P>
<P>
   That was consistent with a study commissioned by MTV Networks, a
unit of Viacom Inc., and released in June. ``We see media
consumption leading to more media consumption,'' said Betsy Frank,
executive vice president for research at MTV Networks. ``People
don't quit watching television because they go online. They do more
of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV study asked 25,000 people to keep diaries of their media
use. Those who said they were heavy Internet users also said they
watched more cable television than average and read more books than
the average respondent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many studies are now finding an increase in what has
become known as multitasking _ surfing the Internet, watching
television, cooking dinner and talking on the telephone, all at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frank said this phenomenon was confirmed on May 14, the
night of the last episode of ``Seinfeld.'' That evening the
television audience surged, but Internet use increased as well,
according to measurements by Relevant Knowledge, an Atlanta
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other seeming threats to television use _ the videocassette
recorder and video games, for example _ have been found not to
reduce the amount of network and cable television that people
watch.
</P>
<P>
   People use VCRs to record TV programs they otherwise would miss,
which offsets whatever decline in television watching may come from
people watching prerecorded movies, said Paul Lindstrom, a vice
president of Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of video games was even more surprising: They
increase the number of televisions in a household as well as
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before video games, kids would watch ``The Flintstones'' or
whatever, after school in the family room,'' Lindstrom said. ``When
a family gets a video game, they often buy a television set for the
kids' bedroom. That means the kids can watch TV whenever they want
to and the parents can watch what they want in the afternoon,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in such findings are high for the television
networks, for the Internet services and for the advertisers who
must choose where to place their messages. Television, after all,
has proved to be the most powerful medium in history for selling
products. And the idea that the rapid growth of the Internet might
pull people away from their sets is frightening to many commercial
interests, especially since advertisements online have yet to prove
effective for sales of many consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use is certainly taking a big chunk of Americans' time.
The 13 million members of America Online, for example, log an
average of 45 minutes daily. That is why the America Online study
that showed lower television use in Internet homes received such
attention. But many media experts said it glossed over important
demographic variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet user base is more upscale than the rest of the
population,'' said Lynn Bolger, senior vice president for media at
APL Digital, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos. ``And
traditionally that is a group that is not a heavy viewer of
television.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online concedes that its study was limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think online time is eating into television time,'' said
Marshall Cohen, the senior vice president for brand development of
America Online. ``If you say prove it, I say the definitive study
has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The best study, of course, would monitor people's use of
television before they signed up for the Internet and then after
they started to go online. So far, that research has not been done,
but the Discovery study with Nielsen came close. In October 1996
and again in October 1997, it measured television use in 2,218
homes that are part of Nielsen's continuing television rating
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen did not ask participants whether they had Internet
access in 1996, so the study could not differentiate longtime
Internet users from those homes that signed up for the Internet for
the first time between the two measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Internet use was increasing nationwide during that
period, Discovery estimates that 40 percent of the people who had
Internet access in 1997 first went online after the 1996
measurement. Households that told Nielsen in 1997 that they had
access to the Internet increased their television use by 1.8
percent over the previous year, compared with a 1.3 percent
increase over all for the whole sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a perfect measure,'' said Steve McGowan, Discovery's
research director. ``But if the Internet was taking time away from
television, you should have seen viewership decline, but in fact it
went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery did find that sort of decline for viewers between the
ages of 12 and 24. In homes with Internet access, television use by
those younger viewers declined by 6.8 percent from 1996 to 1997.
Television use by young people without Internet access remained
constant.

REVISIONS: RODCHENKO AND HIS ARTISTIC BROTHERS IN AMERICAN JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I went to the Museum of Modern Art to see the work of the
Russian artist Aleksandr Rodchenko for two reasons. I certainly
wanted to see first-rate art. But I also wanted to see what a
first-rate artist committed to being an honorable citizen did when
faced not with second-rate political scandals but with
life-and-death upheavals: a revolution that was changing
everything, from the way people worked to the way they thought.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko took his stand as an avant-garde abstract painter in
the years just before the Russian Revolution of 1917. As part of a
group whose members called themselves the Constructivists (they
included Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitzy and Rodchenko's wife, Varvara
Stepanova), he committed himself to the highest ideals of that new
society. And he did his best work in the decade or so just after
the revolution, when experimentation was still the norm, with
extraordinary artists marrying art, craft and technology, and
testing how expressivity could be joined to collectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy hangs over the show, of course. We know Stalin is moving
in, ready to lunge as the 1920s end, and he is all the more potent
here because his image is nowhere to be found. The year 1928
brought the denunciation of Rodchenko's work as bourgeois
formalism; 1932 brought the dissolution of the independent artists'
groups he had been such a force in, working with poets, filmmakers
and stage directors like Mayakovsky, Eisenstein and Meyerhold.
Rodchenko was not a trusted Socialist Realist, so his work
opportunities dwindled and he found himself isolated and ignored,
the artist's equivalent of solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The work is wonderful. You see the paintings, photographs and
graphic design the way you hear a piece of perfectly constructed
music. The colors are harmonics, and the lines are uncannily pure
melodies. He uses space the way a musician uses silence.
</P>
<P>
   But what struck closest to home was the way Rodchenko plunged
into the everyday, the practical and the commercial. He designed
factory uniforms, teapots and a workers' club. He produced gorgeous
book and magazine covers and advertisements for stores and airline
companies. He never felt any of this was beneath him and there was
no slacking off between the early high art and the later mass art.
(At least, not until the 1930s, when he was pushed aside.)
Rodchenko and his peers wanted to reach as many people as possible
with the best work they could do, remaking art in and for a society
trying to remake itself.
</P>
<P>
   It was this reaching inward and outward simultaneously, this
eagerness to test the resources of his art and his audience that
was so moving. There was so much beauty here and such idealism, and
simplicity too. (Art like this can be thoroughly and rewardingly
analyzed. But it can just be enjoyed, too). In his rigorous and
manifesto-laden way, Rodchenko was striving to make and help define
a truly modernist popular art.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of an American visual artist with this
reach. The Constructivists sometimes compared themselves to
architects. But given their work with people like Meyerhold and
Eisenstein, their ties to the performing arts are quite clear.
Which is no doubt why I began thinking of American popular music
and of those two composers who are celebrating their centennials
this year and next, George Gershwin (1898-1937) and Duke Ellington
(1899-1974).
</P>
<P>
   They weren't considered avant-gardists because the music they
wrote wasn't considered high art. But it was new and unsettling for
plenty of people. Rodchenko and his peers learned that high art
could be inseparable from everyday life and commerce. Gershwin,
Ellington and their peers learned that mass art could be converted
into high art without losing its character or its place in the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   You could write a jazz concerto or a folk opera. Of course a
two-and-a-half minute instrumental piece could be as texturally
rich as a piece two or three times as long, while a popular song
could have all the pleasures of an art song. Between them,
Ellington and Gershwin wrote short and long pieces, a host of
symphonic works, operas and liturgical music, all of it available
to all of us. They seized on the tensions between jazz, theatrical
and classical styles, between writing for an audience willing to
sit in a concert hall and one eager to leave a theater humming
tunes and enter a nightclub to dance to them.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko and his peers were high artists who remade themselves
as mass artists. Ellington, Gershwin and their peers were mass
artists who remade themselves as high artists.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ellington nor Gershwin came of age artistically during a
full-scale revolution. But they did come of age amid the economic,
political and social shocks of the Depression and the New Deal, and
in a country obsessed by race, ethnicity and Anglo-Saxon dominance.
Neither risked artistic death through political censorship. But as
commercial artists, they did risk the obliteration that can come
from failing to please the producers, bookers and reviewers who
controlled their access to their audience.
</P>
<P>
   And for every experiment they made, they risked disappointing
and losing some portion of that audience. In the United States, it
is commercial failure that lands an artist in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin had Broadway and Hollywood and all those recordings of
his songs to offset experimental failures like ``Blue Monday'' and
``Porgy and Bess.'' Ellington, denied more than occasional access
to Broadway or Hollywood, had his band, and between unceasing tours
and recordings he was able to underwrite his more experimental
work.
</P>
<P>
   We make a big point today about post-modernists who blur the
distinctions of high, low and mass art. Modernists like Rodchenko,
Ellington and Gershwin did little else. Maybe ``blur'' is the wrong
word. You can't use a form or technique effectively if you don't
know what distinguishes it from other forms and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to their work and their audience, these artists
refused to respect what these distinctions were supposed to
signify. This meant not only that they were brilliant. It meant
they honored their audience, as they were and as they could be.
</P>
<P>
   We may find it small comfort during tawdry or brutal political
times, but Shelley was right when he said that artists (his word
was poets, but surely he wouldn't object) are the unacknowledged
legislators of the world.

ADVERTISING: MULTICULTURAL MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A giant agency company is stepping up its efforts in
multicultural marketing, forming a unit devoted to encouraging
advertisers to keep pace with the changing face of consumers by
increasing sales pitches aimed at ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, New America Strategies Group, is being introduced by
True North Communications in Chicago, the world's sixth-largest
agency company, with estimated billings of $10.8 billion handled by
units like Bozell Worldwide and Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding. The start-up
is timed to coincide with a three-day conference, beginning Tuesday
in Chicago, that describes ethnic marketing as a ``gateway to
America's trillion-dollar growth markets,'' which include black,
Hispanic and Asian-American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the conference, sponsored by True North and the
Strategic Research Institute in New York, New America Strategies
Group will share results of a study analyzing household shopping
and spending propensities of multicultural and white families.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing initial finding of the study is that
household spending of multicultural families, on purchases deemed
essential and discretionary, is growing faster than for white
families in 10 of 13 categories in a New America Market Basket
Index, which include vehicle purchases, clothing and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multicultural Americans are in many ways the growth engine of
the economy,'' said Alfred Schreiber, who becomes managing partner
of New America Strategies Group, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``CEOs who can manage change will be the winners,'' he added.
``And one of the biggest coming changes is the rise of what we call
the New America, which probably offers the best opportunity for
companies for organic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   True North is joining a lengthening list of mainstream agency
companies that are devoting additional resources to multiethnic
marketing. For instance, Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York, which
already owns shops specializing in advertising aimed at Hispanic
and Asian-American consumers, is acquiring operations of One World
Communications, a unit of Leap Group in Chicago dedicated to
multicultural marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Those intensifying activities have stirred irritation and
anxiety among the smaller, independent agencies _ many of which are
owned by members of minorities _ that have long focused on the
ethnic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of outstanding ethnic agencies and I
applaud them,'' said Charles Peebler Jr., president of True North
and chairman and chief executive of True North Diversified Cos.,
the division under which New America Strategies Group will operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are looking at the broader, total multicultural
picture,'' he added, ``which marketers have yet to give the
substantial time and attention they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The new unit is offering clients a planning tool called the
Multicultural Marketing Opportunity Model, intended to analyze the
return on investment of initiatives aimed at ethnic consumers.
</P>
<P>
   New America Strategies Group will consist of three agencies and
a marketing consulting company. These are the agencies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Siboney USA in New York, which specializes in advertising,
direct marketing, promotion and public relations directed at
Spanish-speaking consumers. Siboney, which also has offices in
Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami, has billings estimated at $50
million from clients like Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Mastercard
International.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stedman Graham &AMP; Partners in Chicago and New York, which
specializes in marketing communications campaigns aimed primarily
at African-Americans. The agency, founded in 1996 as Graham Gregory
Bozell, works for such advertisers as Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   _ Admerasia in New York, an affiliate of True North that creates
campaigns in languages including Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Russian and Vietnamese for marketers like American Express Co. and
the Citibank unit of Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting-company component of the new unit is Skunkworks
Marketing Lab in New York, whose clients include AT&AMP;T Corp. and
Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   New America Strategies Group will be overseen by a partners
board. The members are: Peebler, 62; Schreiber, 52, who is also
executive vice president and general manager at Graham; Stedman
Graham, 47, chairman and chief executive at Graham; Jose Cubas, 68,
chairman at Siboney; Richard Mascolo, 43, president at Skunkworks,
and Val Zammit, 51, president and chief operating officer at True
North Diversified Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The market basket study, developed in alliance with Demograph
Corp., a management consulting company in Miami, concluded that
spending by multicultural households has grown 17.8 percent from
1995 to 1998, compared with an increase of 13.1 percent for white
households in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The categories in which the growth rate in spending in
multicultural households most exceeded the growth rate in spending
in white households were entertainment, vehicle purchases and
health care. As a sign of upward mobility among ethnic consumers,
the study showed, spending has been shifting from public
transportation to purchasing vehicles and from rental housing to
homeowning.

`FARMER'S WIFE': DOUBLE BIND IN NEBRASKA: FARMING AND A MARRIAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.)

 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a delicate matter. Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter are not
made-for-television characters whom a reviewer can kick around
without getting personal. They are a young Nebraska farm couple,
parents of three, whose ordeal of dry weather with its crop of
economic and emotional troubles is the subject of ``The Farmer's
Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sutherland, the conscientious filmmaker who culled six and
a half hours of television from 200 hours of shooting over three
years, trains an intimate yet generally unsentimental lens on the
Buschkoetters and their children, parents, creditors and others
involved in their battle for a way of life and for a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   None of them are noticeably put off by the prying cameras or
sound equipment, but their collaboration, which invites comparison
with the 1973 television portrait of the Loud family, seems to go
on forever. Sutherland demonstrates that given enough time, a
likable, hard-working couple on the edge of disaster can make
pretty wearing company. Their story will be told over three nights
beginning Monday on PBS' ``Frontline.''
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, Juanita Buschkoetter is at the heart of
this chronicle of tough going on the Nebraska range. It begins in
the spring of 1995, when the couple are battling to hold onto their
small farm. ``Am I going to be farming this fall or am I going to
be forced to sell out?'' Darrel asks and keeps asking. ``How can it
get any worse?''
</P>
<P>
   Wait and see. If you had any doubt about how hard farm families
still work, it should be laid to rest as Darrel takes a job in a
factory and Juanita hires out as a housekeeper. Darrel says,
``Trying to farm at night and work all day for somebody else, it's
worse than a living hell.'' The pressures, which threaten to reduce
the pair from independent farmers to a beaten-down peasantry,
buffet their marriage. ``The Darrel that's on the surface right
now,'' Juanita says, ``it's really hard to deal with him.''
Fortunately, self-esteem counseling is available even in rural
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   You have to sympathize with the couple's grit and perseverance,
but six and a half hours of worries about getting a government loan
(Sen. Bob Kerrey helps) and accepting handouts and enduring family
nagging is demanding on the audience, too.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue can be relentlessly real.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita: Do something. You're sitting here in my way.
</P>
<P>
   Darrel: Like what?
</P>
<P>
   Juanita: Take a bath or. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Darrel: How can I take a bath? Can't take a bath yet.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Darrel: Well, the kids running all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of sensitivity on show during these three long
nights _ Sutherland catches all the nuances of pillow talk _ and no
resort to the sensationalism that gave the Louds of Santa Barbara
their soap-opera appeal. Missing, however, is a compelling
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Farmer's Wife,'' with its unsparing theme, just doesn't
produce enough drama to repay watching unless you have a soft spot
for in-law spats and domestic bickerings. By the end, when the
weather finally improves, the series slips into a feminist fable,
with Juanita going to school and finding a fulfilling job and a
newly respectful Darrel taking over the housework.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is a criticism of the Buschkoetters. Few lives are
made for television, and their troubles deserve attention.
Sutherland has delivered a respectable sociological document. But
for six and a half hours, it would be helpful to have a more
eventful story to tell or more variety in the telling.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A final day of sultry weather is expected along the East Coast
from New England to the Carolinas as high pressure over the
southwest Atlantic circulates tropical air northward along the
seaboard. The day will begin with widespread haze and fog east of
the Appalachians, but balmy breezes will stir the lower atmosphere
enough to bring intervals of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Remnant moisture from tropical storm Hermine will flow northeast
into the southern Appalachians, eastern Tennessee Valley and
western Carolinas. Dense clouds will accompany heavy showers and
thunderstorms with flooding rain likely in some spots. The cloud
shield will be drawn up the Appalachians along with a few
thundershowers. Very moist and warm air from Maryland to
Massachusetts will become buoyant when heated by sunny intervals.
An approaching cold front will trigger a few clusters of strong to
severe thunderstorms in the northern Appalachians Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of much cooler, drier air will press southeast
from the Great Lakes and Plains. A few thunderstorms will mark the
advance of cooler air into the Ohio Valley. A jet stream
disturbance exiting the Rockies will further lift chilly, moist air
in its ascent into the western Dakotas and Wyoming. A cold rain
will soak South Dakota and showers will spread east into southern
Minnesota and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few thunderstorms in the central Rockies, the West
will be brighter with a steady warming trend. Coastal clouds will
obscure sections of the Los Angeles Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Plains Cold Front
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose to a record maximum of 92 degrees at the Twin
Cities airport in Minneapolis on Saturday and readings reached 95
degrees at Redwood Falls, southwest of the capital. The hot air
preceded a strong cold front which swept through the northern
Plains on Saturday night. In fact, cold fronts mark both the
leading edge of advancing cooler air and the apex of a warm air
mass being displaced. As winter approaches, it will become more
evident that the mildest air precedes cold fronts. By Monday
afternoon, readings were 20 degrees lower in Minneapolis.

`GOOD MORNING AMERICA' DRIFTS INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic of ``Today'' and ``Good Morning America'' ratings
is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make

 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In early morning television, Katie and Matt don't
need surnames. As co-hosts of the enormously popular ``Today'' show
on NBC, Katie Couric and Matt Lauer are not only familiar
companions in more than 5 million American homes each morning; they
are also well known to movers and shakers from Washington to New
York to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to ``Good Morning America'' on ABC, many
people think of the co-hosts primarily as that smiling blond woman
and that nice young man who wears glasses.
</P>
<P>
   True, Lisa McRee has been in the job for just one year, and
Kevin Newman took over from Charles Gibson only this May. But their
valiant, visibly difficult struggles to stay smiling and
sharp-witted in the competitive arena of morning television are the
surface signs of turbulence at a show in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of a decade, from 1985-95, ``Good Morning
America'' was the most-watched show in the 7-9 a.m. weekday slot.
But in the last two years, it has seen its Nielsen ratings plummet,
losing more than 25 percent of its viewers. In May 1996, the
average number of households watching the show each day was 4.17
million, just a bit behind the ``Today'' show's 4.43 million. By
May 1998, ``Today'' had an average of 5.26 million homes tuned in,
while second-place ``Good Morning America'' had slipped to 3.12
million.
</P>
<P>
   That drop hurts the prestige of ABC, a subsidiary of Walt Disney
Co., but the financial pain is far worse. Not only are the
breakfast shows the most profitable news programs on NBC and ABC,
but those networks split the advertising time 50-50 with their
owned and affiliated local stations _ for whom it is almost pure
profit since they contribute little to the shows' costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America'' had been run by ABC Entertainment since
its debut in 1975. But because all the morning shows were becoming
newsier and more sophisticated in keeping with changing American
habits and tastes, and because the show's ratings had begun to
stagnate, ABC in 1995 moved the program to the news division.
Oddly, that is when the downturn began.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been costly. For the first half of this year,
``Today'' earned about $117 million for NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., more than the other two morning shows combined,
according to estimates reported by the networks themselves and by
advertising agencies, and compiled by Nielsen. Those estimates show
``Good Morning America'' earned about $77 million.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, ``Today'' and ``Good Morning America'' were
``dead even'' in revenue, said a network executive with direct
knowledge of the revenue picture, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``CBS This Morning,'' usually a distant third but
improving recently, earned about $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The news division takeover is widely blamed for the ``Good
Morning America'' decline, but even die-hard devotees of the old
show admit that changes were needed. Its audience was growing
older, and ``Today'' was growing stronger and more competitive in
snapping up the important first interview with the news maker of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the changes backfired, either because they were too
precipitous, were not well thought out, or were poorly communicated
to the staff producing the show, according to interviews with two
dozen people, including some who work on the show now, some who
have left it and executives at all three networks. Many, especially
those still employed at ABC, insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Since Phil Beuth, the president of ``Good Morning America''
under the entertainment division, and Jack Reilly, its executive
producer for seven years, departed in early 1994, the program has
had four executive producers in four years.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped foster high turnover at other levels, especially
among producers and bookers, who are the people who get guests to
commit themselves to appear on the show.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers, the change is most visible in the co-anchors.
Newman, a well-regarded reporter, and Ms. McRee, a former anchor of
ABC's overnight news, of magazine shows and of local news at KABC
in Los Angeles, may be competent, but they were almost unknown when
they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The tension seen on the set began when the news division took
over in 1995, and even some news staffers acknowledge that change
may have been too blunt and too fast, according to accounts from
people on both sides. Many longtime staff members of the show use
the same word _ ``disdain'' _ to describe the attitude they sensed
from the news division.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense when news took over that anyone who worked
there before that was an idiot,'' said Kevin Magee, a former senior
producer who now works at CNBC, the cable business-news channel.
``It was very sad, very hurtful, especially when people were
killing themselves with the work level they gave to that show.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Originally created to be an alternative to ``Today,''
deliberately less newsy and more folksy, ``Good Morning America''
grew popular with little help from the news division. It built its
own news gathering team and its own slate of experts, like doctors,
lawyers and consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find Tim Johnson, Geraldo Rivera, Joel Siegel,''
said Bob Reichblum, the executive producer through all of 1995 and
now the vice president for prime time at CNBC, ``but that became
the signature of the show, its own family of contributors. That
concept started with `GMA' out of necessity, because the show had
no support from ABC News.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Today'' show even copied that ``family'' concept in the
early 1990s, trying to mend its own rifts of 1989 and 1990 after
Jane Pauley quit, Bryant Gumbel criticized colleagues in a memo
leaked to the press and Deborah Norville proved a disastrous
replacement for Ms. Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, ``Today'' got viewers' attention by moving to a new
studio on Rockefeller Center's plaza, where a live audience could
participate, and by 1995, ``Today'' had pulled even in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that ABC News took over, but there was a
history of scant mutual respect between the news division and the
program. By contrast, ``Today'' had the advantage of having always
been an integral part of NBC News, going back to its debut on Jan.
14, 1952, with Dave Garroway as host.
</P>
<P>
   Many longtime ``Good Morning America'' producers and
correspondents were pushed aside, and the number and quality of
their assignments diminished. With producers' roles frequently
changing and the program's top executives tending to rule by
committee, according to most accounts, the show began to appear
chaotic on the air, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulated that Joan Lunden and Gibson would be replaced,
yet the ABC News executives never chose regular substitute anchors
to groom them to fit comfortably into the morning's mix, as
``Today'' had done with Ms. Couric and Lauer. (Lauer co-anchored
almost one-third of the ``Today'' shows in the year before he took
over permanently from Gumbel, according to NBC News.)
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract younger viewers, young contributors were
hired, but they often did not stay long. Cindy Adams, the brassy
New York Post gossip columnist, was added. Many loyal viewers of
the show began to feel they scarcely recognized it.
</P>
<P>
   When Elizabeth Vargas replaced Morton Dean as the show's news
reader, in May 1996, audience research showed that many viewers
were upset, said one ABC executive, who insisted on anonymity. It
was yet another goodbye to a familiar face, and Ms. Vargas was
perceived as openly seeking to replace Joan Lunden as the show's
co-anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Executives did not stick with her either, however; she left a
year later to become a correspondent for the news magazines
``20/20'' and ``Prime Time Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I reported to had no vision whatsoever,'' Reichblum
said. ``It's one thing to say, `You're stale, you have dead wood,
you're not coming up with new ideas.' Nothing's wrong with that, if
you have a plan for how to fix things.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one at `GMA' was opposed to change,'' he said. ``They
recognized that, like any television show, it needed to evolve. But
it did not need a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those responsible for making the changes say complaints
about ``revolution'' are naive. They say the ``family'' so
cherished by longtime ``Good Morning America'' staff members
blocked the integration of new talent into that clan, and did
little to recruit a new generation of viewers. And the ``Today''
ratings were getting stronger, especially in the 18-49 age group
that advertisers covet.
</P>
<P>
   But even these people acknowledge there may have been too much
change, too fast. ``It has lurched back and forth,'' one said.
``For six months this year it tended toward fluffier, lighter
segments, more spontaneity, and then for the last two, three months
it has been trying to get newsy again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indecision like that causes bookers to be less certain about
what sort of guests to pursue, and if they wait to get approval
from a high-level producer, the guest will often already be booked
by ``Today.'' Or, a booker will snare a guest, only to have to call
back and undo the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Indecision can also give the anchors less time to prepare for
interview segments, or make them appear uncomfortable and jittery
shifting between segments.
</P>
<P>
   A nadir mentioned with chagrin by a number of people connected
with the show was the coverage of the crash of TWA Flight 800 into
the sea off Long Island in 1996. ``Good Morning America''
executives decided not to risk sending Gibson to the scene because
technical problems made it questionable whether he could get on the
air. NBC flew Gumbel back from the Atlanta Olympics to anchor the
coverage from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen again, said Shelley Lewis, the show's
current executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra now is substance,'' she said. ``We're trying to be
the most substantive news and information program on television.
The show just has to get a lot better, and then the ratings will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   But the climb back toward No. 1 is much steeper now than it has
ever been for either show, since there is more competition in the
morning than ever _ from local morning shows, like Fox's ``Good Day
New York,'' to cable networks, like ESPN for the sports fan or CNBC
for the business person.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over `Today,' they told me I had two years to fix
that show,'' said Steve Friedman, a former executive producer of
``Today'' who is now vice president and station manager of
WCBS/Channel 2 in New York. ``I did it a lot differently knowing I
had two years than if I'd had to worry about every week, every
month, every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   How long does he think it will take to revitalize ``Good Morning
America''?
</P>
<P>
   ``At least two years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis said bravely, ``Nobody has given me a deadline or a
time frame.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't uncommon for Michael Birck, chief executive of Tellabs
Inc. to arrive early at his headquarters office in Lisle, Ill. But
on Friday, Aug. 21, he was earlier than usual. The company's
shareholders were set to vote on the much-awaited merger with Ciena
Corp., a telecommunications equipment maker, and he had a few
slides to go over before his 10 a.m. presentation.
</P>
<P>
   As he shuffled through a stack of transparencies, his
investor-relations officer knocked on the door with curious news.
Kevin Slocum, an analyst from Soundview Financial Group, had just
called to say that AT&AMP;T, a potentially large Ciena customer, had
abruptly halted its test-run of Ciena's flagship product. ``I don't
know what to do with this,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Birck, who had heard nothing of the sort from Ciena and who knew
that analysts sometimes called with mistaken or misleading tips,
decided to ignore the message as so much noise in the industry
channel.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes now he had listened harder. For he was stunned when _
minutes before shareholders were to vote _ Patrick Nettles, Ciena's
president and chief executive, called with the same troubling news.
AT&AMP;T had just told him it had pulled the plug on its Ciena test.
</P>
<P>
   Birck recalls wondering how the analyst had known even as the
executive helped draft the two-sentence press release he would soon
read to a puzzled group of shareholders in a company auditorium,
informing them that the merger vote would be delayed, pending
further review.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview last week, Birck himself still sounded a bit
puzzled. ``Some things just stand out as a little difficult to
explain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost four months after Ciena and Tellabs announced what some
hailed as the perfect combination, the companies called off their
$7.1 billion merger last Monday, ending one of the oddest corporate
dramas in recent memory. Or make that melodrama _ given the
intrigue, charges of corporate sabotage, laments of fortunes lost,
even a quarterly report that has proved to be a page turner.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it in part on the stock market's plunge, or on the
ever-shifting sands of information technology. But in many ways,
the demise of the Tellabs-Ciena merger is a tale unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what this is going to say about us in time _ the
notoriety of not only working on one of the biggest mergers in
technology history, but also one of the most bizarre,'' said Dan
McCurdy, vice president for marketing and strategic transactions at
Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md.
</P>
<P>
   No one escaped unscathed. Investors who bought stock in Ciena at
the July high of $92.375 have seen the value of those shares
plummet 87 percent, to close at $11.5625 last Friday. Tellabs'
stock price has tumbled 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And both companies, not to mention their investment bankers and
the analysts who follow them, are more than a little embarrassed.
Not only did they underestimate the speed with which Ciena's
technology would come to be viewed as a commodity driven largely by
price, but also the mercurial nature of anxious investors.
</P>
<P>
   The surprises were not as sudden as they might have seemed from
the outside. Birck, in fact, said he had been nervous about the
merger since mid-August, despite telling reporters then that the
deal was ``absolutely on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tellabs agreed to acquire Ciena in June for stock, the
attraction was chiefly Ciena's vaunted technology that can vastly
increase the information-carrying capacity of fiber-optic cables.
Those capabilities would complement Tellabs' core product _
equipment that enables digital circuits to communicate with one
another in public telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   And with Tellabs' well-trained sales force, Ciena could expand
its small customer list, making the combined two powerful enough to
take on bigger rivals like Lucent Technologies and Alcatel Alsthom.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing Birck did not want was a deal that would
dilute future earnings. That did not appear to be a problem,
because analysts had estimated Ciena's fiscal 1999 revenue at $880
million.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a warning from Nettles on Aug. 14 that
third-quarter earnings would be less than half of estimates, in
part because of delays in a $25 million order Ciena had been
expecting from a regional carrier, Digital Teleport Inc. The
company, concerned about price, ultimately gave the contract to an
affiliate of Pirelli SpA, an Italian tire and cable company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to do a little bit of soul-searching,'' Birck said.
``We thought it was now a riskier venture.''
</P>
<P>
   So did investors, after Ciena announced the projected shortfall
that same day. Its stock fell from a high of $61 a share that day
to close at $54.125, an 11 percent drop. Tellabs' share price fell
as well _ 8 percent _ to close at $58.125.
</P>
<P>
   The next Friday brought word that AT&AMP;T had abandoned its Ciena
test. After hearing that the analyst, Slocum, knew this before
Ciena, Nettles called his AT&AMP;T contact, hoping to ferret out the
source of the leak. (Ciena executives said they had communicated
with Slocum, too, which he confirmed, though neither party would
comment further.)
</P>
<P>
   Nettles was concerned with AT&AMP;T's ties to Ciena's rival, Lucent,
which had been spun off from AT&AMP;T less than two years earlier. But
when he asked another AT&AMP;T contact to talk to the chairman and
chief executive, Michael Armstrong, about the canceled tests,
Nettles said he was discouraged from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles had long considered the AT&AMP;T-Lucent relationship a bit
too cozy. AT&AMP;T, he said, tested Ciena's products in a laboratory on
the same floor of a building that AT&AMP;T shared with Lucent
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the laboratory was secured by locks, he said,
mysterious accidents occurred with the Ciena test equipment. Once
some fiber-optic cables were found broken. Another time, a
power-supply circuit board failed during a test, filling the area
with smoke from melted plastic. ``It is the only example of it ever
happening,'' Nettles said. ``AT&AMP;T had control of that space. But
who knows how much?''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena's relationship may have soured because AT&AMP;T demanded more
timely responses to its questions about the products being tested.
Nettles concedes that Ciena sometimes fell short in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ciena and Tellabs share prices took another hit
when they disclosed news of the AT&AMP;T cancellation. And even a week
later, when they announced a renegotiated $4.74 billion price tag
for Ciena _ the result of a five-hour session at Tellabs' lawyers'
offices in Washington on the evening of Wednesday, Aug. 26 _
investors were far from reassured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured lightning could always strike twice,'' said one
trader who stampeded out of the stock on Friday, Aug. 28, racking
up losses of more than $1 million. And some people in the industry
estimate that arbitragers _ who trade in takeover stocks _ have
lost as much as $500 million on their investments in both Tellabs
and Ciena, which could wipe out many of the arbitragers' monthly,
if not yearly, profits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at Tellabs headquarters that same Friday, the
investor relations officer, Tom Scottino, received an anonymous
e-mail stating that Ciena falsified test results on certain
equipment _ a copy of which had been sent to CNBC. ``This one
seemed so bizarre I forwarded it to our general counsel,'' Scottino
said.
</P>
<P>
   And to Ciena executives, who sought to find the author. Ciena
executives have concluded that it was sent at 3:47 a.m. _ three
hours after the renegotiating session ended _ and say it can be
traced back to an Internet account that was established the
previous day, with the message originating from an unspecified
Lucent office in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy of Ciena described the e-mail's message as a twisting of
facts based on confidential information that ``no one outside of
AT&AMP;T would know.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would not comment. And Nettles stops short of accusing AT&AMP;T
or Lucent of sabotage. ``I have not made accusations,'' he said.
But his lawyers are demanding an explanation. A Lucent spokesman
said last Friday that the company had not received a copy of the
e-mail, but would investigate any evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Nettles had more serious problems on his mind than the
mysterious e-mail when he called Birck with more alarming news on
the Friday before Labor Day. Ciena's management had reanalyzed its
business prospects and found that ``fourth-quarter revenues could
go as low as $90 million,'' Nettles told him. The first quarter of
1999 looked about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a loss?'' a surprised Birck asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Nettles replied.
</P>
<P>
   Birck sighed. Word of the third-quarter revenue shortfall had
been bad enough. Now this bombshell. ``I think our shareholders are
going to rebel,'' he told Nettles. Birck knew Ciena faced stiff
competition, but even analysts who had already reduced Ciena's
fiscal 1999 revenue estimates had not predicted this kind of
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Birck recalled, ``it's not what you do to
save this thing, but how do you get out of it.'' He called each of
his board members personally the next week, before telling Nettles
on Sept. 10 to say that termination papers would be delivered by
his lawyers. When that happened, ``my feeling was one of relief,''
Birck said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Nettles, who now faces the challenge of keeping Ciena
as a viable independent company. The company still has its
acclaimed technology, he said, and $200 million in cash. But it
also has a battered share price.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that Ciena could have done a better job tending to
its customers while waiting for the merger to be approved. But in
an unusually angry quarterly report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission last Monday, the day the companies called off
their merger, Ciena blamed an unnamed competitor and an
unidentified short-seller with ``orchestrated activities'' that
influenced adverse media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply the latest twist in this most puzzling of
corporate tales.

   RUSSIA-LEBED (Krasnoyarsk) _ Russia's financial crisis has not

 &HT;    Married . . . with TV: `King' a blue-collar kid
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug has been married for three years, works hard as a parcel
deliveryman and is a lovable, little kid.
</P>
<P>
   When wife Carrie tells him he's going to dinner at his in-laws',
Doug _ a 2-ton baby in an adult's body _ whines, ``C'mon, Carrie,
please. Don't make me go to that bad place.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug is ``The King of Queens'' (8:30 tonight on CBS), the lord
of his New York row house and the latest in a long line of
adorable, know-nothing males who populate TV's adorable blue-collar
sitcoms. Like Tim Allen in ``Home Improvement'' and Ray Romano in
``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to like Doug (nicely played by stand-up comic
Kevin James). He's honest, caring and overjoyed by the warm glow of
a new 70-inch TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   That bigger than big TV is the heart of tonight's ``King''
debut, and it's a promising start. Doug's pals pile in like Little
Rascals to watch sports. His too-understanding wife (admirably
played by Leah Remini, an escapee from last season's dreadful
``Fired Up'') towers above their juvenile ways. And adding depth to
the wacko mix are Jerry Stiller, reprising his Frank Costanza
antics from ``Seinfeld'' as Carrie's dad Arthur, and Lisa Rieffel,
playing her ditsy sister, wannabe actress Sara.
</P>
<P>
   Getting all these family members under one roof (it wouldn't be
TV if it didn't happen) is pretty much a stitch _ far funnier than
``Home Improvement'' these days and a nice warm-up to the superior
``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough road starts next week. That's when Episode 2 of
``King'' drops back and punts, trying to generate laughs by having
rotund Doug worry incessantly over whether a slender Carrie is
gaining weight and will eventually blimp out.
</P>
<P>
   Can a husky king love a husky queen?
</P>
<P>
   That's when female viewers might decide that ``King's'' humor is
a
</P>
<P>
   little thin.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Raymond hates termites
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' moves to a new time slot tonight (at
9 on CBS ), forcing those who once used it as a running start into
Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' to make a choice between the two.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because ``Raymond'' was TV's best pre-9 p.m.
show, a family sitcom for adults. Tonight's season opener features
some coarser language than usual, as if that'll make it sound older
for those not already tucked into bed. But the rest is pure, if not
classic, ``Raymond'': Ray (Ray Romano) and Debra (Patricia Heaton)
find termites in their house and are forced to move the family in
with Ray's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Parents as beloved enemies is at the root of this show's
success, and tonight Doris Roberts, as Ray's mother, Marie, shows
again why she's as good a supporting sitcom actress as there is on
TV.

   A dark, dreary `Bay'
</P>
<P>
   No one's happy on ``Hyperion Bay'' (9 tonight on WB ). Not
Dennis Sweeny (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), a high school nerd now all
grown up and ready to show off his white-collar success with
computers to his tired hometown. Not his older blue-collar brother,
Nick (Dylan Neal), whose marriage is crumbling. And certainly not
his pop, Frank (Raymond J. Barry), who's caught between feuding
sons angling for attention.
</P>
<P>
   This hour bummer bristles with the darkest, dreariest strains of
``thirtysomething'' _ as you imagine it would since it comes from
Joseph Dougherty, a writer, director and producer for that dark,
dreary show.
</P>
<P>
   ``thirtysomething'' took time to develop. Since it airs opposite
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Monday Night Football,'' time is the one
thing ``Hyperion'' hasn't got.

   Might as well call ``Conrad Bloom'' (8:30 tonight on NBC )
``Conrad in the City,'' since this new sitcom was created by
``Caroline's'' producer Marco Pennette and stars Mark Feuerstein,
who played her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a nice young mensch surrounded by difficult women _ his
stereotypically Jewish mother (Linda Lavin), needy best friend,
nutty sister, neurotic co-worker. Taxing him further is Steve
Landesberg (``Barney Miller''), the best thing in the show as a
burned-out ex-whiz now partnered with Conrad at their ad agency.
Just another by-the-numbers NBC comedy that doesn't distinguish
itself.

watch the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brian Benben Show,'' which debuts at 9:30 tonight on CBS
and stars that guy with the redundant name, tries to milk laughs
from one very dry cow. It wants to be the light sex farce that the
likable Benben fit perfectly into in ``Dream On,'' but it comes up
far short.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting two new reporters, a Barbie and a Ken, the
soon-to-be-replaced Benben remarks ``So young and clean and shiny.
They're about to smile!'' They then cover their eyes, as if
shielding them from a solar eclipse. Hey, it's a gag. If that
doesn't hurt you enough, they bomb away with double entendres.
``I'd pour coffee in your lap if I thought I'd hit anything.''
Guess the bomb dropped on them.

 &HT;    Some haven't taken shine to laser light
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laser pointers are one of the hot novelty toys of the year, a
hit with teens and Gen-Xers who like to shine their bright red
lights on walls, movie screens and other people.
</P>
<P>
   While not as visible in Atlanta as in other parts of the
country, the pointers are getting a workout, from impromptu concert
light show to high-tech cat toy. They project a red dot of light up
to hundreds of feet away, somewhat unnerving for those who confuse
them with the similar-looking beam from the laser scope of a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' spotlighted the pointers last spring, as George
struggled to find the tormenter who kept shining a red light on a
movie screen and on him in a darkened theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who do it think it's hysterical,'' says Crystal
Brown, a senior at Forest Park High School.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the dividing line: There are those who point
and those who are pointed at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a little kid with one in the movie theater and I said,
`If he keeps flashing that thing when the movie starts, I'm going
to go down there and grab him,''' says Mary Stimmel of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The kid shut it off, but lots of others don't. Use them during a
Concert/ Southern Promotions show, and you lose your laser and your
entry to the concert. World Championship Wrestling asks fans before
all televised matches to pocket their pointers or risk
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even one's just too much. When you have a dark house and
you're trying to create atmosphere and mood and somebody does
something like that, it distracts,'' says Concert/Southern
President Peter Conlon.
</P>
<P>
   Some metro school systems, including Fayette and Cobb counties,
have banned laser pointers. They've been banned in such communities
as Virginia Beach, Va., and Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Isaac of Peachtree City isn't allowed to take his pointer
to school or church, but says he's seen them whisked out between
classes at Booth Middle School. During class, the gadgets are
always under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it to sleep-overs and we take them out and shine them
on cars that go by,'' the 14-year-old says.
</P>
<P>
   The ink pen-sized pointer, which he bought for $20, can cast a
red dot up to 1,200 feet away. Several companies make the pointers,
which became hot sellers as their prices dropped from several
hundred dollars to less than $25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to shine on people when they don't know you're
shining it on them,'' Josh says. Mindful of the potential harm the
powerful light could cause, he says he never shines the pointer
directly into anyone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A Food and Drug Administration warning on the product cautions
that the lasers can cause more eye damage than staring directly
into the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Phillips of Kingston tried to return her 15-year-old son
Nathaniel's pointer after learning of the FDA warning, but the
store wouldn't take it back.
</P>
<P>
   But even she'll admit that there's a certain appeal to it.
``It's incredible what this thing will do,'' she says. ``I can see
how the kids think it's cool.''

 &HT;    Klein skirts and dresses survive stumbles, uncoordinated colors
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a model tripped and fell to one knee during
Calvin Klein's spring/summer 1999 runway preview Friday night, it
signaled a turning point in an otherwise flawlessly executed show.
The incident, which came 57 outfits into Klein's 79-outfit show,
also symbolized the stumbling block that derailed many of the
collections shown throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   The model, identified only as Angela, was wearing a fire-red,
sheer and strapless stretch evening gown with a zippered slit
running up one side. Her pratfall gave those in the
standing-room-only crowd reason to reconsider the desirability of
the only shoe Klein showed for next season: leather mules in black,
beige or brown, with heels that looked like roofing nails.
</P>
<P>
   What followed the incident, which sparked a chorus of gasps, was
a calvacade of Klein's ``surprise'' styles for next season's
soirees: layered sheer slip dresses in such color-over-color
combinations as pink and green, green and blue, pink and gold. The
look carried all the ``drama'' Klein intended it to as the
side-slit, bias-cut layers of jersey danced around the models'
scant contours. But the odd mix of colors also injected the
collection with an element of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Would a woman really feel elegant wearing such uncoordinated
colors? And how willling will she be to pay for two separate
dresses _ underwear not included _ in order to achieve this look?
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Klein's message, however, couldn't have been
clearer. From his standpoint, women should wear (knee-length)
skirts and dresses much more often than pants. The former
outnumbered the latter by a 6-to-1 ratio. And, predictably, most of
Klein's collection came in a subtle mix of neutrals; i.e., a cream
silk/canvas jacket with a sheer white tank top and a beige cotton
stretch skirt, or a metallic grey suit with a steel-blue,
suede-textured tank.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were cut to look curvy and comfortable.
Distinguishing features included the zippered skirt slits;
needle-thin streaks of red, green or metallic embroidery; wrap
skirts with Napoleonic pockets; concealed closures on jackets;
raw-edged linen waistbands; muted plaids and a revolutionary new
``crushed'' wool fabrication that's weightless and intentionally
wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   Weightless, wrinkled fabrications were also central to the
spring/summer '99 collection by Vivienne Tam, whose runway show
closed the first of a full five weeks of previews in the fashion
capitals of New York, London, Milan, Paris and New York again.
</P>
<P>
   Tam took a waxed-paper fabric and cut it into: cheeky short
shorts; collarless zip-front blouses and jackets; skirts and
dresses that ranged from mini- to maxi-length; and swingy trench
coats. Another innovative fabric Tam employed was one of rubberized
mesh that she calls ``Airtex.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion editors agreed that the most attractive outfit shown was
the purple paper skirt and matching sheer cotton sweater that Tam
herself wore when she appeared from backstage to accept rousing
applause.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the show was further testament to Tam's mastery of
intricate embroidery and beading, her creative fearlessness and her
flair for melding modernity with femininity. At its worst _
specifically, a grouping of palm-leaf-print separates in rust and
wine shades _ Tam's collection was too busy to suit the tastes of
women who're becoming increasingly enamored of simplicity.

 &HT;    Southern impact on works key topic
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Toni Morrison's novel ``Jazz,'' Joe and Violet
Trace board ``the colored section of the Southern Sky'' in 1906 and
leave Virginia for a Northern city. As the train nears their new
home, they are ``nervous at having gotten there at last, but
terrified of what was on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Violet represent the nearly 4 million African-Americans
who took part in the ``great migration'' from the largely agrarian
South to the urban North from Reconstruction through the world
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nobel laureate Morrison was born in Lorain, Ohio, her
parents had been among those who moved north, and the background of
her novels offer rich readings of the meaning of the South in the
lives of her urban characters.
</P>
<P>
   That richness is the context for ``Toni Morrison and the
American South,'' a five-day conference beginning Wednesday at
Georgia State University. As many as 200 scholars and readers will
attend the events, sponsored by the Toni Morrison Society.
</P>
<P>
   In a public session benefiting the society, Morrison will read
from ``Paradise'' and answer questions at 8 p.m. Saturday at the
Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to make Toni Morrison into a Southern
writer,'' says Carolyn Denard, the GSU associate professor of
English who has spent two years organizing the conference. But ``if
we talk about blacks in the North from 1865 to the 1930s and try to
understand their psyche, their sense of self, we've got to
understand their relationship to the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Denard is among those interested in how Morrison portrays the
ways migrants dealt with their Southern pasts and constructed
modern urban selves in the North. ``You have to travel to see your
culture,'' she says. ``That's when its distinctiveness becomes
apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's father was about 14 when he left Cartersville, Ga. at
the turn of the century, and her mother was about 6 when she moved
north from Alabama. In an interview with Denard, to be published in
November in the GSU journal Studies in the Literary Imagination,
Morrison discusses the sense of the South she gained from her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had diametrically opposed positions,'' Morrison says in
the interview. Her father remembered Georgia racism, while her
mother had fonder memories and was nostalgic. Even so, her father
returned for yearly visits while her mother never went back. ``I
grew up with a complicated notion of the South, neither sentimental
nor wholly frightening,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Morrison discusses what the South means for
African-Americans. While ``for us, it's home, I guess, in the sense
that it was the first stop when you left the ancient home,'' she
struggles to keep the South from ``being just the old place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What black people did in this country was brand new,'' she
tells Denard. The people were inventive, she says, creating, among
other things, ``a music that is the world's music, a style, a
matter of speaking, a relationship with each other. . . . And no
one gives us credit for the intelligence it takes to be forced into
another culture, be oppressed, and make a third thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's literature and the multidisciplinary conference
reflect that creativity. Events include a Dwight Andrews Jazz
Quintet performance of an original tribute to Morrison's works, the
Spelman College Readers' Theater ``Talking Drum,'' an exhibit and
lecture by artist Michele Wood and a visit to Cartersville, the
birthplace of Morrison's father. Conference fees are $150 ($75 for
students).

`SPORTS NIGHT' AND `THE BRIAN BENBEN SHOW': GOINGS-ON BEHIND THE
SMILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We seem minutes away from an all-``Dateline'' channel, and
show-business gossip is a growth industry; no wonder two of the
season's most likable sitcoms are set behind the scenes of
fictional quasi-news programs and take a shrewd look at television
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The sharply written ``Sports Night'' (beginning Tuesday) and the
goofy ``Brian Benben Show'' (which has its premiere Monday night)
have radically different styles, but share a media-savvy attitude.
The freshness of their comic approaches can be measured by how far
they have come from ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' still the
godmother of all sitcoms that find humor in an associate producer's
job.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy laced with sincerity, ``Sports Night'' is about a cable
show by that name, resembling ESPN's ``Sports Center,'' but it
works perfectly well for viewers who can't tell a Met from a Yankee
(trust me).
</P>
<P>
   The hosts of the fictional ``Sports Night'' are Dan (Josh
Charles) and Casey (Peter Krause), who in the first episode is
newly divorced and worn down by too many stories about millionaire
athletes getting into bar brawls. ``I've turned into a PR man for
punks and thugs,'' Casey says, as the show deftly brings sports
into more general terrain. These actors are smooth, but so far
their characters are less vivid than those of the staff around them
and less bracing than the traces of cynicism in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac (Robert Guillaume), their executive producer, says he's
close to firing everyone because Casey's slump is hurting the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you won't, because we're all family here and I'm just like
a daughter to you,'' says Dana (Felicity Huffman), the show's brisk
producer, with an acknowledgment that they have inherited the Mary
Richards and Lou Grant roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is a television show here and you're very much like
an employee to me,'' Isaac says. That is partly true, but it is
also the kind of smoke screen Lou would have created. The entire
staff protects Casey (and next week Dan) from the network suits,
today's equivalent of bad guys in black hats.
</P>
<P>
   The series is acted with razorlike timing. In the first
episode's funniest, snappiest scene, Dana interviews Jeremy (Joshua
Malina), an endearingly insecure sports geek, for a job as a
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   And the attention to crisp dialogue sets this show apart from
most others. ``Sports Night'' was created by, and the first two
episodes written by, Aaron Sorkin, with a swift rhythm to its
language, and even a staccato echo of his play and screenplay for
``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times Sorkin spells out clumsily what real people would
never say. ``I love producing `Sports Night,''' Dana tells Casey.
``I live from 11 to midnight and the rush is so huge I don't come
down till 3 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second episode, Dan is asked to apologize on the air for
saying in a magazine interview that marijuana should be legal. That
leads to a speech and a slightly mawkish ending. What saves this
immensely appealing series from its own preachy impulses is that we
can always feel its awkwardly phrased ``rush'' of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The more lightweight ``Brian Benben Show'' is built on a common
but true assumption: the Ted Baxters of the world have taken over
local news, that broadest and most irresistible of television
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Benben, best known as the fantasizing Martin Tupper of the HBO
series ``Dream On,'' inspires sympathy here as a character named
Brian Benben. He has been pushed aside as an anchor at a Los
Angeles station in favor of two young, plastic airheads. ``Ken and
Barbie have entered the building,'' Benben's colleagues say when
they spot the new anchors. Benben is handed a fluffy human-interest
segment called ``L.A. Story.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mini-homage to the famous ``Mary Tyler Moore'' episode in
which Chuckles the Clown, dressed as a peanut, is crushed to death
by an elephant, we see Benben's predecessor on ``L.A. Story'' meet
his end. He does a story at the zoo and is crushed to death by a
lovelorn ape. His funeral is crammed with people he has covered,
including Professor Kazoo and Miss Garlic. Now all that is
Benben's.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath this silliness, though, Benben shares much of the
sardonic attitude of Martin Tupper. The series' tone is set by his
vindictive attitude toward his gloating replacement, Chad Rockwell
(Charles Esten), who is evil but happens to have great hair. With
its surface giddiness and sight gags and its undertone of mordant
wit, ``The Brian Benben Show'' plays better than it sounds and is
much sharper than CBS' lame promos for it suggest. It is not the
most hyped series of the season, but could turn out to be one of
the most enjoyable.

YEAR 2000 COMPROMISE BILL OPPOSED BY TRIAL LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (lb) 
 By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A compromise effort by Congress and the Clinton
administration to promote candid information about year 2000
problems in the United States' computers is being assailed by trial
lawyers because a cornerstone of the plan would grant computer and
chip makers immunity from liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of proposed legislation say such immunity is needed
to encourage high-technology companies to acknowledge hidden
problems that could cause computers and electronic devices to
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the bill would allow thousands of companies
to shirk their responsibilities for having sold products that cause
problems ranging from the merely annoying to the catastrophic, or
having made repairs that failed to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this bill does is lower the standard of care for a
supplier,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said during heated Senate
Judiciary Committee debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would protect companies by allowing them to issue
written statements about their readiness for the year 2000, or Y2K,
with the guarantee that the statements could not be used as an
admission of liability in court unless the information was provided
recklessly or with the intention to deceive.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to make it easier for businesses to hold candid
conversations with suppliers, vendors and others, supporters say.
In addition to protecting companies from suits, it protects them
from antitrust violations when sharing information on year 2000
flaws.

 &HT;    Managed care manages to make our blood boil
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We are driving away from the medical
laboratory over on 45th Street in West Palm Beach and I am
explaining to a 7-year-old why his mother just behaved like a
raving lunatic. Indeed, I am trying to figure it out myself.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I glare so at the woman in the little white coat and,
teeth clenched, spit out the order: Give me my paperwork now.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe I even said please, even though it wasn't her
fault my doctor's office hadn't given her the right information to
do the blood work they'd ordered.
</P>
<P>
   So now, here we are, this kid and I, navigating our way home in
the pouring rain, and I am giving The Talk. The one about being a
good listener and doing what you know is right in your heart.
</P>
<P>
   The one about treating other people the way you want to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Parents might as well give this talk to a tree, any one will do,
and I realize this (again) when he gives me that vacant
second-grader stare and says, ``Can we have McDonald's tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   And I nearly pull over and start bawling because, see, I'm
angry.
</P>
<P>
   I'm angry about health care. I'm angry about doctors.
</P>
<P>
   I'm angry about the busy signal I get when I call them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm mad because it takes forever to get an appointment. I'm mad
because the first question anyone asks is not what hurts but,
``What kind of insurance do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm mad because the women back at the medical lab on 45th Street
just behaved as poorly as I did. Rude, tired and humorless.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Dr. Jana Rasmussen, a West Palm Beach plastic
surgeon and president of the Palm Beach County Medical Society, has
to say about all this.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's cranky.
</P>
<P>
   She explains it like this:
</P>
<P>
   Doctors today don't feel in charge. They have to call managed
care companies for permission on stuff that used to be everyday,
run-of-the-mill. Rasmussen says getting through to those companies
is even worse than dialing a doctor's office. (Sure.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some studies say that if doctors spend more than
seven minutes _ seven minutes! _ with each patient, they'll lose
money, Rasmussen says.
</P>
<P>
   Now I don't know about you, but by the time I get in to see the
doctor, I've got seven minutes of complaining to do about how I
couldn't find their office before I even get to what ails me.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen says we're all at fault. The doctors. Their staff. The
lab folks. Everybody. Even me and you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with these managed care carriers and their
rules and their denials,'' says Rasmussen. ``So our staff is angry
and upset. Then you have all the people in the labs. And then you
have the angry patients.''
</P>
<P>
   She calls it a nasty ``cycle of angryism'' and assures me it
won't get any better until we pressure our Florida legislators to
change the laws on health care. After watching what happened to
Hillary, I am not holding my breath.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is the minute I call a doctor's office and I get the
least little bit of a run-around, I turn on the attitude. I'm
nasty. I'm forceful. I'm tired and put-out. So are they. And I'm
not sure who started it first, but that is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Point is, nobody's treating anybody the way we'd all like to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Time for The Talk.
</P>
<P>
   We all need to be nice. We all need to be patient. We all need
to smile and exchange names.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, we're not stopping at McDonald's for dinner.
</P>

DALLAS IS OFTEN THE MEASURE OF THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the modern era of the National Football League, no team has
helped define the success or failure of any Giants season quite
like the Dallas Cowboys. Year after year, how the Giants have fared
against the Cowboys has tended to mark the team's season _
positively or negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice since 1960 _ when the Cowboys and the Giants first
met _ have the Giants had a winning season without defeating the
Cowboys at least once. The series between the teams is strewn with
landmark games.
</P>
<P>
   The first Giants game at Giants Stadium 22 years ago was against
the Cowboys _ the Giants lost. The first National Football
Conference East game in 1970 was a Giants-Cowboys game _ the Giants
lost. After losing 12 consecutive games to the Cowboys in the late
1970s, the first Giants playoff season in 18 years wasn't clinched
until the Giants had defeated the high-flying Cowboys in overtime
in the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' rivalry with the Washington Redskins may be longer,
their rivalry with San Francisco more bitter, and their rivalry
with the Jets more regionally significant, but for two decades or
more, it's the Cowboys by which the Giants have often measured
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be so again this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to know if the Cowboys will be the Giants'
principal competition in the division this season. The preseason
consensus was that their chief rival would be Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But for Monday night's game at Giants Stadium, once again it is
the Cowboys who arrive at a pivotal juncture in the Giants' season.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did a year ago. Just as they did 17 years ago, and
any number of years in between.
</P>
<P>
   Last season when the Cowboys came to town, the Giants were a
team in search of itself after a staggering 2-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to remember the 1997 Cowboys now as a team in
disarray that won just six games. On Oct. 5 last year, the Cowboys
arrived as the defending NFC East champions with a 3-1 record in
1997. They knocked the Giants' starting quarterback, Dave Brown,
out of the game with a chest strain, and his backup, Danny Kanell,
took over with the team trailing by 3-0 as the game wound into the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell did not turn the ball over, playing just well enough to
rally the Giants to a 20-17 victory, the second of five successive
victories that sparked them to an undefeated division record and
the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Giants, then the youngest team in the National
Football League, took confidence from their defeat of the Cowboys.
It was the first time in five years that the first meeting of the
season between the Giants and the Cowboys had not been a lopsided
Dallas victory, and it had the Giants believing not only in Kanell,
but also in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that Giants-Cowboys game with the one three years ago _
the last time the Giants played on ``Monday Night Football.''
Emmitt Smith burst up the field for 60 yards and a touchdown on his
first carry of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who had been 9-7 in 1994, contended that they were
ready to challenge the Cowboys for supremacy in the division. The
Cowboys won that 1995 season-opening game, 35-0, on their way to a
Super Bowl championship. The Giants lost 11 games and finished
fourth in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other notable Giants-Cowboys games, including
some eventful struggles in the late 1960s and in 1970, when the
Giants were trying to wrest a division championship from the
ascendant Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But two other games stand out among the rest in a series the
Cowboys lead, 44-25-2.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of the 1993 regular season (it was actually
Jan. 2, 1994), the 11-4 Cowboys came to Giants Stadium to face the
Giants, who had the same record. The division title, and more
important, home field throughout the playoffs would go to the
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 13-0 at the half, the Giants rallied to send the
game to overtime. A controversial penalty against Giants center
Brian Williams cost them an overtime scoring opportunity. Shortly
thereafter, in a game played under dark skies, things got truly
gloomy for the Giants as Eddie Murray of Dallas kicked a 41-yard
field goal to win the game, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won their opening-round playoff game, but were blown
out in San Francisco in the conference semifinal game. Another
Dallas Super Bowl championship followed.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's field goal wasn't the only one in overtime between
these teams to set a historic playoff course. In 1981, on a
Saturday during the final weekend of the regular season, the Giants
needed to defeat the Cowboys to qualify for the playoffs for the
first time since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Joe Danelo, who had missed two short field goals in the
first half, made a 40-yard field goal into a strong wind to tie the
score with 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter. In overtime,
Danelo missed another field goal. Then, he converted from 35 yards
for the Giants' 13-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of Giants fans who had never seen their team in
the NFL postseason, Danelo's last act on the Giants Stadium field
that long, tense day 17 years ago is still the kick that liberated
a storied franchise from a dismal, doleful period. It's the baby
step on the path to the Giants' first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That it came against the Cowboys no doubt makes it all the more
memorable.

HOLYFIELD WINS BUT DOESN'T IMPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield absorbed several big blows late in his fight
against Vaughn Bean on Saturday night, going 12 rounds against an
opponent who many observers thought might last three. The champion
was not awful, but he was not awesome, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bean, the International Boxing Federation's No. 1 contender,
could not do enough to take Holyfield's two belts away, but he may
have raised some concern about Holyfield's ability to unify the
heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Styles make fights, and he had a very awkward one,'' Holyfield
said after winning a unanimous decision against Bean at the Georgia
Dome in Atlanta before 41,357, the largest boxing crowd in 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis would not have been moving,'' Holyfield said of
the World Boxing Council champion.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield-Lewis is no closer to being made than Ali-Foreman II.
There are mandatory defenses to take care of, purses to divide and
bidding from different sites.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Holyfield's age. He turns 36 in October, and given
how he looked before his hometown fans, it is reasonable to wonder
how much longer he can hold the IBF and World Boxing Association
titles. His next fight, probably against the No. 1 WBA contender,
Henry Akinwande, will be Holyfield's 40th.
</P>
<P>
   As he said his goal was to unify the title and then ``hang up
the _ '' the promoter Don King quickly interrupted his new meal
ticket. (King's former meal ticket, Mike Tyson, is suing him.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's close the books on that right now,'' King said. ``No one
asked Rockefeller when he was going to stop pumping the oil. So no
one should ask us when we're going to stop making the money. This
is Evander Holyfield's time. He set the record tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield promoted himself to his fellow Atlantans in the weeks
leading to the bout, and he was rewarded with the largest crowd to
see a fight since 63,350 piled into the Superdome in New Orleans to
see Muhammad Ali against Leon Spinks in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The people who paid from $25 to $500 a ticket got to see
Holyfield (36-3) force the action and drop Bean in the 10th round
with a vicious right uppercut. He appeared to have pushed Bean into
the ropes before the punch, but the ring referee ruled it a legal
knockdown.
</P>
<P>
   Using his forearms and elbows to bull his shorter and less
athletic opponent around the ring (the pudgy Bean stands 5 feet 11
inches and weighed 231 pounds, while the 6-2 Holyfield weighed
217), the champion won 117-110 on two scorecards and 116-111 on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   But his penchant for trading shots inside instead of boxing from
the perimeter got him in trouble at times. Bean (31-2) did not have
the size or the power of Riddick Bowe, who knocked Holyfield out in
their last fight. But the punches he did land _ clubbing overhand
rights that Holyfield said he could not see coming because of the
angle _ caught Holyfield flush.

 &HT;    Is all lost? As nation airs the president's sins, some aren't
rushing to judgment
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General News and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not just the president.
</P>
<P>
   The whole country has slipped morally. Or so we believe.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the past through a rosy rearview mirror, we see a
time when our leaders were noble and our word was our bond. Today,
we're awash in gross-out movies, nasty talk radio, rude drivers,
ill-behaved children and mendacious politicians.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions have convinced many people that we're headed
for Hades in a handbasket. Three out of every four respondents to a
recent Washington Post poll said the country is in a serious moral
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even shocked any more,'' says Julie Rogers-Martin,
director of Christian education at Columbia Presbyterian Church in
Decatur. ``Nobody's going to call(President Clinton) on the carpet
in Washington, because they're all doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so it would seem. Revelations in recent weeks that several
leading Republicans, including Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, have indulged in adulterous affairs add to the
impression that our elected leaders are perennially auditioning for
``Oh, Calcutta!''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Josephson, a California millionaire who sold his company
to start a nonprofit foundation devoted to teaching ethics, is
another who's worried. The latest Josephson Institute survey of
10,000 high school students, to be released in two weeks, indicates
that kids are lying, cheating and stealing more often.
</P>
<P>
   Though Josephson won't reveal the figures until the biennial
report is published, he said this year's survey register a sharp
rise from 1996, when ``39 percent admitted they stole from a store
in the last year, 63 percent said they had cheated on an exam in
the last year and 25 percent said they lied to get or keep a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Josephson, ``There's a hole in the moral ozone, and it's
getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we tolerant of Clinton's behavior because of our own sagging
standards? The Post survey, also conducted by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation, found that even among those seven out of
10 who said adultery ``should not be tolerated,'' fewer than half
said the president's dalliance was an important matter. While we
look to the Internet for the details of his Oval Office trysts with
Monica Lewinsky and Americans wait to view their chief executive
explaining himself on videotape (to be released this morning), his
job ratings remain high. Polls conducted after the Starr report was
released show Clinton's job approval rating unchanged at more than
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book ``The Death of Outrage,'' former Bush Cabinet
member William Bennett contends that the ``moral exhaustion'' of
many Americans makes them reluctant to judge Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The men of Congregation Etz Chaim aren't convinced. In the
Jewish calendar, the season of Rosh Hashana, which began Sunday, is
a time for confession and repentance. The consensus of this group
of men meeting for breakfast after morning prayers (or ``morning
minyon'') at the east Cobb County synagogue, is that all of us have
plenty to confess.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's acts were abhorrent, but the rest of us aren't so hot
either, said Larry Travis, 67, a former police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jesus said it best,'' Steve Dix, 47, a Sandy Springs
lawyer, said as he munched a bagel with cream cheese with the group
at the Bagelicious deli on Johnson Ferry Road. ``Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that we are any more sinful than past generations. ``I don't
think morals in this socioeconomic class are any different than
they were 50 years ago,'' Dix said.
</P>
<P>
   But times are more complicated, said Harold Sarles, 75, a
retired podiatrist. Much is made of the fact that the younger
generations are spoiled, that they've never had to suffer an
economic depression or a world war. But Sarles, who participated in
the invasion of Normandy (``D-Day, H-Hour plus 28 minutes''), said
the current generation has problems he never encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I don't have young children now, and I'm glad I'm not
16 or 17 myself because I know I'd end up trying drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are threatened by new and different troubles, such
as AIDS and economic uncertainty, says Emory theologian Elizabeth
M. Bounds. They are pressured to succeed by parents who themselves
work long hours. ``Our social structures are leading us to
anxiety,'' says Bounds, associate professor of Christian ethics at
the Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   Pop moralists such as radio talk show host Laura Schlessinger
tell us ``if we just get our moral values straight then it will all
work out,'' Bounds said. But it's not that simple. ``We should
still be doing that, but we will do that against a background of
complex lives,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bounds said she's reluctant to believe in a moral decline or any
mythical golden age. ``Fifty years ago, to say blacks were inferior
was morally acceptable for many people in this country,'' she
points out. ``It is no longer acceptable to make assumptions of
black inferiority and female inferiority. In certain ways our
public discourse has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread feeling of a slide in standards and behavior may
be due to a particularly tumultuous summer, said Gerald Celente,
director of the Trend Research Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y. ``Look
what has happened just since August,'' says Celente, counting off
disasters: an unraveling stock market, missiles launched against
Sudan and Afghanistan, the collapse of Russia and the president
caught with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course people are concerned,'' Celente said. ``There's a
sense of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephson, whose survey gives evidence that young people are
straying, said his findings also indicate that youngsters still
know right from wrong. The failing, he says, is more ``a question
of moral will power not moral sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And, says Josephson, our tolerance of Clinton may be a pragmatic
decision rather than a moral choice. ``I don't think for a minute
Clinton could be re-elected again, nor would he be nominated,'' he
says. ``But would we throw him out of office? That's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite worries about what a moral example our tolerance might
be setting for our children, this scandal may serve as a salutary
lesson, Josephson says.
</P>
<P>
   Sarles agrees. The World War II veteran says the story of
Clinton may become a warning: ``You can be the greatest man in the
world, you can be the president, but look at what will happen if
you lie.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not just the president.
</P>
<P>
   The whole country has slipped morally. Or so we believe.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the past through a rosy rearview mirror, we see a
time when our leaders were noble and our word was our bond. Today,
we're awash in gross-out movies, nasty talk radio, rude drivers,
ill-behaved children and mendacious politicians.
</P>
<P>
   These conditions have convinced many people that we're headed
for Hades in a handbasket. Three out of every four respondents to a
recent Washington Post poll said the country is in a serious moral
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even shocked any more,'' says Julie Rogers-Martin,
director of Christian education at Columbia Presbyterian Church in
Decatur. ``Nobody's going to call(President Clinton) on the carpet
in Washington, because they're all doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so it would seem. Revelations in recent weeks that several
leading Republicans, including Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, have indulged in adulterous affairs add to the
impression that our elected leaders are perennially auditioning for
``Oh, Calcutta!''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Josephson, a California millionaire who sold his company
to start a nonprofit foundation devoted to teaching ethics, is
another who's worried. The latest Josephson Institute survey of
10,000 high school students, to be released in two weeks, indicates
that kids are lying, cheating and stealing more often.
</P>
<P>
   Though Josephson won't reveal the figures until the biennial
report is published, he said this year's survey register a sharp
rise from 1996, when ``39 percent admitted they stole from a store
in the last year, 63 percent said they had cheated on an exam in
the last year and 25 percent said they lied to get or keep a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Josephson, ``There's a hole in the moral ozone, and it's
getting bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we tolerant of Clinton's behavior because of our own sagging
standards? The Post survey, also conducted by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation, found that even among those seven out of
10 who said adultery ``should not be tolerated,'' fewer than half
said the president's dalliance was an important matter. While we
look to the Internet for the details of his Oval Office trysts with
Monica Lewinsky and Americans wait to view their chief executive

SPOTLIGHT ON GARRETT AS COWBOYS FACE GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ ``New York, New York'' hasn't exactly
been the top of the heap for the Cowboys lately. In lousy
performances unfit for Broadway or the Bass Hall, the Cowboys have
lost three consecutive games to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And those came with Troy Aikman in the leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spotlight is on understudy Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton graduate has studied his lines all week. He is
ready to make his first start in nearly four years against the
defending NFC East champion Giants and the glossy backdrop of
Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens with Aikman sidelined a month because of a
broken collarbone, for this is the beginning of a four-week odyssey
that could define the Cowboys' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get caught up in the pressure of the moment,'' said
Garrett, who has thrown just 91 passes in his six-year Cowboys
career. ``I've got to go out and play like I've prepared. I know
the guys are depending on me. But I'm depending on them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, and a veteran offensive line are
prepared to give Garrett offensive support. Deion Sanders, Darren
Woodson, and a hobbling Leon Lett must force turnovers to help
Garrett's cause.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrett's play will tell the tale tonight.
</P>
<P>
   To rattle Garrett's confidence, the Giants are expected to blitz
from everywhere but the Holland Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have had to stay up late at nights trying to create
more (pressure) than they already do,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said of the Giants, who lead the NFC with 13 sacks, four each by
defensive ends Michael Strahan and Chad Bratzke.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey contends that he will not alter the offensive game plan.
Practice this past week did not reveal Garrett lining up under a
guard, or handing off to the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see Garrett throw a ton of short passes to his running
backs and tight ends against the Giants tonight, with an occasional
deep pass to Michael Irvin or Billy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Smith who must play a big role to completely take the
pressure off Garrett. In a 20-6 loss here on Nov. 24, 1996, Smith's
career hit bottom when he carried the ball 11 times for 18 yards
and was benched for the first time as a pro for performance
reasons. But the four-time rushing champion has rebounded lately.
He has run with renewed quickness and power, and his 217 yards are
fourth in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive success for the Cowboys will not matter if the Broncos
show up again tonight. Defensive coordinator Dave Campo worked all
week figuring ways to get ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis to the
quarterback, which would lead to more interception chances for
Sanders and cornerback Kevin Smith. Team trainer Jim Maurer worked
all week tending the bumps and bruises of tackles Leon Lett and
Chad Hennings, who must clog up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants have struggled on offensive this year. They are
27th in rushing average (2.9) and last in third-down conversions
(11.5 percent). Running back Tikki Barber (69 yards rushing) and
quarterback Danny Kanell (5.69 yards per pass play) do not pose the
same kind of threat as Terrell Davis and John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play well now,'' Gailey said. ``We can't sit
around and hold our breaths for four weeks. That's not the way it
works.''

OPPOSITION LEADER IN MALAYSIA IS JAILED IN SEX CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ After a day of lurid headlines and
protests by thousands, the rising star of Malaysian politics, Anwar
Ibrahim, was jailed Sunday night, following a long, bitter struggle
against his one-time mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before his arrest, apparently on charges of sexual
indecency, Anwar led a mass rally calling for Mahathir's
resignation, and the police fired tear gas at demonstrators who
were marching on the prime minister's house.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult coincided with a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II
and the competition of athletes from 70 nations in the Commonwealth
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the tear gas drifted past the British flags raised to
honor the queen, the police kicked down the door of Anwar's house,
where he was talking to reporters, and gave him one hour to pack
his clothes, eat dinner and say goodbye to his family. He was
driven away in a white van, surrounded by dozens of red-helmeted
officers, as his supporters ran alongside shouting, ``God is
great!''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Anwar, 51, followed his ouster on Sept. 2 as
deputy prime minister and heir apparent to Mahathir, 72, in the
most lurid political battle this conservative Muslim country has
known in years.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, whose authority is rarely challenged, has had the
upper hand throughout. But the protests and arrest have shaken
Malaysia's reputation for stability, overturned one of Asia's most
solid succession scenarios and removed from public life a leading
standard-bearer of a more liberal generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mahathir has been a vocal advocate of authoritarian
``Asian values,'' Anwar has called for the ``creative destruction''
of old political traditions and has advocated more free expression.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign since his ouster has uncovered what appears to be a
broad and formerly voiceless mood of discontent. As Anwar
barnstormed last week he drew large and enthusiastic crowds that
raised the cry of ``reformasi,'' or reform, that was the slogan of
the demonstrators who helped oust President Suharto of Indonesia in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts here said Mahathir's leadership was not
threatened, although an official of the governing party, the United
Malays National Organization, warned that Anwar's campaign ``could
create chaos and spark a revolution, which would eventually lead to
anarchy in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's hold on his party is unchallenged, and his reputation
as a nation builder remains high. His word has been law for
decades, and many Malaysians seem reflexively to credit the
allegations against Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   But as in Indonesia, the economy is the wild card. Even as he
was moving against Anwar, who had promoted tight fiscal policies in
tune with the International Monetary Fund, Mahathir took the ailing
economy on a risky about-face, curbing trading in the currency, the
ringgit, and cutting off the country from the global financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange rate immediately stabilized, currency flowed back
into the economy, and the stock market rose, with help from
civic-minded institutional buying. But economic analysts said that
those gains might be short-lived and that Malaysia could in a few
months plunge back into a worse decline.
</P>
<P>
   But Anwar, lacking an independent organization and apparently
facing a prison term, seems at the moment to have little chance of
capitalizing on political changes. From the start he said he was
certain he would be arrested. But he had expected Mahathir to wait
until the end of the Commonwealth Games on Monday and the departure
of the queen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the press is tightly controlled and even
professional political commentators sometimes ask reporters not to
quote them by name, Anwar and his followers seemed to bask in the
thrill of nothing-to-lose invective.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting words that had hardly been whispered here before, Anwar
roused his listeners with statements like ``Dr. Mahathir has lost
the people's support,'' ``The time has come for him to step down,''
and ``My greatest sin was to challenge Dr. Mahathir _ he's old,
he's senile.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar reached the point on Saturday of calling his rival
Malaysia's ``chief Tarzan'' and his friends ``apes and elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   The vivid language was far from one-sided. Anwar's dismissal
followed the publication of a Malaysian-style Starr report, ``50
Reasons Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister,'' filled with detailed
allegations of sexual hijinks with men and women, as well as
sedition, abuse of power and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's headlines _ including ``We Were Sodomized'' and ``They
Allowed Themselves to Be Sodomized by Anwar'' _ repeated the
allegations. The newspapers reported that two of his close male
associates had confessed to having sex with Anwar and were each
sentenced on Saturday to six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the same linguistic taboos as the Starr report in a
Muslim nation where explicit sex is carefully censored, the
newspapers reported on both cases in surprising detail.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who is married and has six children and who is known as a
devout and clean-living Muslim, strenuously denied the accusations
as having ``not an iota of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a political conspiracy of the highest level to
destroy my political career by means of character assassination,''
he said on Saturday. ``I once again clearly and specifically deny
that I have been involved in these despicable activities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his friends had been tortured, on Mahathir's orders,
into making false confessions and accused security forces of using
Gestapo and Israeli secret-police methods.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for the inspector general of police, Abdul
Raheem Noor, who said: ``We can no longer tolerate it when he
accuses us of being similar to Israel. If he had accused us of
being similar to pirates, we could accept that. But not that he
equates us with Israel.''

WHAT KIND OF KINDNESS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: The first day of Rosh Hashana is Monday, Sept. 21; for
release Monday, 9/21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By  ? 
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Rosh Hashana, the first day of the Jewish year 5759, and I
am thinking about a message I keep spotting on bumper stickers and
T-shirts: ``Practice random kindness and senseless acts of
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems a warm, uplifting sentiment. In a
world filled with random cruelty, what could be more welcome than
some unexpected kindness? With all the senseless violence human
beings inflict on each other, we can all use a little more beauty
in our lives. Who wouldn't welcome anything that can inspire us to
deeds of kindness and beauty -- even if only an expression on a
bumper sticker?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the more I see this expression, the more it bothers me. The
words are sweet. But taken literally, they convey a troubling
message.
</P>
<P>
   For what our society needs more of is not random kindness, but
sustained and dependable kindess; not senseless acts of beauty, but
beautiful behavior that is deliberately cultivated. Of course a
random kindness is better than no kindness at all. But it is the
ethical equivalent of sitting down at the piano to bang out
``Chopsticks'': quick, easy, and not very serious.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning that lurks in the interstices of ``Practice random
kindness'' is that treating others with compassion and decency is
something to be done as a lark. That is not a philosophy that
promotes kindness as an essential element of good character. It is
a philosophy that promotes kindness as a fun activity for a slow
weekend. This attitude suffuses the recent spate of ``kindness''
books. ``Guerrilla Kindness,'' for example, recommends burying
nickels in sandboxes for children to find when they play. ``Random
Acts of Kindness'' suggests buying coffee for strangers in a diner
or secretly washing a neighbor's car. Something called The Kindness
Society offers this on its Web site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Random acts of kindess are those sweet or lovely things we do
for no reason except that, momentarily, the best of our humanity
has sprung into full bloom. When you spontaneously give an old
woman the bouquet of red carnations you had meant to take home to
your own dinner table, when you give your lunch to the
guitar-playing homeless person who makes music at the corner ...,
when you anonymously put coins in someone else's parking meter ...,
you are doing not what life requires of you, but what the best of
your human soul invites you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   I am all for spontaneously giving bouquets to old women. Any
good deed is to be encouraged, even if it is only done on a whim.
But if kindness is merely spur-of-the-moment gestures, if it is
``not what life requires of you,'' why bother? Because it feels
good? Then what happens when it doesn't feel good? What happens
when it takes a real effort of will -- or a financial sacrifice --
or a significant commitment of time -- to treat someone with
kindness and charity?
</P>
<P>
   How different is the understanding of kindness conveyed by the
Rosh Hashana liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Today and tomorrow, Jews will revisit the story of Abraham, the
father of the Jewish nation. Each of the three Biblical patriarchs
is regarded as the exemplar of a particular trait, and Abraham is
remembered above all for his acts of loving-kindness. (Isaac's
trait is self-sacrifice; Jacob is the paradigm of scholarliness.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bible portrays Abraham as a man intensely concerned with the
comfort and well-being of others. He leaves his sickbed when he
sees strangers in the distance, ignoring his pain in order to show
them hospitality. He pleads with God to spare the cruel sinners of
Sodom and Gomorrah. So thoroughly does he inculcate the habit of
kindness in the members of his household that when his servant
Eliezer journeys to find a wife for Isaac, the litmus test he
applies is one of compassion: He looks for a girl who is willing
not only to offer him a drink of water, but to draw water for his
camels as well -- a backbreaking chore.
</P>
<P>
   This is kindness of a far higher order than dropping nickels in
a playground or handing out carnations in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are the compassionate children of compassionate
parents,'' the Talmud teaches. ``One who is merciless toward his
fellow creatures is no descendant of our father Abraham.'' Jewish
tradition teaches that kindness (ital) is (unital) what life
requires of you -- and even that it is required for life. On Rosh
Hashana, God sits in judgment, deciding who will live and who will
die, whose days will be peaceful, whose tormented. But His
decisions are not unalterable. At the climactic moment of the
service, in the famous prayer of Rabbi Amnon, Jews remind
themselves that ``repentance, prayer, and (ital) acts of charity
(unital) can dissolve a bitter decree.''
</P>
<P>
   The sages taught that God Himself is the original model of
kindness: He clothed Adam and Eve when they were naked, visited
Abraham when he was sick, comforted Isaac in his grief, buried
Moses after he died. We, who are commanded to follow in God's ways
(Deuteronomy 13:5), must likewise clothe the naked, visit the sick,
comfort the bereaved, bury the dead. We pray on Rosh Hashana for
God to treat us with charity and kindness --  &UR; (ital)  &LR; asei imanu
tzedaka va'chesed (unital) -- not randomly but daily, not on a whim
but constantly. He wants the same from us. ``For I desire kindness,
not sacrifices,'' said the prophet Hosea 2,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   My resolution for the coming year is to practice consistent
kindness and thoughtful acts of beauty. May 5759 be for all of us a
year of compassion, charity, and goodwill.

TREATMENT BY U.S. ANNOYS JAPANESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan is often seen these days as an insouciant bumbler,
fiddling while much of the world's economy burns. But government
officials here, grimly plodding the corridors of power, see things
rather differently.
</P>
<P>
   As Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi prepares for a summit meeting
with President Clinton on Tuesday in Tarrytown, N.Y., some
officials here are irritated at what they perceive as American
arrogance and its scapegoating of Japan. They say that Japan tried
several times to grapple with the Asian economic crisis in the
early stages, but each time the United States slapped Japan down.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis was in its infancy a year ago, for example,
Japan proposed setting up a $100 billion fund to help Southeast
Asian countries pull through. The United States swiftly killed the
idea, sending a humiliated Japan slinking back to its corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now many economists think that Japan's idea should have been
tried, and even the United States sounds humble on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've all learned a lot of lessons over the last year
or so,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, under secretary of state for
economic affairs. ``Perhaps with 20-20 hindsight, this was an idea
that might have gotten more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan was the first major country to pay attention to the crisis
unfolding in Thailand in the summer of 1997, and then-Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto tried to get world leaders to discuss
the economic instability in Asia at the Denver summit meeting, two
weeks before the crisis exploded into the public eye. But no other
leader wanted to discuss what then seemed like an obscure topic.
</P>
<P>
   Then just this month, Obuchi proposed that leaders of the
industrialized countries meet to consult on the Russian crisis and
global economic risks. Washington killed that idea, too. But a few
days ago, as the crisis became more serious, Clinton summoned
finance ministers and central bankers from the same countries to
discuss the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials are not exactly gnashing their teeth, nor do
they want to be hailed as visionaries who saw the crisis coming and
tried to galvanize international action. But they do bridle at the
suggestion that they are part of the problem rather than the
solution, and that Japan is the culprit in the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a wrong perception,'' complained Kaoru Yosano, the
minister for international trade and industry. ``Sure, Japan has
lots of political problems. But Japan has contributed more than any
country in the world to the Asian countries hit by the crisis since
Thailand, and we intend to continue those contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosano noted that Japan has contributed $43 billion to rescue
packages in Asia, compared to $12 billion from the United States
and $7 billion from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is not paralyzed,'' he added. ``It would be an
interesting yarn if it were true, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was annoyed at repeated American statements
urging Japan to do more to address the crisis, Yosano allowed a
smile to flit across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it, so we're not frustrated by it,'' he said.
``It's like a church bell ringing at the same time every day, so
that after a while you don't notice it. But of course if you say
things too many times, then nobody will listen to you any more. So
I think it would be more effective to speak less often.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody in the Japanese Cabinet is quite so patient.
Seiichi Ota, director of the Management and Coordination Agency,
complained at a press conference the other day about the impact of
international banking standards stipulating the appropriate levels
of capital that banks should maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if everyone is just accepting this because it is
decided by Anglo-Saxons,'' Ota fretted. ``Everyone, including
Japan, bows to these rules, because Anglo-Saxons are powerful in
the financial world. But being powerful is not the same as being
right.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their frustration, Japanese officials still go out of
their way to try to pacify American demands. Late last week, for
example, leaders of the ruling and opposition parties stayed up all
night and worked frantically to cobble together a frail agreement
on stabilizing the banking system, all so that Obuchi would have
the deal in place by the time he met Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The simmering resentments in Tokyo may grow with the summit
meeting, since one of its purposes seems to be to give Clinton a
chance to drum into Obuchi the importance of rapid action to revive
Japan's economy. Clinton said a few days ago that in terms of
resolving the global financial crisis, ``the key here is Japan,''
and he added: ``It is difficult to see how any actions of the world
community can be successful in restoring growth in Asia in the
absence of the restoration of growth in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuji Tsushima, a prominent member of Parliament for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, warned that if Americans continue to
complain about Japan, then there could be a serious backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American policy-makers continue to criticize us or push too
hard, a sentiment might develop here similar to that in Malaysia,''
Tsushima said, referring to the strong strain of anti-Western
opinion in Malaysia. ``That's what we have to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials respond that while they would prefer not to
give offense, the world is at an extremely delicate juncture and
requires dramatic action from Japan to stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States feels quite acutely that Japan must bear its
share of responsibility for mitigating as much as possible the
Asian crisis,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, who was in Japan last week. Ms. Barshefsky said
that Clinton and Obuchi would speak ``in an unusually forthright
manner for a first-time meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can express perhaps exasperation, but it's up to Japan to
take the measures,'' she added. ``The president will certainly make
clear that Japan must act.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There has been some disagreement in the administration about how
harsh to be with Japan, and the result is an inconsistency in tone.
Ms. Barshefsky and Treasury Department officials have been
unrelentingly tough, while State Department officials have
soothingly offered advice rather than making demands.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials say that one reason why Washington has
often made tough statements is the feeling that pressure to the
point of rudeness is the only mechanism that has ever worked in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's demonstrably the case that external pressure
tends to help more than it hurts,'' Ms. Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, for example, the United States fairly politely
urged Japan not to raise its national consumption tax. Japan raised
it anyway, and fell into its worst recession in half a century _
threatening the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, even after falling into recession, Japan felt much
less urgency than other countries. Tokyo delayed action on measures
to stimulate the economy and tackle the nation's bad debt problem,
and the frustration in Washington grew so acute that some Treasury
officials dubbed Japan's finance minister the ``minister for the
destruction of the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sarcasm is particularly painful for Japanese officials, who
try hard to build good relationships with their American
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese officials are really interested, almost obsessed,
with the reaction of Americans, and so these days they are very
resentful because the reaction is bad,'' said Yasuaki Onuma, a law
professor at Tokyo University. But he added that fundamentally the
blame should lie with the Japanese officials because, he said, they
are invariably disastrous at public relations and thus never get
credit even when they manage to do things right.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Japanese proposals for summit meetings or other
global measures have not been taken seriously is that the Japanese
government has almost no credibility abroad. It has insisted for so
long that its economic problems are under control that the
assumption whenever a Japanese prime minister speaks out on global
issues is that he is simply trying to divert attention from
problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   The distress of Japanese officials at being blamed for the
global crisis comes on top of the distress at seeing the once-great
Japanese economy steadily lose strength. The Japanese stock market
is at a 12-year low, and Japan's banks are now not just the world's
biggest but also among the world's shakiest.
</P>
<P>
   A headline last week on a column in the Asahi Shimbun, perhaps
Japan's most respected newspaper, grimly described the despair at
Japan's economic morass: ``The Feeling of Losing a Second War.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Japanese public at large, the measure of resentment at
perceived American arrogance has been no greater lately than usual.
One reason may be that the public is focusing its indignation on
its own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Obuchi can make Clinton look comparatively strong
politically. A poll last week for the Asahi Shimbun found only 21
percent of the public supported Obuchi's government, and even
members of his own party are jockeying to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, most of the public frustration isn't with
foreigners,'' said Charles Horioka, an economist at Osaka
University, ``but with the Japanese government and its difficulties
in getting things done.''

WHITE HOUSE STRUGGLING FOR A WAY TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He goes to work, they go to work. He keeps his chin
up, they keep their heads down. But nothing is quite the same for
President Clinton and his senior aides, advisers and friends these
days, and they make little pretense that the White House is other
than a shaken, static place, groping for a way to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't talk about this,'' said one longtime aide,
speaking, like all his colleagues, on condition of anonymity. ``I
honestly don't know who he's talking to.'' But, this aide added of
the president, ``There's now a whole man I've never even met. I
don't believe anything any more from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime adviser said: ``He's always pretty tough,
resolute when we talk,'' but added, ``I try to really avoid saying,
`How are you feeling?'''
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide in a Cabinet department, who has been with
Clinton since the 1992 campaign, said: ``The one thing that
dominates over there more than anything else is a sense of sadness,
especially among what's left of the old guard. They're having a
wake for someone who's not dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, as the White House braces for the release on Monday
of the president's videotaped testimony before Kenneth Starr's
grand jury, aides acknowledge that no one knows quite what to do
about an impeachment process that is rolling along under its own
power on Capitol Hill and not susceptible to White House influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oddly powerless time,'' one senior aide said. ``We're
passengers on the bus, and someone else is driving the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The daily 8 a.m. staff strategy session led by John Podesta, the
deputy chief of staff, usually a scene of jocular intensity
punctuated by ironic jeremiads from the senior aide Rahm Emanuel,
is ``recently just grim,'' according to one aide who can longer
bear to attend, though another who still goes said that some of
``the raucous, gallows humor has returned.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the laughs in the West Wing come in lieu of tears, when
the press office lists the roster of guests on the Sunday talk
shows and the line-up invariably boils down to faceoffs between
Clinton's Republican congressional critics and his Democratic ones,
and the practical talk involves making sure the president will not
be close enough to reporters to risk unwanted questions.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official summed up the feeling of futility:
``There's no great amount of, shall we say, organization there.
What power does this White House have?''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official was even blunter, saying,
``There's no White House there.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, Clinton's former labor secretary and friend of 30
years, said on ABC's ``Nightline'' last week: ``We have almost a
virtual impeachment, a Potemkin president. He's going through the
motions of being a president, but he doesn't have very much power
or authority left.''
</P>
<P>
   Penetrating the mood of the president and his inner circle is
dicey in the best of times, since the White House is at once a huge
public stage and a place of deep secrets, as the Monica Lewinsky
affair itself shows. Now more than ever, insiders keep their own
counsel and outsiders are reduced to studying shadows and proferred
peeks past the veil.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, aides insist that Clinton's famous capacity for
compartmentalizing his life has once again come to the fore, and he
``takes solace in his work,'' one aide says. The president keeps to
his schedule, raising money for Democratic candidates, touching
base with interest groups, campaigning for his policies, like, for
example, a patient's bill of medical rights, which he touted in a
speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
convention here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president began those remarks by saying how much his wife
liked the group, then surprised his speechwriters by ad-libbing a
riff sympathizing with well-meaning bureaucrats who may initially
refuse to allow certain medical procedures because they know they
are ``never going to get in trouble for saying no,'' a sentiment
bound to ring true with a union audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that for the last eight months, the White
House has been the only place in America where you can have an
hourlong conversation about Bill Clinton that's only about
policy,'' one senior aide said of the work of speechwriting,
scheduling and planning. ``It's the eye of the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aide insisted, ``He's paying attention, not just going
through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton is not without a certain rueful sense of humor. When
Suzan D. Johnson Cook of the President's Advisory Board on Race
presented him with a little book called ``Too Blessed to Be
Stressed'' at a ceremony marking the end of the commission's work
in the Oval Office on Friday, he replied, ``I think I need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clinton embarks on one more campaign _ to stay in
office _ a looming sense of a long, grim, unavoidable ordeal
pervades the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings are like the weather in Oklahoma,'' one longtime
adviser to the president said. ``You know, you might have a cold
front, or a tornado come through, and then a hot spell and a
drought. What makes me low is when I think how long all of this is
going to take.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another outside adviser said that the president understands the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understands that while these top-line, national
poll numbers are fine, that there's a potential problem with the
public and a serious problem on the Hill,'' this adviser said.
``The Republicans are determined to conduct a Chinese water-torture
impeachment process. And there's been a slow, slow, slow, but
clearly perceptible, change in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The official White House word is that Clinton well understands
the damage he has done to himself and is trying to make amends. But
one senior aide said he worried that the president, in telephone
calls to Democrats in Congress, was still trying to play down his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This same aide, when told that some other administration
officials said Clinton had complained that his anger at Starr
prompted him to seek relief with Ms. Lewinsky, exploded in
irritation: ``Oh, yeah, I forgot. It's all Ken's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has quit. But press secretary Mike McCurry is
leaving as long planned at the end of the month. Emanuel, who has
also long planned to leave, has a new baby and is househunting in
his hometown of Chicago. The chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, who
has also long wanted to leave, perhaps to run for governor in his
home state of North Carolina, is said to finally be serious about
going home.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, the 1992 campaign veteran, who was among the
president's most visible and vocal defenders after Clinton's
initial denials last winter, is not leaving, but he has told
friends he will no longer appear on television, either.
</P>
<P>
   One outside adviser said that, with the hiring of Gregory Craig
as the White House's new damage control point man, and Podesta's
continuing efforts, the staff at last has a mechanism for
coordinating the supporters it has left, from old Friends of Bill
around the country to black elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can handle some of the incoming and finally channel it
into an outgoing,'' this adviser said. But he added that the future
remained deeply unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there's going to be either a really smart move
or a really dumb move by either side that's going to more or less
define things,'' he said. ``I just hope it won't be a dumb move by
us.''

BRAZILIAN SHATTERS WORLD MARATHON RECORD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Brazilian named Ronaldo accomplished in marathon running
Sunday what his counterpart in soccer could not do at this summer's
World Cup _ prove that he was indisputably the best on the planet
in his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Running only his second marathon, Ronaldo da Costa shattered the
world record for the 26-miles-385-yard race, winning the Berlin
Marathon in 2 hours 6 minutes 5 seconds. Having spun the record on
its head, da Costa felt energized enough to perform a cartwheel in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day in Berlin with temperatures rising through the
50s, Da Costa shaved 45 seconds off the record, which had been
2:06:50, set in 1988 in Rotterdam by Belayneh Densimo of Ethiopia.
Last year, in his first marathon, da Costa, 28, finished fifth at
Berlin in 2:09:07.
</P>
<P>
   His victory Sunday challenged the international distance-running
supremacy of Africans, Mexicans, Koreans and Spaniards, and it
contradicted the belief that marathoners need significant altitude
training to increase their oxygen-carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, da Costa trained about a quarter-mile above sea level
in Brazil and employed sprint training that allowed him to run the
final 13.1 miles in a searing 1:01:23 after running the first half
of the race in 1:04.42.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to run under 2:08 this year, but conditions were so
good I just went for it,'' da Costa said.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the pace-setters were too slow at the midpoint, da
Costa ran the next 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) in 14:20 to open a
40-second lead over a group of Kenyans. Josephat Kiprono of Kenya
finished second in 2:07:26, and Samson Kandie of Kenya finished
third in 2:09:11.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the half, he ran the next kilometer in 2:49,'' Luis
Posso, da Costa's Tampa, Fla.-based agent, said by telephone from
Berlin. ``The last seven kilometers are slightly downhill. At 39K,
I told him, `Don't look back, don't look at your watch. This is a
world record. Just run.' He was in shape to run anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The approximately $200,000 in prize and bonus money that da
Costa won will come in handy for a runner who grew up poor and now
is the chief provider for an extended family of about 20 relatives,
Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa's family lives north of Rio de Janeiro in two small
towns named Descoberto and San Joao de Nepomuceno. He has a twin
brother, who formerly trained with him, and he pays his nephews
small amounts of money to carry water and pace him on their
bicycles, Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   While his coach, Carlos Alberto Cavalheiro, operates altitude
training camps in Brazil and in Boulder, Colo., da Costa is a
``hometown guy, who'd rather stay at home,'' Posso said.
</P>
<P>
   So Cavalheiro tailored a training regimen that drew from his
experience as a sprint coach. Cavalheiro previously coached Robson
da Silva, who won a bronze medal at 200 meters at the 1988 Summer
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa's training partners include Andre Ramos, who finished
fourth at the 1998 Boston Marathon in 2:08:26, which, until Sunday,
was a South American record.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Da Costa employed an eight-week program to train for Berlin,
Cavalheiro said from Berlin. He did two long runs of 22 miles each
per week in the hills above his hometown, and trained about 120
miles a week at peak, but the most intriguing aspect of his
training was his speed work.
</P>
<P>
   His workouts included 15 repeats of 1,000 meters in 3:00 or
3:01, with 20 to 30 seconds' recovery time, and 25 repeats of 400
meters in 66 to 68 seconds, with a recovery time of 15 to 20
seconds. After his long runs of 22 miles, da Costa completed the
workouts with 10 or 15 100-meter sprints, Cavalheiro said. He also
employs jumping and bounding exercises used by sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa began running 10 years ago, and, on the track, has run
13:37 for 5,000 meters and 28:07 for 10,000. He also finished third
in the 1994 world half-marathon championships, and 1:00.54, but
nothing suggested that he was ready to shatter the world record for
26.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Now the accomplishments of da Costa and Ramos and Luis dos
Santos, a two-time winner of the Chicago Marathon, suggest that
Brazil is an emerging marathon nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are as good as the Africans, and now they are
using scientific training,'' Posso said. ``They have a coach who
knows how to coach, they are eating properly and they are using
heart-rate monitors to train. It's totally professional. That made
the difference.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TESTAVERDE'S ARM, JET SEASON, BOTH REVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Vinny Testaverde had no feeling from his
shoulder to his fingers, but inside his helmet he was fine. He was
not thinking about his own misfortune, but about the two
quarterbacks on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about Ray Lucas not getting any snaps in
practice,'' Testaverde recalled, ``and how Glenn might have to go
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern for his fellow quarterback was on target. This was
early Sunday, with the Jets ahead by a simple touchdown and the
season hanging in the balance. The Jets had lost their first two
games, and their fans were nearly as numb as Testaverde's throwing
arm.
</P>
<P>
   A regular for almost all of his 11 seasons in the league,
Testaverde has had to adjust to the concept of being a backup
quarterback. In the ever-beefed-up National Football League,
however, there is no such thing as an invisible or dormant backup.
Everybody is on full-stage alert.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was playing Sunday because Glenn Foley's ribs were
all bunged up, so early in the season. And Lucas, the nominated
backup quarterback for the day, is a dashing role player but not
expected to lead a team for more than three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my shoulder was separated,'' said Testaverde, who
has had it happen before.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had gone diving on the unforgiving artificial turf
for a teammate's fumble, and a phalanx of 300-pound brutes had
fallen on him.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, a quarterback's getting hit was the
equivalent of being struck by a sedan; in this chemical age the
experience is now the equivalent of being clobbered by a sport
utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Then, slowly, Testaverde felt the tingle in his arm. The injury
was only a stinger. Meanwhile, his mind was still working. The
referee came over and said it would cost the Jets a timeout if
Testaverde stayed on the field after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the scoreboard and it was third-and-12,'' he said
later, although it had actually been third down and 14 yards to go.
``I thought it was better if I came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas came in for one play, the Jets punted, and then Testaverde
came back to lead the Jets to a 44-6 victory over the Indianapolis
Colts, the right opponent for a team in trouble. The Jets hardly
needed that extra timeout he had saved by walking off the field
after his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde wound up completing 12-of-21 passes for 203 yards. He
had four touchdown passes, the second time he has thrown that many
in one game in his career. There was little sense that a star was
being born. Basically, the Jets were just running right over the
Colts, offense, defense, special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Testaverde is too old, and too established, for the
theatrics of being discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for me to come in and play this way than if I was
a backup all my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The discerning fan will note that there has been no mention so
far of any so-called quarterback controversy, the very stuff of
football. Bill Parcells, the oft-sarcastic coach of the Jets, was
in such a jolly mood that he merely rolled his eyes at questions of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the future. The Jets have next weekend off on a schedule
that gives four different teams a bye at a time. The week off let
Parcells be almost expansive in his discussion of his quarterbacks.
He would have used Lucas first Sunday if Testaverde had not
continued. Foley was merely the ``third quarterback,'' in uniform
but available only in case of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job,'' Parcells said of Testaverde. ``When
you're moving the ball around, you can throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any question about who will play quarterback in two
weeks, when the Jets play host to Miami?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there sure is,'' Parcells said, then, referring to
Foley: ``If you could tell me how he is, then I'd know better. If
he's OK, I'd plan on playing him. He was available for spot duty,
but I'd hate to use him.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Testaverde think he should be starting in two weeks? He
replied: ``Personally, I think I should get $8 million, but you
don't always get what you want. It's the coach's decision if I
play, and if it's Glenn, I'll be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it disappointing to know he might be a backup in two weeks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can disappoint me,'' Testaverde said. ``We had too
good a game.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no complaints, at the moment. And the Jets' fans can feel
life returning to their season, the way the sensation returned to
Testaverde's throwing arm.

   Videotape of President Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony
will begin rolling on the major all-news cable television networks
as soon as it is released to them Monday morning, but the three
major broadcast networks plan to use only parts of the video at
first, incorporated into live reports beginning at 9 a.m. or as
soon as the tapes are released.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, MSNBC, Fox News Channel and C-Span all plan to carry the
four hours' worth of testimony in its entirety, spokesmen said.
They will also release the videotaped testimony simultaneously on
their websites.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS and NBC will have their anchormen _ Peter Jennings, Dan
Rather and Tom Brokaw, respectively _ leading coverage of the
videotape's release, but all three were unsure how many excerpts
they would run or how long they will stay on the air in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The length of time depends on the content,'' said Kim Akhtar,
a CBS spokeswoman. ``We won't play this wall-to-wall without any
kind of context, perspective and analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The three major networks will also cut into their normal
programs during the day if news developments warrant, and all three
plan to expand their evening news broadcasts to a full hour,
instead of the usual half-hour, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. Eastern
time.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also plans to devote its Monday-night edition of
``Dateline'' (10 p.m. Eastern time) to the testimony, and ABC plans
a special one-hour edition of ``Nightline,'' to begin 35 minutes
after the end of ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   All three broadcast networks will also carry the entire four
hours of testimony on their websites, in video, as soon as it is
released. That video will carry advisories warning of possible
objectionable content.
</P>
<P>
   The all-news cable networks also will label the testimony with
warnings about the adult nature of the content, and will add spoken
advisories from time to time as well.
</P>
<P>
   CNN Headline News, which is not carrying the testimony
videotape, will break into its normal coverage to televise
President Clinton's speech at the United Nations, at 10 a.m.
Monday. &QL;

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Dr. Michael Westerman was catching up with one of
his patients, 72-year-old John Foltz. Foltz, who has emphysema and
heart disease, told the doctor he had not had a cigarette in a
month, and was breathing better, though climbing the stairs to his
apartment was still a trial. What was his goal? To be able to walk
the half-mile to Santoni's grocery.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing remarkable about the conversation except that,
in this era of managed care and 15-minute checkups, it went on for
nearly an hour. And Westerman was sitting at Foltz's kitchen table
in his apartment above a bar in Baltimore's Highlandtown
neighborhood, a few miles east of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Westerman, 29, is a third-year resident in internal medicine at
Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, which is a part of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine. He is required to make house
calls. He has to take the time to get to know his patients. It is
part of what is regarded as the cutting-edge training in geriatrics
_ medical care for the complex needs of older patients _ required
of all residents in internal medicine at Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   House calls, though only one aspect of the immersion in
geriatrics, are central to the Hopkins Bayview focus on changing
the attitudes of medical professionals toward older patients.
Medical school introduces students to the elderly primarily as
frail, acutely ill patients in hospitals. Through house calls,
residents meet older people who are independent and even vigorous,
despite chronic, age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``House calls teach the real humanity of medicine,'' said Dr.
John Burton, director of the division of geriatric medicine and
gerontology at the Hopkins School of Medicine. ``Suddenly, the
residents aren't the benevolent dictator. They're the invited
guest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hopkins Bayview geriatrics training program, along with a
handful of similar ones at other medical schools around the United
States, is part of a growing effort to meet what experts say is an
urgent need for doctors properly trained in the problems and the
process of aging.
</P>
<P>
   With the rapidly growing number of older Americans _
particularly those who are over 85 and frail _ there is a shortage
of more than 13,000 doctors trained to treat them, according to a
1996 study by the Alliance for Aging Research.
</P>
<P>
   There are 8,800 physicians certified in geriatrics, according to
the American Geriatrics Society. The United States will need 36,000
physicians with geriatrics training by 2030 to care for about 76
million older Americans, according to the society. Students
entering medical school today can expect that at least half of the
patients they will see as doctors will be over 65, according to the
Alliance for Aging study.
</P>
<P>
   ``With frail old people, there's just no margin for error,''
said Dr. David Solomon, a geriatrician who helped found the highly
regarded geriatrics program at the University of California at Los
Angeles School of Medicine. And, he said, with the lack of trained
doctors, ``lots of errors are made.''
</P>
<P>
   Common errors include prescribing inappropriately high doses of
medicine, or failing to recognize symptoms of heart attacks like
confusion or shortness of breath that often appear in elderly
patients, particularly in women.
</P>
<P>
   Untrained doctors might not recognize dementia, which puts an
older patient at risk for a dangerous acute delirium after surgery,
or during an infection like pneumonia. They might not know that
urinary incontinence, which is relatively common among people over
65, can usually be easily managed. They routinely miss depression,
or write it off, wrongly, as an inevitable disease of old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes doctors will call me, embarrassed, late at night to
ask for help with their own mothers,'' said Dr. Robert Butler, who
in 1982 established the first medical school department of
geriatrics, at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the lack of knowledge can be traced to the limited
training in geriatrics offered at medical schools. While they say
the situation is improving, only 14 of 126 medical schools require
students to take a course in geriatrics, according to the 1997-98
Association of American Medical Colleges' curriculum directory,
while 85 offer geriatrics as an elective course.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1996 Alliance for Aging study, only 3 percent
of recent medical school graduates have taken an elective in
geriatrics. Only three medical schools _ Mount Sinai, the
University of Arkansas and the University of Oklahoma _ have
departments of geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is making room in the overloaded medical
school curriculum, said Donna Regenstreif, a senior program officer
at the John A. Hartford Foundation in New York, which directs its
resources toward the health-care needs of the aging, and in 1995
awarded grants to seven medical geriatrics residency training
programs, including those at Hopkins and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she added, ``It's very hard to get medical schools to pay
attention. Most people in power in medical schools represent the
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field say that the need is not so much for large
numbers of geriatricians as it is for training physicians to make
geriatric care part of their practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of older people, including the frail older
people, could get their care from a properly trained generalist
physician,'' Burton said. ``That's what we're trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Few medical students are drawn to geriatrics. The field lacks
the glamour _ and the relatively high salaries that help offset the
burden of medical school debt _ of popular subspecialties like,
say, cardiothoracic surgery. Geriatrics is considered a discipline,
not a specialty. To become a geriatrician, a doctor must complete a
geriatrics fellowship of at least one year, and pass an examination
by a certifying medical board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people aren't very sexy,'' said Dr. David Reuben, chief of
the geriatrics division at the UCLA School of Medicine, reflecting
the attitudes not just of the medical establishment but of American
society. ``And frail old people really aren't sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sangeeta Varanasi, 26, a resident at Hopkins Bayview, said she
was one of only three people out of 160 in her class at medical
school, at the University of North Carolina, who was interested in
caring for old people. Her classmates' attitude: ``They'd say,
`Ooh, you're really going into geriatrics?'''
</P>
<P>
   But at Hopkins Bayview, geriatrics is the new frontier. ``It's
so necessary,'' Burton said. ``I get 20 calls a week from people
saying: `Can you get us a geriatrician? Can you refer me to a
geriatrician?' There are 500 slots for every geriatrics fellow.''

 BALTIMORE: geriatrics fellow.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With about 12 months of their three-year training period
dedicated to geriatrics, residents spend time treating patients in
a variety of settings, from their homes to a retirement community
to a nursing home at Hopkins Bayview.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, geriatrics goes against the standard medical
model, which focuses on curing disease and extending life. ``A lot
of it is common sense,'' said Dr. Eric De Jonge, a geriatrician on
the staff. ``It's making sure patients don't take too many
medicines, that we don't do harm, that we keep people comfortable
and dignified at the end of life. A lot of it gets lost in the
largely technology-dominated medical training.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben said: ``Geriatricians are the Labrador retrievers of
medicine. We're warm, fuzzy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents at Hopkins Bayview learn that success is not
necessarily measured in dramatic medical procedures. Instead, it
might be getting a patient who has had a stroke from the bed to the
toilet, or maintaining a patient's independence. Or cooling off a
patient's sweltering apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Foltz over the summer, Westerman discovered that it was
110 degrees inside his apartment. ``I tell you, I could barely
breathe,'' Westerman said. ``Mr. Foltz's weight went way down
because he became so dehydrated.'' His patient, who was once a
hospital orderly, wouldn't even consider going to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are trained to work in teams, with social workers and
geriatric nurses, as well as other doctors. Westerman prevailed
upon a social worker for help, and she found a secondhand air
conditioner for Foltz.
</P>
<P>
   Westerman said he has found his experience at Hopkins so
satisfying that he plans to go into geriatrics.
</P>
<P>
   One of De Jonge's patients is an 81-year-old woman suffering
from severe hypertension, depression, coronary artery disease and
diabetes. ``When she came to me, she was on 14 medications,'' De
Jonge said. ``Her daughter had them all on spread sheets. Over the
last 18 months I've stopped eight of the 14, step by step. It's one
of the most gratifying things I've done, to see this woman become
more alert, more physically independent, her mood improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontinued medications included one for Parkinson's
disease that was causing insomnia and hallucinations. ``She came to
me with a Parkinson's disease diagnosis,'' De Jonge said. ``She
didn't have Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   While most teaching hospitals have one or two geriatricians,
Hopkins Bayview has 17 clinical geriatricians on the faculty, and
13 geriatrics fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students follow role models,'' said De Jonge, who followed two
of his role models, Burton and another geriatrician at Hopkins
Bayview, Dr. Thomas Finucane, into the field. ``The role models in
medical school are doing the most cutting-edge technology. Medical
schools are usually based at tertiary-care centers dominated by
subspecialists. Each doctor is an expert at taking care of one
organ. In some ways, geriatrics puts the whole person together.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bayview, one of the geriatrician role models is Dr. William
Greenough III who, as the former director of the International
Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh, is world
renowned for his work in dramatically lowering cholera mortality
rates in children.
</P>
<P>
   Greenough, 66, said that when he returned to the United States
from Bangladesh after many years, he decided to focus on older
patients because they had become so neglected as to be ``a
third-world country within the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather be old in a developing country than here,'' he
said the other day, making his rounds on the chronic-care ward at
Bayview with Dr. Joel Bolen, a geriatrics fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Eunice Mitchell, 78, who has been bedridden and on a ventilator
since her spine collapsed from osteoporosis five years ago, lit up
when Greenough walked into her room. They chatted about the latest
romance novel Mrs. Mitchell was reading, and about her love of
dogs. A dog had recently visited Miss Mitchell in the hospital,
Greenough said, courtesy of Pets-on-Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   It is vital that medical residents spend time with patients like
Mrs. Mitchell, Greenough said as he moved down the hallway. ``Mrs.
Mitchell is transformed if only they will listen,'' he said. ``She
does have a life. This is an education for anyone who wants to open
their heart. The human spirit is amazing. You see it here, you see
it in the refugee camps I used to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bolen, who is 29, he intends to return to his hometown of
Montgomery, Ala., when he completes his one-year fellowship. The
doctor will undoubtedly be busy. ``I'm going to be the first
geriatrician,'' he said.

U.S. MAY LOSE U.N. VOTE BY YEAR'S END
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the annals of American relations with the
United Nations, supporters and critics of the organization broadly
agree, there has never been a more dismal moment than this.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton, personally tarnished by the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, speaks here on Monday, he will face an
organization that is likely to strip the United States of its
General Assembly vote by the end of this year for nonpayment of
dues. Washington owes the organization more than $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the political heir to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman _
who fought to create a strong United Nations and give it
Washington's firm bipartisan support _ is now viewed by many
diplomats and officials here as too weak or unwilling to battle a
hostile Congress to preserve that pivotal American role.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States is now without a chief representative to
the organization since the departure of Bill Richardson and the
shelving of Richard Holbrooke's appointment as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's largest contributor is now Japan, which kept
its dues payments up to date despite a recession. What is helping
keep the U.N. afloat _ barely _ is that Japanese, Europeans and
some developing countries have not been reimbursed for providing
peacekeeping troops, allowing the money to be applied instead to
the operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are furious _ our allies are furious,'' said Alvin
Adams, a former ambassador who is president of the U.N. Association
of the United States, an advocacy and research organization with
chapters around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' organization, known as UNA-USA, recently announced poll
results showing that a growing percentage of Americans approve of
the United Nations and want the United States to pay its overdue
assessments, without conditions. Eighty percent of those polled
opposed linking the payments to anti-abortion restrictions on
international family planning groups, as Congress has done.
</P>
<P>
   In the UNA-USA survey, conducted Aug. 21 to 25 by Wirthlin
Worldwide, 72 percent of 1,005 adults said that it was ``very
important'' that the United States remain an active member of the
United Nations, which they ranked higher than NATO, the World Bank
and the World Health Organization. Seventy-three percent said that
Washington should pay its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of those surveyed also said that the United
Nations was doing a good job, the highest rating UNA-USA has seen
in a variety of polls since 1959. Contrary to what some members of
Congress and the Clinton administration believe, the poll found
that many Americans say that they would take attitudes toward the
United Nations into account when voting for members of Congress,
although this would not be a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These polls have taken a jump in public opinion since we took
our last poll two years ago,'' said John Whitehead, a former Deputy
Secretary of State and chairman of UNA-USA. Speaking at a news
conference here on Thursday, Whitehead said that there has long
been ``some kind of disconnect between public opinion on the United
Nations and the voting record of Congress, at least in recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The new poll also found a much higher approval rating for
Secretary General Kofi Annan _ although 25 percent of those polled
had never heard of him _ than a similar poll in late 1995 found for
his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose name had become the
butt of Republican ridicule. Annan's performance was given a 53
percent approval rating compared with Boutros-Ghali's 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that Annan's political skills and personable approach
to Americans is probably helping improve the image of the United
Nations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has ``a sense of the politics of the public'' that no
other Secretary General has had, Adams said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the good movement in public opinion about the U.N. is
due to the fact that there is a face now, a face that is warm and
approachable, and people identify with him,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Annan has become disillusioned with Washington, as
protestations of support for the United Nations in the
Administration and Congress fail repeatedly to turn into tangible
support.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid losing its General Assembly vote, the United
States will have to pay about $200 million by Dec. 31. But even if
Congress, which is locked in a confrontation with President Clinton
over an anti-abortion amendment to legislation, is able to
authorize the money in the current session, dozens of conditions,
some requiring administration certification, are expected to block
payment to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has demanded that the United Nations write off some
back dues; some members insist that the organization owes money to
Washington and not the other way around. Congress is also demanding
further budget and staff cuts at the United Nations and a pledge
that the organization not create a standby peacekeeping force that
some Americans see as a potentially inimical international army.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials here say that with every day that passes, it is
more likely that the United States will fall automatically under
Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, which strips a country of its
General Assembly vote when its debt equals or exceeds the
assessments due for the preceding two years.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen nations now fall into this category: Bosnia, Burundi,
Cambodia, Comoros, Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia,
Guinea-Bissau, Iraq, Liberia, Moldova, Sao Tome, Somalia,
Tajikistan, Togo, Vanuatu and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States seat on the Security Council would not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   However, diplomats, including Americans, say that anger toward
the United States is beginning to erode support on issues vital to
Washington, and that General Assembly votes do decide elections for
rotating Security Council seats as well as major initiatives and
appointments within the organization at large.
</P>
<P>
   Still, John Bolton, who was Assistant Secretary of State for
international organization affairs in the Bush Administration and
is now at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said in
an interview that the loss of a General Assembly vote would not
jolt critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote is lost in the General Assembly, that's not going
to make people in Washington jump up and say, `Gosh!,''' Bolton
said. ``It's going to have exactly the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a bean-counting argument,'' he added. ``This
represents a fundamental divergence of opinion on the right course
for the organization.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a General Accounting Office report in June said
that the U.N.'s financial problems ``have been primarily caused by
the accumulation of unpaid assessments and late payments of
assessments by a large number of members.'' But the GAO report adds
that no nation has run up such a large debt to the organization,
which amounts to more than half of the organization's annual
operating budget of $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is assessed 25 percent of the regular budget,
based on its share in the world economy, though Congress had wanted
this reduced to 20 percent by the year 2000. A 31 percent share of
peacekeeping has already been unilaterally reduced by Congress to
25 percent, putting the United States in perennial arrears because
such changes are recognized only if made according to the Charter
by a committee of member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the United States pays on time, its payments have been
received late in the year because of a decision in 1983 to tie
disbursements to the federal budget cycle. While the United Nations
bills members in January, the United States never pays the bulk of
its debts before Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N.'s cash flow problems stem largely from this U.S.
delay in payments,'' the GAO report said. ``The United States is
the only major country that regularly schedules payment with this
delay factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the United Nations say that Americans, who take
part in increasing numbers in many international activities
organized here, from grassroots groups up to national professional
organizations, are spreading the word around the country that the
United Nations is in trouble, and that the United States is the
major cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the American public is beginning to become aware of
the gravity of the crisis that is facing the organization,'' said
Jeffrey Laurenti, director of policy studies at UNA-USA. ``Three
out of four said in the poll that the American forfeiture of the
vote under Article 19 would be at the very least an
embarrassment,'' he said. ``Possibly for many _ almost 40 percent
say _ it would actually severely impact on America's ability to do
business with other countries.''

INDIAN RESERVATIONS BANK ON AUTHENTICITY TO DRAW TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>

   UMATILLA RESERVATION, Ore. _ The mercury had pushed over the
100-degree mark again here in the high desert, but the tourists
from Germany were undeterred, looking for clues to life in the
American West before every small town had an espresso bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``As children we used to play cowboys and native Americans,''
Klaus Pumple, a 37-year-old construction manager from Stuttgart,
Germany, said recently. ``Now when you pass through the native
American zones in this country, it's kind of depressing, not like
you expected. But also, it is so very interesting to see how these
people live today.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, at the high
drama nexus of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, Vicky
Kilian of the Netherlands had just spent another night sleeping on
a dirt floor inside a tent and was wondering whether she could ever
return to her life as a business consultant in a very flat country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sleep in the teepee, I feel a lot of connection to the
earth,'' said Ms. Kilian, 29, who is on her first visit to America.
``I have had a fire every night and I have been able to walk over
the prairie. It has a very special energy.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian reservations, long considered economic deserts
in a landscape of general prosperity, are finding that they have a
lot more to offer the world than casinos and art galleries _ they
have their homes, their backyards, their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, especially a growing number of Europeans, are
traveling to some of the country's most remote places, like this
Indian reservation in central Oregon, in search of life many
Americans overlook on their vacations. No theme parks built around
fantasies for these travelers. In fact, some of the biggest new
attractions are rooted in today's world and in authenticity _ even
if it leaves visitors feeling more guilt than vacation relief.
Tourists to Indian country spend their holidays hearing tales of
heart-numbing atrocities or listening to songs in languages that
never show up in Frommer's guides. They come away thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   And for Indians who have figured just how to market this niche
of native society, business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans have been visiting Indian country since the time of
Columbus, but what's really new is Indians getting control of it,''
said Gordon Bronitsky, a Denver tourism marketer who has just
produced a catalog of Indian travel packages that is going out to
5,000 travel agents in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship full of Germans will tie up next spring near the
western Oneida Reservation, next to Green Bay, Wis., after the tour
operator reported that visitors requested a stop at an Indian
reservation as part of their itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit there and say, `How,' and paint our
faces,'' said Jeff House, a spokesman for the Oneida. ``We will try
to give an impression of how people live today. We're business
people. We go to Packer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tribes are trying to blend the old with the new. Will
Tsosie runs what might be called an Indian bed and breakfast on the
Navajo Reservation not far from Canyon de Chelly National Monument
in Arizona. He charges $85 a night to stay in a traditional
earthen-floored hogan, a cylindrical house with no running water,
and a structure in which few Indians live. But he also takes people
to visit the local community college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our European guests are very well-prepared and very well-read
_ unlike most Americans,'' Tsosie said. ``If they show up with too
much of the wrong attitude, we turn them away.'' Recently, he said,
some people came to the Hopi Reservation looking for a sun dance,
and asked whether they could be ``pierced'' in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them they had the wrong Indians,'' Tsosie said. ``Try
a thousand miles to the north, with the Lakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Conner, director of the new $18 million Tamastslikt
Cultural Center, on the Umatilla Reservation, said, ``We get a lot
of people who expect they are going to find the Hollywood
stereotypes, the beads and feather Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, whose Indian name means interpreter, opened this
summer after nearly 10 years of planning and is drawing visitors
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tamastslikt is the only Indian-run, Indian-owned interpretive
center along the entire length of the old Oregon Trail, Ms. Conner
said. The trail, from St. Louis to Western Oregon, has long been a
magnet for fans of heritage tourism. With the opening of
Tamastslikt, she said, there is now another side of the story of
Westward expansion, as well as a history of the Indians who have
long lived in this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Umatilla and the two other tribes that live on the
reservation, the Cayuse and the Walla Walla, sent a delegation to
Berlin this year, to the world's biggest tourism trade show. They
handed out posters of a Cayuse Indian leader in a buffalo headdress
with the slogan ``Nicht Ihr Durchschnittlicher Reisefuhrer,'' Not
Your Average Tour Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is often the focus of the marketing because the country
has more than 300 Indian clubs, where people adopt a tribe or a
chief and study the history. Plus, millions of Germans have grown
up on the books of Karl May, a German author who wrote a series of
stories about an Apache and his white sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sort of noble savage image, unfettered by
civilization, which they like,'' Bronitsky said. ``God forbid that
anyone should ever discuss that Indians have VCR's and
microwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But a central thrust of the new interpretative center, which is
part of a resort that includes a casino, an 18-hole golf course, a
hotel and recreational vehicle park, is to show how Indians of the
Columbia Plateau live today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be perceived as dynamic, evolving, healthy
people,'' Ms. Conner said. ``That's not exactly what people expect
to see when they visit a reservation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that these Columbia Plateau Indians have lived
in roughly the same places for thousands of years is a tourist draw
in a country where so many of the human attachments to the land are
ephemeral, tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much live where we've always lived, and people are
fascinated by that,'' Ms. Conner said. The center tells a story of
independent people whose lives were forever changed by the
schooners that came over the Oregon Trail. It shows the effect of
disease, of boarding schools that disrupted families, and of
poverty. And it ends on a hopeful note, with visions of a tribe
flourishing anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very moved by it,'' Ms. Conner said. ``We get these
notes in the suggestion box: `I'm sorry for everything we've done
to you people.' It awakens a lot of trauma, a lot of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guilt-swollen effect of some heritage tour sites,
tour operators outside the reservation say there is great interest
in all things Indian. A record number of people, about 600,000,
visited the National Museum of the American Indian in lower
Manhattan last year, double the attendance of the year before. And
out near the reservations, museums report a similar trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the Plains Indian, on the Blackfeet
Reservation, near Browning, Mont., nearly half the visitors this
year have been from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A huge majority of the guests at Darrell Norman's village and
horse ranch on the Blackfeet Reservation are Europeans. They take
pictures of the bison herds that wander around the reservation,
ride horses that are descendants of the mustangs brought to the
Americas by the Spanish and learn about the culture of Northern
Plains tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know what the Blackfeet are all about,'' Norman
said. ``They want to taste our food. They want to sleep on the
ground _ the whole package. They may show up with stereotypical
image, but they leave with the sense that we have a very alive
culture. We do not have dead arts, dead language.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kilian, the Dutch visitor to the Blackfeet, said she had
considered going to China on her vacation, but chose the Blackfeet
Reservation instead. ``Before I came here I heard that they had a
dislike for whites,'' she said. ``That is not true. I have felt
very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem that concerns the tribes is trying to hold the line
between sharing culture and exploitation. The Umatilla, for
example, found that many Germans want to stay with Indian families
_ but the Indians themselves do not feel like opening their homes.
The Blackfeet, who are enjoying a banner year for tourism, are
grappling with the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been this question,'' said Ray Montoya, the
Blackfeet tribal planning director, ``of how far we develop this
industry while maintaining a pristine environment and our
culture.''  &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Serbia _ NATO indecision about whether to act against
a three-month-old military offensive in Kosovo by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic has severely threatened the
credibility of the alliance and almost ensured a winter-long human
catastrophe, Western diplomats said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the shelling and torching of villages by
Milosevic's forces, coupled with the apparent electoral victory of
a Serbian ultra-nationalist in Bosnia, has put Washington's policy
of dealing with Milosevic to its biggest test since the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to regain the initiative,'' said an influential
NATO diplomat, adding that the alliance had severely underestimated
the will and strength of the Serbs at the start of the summer and
allowed them to roll on unchallenged. NATO had overestimated the
strength of the Kosovo Liberation Army _ ethnic Albanian rebels
fighting for Kosovo's independence _ and had quaked at the thought
of acting as the ``KLA's air force,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Washington's envoy on Kosovo, Christopher Hill, is
scheduled to meet Milosevic. A flurry of discussion about Kosovo is
expected in New York this week at the U.N. General Assembly, and in
Portugal at a meeting of NATO Defense Ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO diplomat noted that the alliance has given Milosevic
comfort by failing to live up to repeated threats of using its air
power.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian forces, now heading into their third month of an
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels, attacked about a dozen
villages around Podujevo, 20 miles north of the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, from last Tuesday to Friday, forcing an estimated 10,000
civilians to flee, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials allowed into the area on Saturday found a health
clinic run by an Albanian charity, Mother Teresa, burned and the
school in the village of Dobrotin vandalized after the Serbian
forces used it as sleeping quarters, said the spokesman, Fernando
del Mundo. Many homes were burned beyond repair, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 ethnic Albanians have been forced from their homes
in similar actions by the Yugoslav army since late July and are
moving around Kosovo on foot and on tractors seeking shelter,
according to U.N. officials and Western monitors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 are squatting without shelter in the cold and
rain on some of Europe's most rugged mountains. About 3,000 were
bussed into the city of Shkoder in neighboring Albania last
weekend, adding to the political unrest there.
</P>
<P>
   The director of U.N. refugee operations in Serbia, Margaret
O'Keefe, said that Milosevic had calculated force against civilians
that was far-reaching but not quite enough to provoke NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just stops short of the mark,'' said Miss O'Keefe, adding
that Milosevic was not conducting a ``slaughter, but severe
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the U.N. refugee organization was ``very pessimistic
that we are heading into a winter of conflict with guerrilla type
strikes by the KLA and reprisals by the Serb police.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic initiated his campaign by insisting that Kosovo is a
province of Serbia and in 1989 withdrew its autonomy. But more than
90 percent of the approximately 2 million people in Kosovo are
Albanian; the number of Serb residents is dwindling daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and European governments, fearful of
the precedent that an independent Kosovo would set for other
breakaway movements in the world, have said they do not support the
aims of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which was fairly well-routed by
Milosevic by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and NATO officials warned Milosevic that if he
continued to use force against civilians, NATO would retaliate. In
the summer, Milosevic pledged that his military action was ending,
according to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, said another NATO diplomat familiar with the Serbian
military action on the ground, ``This has gone from being a fight
with the Kosovo Liberation Army terrorists to being a campaign
against the Albanian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, the Assistant Secretary of State for Refugees in
Washington, said that during a tour of Kosovo and Montenegro this
month she had been told that 212 villages in Kosovo had been
torched to varying degrees by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Taft said the Serbs' strategy ``seems to be the aggressive
displacement of civilians and then, when winter comes, saying to
the West you can have access and feed them.''

SCHROEDER THE INVULNERABLE? LOOK AT HIS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This story was eliminated earlier and is now reinstated.)  
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ He went to the opera in Vienna with the
chairman of Volkswagen. He took a spin on the Boeing yacht in
Seattle last year. He has visited with Bill Gates, the chairman of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If Gerhard Schroeder has tried to communicate anything during
his long quest to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl, it is that he is
worldly and modern. A Social Democrat who started out as a Marxist
student leader, he now talks easily about working with both
business and labor to tackle Germany's high unemployment and
prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   But with elections just one week away, Schroeder's past is
coming back to haunt him. As the premier of Lower Saxony since
1990, he presides over a state with nearly 11 percent unemployment
_ one of the highest rates in western Germany. The state's budget
is a shambles, groaning under a mountain of debt. Job-training,
school budgets and community programs have been cut back, and
bigger cuts are likely next year.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union,
steadily gaining in national polls, have begun to hammer at
Schroeder's problems at home. The issue was a major theme in the
Sept. 12 state elections in Bavaria, where the Social Democrats
suffered a major setback by receiving only 28.7 percent of the
vote. Schroeder continues to lead Kohl in national polls by two or
three percentage points, but many voters are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charge that Schroeder is all show and no substance, a
person who thrives on dramatic gestures but whose state
nevertheless lags behind in key respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to be the trouble-shooter, to jump into situations
where he can rescue a factory from being shut down,'' said Fritz
Muller, a senior economic adviser to Christian Democrats in the
state parliament. ``The problem is, he doesn't have any fundamental
economic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has shown a knack for bailing out troubled local
factories. Brushing aside objections from environmentalists, his
government has spent hundreds of millions of marks to deepen a
small river so that a family-owned shipbuilder could build luxury
liners and deliver them to the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   When Preussag AG wanted to sell its steel mill in March to an
Austrian company, Schroeder's government bought the factory for
about $600 million and then quickly listed it on the stock
exchange. It has also propped up Continental Tire, based in Lower
Saxony, and taken over an airplane maintenance center that
Daimler-Benz wanted to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and his supporters say such actions show their
resourcefulness as the state's old manufacturing industries
struggle with global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not how we compare with other states today,
but whether things look better now than they did when we came into
power,'' said Alfred Tacke, Schroeder's state secretary for
economics. ``We think there has been progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But government statistics show that Lower Saxony has grown more
slowly than most other western German states for the last several
years _ and more slowly than several eastern German ones. While
industrial growth has roared ahead in states like Bavaria,
Germany's wealthiest, it barely limps along here. And while
Schroeder talks about creating 100,000 more job-training positions
and investing in technology, his own state has invested much less
than many others.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's record here provides a vivid insight into his
personality and his style of governing. The picture that emerges is
of a relentlessly pragmatic leader who thrives on protecting jobs
but is bored by economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of sympathy for him,'' said Gernod Preuss,
president of Lower Saxony's association of employers, who has known
Schroeder for two decades. ``He has learned a lot about business,
and he has consistently said that the state can only be successful
if the economy is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He relishes his role as a member of Volkswagen's supervisory
board, a position he holds because the government of Lower Saxony
owns 20 percent of the company. When Volkswagen was in danger of
bankruptcy in 1993, he strongly supported brutal cost-reduction
measures that raised howls of protest from suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder gets much poorer grades as a thinker. Executives
and many local government officials complain that he was sloppy
about finances when the state was booming in the early 1990s and
was then caught by surprise when the economy slowed to a crawl. And
they were infuriated this year when Schroeder unilaterally vetoed
Preussag's decision to sell its steel mill and had the state take
it over instead.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Today, Schroeder's budget problems are among the most acute of
any state in western Germany, and his lieutenants have been
scrambling to keep them from damaging his campaign for chancellor.
The state's total debt has ballooned from 37 billion marks in 1989
(then about $23 billion) to more than 62 billion marks (about $34
billion) last year. The debt here has grown faster than in any
other state in western Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the state supreme court ruled for the second time
that Lower Saxony's budget deficit violates legal limits. Local
governments, meanwhile, have sued the state, maintaining that it
has shortchanged them by about $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders now contend that Schroeder faces a shortfall
of nearly $3 billion in the two-year state budget for 1999 and
2000, and they are asking a court to force him to reveal his budget
before the elections. Schroeder's lieutenants have said they won't
even show their draft to the parliament until just before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The financial straits have seriously cut into social programs.
Local school districts have all but stopped hiring new teachers,
and one town on the northern coast went so far as to use its own
money to do so. The University of Hanover has been forced to
increase the size of classes, delay renovations and lay off
clerical workers. At a community counseling program in Hanover for
battered women, workers have gone without pay since the government
cut off money several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Saxony's level of joblessness, at 10.7 percent, is
markedly higher than the western German average of 9.1 percent. Its
level of youth unemployment, at 13.9 percent, is the highest of any
western German state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the state's budget has been so cramped, Schroeder's
government has spent far less than other states on training
programs and investment in new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Saxony has privatized about $1 billion worth of
state-owned companies, but it has used almost all that money either
to make interest payments on its debt or support entitlement
programs. Defenders of Schroeder say he has had to wrestle with
long-term problems that were evident before he came to power. Lower
Saxony's industry was dominated by old-line manufacturing companies
that have been battered by global competition since the 1980s.
Volkswagen, the state's biggest company and the anchor for an
extensive industry of parts suppliers, came perilously close to
bankruptcy in 1993 before it put itself through brutal cost
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame Schroeder for everything,'' said Wilfried
Prewo, president of Hanover's chamber of commerce and industry.
``Unemployment was high before he came to power. He started out
with a pile of debt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Prewo did say that Schroeder had made mistakes. When
Schroeder was elected premier in 1990, Lower Saxony was in the
midst of a boom resulting from the re-unification of Germany.
Because the state lies right on the old eastern border, its
companies sold vast amounts of equipment and services when the Bonn
government pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into rebuilding
the east.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using the good years to shore up the state's
finances or invest in new industries, it embarked on new
entitlement programs, such as giving free school materials to every
child in the state. When the economy in eastern Germany went into a
deep slump around 1995, Schroeder was left with billions of dollars
in additional debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``His miscalculation was that the growth would go on forever,''
said Prewo. ``He didn't invest his surpluses, but rather consumed
them on long-term commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   But even his critics acknowledge that Schroeder has an
unorthodox cleverness, which he showed after acquiring Preussag's
steel mill in February.
</P>
<P>
   The move outraged free-market purists and many business leaders.
But then Schroeder took advantage of what was still a booming stock
market and listed the company on the stock exchange in June. The
government sold most of its stake for a cash profit of about $25
million, and still owns shares worth several hundred million
dollars. &QL;

FIRST LADY`S RESPONSE TO SCANDAL: MORE WORK, MORE INTENSITY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the dedication of the new Peace Corps
headquarters last week, Hillary Rodham Clinton cut a long red
ribbon with two-foot-long scissors and nearly signed up.
</P>
<P>
   When the Peace Corps director praised the first lady for her
character and said she would be a great volunteer, Mrs. Clinton
deadpanned, ``Maybe I'll just leave this afternoon. Point me in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Mrs. Clinton really wants escape from Washington, or from
the humiliation and betrayal her friends say she feels, she is not
showing it. Nor is she talking about forgiveness, leaving her
husband to do all the atoning and confessing on his own for the sex
scandal that may doom his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she is playing her role as first lady with a
no-time-to-waste-hello-goodbye intensity that is both breathtaking
and unnerving, struggling to change the subject with passionate
talk about health care, education and family, and fighting to win
back disillusioned voters, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, paradoxically, the first lady has never looked
better, sounded stronger or even seemed happier. Her popularity
rating is high. Her loyalists say that no matter what happens to
Bill Clinton, she is a lady with a future. Every day seems to be a
good-hair day.
</P>
<P>
   She is said to feel pressure, not to leave Clinton or to come to
his defense, but to get a lot of things done before her tenure
ends, whenever that may be. There's simply no time to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets up in the morning and takes a shower and puts on her
makeup and a nice dress and does her events,'' said Sara Ehrman, a
Middle East expert who has been one of Mrs. Clinton's closest
friends since the 1968 McGovern campaign. ``She went on vacation
and probably ate chocolates and pulled the covers over her head and
pitched her fits. Have you ever said to yourself, I want to have a
nervous breakdown but I don't have the time now? It's enough
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, ``She doesn't
wallow.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Clinton has made her already full fall schedule even
fuller. On Thursday, for example, she appeared with pop singer
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds to accept a grant to buy musical
instruments for public schools, and met at the White House with
educators and executives to promote corporate support for the arts
in public schools. Then she gave a speech that evening on the need
for American engagement around the world as she picked up an award
for ``raising consciousness'' globally for family issues.
</P>
<P>
   To raise her own foreign policy consciousness the day before,
she called in senior officials like the national security adviser,
Samuel Berger, and more than a dozen outside experts, including
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, to brief her on
America's role in the post-Cold War world. She plans to travel to
Chile, Haiti, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic later this month
to promote development and women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets sustenance from her work, sustenance from her friends
and this is the cloth through which she has her support system,''
said Melanne Verveer, her chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's most immediate goal is to stanch the damage of
her husband's errant sex life at the polls this November.
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic candidates are shunning the president, they are
clamoring for her. And this week she is slated to campaign for
Democratic candidates for Congress in New York, Colorado,
Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, two dozen female lawmakers who came to the White
House for 90 minutes of tea and conversation prevailed on her to do
even more.
</P>
<P>
   They referred to the scandal as ``the clutter,'' telling Mrs.
Clinton that there was an urgent need to cut through it and focus
on issues that mattered to them and their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her that as women, we know that women can do more than
one thing at a time in an emergency,'' said Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Calif. ``If there's an emergency, women still make their kids'
lunches, listen to the news, get ready for work, pay the bills. So
we asked her to get on a plane and stop at places where her voice
so desperately needs to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is so seized with this fall's elections that at a
Democratic fund-raiser in New York last Monday she wasted no time
in gathering intelligence. ``I hadn't been with her two minutes
when she asked me to evaluate what the state-by-state prospects
might be,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``We didn't focus
on the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the ``problem'' intrudes.
</P>
<P>
   At a National Council of Negro Women black-tie dinner for 2,000
people honoring Dr. Dorothy Height, there was Mrs. Clinton all
dressed up in a black, V-necked, sequined St. John knit.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the sometimes White House
confessor, using his invocation time to tell Mrs. Clinton that no
one knows exactly what to say to her during this crisis. The crowd
applauded as he praised her as a woman of ``uncompromising
dignity.'' He then prayed to God to ``forgive us for our sins and
the foolishness of our ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton put on her serenely opaque face. While Jackson may
feel like talking about forgiveness, she is keeping quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 news conference, Mrs. Clinton spoke of her desire for
``a zone of privacy'' and has always struggled to keep up a thick
wall that few are allowed to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   After a Clinton confidante suggested earlier this month that
Mrs. Clinton might make a stand-by-your-man statement of support
for her husband, one of her close allies asked her about it. ``Her
answer was, 'Look, this is a purely private issue and we're working
it through, and if I have anything to say it's going to be if and
when I say it,''' the ally said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neel Lattimore, who was the first lady's press spokesman for
five years, said that there is a political motive as well. ``If she
went out there and said, `I forgive my husband,' well, what woman
so quickly does forgive and forget? She is very smart politically
and this has political ramifications. She will choose her moment.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters ask about the first lady's marriage, Ms. Berry
repeats the mantra authorized by her boss: ``She has made it clear
that she supports her husband, she loves him and she forgives
him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the first lady's aides, she has not shared even
with them her feelings about either the investigation or her
husband. ``She has not talked about her personal situation, and all
of us to a person honors the fact that that is absolutely
private,'' Ms. Verveer said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of the Starr report, Mrs. Clinton has
abandoned her verbal war against her husband's enemies. She is no
longer publicly blaming the scandal on a right-wing conspiracy
against him.
</P>
<P>
   That's because she now knows the facts about Monica Lewinsky,
her supporters say. ``She was not privy to the information,'' said
Ms. Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Clintons are giving the impression that they have
never been closer.
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner at the White House for Czech President
Vaclav Havel last week, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton smiled and cooed and
held hands throughout the evening. She waved her arms and he
mouthed the lyrics as they danced to the Marine Band's rendition of
``Mustang Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speeches, she talks frequently about her ``husband'' and
``the president'' in promoting his policies.
</P>
<P>
   And what she is doing is greatly appreciated. ``She has been
very supportive of the president publicly in terms of her events
and that's been great,'' said Douglas Sosnick, the president's
counselor. ``It's not my place to suggest anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Her close associates insist she has not read the Starr report
with its salacious allegations about Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky,
including Ms. Lewinsky's account of a conversation in which the
president told her he had had hundreds of lovers in his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a report in large part that is designed to embarrass and
humiliate,'' said Ms. Verveer. ``Why would she spend her time
reading it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said that Mrs. Clinton is scarcely reading the
newspapers or watching television, except for Chicago Cubs games.
She is said to be exercising every day.

COMMENTARY: IMPEACHMENT ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In six weeks, a minority of the nation's eligible
voters will decide whether the president is to be impeached by the
House and removed from office by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates are ready to deal with the gut issue of this
November's election. Republican candidates talk about truthfulness
and Democrats issue fervent pleas to get on with the nation's
business. But nobody will come out and say, ``If elected, I will
vote to impeach that hairsplitting perjurer'' or, contrariwise,
``Those Bible-thumping hypocrites will throw out Bill Clinton over
my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   The pervasive public pussyfooting by the candidates who will be
entrusted with the punishment of the admitted miscreant has two
causes:
</P>
<P>
   1. No Democrat inclined to defend the president knows what else
is in the scandal pipeline. Does Ken Starr have anything else on
Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate? Will courts reinstate the Paula
Jones case or hold Clinton in contempt? Will a new independent
counsel find cover-up of Clinton-Gore campaign lawbreaking, or
House committees reveal the Asian connection? Will a new bimbo
erupt?
</P>
<P>
   2. No Republican inclined to remove the president knows if his
high job approval outweighs his dropping personal approval in
voters' minds. Are likely voters disgusted with the perpetrator or
the messengers? Will taking a position seem like prejudgment? Is it
safer silently to watch Clinton self-destruct, or will absence of
outrage offend the GOP base?
</P>
<P>
   Result: Both sides are submerging the key issue in this
election. Candidates go into pious contortions to avoid Topic A.
And yet we all know what would happen if the Democrats picked up 12
seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers would replace Rep. Henry Hyde as House
Judiciary chairman, and Rep. Barney Frank, speaking for the new
majority, would interpret the election as a national vote to
forgive and not to impeach the president. Unless Clinton could be
shown accepting a cash bribe to commit treason from Jiang Zemin on
national TV, no crime would be high enough to rate more than a
tut-tut resolution about hallway hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the House stays Republican and its impeachment inquiry
turns up abuses beyond Monica that produce a public consensus that
Clinton has to go. Then his fate will be decided by his ability to
marshal 34 out of 100 votes in the Senate to prevent removal.
</P>
<P>
   The election this year will determine the size of the Clinton
core. Consider Senate races crucial to Clinton survival in some of
our largest states:
</P>
<P>
   In California, Sen. Barbara Boxer does not want to be left an
outlaw's in-law. Though polls have driven her to express mild
anguish at behavior far worse than she used to excoriate furiously
in Republican males, the Clintons can depend on her vote.
</P>
<P>
   In cahoots with Janet Reno, Boxer punished San Diego prosecutor
Charles La Bella for his stunning report daring to recommend an
independent counsel in the campaign finance scandal. On cue from
the White House, Boxer chose a far less qualified Hispanic-American
to fill the job of U.S. Attorney that had been promised La Bella
(whose ethnic group is apparently insignificant in California). If
re-elected, she's a sure vote to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun may be in difficulty for
her affinity to Nigerian dictators, but if re-elected is certain to
stick with Clinton until the last dog dies.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there is at least a chance that either challenger
Charles Schumer or incumbent Al D'Amato would vote his conscience,
but the political heat on Schumer to leave Clinton untouched would
be far greater.
</P>
<P>
   (Schumer's campaign theme _ branding D'Amato a liar _ is
curious. When FDR was accused by Republicans of not ending the
Depression, he reminded them of ``the lugubrious adage of never
mentioning rope in the house of a man who'd been hanged'' and
suggested the GOP never use the word ``Depression.'' In this
impeachment election, ``liar'' is not the best choice of charges
for a Democrat.)
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates will shy away from the gut issue because they
don't know how it will cut. But next year's impeachment is in the
hands of this year's voters. They will make it possible _ or
impossible _ to bring Bill Clinton to account. &QL;

 &HT;    Final week of season promises answers to questions
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The final week of baseball's regular season should be
just like the first 25 _ breathtaking. There are some many
questions needed to be answered, so little time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   No playoff-bound club, despite that five of the six divisions
have been wrapped up, knows who they will be playing in the
divisional playoffs. There is the home run race between Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa and who will finish with the new standard.
There are wildcard spots to be won, final impressions for all the
awards to be made, close races for both batting titles to end.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for:
</P>
<P>
   _ The home run race: On paper, Sosa should be able to hit a few
homers this week considering he has two games left against the
Brewers and 10 of his 63 homers have come against Milwaukee
pitching. But Sosa doesn't get the benefit of the wind blowing out
at Wrigley Field, spending all week on the road. McGwire has to
face the pitching-tough Astros but he does get to close out the
season against Montreal in St. Louis where he is hitting .307 and
has 33 of his 65 homers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The wild cards: Remember the division race between the Braves
and the Giants in 1993, which came down to the final game and
Atlanta slipped past by winning its 104th game? Well, that's what
happening between the Mets and Cubs for the NL wildcard. For almost
six weeks, the most the has separated the two clubs has been one
game, that margin now being held by the Mets. Neither team really
has an advantage when it comes to their schedule as the Cubs close
out the season in Houston and New York in Atlanta. Braves manager
Bobby Cox, even if his team has wrapped up the league's best
record, will want to beat the Mets considering the club would much
rather play the Cubs in the first round rather than Houston or San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can't just seem to put away the AL wildcard, having
lost three straight and they are four games up on Toronto. The Red
Sox, known for their late September disasters, is at home all week
with three with Tampa Bay and four with the Orioles. The Blue Jays
are also at home, with three against the Orioles and three against
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   _ The battle in the AL West: For a moment there it appeared as
if the Rangers were going to pull away from the Angels. But Texas
can't stand prosperity and this spot could come down to these next
three nights where the club face each other In Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The battle for the NL best record: The Braves lead the spot by
two games over the Astros and head to Florida for two and then back
home against the Mets. The Astros have two in St. Louis and three
with the Cubs while the Padres appear out of the hunt at 4 1/2
games back.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the season ended today: In the AL, the Yankees would open
up with Anaheim in a best-of-five series and the Indians would host
the Red Sox. In the NL, the Braves would open the first round with
the Padres and Houston would play the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The batting titles: The NL race has come down between
Colorado's Larry Walker (.355) and John Olerud (.354) of the Mets.
Walker may be helped by the fact that he is playing very little
lately while Olerud is caught up in a wildcard chase. On the AL
side, New York's Bernie Williams (.336) has a four-point lead over
Boston's Mo Vaughn. Williams will get some time off this week while
Vaughn must stay in the lineup until the Red Sox clinch the
wildcard.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cy Youngs: Both races are close. In the NL, Braves
lefthander Tom Glavine may be out front after becoming the major's
first 20-game winner with a shutout Saturday while teammate Greg
Maddux, stuck on 17 wins, may be out. Glavine's biggest competition
will come from San Diego where starter Kevin Brown (18-7) has the
league's second best ERA (2.44) and whether voters will go with
closer Trevor Hoffman, who perhaps has been the most dominant of
any pitcher this year.
</P>
<P>
   The AL side is as tough. Boston's Pedro Martinez was the
favorite until he lost three straight and now it appears that
Toronto's Roger Clemens will win his fifth Cy Young and second in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   _ MVPs: Sosa should win the NL version considering how he has
carried his team all year but McGwire will get a lot of votes. The
AL is wide open though it may come down between Seattle teammates
as Ken Griffey Jr. has 53 homers and 137 RBIs while Alex Rodriguez
has 40 homers, 119 RBIs and 43 stolen bases. With 43 homers and a
major league-leading 154 RBIs, Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez
could help his chances with a big week that pushes his club to a
division title.

 &HT;    Inside College Football
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ For those Tennessee fans who want to spend
this week celebrating Saturday night's emotional 20-17 overtime win
against Florida, Volunteers coach Phillip Fulmer has two words:
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame opened the 1998 seaon with an equally emotional
victory over Michigan. The following week the Fighting Irish looked
like a team without a clue when they were embarrassed by 0-2
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think the same thing can happen to the No. 4
Volunteers Saturday night against Houston? Here are two more words,
said Fulmer: Florida State. The Seminoles were ranked No. 2 on
Sept. 12 and never dreamed they could lose to N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll be reminding our players of those things this
week but I also think our guys will handle it (beating Florida)
maturely,'' said Fulmer, who got only a few hours sleep before
going back to his desk on Sunday. ''But we've been a pretty
consistent team over the years. We don't usually go up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (0-3) is certainly not a good team but the Cougars did
make No. 3 UCLA work for a 42-24 win on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be hard for the Vols to concentrate on the
Cougars, given the October guantlet awaiting them. They play back
to back road games at Auburn (Oct. 3) and Georgia (Oct. 10). After
a week off, they face improving Alabama at home on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this team knows that we're going to have to play hard
every week to have a chance,'' said Fulmer. ''They know this is a
blue-collar team. We're going to have to fight for everything we
get.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Tennessee can get past those games and get to November,
it has a great chance to run the table. In the 90s, Tennessee is
30-1 in the month of November.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier: it's not over
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss to Tennessee, Florida coach Steve Spurrier said
Sunday he is not conceding the SEC East to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to play eight conference games and I think the SEC
is very tough and very even this year,'' said Spurrier. ''We just
have to wait and see how everything plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   No mystery why Florida is struggling. The Gators have nine
fumbles in three games, one more than they had all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Florida had five turnovers, nine penalties, and
had to burn several timeouts because of miscommunication on the
sidelines. Florida fumbled once going into the Tennessee end zone
and then had to settle for a field goal inside the Volunteer
five-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Gators are playing very un-Gator like.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we don't have 11 guys who know what to do out
there--at least on offense,'' said Spurrier, whose team hosts
Kentucky on Saturday. ''We've got to sharpen up our assignments on
each play.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more bad news for Florida on Sunday: Cornerback Tony
George suffered a severe knee sprain against Tennessee and will be
out for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vols No. 4 in both polls
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's win over Florida elevated Tennessee to No. 4 in both
of the major polls that were released on Sunday. It also left the
polls in an unusual state. For the first time in almost eight
years, a team from the state of Florida is not ranked in the top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Florida (2-1) dropped from No. 2 to No. 8 in the Associated
Press poll of sportswriters. Florida State, which trounced Duke,
moved back into the Top 10 at No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a team from the Sunshine State was out of the top
five was Oct. 27, 1990, when Miami was eighth, Florida State 12th,
and Florida 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking
</P>
<P>
   --Looks like Auburn is rethinking this idea about running the
football. After losing 50 yards to quarterback sacks, Auburn was
heled to just 21 yards on 28 carries in Saturday's 31-19 loss to
LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made our minds up that we weren't going to lose like we did
to Virginia (19-0),'' said Bowden. We were going to do things that
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for Auburn's miracle win over Alabama last season,
Saturday's loss to LSU would have been the fifth straight at home
for the Tigers. They get this week off and host Tennessee on Oct.
3.
</P>
<P>
   --Maybe Kansas State is for real. The Wildcats (3-0) did
anything they wanted in beating Texas 48-7. The coaches who vote in
their poll are convinced, putting Kansas State third. The writers
in the AP poll remain skeptical and have K-State at No. 5. Kansas
State's next test will beat Colorado on Oct. 20.

 &HT;    Vikings' patience tames the Lions
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Football is mostly a game about speed, but as the
undefeated Minnesota Vikings demonstrated here on Sunday afternoon
in their 29-6 victory over the Detroit Lions, patience is often as
significant a virtue as quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Victimized by their own aggressiveness and haste during a first
half that ended in a 6-6 tie, the Vikings advanced to 3-0 for the
second time in three years by emphasizing a steadier approach on
both sides of the ball over the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we thought, `Oh, boy, a rookie quarterback' on
those first couple series and we probably were aggressive to a
fault,'' said Vikings defensive coordinator Foge Fazio. ``You see a
guy starting his first NFL game and the reaction is to get after
him. You see Barry Sanders running to the sideline and everybody
wants to sprint after him. But the biggest thing you need is
discipline ... and we had that after halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Vikings gradually began to control Sanders and
Lions first-time starter Charlie Batch, the first series of the
second half was a microcosm of the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the Detroit 14-yard line, Sanders was buried
for a 2-yard loss off left tackle by defensive end John Randle. On
second-and-12, middle linebacker John McDaniel came through an
inside gap cleanly to stuff Sanders for minus-3 yards. Instead of
blitzing on third-and-long, Fazio called for a ``cover-two'' zone
and Batch was forced to scramble for 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Slippery all-purpose threat David Palmer returned the subsequent
punt 44 yards to the Lions' 22-yard line, and three plays later
Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham rifled a 5-yard touchdown
pass to Randy Moss. The Vikings went on to score on four straight
possessions, three of which originated in Detroit territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first (defensive) series set the tone for the whole
second half,'' said McDaniel, who had eight tackles, 1 1/2 sacks,
one pass defensed, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. ``We
really carried the play to them after that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the usually explosive Minnesota offense struggling to take
advantage of ``red zone'' opportunities _ five drives ended in Gary
Anderson field goals as the 17-year veteran became the No. 2 scorer
in NFL history _ the defense had to carry the Vikings as well.
</P>
<P>
   To eliminate the double-team blocking Randle typically commands
when he plays at the ``under'' tackle position, Fazio moved the
All-Pro defender outside to end. After blitzing on 11 of Detroit's
first 23 offensive snaps and being burned at times by Batch runs,
he settled on a five-man rush with zone coverage on the back end
thereafter. And once the Vikings widened the lead, Sanders was no
longer a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Sanders carried 13 times for 12 yards, with
five of the rushes for negative yardage. For the day, he had 22
carries for 69 yards, but 10 rushes went for 1 yard or less as
McDaniel and weakside linebacker Dwayne Rudd hounded him
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio and his charges were abetted by dubious play-calling from
the Detroit offensive staff. Nursing a 6-3 lead midway through the
second quarter, the Lions never gave the ball to Sanders again in
the first half. Instead, they called 12 consecutive pass plays and
Batch, who scrambled for 63 yards on eight carries, slowly came
undone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking nothing away from (Batch), because I thought he showed
a lot of poise,'' Vikings coach Dennis Green said. ``But as long as
he's running the ball, and not Barry Sanders, I can live with
that.''

 &HT;    Martin wins at Dover
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Mark Martin gave Jeff Gordon an old fashioned
whipping Sunday at Dover Downs Speedway, leading 380 of the 400
laps for his sixth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, however, hardly could feel the pain. While Martin
dominated, beating Gordon to the MBNA Gold 400 checkered flag by
2.036 seconds, he cut only 10 points into his rival's Winston Cup
championship war chest. He now trails by 194 points with seven
races left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is the glue that holds a championship together,''
Martin said. ``We lost 140 points two weeks ago at Darlington. The
only way we can be a contender is if he loses 140 points or 75
twice. If we hadn't been so hooked up, he would have won again
today.''
</P>
<P>
   That Gordon didn't have anything for Martin can be attributed to
Martin's gile and tenacity in working lap traffic over the final 49
laps laps with a 1.026-second lead. Gordon never could close within
a car length, though he also skirted the same traffic as Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to congratulate Mark and that team,'' Gordon said.
``They did a great job; had the car to beat. they pretty much had
us whipped all day. There, at the end, was about the best my car
had been all day. I was just too tight on those long runs. You go
back and forth, loose-tight, loose-tight. We got the best we could
out of it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin got the best he could muster, also. He needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't been so hooked up, he would have won again. They
threw everything they had at the end,'' Martin said. ``But, we had
a dominant car. This is what it's all about. I'm so happy for the
entire Valvoline team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led only once for six laps in the middle of the day.
Whatever momentum he might have mustered went plop on lap 246 when
he was black flagged and ordered into the pits. His pit crew a lap
earlier had pulled the fenders out from the wheels. Gordon came to
the pits in third place and left in ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have to ask NASCAR about that (black
flag),'' Gordon said. ``I've never heard of anything like that
before.'' ``We didn't do anything to the fenders. I did get hit,
knocked into somebody and caved in the right side,'' Gordon said.
``I don't think it bent anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Grand National Matt Kenseth might have been the
show-stopper. He finished sixth in his first Winston Cup race,
subbing for Bill Elliott, whose father died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one race, and I appreciate Bill giving me this
opportunity,'' said the 26-year-old Kenseth, who on Saturday won
his third Busch race of the year.

 &HT;    Young coaches on the move
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During her playing career at Georgia Tech , Theresa
Gernatt displayed the characteristics that quickly helped her move
up the ladder of Division I women's basketball assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The walk-on from Marietta, Ga.'s Wheeler High earned a
scholarship and became the team captain because of her leadership
and infectious enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in my family, it's been in my blood for as long as I
can remember,'' said Gernatt, in her third season as Florida
State's recruiting coordinator. ``I'm doing now what I've always
dreamed of doing, but to be in this position at this point in my
life is truly incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gernatt, 29, personifies the growing number of young female
assistants who have used momentum from Title IX gender equity
legislation to propel them into full-time jobs in collegiate
sports. She also earned a master's degree at Georgia Tech while
working as an assistant to former athletics director Homer Rice.
</P>
<P>
   But has she paid sufficient dues to fulfill her ambition of soon
becoming a head coach? Are women being pushed along an exceedingly
fast track so university presidents and athletics directors can
tout a progressive hiring record? Gernatt began her networking
while in college, attending the Women's Final Four and confirming
in her own mind that the coaching bug she felt needed to be
parlayed into experience. She has not coached in high school,
unlike many of her older peers _ men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess things are different for us now than maybe they were
10 or so years ago,'' Gernatt said. ``I don't know whether I want
to be a head coach or not. But I've had some great mentors, and
it's very important for us to get established that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to her current boss at Florida State, Sue Semrau, a
former assistant at Wisconsin, where head coach Jane
Albright-Dieterle served under Tennessee's Pat Summitt for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of connections among female coaches have
strengthened in recent years. Ironically, the networking approach
may be keeping more experienced males out of jobs.Vivian Acosta, a
retired Brooklyn College professor and coach who tracks gender
numbers, acknowledged that at the top levels , women basketball
coaches have a statistical advantage, albeit a diminished one, over
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do, and why shouldn't they?'' she said. ``If young women
don't see women in leadership positions, they can never aspire to
do the same thing. Role-modeling is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the gains women have been making on the coaching side,
their presence is nearly invisible at the helm of major athletics
departments _ which oversee men's and women's sports _ and other
administrative posts.
</P>
<P>
   Only two women are overall athletics directors at
football-playing schools in major conferences _ Barbara Hedges at
Washington and Deborah Yow at Maryland. Linda Bruno of the Atlantic
10 is the only female commissioner of a major conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and UNC-Charlotte athletics director Judith Rose have made
attempts at being selected for the men's basketball committee, but
were turned away. The women's committee has had just one male
member in recent years, and former chairwoman Jean Lenti Ponsetto
thinks there's no need to apologize for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of keeping men away,'' she said. ``It's a
chance for women administrators to obtain some leadership
experience that isn't available in other places.''
</P>
<P>
   A good example is former Georgia Tech associate athletics
director Bernadette McGlade, who was a candidate to succeed Rice
when he retired last year. Within months of Dave Braine's
appointment, McGlade was hired as an associate commissioner at the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

 &HT;    A women's place is in the Olympics
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The evolution of women as accepted Olympians did not
take quite as long as the evolution of ape to man. But the starting
points were not too dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   _ 776 B.C. Inaugural Ancient Olympics are held with no women
competitors. All females caught watching are put to death.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1900 A.D. Women make Olympics debut in two sports _ golf and
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1912 A.D. A record 57 women _ compared with 2,490 men _
compete in Stockholm Games. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of
the Modern Day Games, describes Olympic competition as ``the solemn
and periodic exaltation of male athleticism, with . . . female
applause as reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, a woman's place is in the Olympics _ on the field, not in
the stands. Females not only account for greater numbers than ever
_ the 3,685 in Atlanta represented a 33 percent increase over
Barcelona in '92 _ they have shifted the balance of gender power in
U.S. sports. In the last two Summer Games, American women have won
40 percent of the country's medal total, up from 33 percent in the
previous two Games and 23 percent in the five before that.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta '96 has been called the Games of the Woman.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. strides taken in the snow and ice of the Winter Olympics
are even more impressive. In the last three Games, women captured
26 medals to 11 for the males, including 13 of the 17 golds. Two of
the biggest stories in Nagano illustrated the diametric fortunes of
the sexes: The U.S. women's hockey team winning the gold medal,
with the men's team failing to place and some of them acting like
frat boys in vandalizing their dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The women's increasing market share in precious metals has not
gone unnoticed in Colorado Springs, Colo., home of the U.S. Olympic
Committee. Executive director Dick Schultz recently signaled a
shift in the philosophy of slicing the financial pie in even
pieces, announcing a greater emphasis before the next Games in
Sydney (2000) and Salt Lake City (2002) to support sports in which
the U.S. has strong medal hopes. And increasingly more of those
events fall on the women's side.
</P>
<P>
   The apportioning of $26 million in new funds will be decided in
the coming months, with three women's sports _ hockey, soccer and
softball _ already earmarked for a significant increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in putting the most dollars where it can (be)
the most (productive),'' Schultz said. ``You won't necessarily see
a shifting away from a certain sport, but we're thinking about
additional funds that go strictly to performances and potential for
winning medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is the success of U.S. women on the rise? Many point to
Title IX, the 1972 legislation that prohibits sexual discrimination
in the sports programs at educational institutions receiving
federal funds. Olympic ``team'' sports are an illustration.
Americans won gold medals in the Olympic debut of softball and
soccer in Atlanta and hockey in Nagano. In basketball, the U.S. has
won three golds and a bronze in the four Games since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   American IOC member Anita DeFrantz said, ``This is the first
generation of girls who grew up in a country that was friendly to
opportunities for women in sports. It's been a cultural change. I
don't know where we would've found a women's soccer team without 20
years of soccer growing in colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known about Evelyn Ashford and Jackie Joyner-Kersee. But
nobody knew about Mia Hamm because she was in a team sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold-medal soccer game was played before 76,481 fans at
Georgia's Sanford Stadium, the largest crowd ever to see a women's
sports event. ``Atlanta really opened doors for women's sports,''
Hamm said, ``in terms of allowing people to see our level of play
of soccer. The same with hockey. As a team, we always felt we had
something special. The hardest part was getting people out there to
watch us. People were drawn to the event to be a part of the
Olympic Games. They came away from our final saying it was the best
thing they saw in the whole Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women also benefited from the fact that many programs
started about the same time as those in most other countries, so
there was little catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1900 Games in Paris, women competed in only two sports.
In 2000, they are expected to compete in all but two _ wrestling
and boxing. Weightlifting, modern pentathlon, water polo, taekwondo
and triathlon will welcome women for the first time in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Women's wrestling could be added by 2004. Boxing, while gaining
acceptance in the U.S., remains verboten in many countries and
could be the lone holdout. Arthur Tunstall, an international
amateur boxing association official from Australia, said, ``I am
totally opposed to women's boxing. I think a women is a petite
person, not to be knocked around.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions have changed since the Olympics went 32 years
(1928-60) without a women's track race longer than 200 meters. The
abbreviated schedule resulted from the Amsterdam Games in '28, when
five women's track and field women events were introduced. Media
accounts of the women's 800 meters painted a picture of women
collapsing after the race.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter wrote, ``Below us on the cinder path were 11
wretched women, five of whom dropped out before the finish, while
five collapsed after reaching the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said there were only nine entries, and more recent
accounts say none collapsed. She blames ``the evil men of ink'' for
shaping negative stereotypes, adding, ``It was a basis for women
saying, 'Oh, no, we can't do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic movement now knows otherwise.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Gillick began her quest convinced that science and a
little common sense could explain why in one ordinary patch of New
Jersey seashore, an unusual number of children, her son Michael
among them, have similar types of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   She reasoned that it must be something in the water or air, some
unnoticed chemical lurking under a toxic-waste dump or factory _
but in any case, a specific factor that she assumed could be
located, analyzed and then eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something that is grossly abnormal, you need to
find out the indicator that is different from somewhere else,''
said Mrs. Gillick, who organized a movement that successfully
lobbied for a comprehensive environmental study of her town of Toms
River and of surrounding Dover Township in Ocean County. ``What do
we have that's different? That's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   As logical as it may sound, Mrs. Gillick's assumption represents
a challenge to traditional science's previous approach to cancer
clusters. Many scientists say that they simply do not exist _ that
there is a lot of cancer everywhere and that neighborhood
concentrations of the disease result from chance, not from the
environment. But people who live in areas where the incidence of
cancer is higher than expected have rarely been content with that
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these people are turning their discontent into political
action. Armed with the clout that gave them an audience with
President Clinton in August and a starring role in some of New York
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's re-election campaign advertisements, they
have become a driving force behind tens of millions of dollars'
worth of new research into cancer clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pushing science to a new era _ of ecogenetic
epidemiology,'' said Ruth Allen, an environmental epidemiologist
with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. She is the
agency's project leader for a $21 million study of elevated breast
cancer rates on Long Island, N.Y. ``This is where molecular
biomarkers of disease and geographical variations are examined
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, health officials are re-examining old
monitoring data, using newly refined techniques to search for
chemicals that may not have been looked at in earlier air, water
and soil tests in communities where cancer clusters are suspected.
</P>
<P>
   An array of ambitious studies are under way using plain gumshoe
detective work combined with computer mapping that can fine-tune
the picture of what is in a community's environment, identify how
people might be exposed to synthetic chemicals and determine
whether small amounts of such chemicals may be toxic to humans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the investigation of certain childhood cancers in
Dover Township and breast cancer on Long Island, there are
statewide studies of cancer and chemical use in Connecticut and
California, a federal study of elevated breast cancer deaths in
mid-Atlantic and Northeast states, and federal studies of childhood
and adult brain cancers near toxic-waste sites in several states.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer clusters _ the term is used to describe
higher-than-expected concentrations of similar cancers in one
discrete area _ have been in the national vocabulary for decades.
They can be difficult to document with standard statistical
analysis. Sometimes the data involve such small numbers of cases
that epidemiologists cannot reach a conclusion about whether an
anomaly exists. Sometimes, according to the National Cancer
Institute, scientists find ``a true excess,'' but cannot explain
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many types of cancer and birth defects that just
by chance alone you'd expect any one of them to be high in any one
little town,'' said Dr. Bruce Ames, a biochemist and molecular
biologist who directs the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences Center at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing a view widely held in the scientific world, he said
that the money devoted to research into environmental links to
cancer is misspent and that there is ``no convincing evidence''
that synthetic chemicals in the atmosphere are an important cause
of cancer in humans. ``I'd put my money into basic research, not
into chasing hypothetical risks,'' Ames said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of citizen activists, the Gillick family
was not willing to have Dover Township's record of childhood
cancers written off as a statistical fluke. The township in
southern New Jersey has had 90 cases over a 12-year period,
compared with the 67 cases that New Jersey health officials said
could be expected during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to look at everything _ the water, the soil,
the air, all of it, and try to find an answer,'' said Michael
Gillick, who was found to have neuroblastoma when he was 3{ months
old.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, with a shrunken body that is painfully contorted by the
disease, he said he realizes that all the research may never tell
him why he, or any other cancer victim, is sick. ``It's too late
for me,'' Gillick said. ``I already have what I have. I accept it.
It's my wish that this not happen to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Public clamor for answers has prodded many states, including New
York and New Jersey, to process and publish cancer data faster.
</P>
<P>
   In April, for example, the New York state Assembly appropriated
$1 million for a comprehensive statewide cancer-mapping project. It
was to correlate the types and locations of specific cancers,
information already assembled in the state cancer registry, with
neighborhood-specific data on past and present water quality,
pesticide and chemical emissions, radiation exposure, industrial
pollution and local toxic-waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George Pataki vetoed the appropriation, he
promised that the Health Department would do the study from its own
budget. But a department spokeswoman, Claire Pospisil, then said it
could not create a meaningful map until it upgraded the registry.
This year the department published data from 1994; its goal is to
have 1996 data assembled and published by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, including Hawaii, Illinois and California, have
undertaken statewide cancer-mapping projects. The proliferation of
cancer mapping reflects a growing trend nationwide to integrate two
sets of data that are widely and publicly available: one on
toxic-chemical releases and the other on geographical variations in
the incidence of some diseases. The trend follows a decade of
intense focus on cancer risk factors like diet, lifestyle and
heredity.

 &HT;    Holyfield thinks Lewis's style a better match
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, Mike Tyson concluded that if Evander
Holyfield had so much trouble taking out Bobby Czyz, the Atlanta
heavyweight must be too slow, too old and too worn out to inflict
any damage on him.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield bounced back with the peak performance of his
roller-coaster career, introduced Tyson to the canvas and pummeled
him into a daze. After theTKO win, Holyfield reiterated the boxing
adage: ``Styles make fights, and Tyson has a style that's perfect
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to Saturday night, when Holyfield was taken the
distance by little-known contender Vaughn Bean. Could WBC champion
Lennox Lewis be faulted if he suddenly holds Holyfield in less
regard heading into their projected title unification next spring
or summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't matter to me what people think,'' Holyfield said.
``But Lennox Lewis wouldn't be moving as much as Vaughn Bean. I'm
sure Lennox Lewis will try to take my head off and it will put me
in position for me to get his. . . . He has a style that I match up
with well. It'll be an action-packed fight. It probably won't be as
long a fight as (Saturday's).''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will have to wait a while before testing his
projection. In order to keep two of his three title belts (WBA and
IBF), he likely will face a mandatory opponent next _ the WBA's No.
1 ranked contender, Henry Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
   The two were supposed to meet in June in New York, but the bout
was cancelled when Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B.
Akinwande has been on medical suspension ever since, but his
manager expects him to pass a blood test soon, then be reinstated
by the New York Athletic Commission. (Even though
Holyfield-Akinwande is likely headed for Las Vegas, states
generally observe each other's suspensions.)
</P>
<P>
   King, Showtime cable network executive Jay Larkin and
Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, will huddle this week to discuss
options. The Akinwande fight would be a pay-per-view event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite going 12 rounds against Bean, Holyfield said he would
have no trouble fighting before the end of the year. ``I'm not
injured, I'm in shape,'' he said. ``I can just take a few weeks off
and be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's trainer, Don Turner, added: ``Bean isn't that big of
a puncher. So going 12 rounds with Vaughn Bean is not like going 12
rounds with a Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   The imminent fight against Akinwande didn't stop promoter Don
King from starting to pump up a meeting with Lewis, which could
complete Holyfield's goal of claiming all three major title belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander will fight him anywhere _ in the kitchen, in the
halls, in England,'' King bellowed. ``He's the most wanted man on
the planet. Send out an APB that can lead to the capture of Lennox
Lewis.''

 &HT;    An eventful fight night, but not title fight
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was, indeed, a spectacle of the Sweet Science,
the term that the late A.J. Liebling bestowed on boxing. There is
no fight mob in Atlanta, but one was being created now by an
alumnus of Marion Correctional Institution in Ohio, No. 125734, Don
King. And if you were unsure of the name, all you had to do was
cast your eyes about from the men's room to the forest of banners.
Evander Holyfield, who has cast his seed upon the wind, had set his
own table at home in the Georgia Dome, and this would be his night,
bearing out, as his theme ran, ``what hard work will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the gloss and the garishness hit a crescendo, there were
minor details to be covered, at least 10 preliminaries. The
spear-carriers, though at least five were listed as the
champeenship of some kind of world. These are the sad scenes.
Hopefuls, some scrawny, hungering for their slice of the cake, but
first, something for the till.
</P>
<P>
   Here each one came, preceded by old men, grey and paunchy, and
wizened little men with scrooched-up faces, climbing through the
ropes carrying a bucket with their tiger. He dances about, boxing
the air. They _ busy in the corner, arranging their tools of repair
_ hug him and send him out on his way, prayerfully, to glory.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitiable was a migrant from Uganda, Abdula Ramadan, who
entered the ring with a practiced scowl and left in humiliation.
His enemy was Robert Allen for the ``interim'' middleweight title
of some piece of the world. Allen quickly dispatched the scowl and
Ramadan took refuge, cowering in a corner. Then he made a limp
effort at fighting back and fled to the other corner, hiding his
head under his gloves. He never finished the round, and if that
wasn't enough, he had to stand there watching it over and over
again on the big screen while the gallery jeered and Allen gloated.
</P>
<P>
   Something I'd never seen before was two women fighting. Marquis
of Queensbury rules, I mean. I'm not sure there's a place in my
world for this.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there's a more proper way for two females to settle a
grievance than pummeling each other in public. (Monica Lewinsky and
Hillary Clinton, I'd pay to see.) When one's ``falsie'' came flying
out, that did it. I'm for going back to hair-pulling and clawing.
</P>
<P>
   What I shall say of Evander Holyfield's share of the evening
will have less to do with prizefighting than ancillary matters.
Vaughn Bean turned out to be more than a punching bag for the
night, though he's built like one. A pleasant, pudgy face with the
build of a bullpen catcher, he gave Local Hero a bellyful, and I'm
not certain that if this had been Las Vegas, Holyfield would have
survived the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   When Bean had become entangled in the ropes, Holyfield whacked
the daylights out of him, helpless to defend himself. There are
rules. You don't hit a man caught in the ropes. It left a smear on
his evening of self-promotion, and though the verdict in his favor
was a foregone conclusion, this did nothing to inflate his sporting
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing, while Bean was down, Holyfield left the neutral
corner, sliding down the ropes to jaw with Butch Lewis, Bean's
manager, who spent his evening lambasting the referee, a Brian
Garry from Tampa. Garry did not distinguish himself as a threat to
Mills Lane. Frequently the fight got out of hand. The Bean corner
was like feeding time at the zoo. Garry never got that bunch in
control.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, it will not go down in the diary of memorable
heavyweight title fights. Holyfield, the event promotor, was more
impressive than Holyfield, the fighter. His punch is losing sting,
but more distressing is that he takes an awful lot of punishment
and that in time takes its toll. Check C. Clay, a.k.a. M. Ali.

   ``Communities now are saying we don't have any of these risk
factors, and still we have a problem,'' said Dr. Allen of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``They ask common-sense questions
that are at once simple and profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen said that ``scientists have new tools and new
hypotheses that they are testing,'' but that the political impetus
for environmental research came after cancer-cluster activists in
places like Toms River and Long Island presented elected officials
with raw data from their own homemade cancer maps. Politicians have
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now look at graphical information and say: `Gee, in my
district it's this number and in yours it's that. What's going
on?''' Dr. Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers have acted on perceived health risks that are
considered merely hypothetical by the scientific establishment.
Surgeon-general warnings were first placed on cigarette packs in
1964, when the American Medical Association did not consider
smoking one of the main causes of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Long Island breast-cancer study, the federal government
is sponsoring more than a dozen studies that focus heavily on the
possible role of environmental factors in the high breast-cancer
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some try to correlate cancer incidence with historical data on
wind patterns, groundwater flow and the accumulation of pesticides
over time in the soil. Others involve new toxicological tests on
220 chemicals that might be found on Long Island. Half of them were
added to the list at the demand of local activists.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when the New Jersey authorities were pressed two
years ago to open an investigation into elevated rates of some
childhood cancers in Dover Township, they agreed to look for 235
substances instead of the 85 they usually monitor in drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the testing, they found traces of a chemical
compound, or trimer, that is a byproduct of styrene and
acrylonitrile. Both chemicals, used for decades in local factories,
are listed as carcinogens by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The route to the water system, according to preliminary research
results, appears to be from a Superfund toxic-waste dump, which
received waste from these factories, less than one mile from a well
field serving Dover Township.
</P>
<P>
   When New Jersey officials examined old records of what was in
the drinking water, they said they found that the compound had been
present for at least 10 years. It was not investigated further,
because it was not on the list of regulated pollutants. The trimer
is now being tested to determine if it is a human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to draw any conclusions about whether there is a
relationship between human cancers and the trimer, said James
Blumenstock, acting senior assistant commissioner of the state
Department of Health and Senior Services. But he said the study is
prompting a reassessment of which and how many chemicals should be
regulated. ``As science advances,'' he said, ``our ability to
measure and detect contaminants will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure to conduct the Dover Township study also focused
attention on the New Jersey cancer registry, which was found to be
too out of date to be useful. The data bank has since been updated,
and the state Assembly passed a law that set fines of up to $1,000
a day for medical personnel who fail to file timely reports of
cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dover Township's study is only one of many efforts to take a
fresh look at childhood cancer and possible risks to children from
chemicals in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute, for example, is financing a
pioneering study in California of potential links between
pesticides and childhood cancers. It was spurred by the discovery
of an unexpectedly high number of brain cancers in children in the
Central Valley town of McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realized how impossible it is to explain why any one
cluster exists, we tried to step back from looking at specific
clusters and look at the big picture, whether there are patterns of
risk we should be paying attention to,'' said Peggy Reynolds, chief
of the environmental epidemiology and geographic information system
section of the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum behind cluster studies caught other health
officials off guard. Mary Lerchen, an epidemiologist with the
cancer surveillance branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said the federal centers cannot keep track of the
ballooning number of studies and is seeking money to set up a
cancer-cluster registry that could coordinate research findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seldom have we found the cause of a cancer because a cluster
brought it to our attention,'' Dr. Lerchen said, ``but you never
know, and you certainly can't start out with that attitude.''

 &HT;    Aging, King ill winds bout blew in
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Beware, Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Beware your 36th birthday that arrives next month. It does not
come gently. It is like a killing frost, and overnight, some night
soon, you will become an old fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the omens of Saturday night. There have been many others,
of course, and you have always been able to beat them back. The
doubt never sticks for long.
</P>
<P>
   This time, in the din of a well-sold Georgia Dome, the puzzle
was Vaughn Bean. And the simple word scramble turned into a Rubik's
Cube. This show got a lot more real than anyone could have
imagined, going the 12-round distance, Bean giving three-quarters
of what he was getting. The one knockdown, in the 10th, was
inconclusive, flawed. We saw you tired; we saw you frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Vaughn is a tougher Bean than advertised. In one way,
he was the winner Saturday night. He made himself known as a
serious fighter with a serious chin. Beneath the gelatinous
midsection, some iron exists.
</P>
<P>
   And granted there is merit to your contention afterwards that
Bean's defensive style did not suit you. ``He may have a style that
confuses me. It's like (Muhammad) Ali and Ken Norton. Norton gave
Ali the blues, but he didn't give nobody else the blues,'' you said
afterwards. Yes, Bean is just made to fight ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there remains this one central warning from the episode: On
what should have been an inspirational night before the home folks,
against a fighter who is not of your pedigree, you lost the final
round on all three judges' cards. The last word was Bean's.
</P>
<P>
   It's nature's way of saying: Cut to the Lennox Lewis denoument
and get the heck out of this play before it turns into a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, beware the shock-haired promoter. Don King is
the serpent in this garden.
</P>
<P>
   Think he cares for you or your long-term future? Strange how
Sunday morning I just happened to run across a 1991 Esquire column
on King, back when he was solidly with Mike Tyson and in the
business of baiting you. Just keep in mind what he said then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield's a (n-word). He's going to be a (n-word)
till he dies. If he's rich, he's going to be a rich (n-word), if
he's poor, he's going to be a poor (n-word). ... Big business spits
on the name of Holyfield. ... The people who like him like him
'cause he's docile. Holyfield can be controlled. `Run, Johnny.
Sing, Johnny. Dance, Johnny.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's show, the topic of retirement was inevitably
raised. How much longer can it go when Vaughn Bean is able to push
you around in the 12th round?
</P>
<P>
   King burst in at midanswer before you could complete the thought
of retiring after unifying the heavyweight title. ``When you ask
Rockefeller when he's through pumping oil, then ask when
(Holyfield's) through getting all the money he can out of this,''
he blurted. King sounded very much like the King who brokered
Muhammad Ali's ruinous fight at 38 against Larry Holmes. Fight 'em
until they can only mumble, right?
</P>
<P>
   Another fight, another set of warning signs. None more glaring
then the relationship with King, necessarily forged when it was
time to get at Tyson. Know that King still has bills to pay, many
jurors to reward, and he would meet his expenses with your blood.

 &HT;    Pole vaulter overcame stereotypes on, off track
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila, 27, is the American record holder in the women's
pole vault. She talks about breaking into the once all-male sport.
</P>
<P>
   I remember when I was curious about the pole vault back in
junior college. I was going to school with a guy pretty much my
build and he was vaulting. I told him I wanted to try it, and he
kind of laughed at me. He said, ``Oh, women can't do it. They don't
have the upper-body strength. It's not safe for women.''
</P>
<P>
   I listened to him and backed off. It wasn't until I got to Idaho
State a year later that my coach encouraged me and offered me the
chance to try vaulting.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, I was considered a tomboy, anyway. There weren't a
lot of girls where I grew up in Northern California, so I was
always around my brother and the other guys. I played their games.
</P>
<P>
   I used to wear my hair shorter and get those stupid comments,
too. Fortunately, I had really good coaches who told me to have fun
doing sports and that it has nothing to do with your sexuality.
That's how I took it to heart.
</P>
<P>
   I was also fortunate to come along after Title IX, which has
given women more opportunities, more scholarships. That's how I
stayed in sports. My scholarship helped me through. Now I'm a
world-class pole vaulter, and I would never have thought that.

 &HT;    Are qualified men being passed over?
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Paul Sanderford doesn't remember the last time he sent
out his resume. He never felt the urge to leave what he considered
a dream job at Western Kentucky. After taking the Lady Hilltoppers'
basketball team to three NCAA Final Fours in 15 seasons, being paid
what he thought was a generous salary with perks that included a
coach's show and enjoying the good life in a small Southern town
that suited his personality, he was in no particular hurry to go
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1997, when Sanderford was offered the head coaching
position at Nebraska, with double the salary and resources, he
found out what many of his male peers have known for years: being
the most qualified person isn't always enough.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a week, the university withheld announcing his
appointment while two state legislators publicly threatened to
withhold funding if female candidates weren't considered.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics director Bill Byrne went on a scheduled fishing
vacation in Alaska, and upon returning ignored his critics and
hired Sanderford, who was unnerved by the political jostling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected that,'' Sanderford said. ``I knew there was
an undercurrent (to push women into high-profile jobs), but I was a
little shocked at the way this happened. I'm just fortunate I had
an athletics director who stuck his neck out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender relations among basketball coaches long has been a touchy
subject, but in this decade it has been boiling over with
animosity, as large, publicly funded universities feel pressure to
hire women as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   When women's sports were overseen by the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), more than 90 percent of
the basketball coaches were female. Since the NCAA era began in
1981, that number has declined sharply, and other sports have seen
a similar decrease.
</P>
<P>
   With salary and benefits packages for top basketball jobs
starting in six figures, the clamor for those positions has become
in some ways more heated than the competition on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's insistence on hiring Sanderford paid off quickly. The
Cornhuskers, who had been an occasional NCAA Tournament
participant, drew crowds of 12,181 and 11,465, the best two in
school history, and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament
with a 23-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Beutler, a Democratic state senator who
represents the Lincoln area, said he was approached by
``constituents'' who expressed concern that women weren't being
given an ample chance to apply for women's coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a public institution, and there are a number of
policies that ideally should be followed,'' Beutler said. ``Equal
opportunity is one of them. It wasn't accorded to women in this
particular case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has one of the most successful women's athletics
programs. Last season, its volleyball, soccer, softball and
gymnastics teams also were highly ranked and qualified for NCAA
postseason competition. Only two have female coaches.
</P>
<P>
   When Angela Beck left the basketball job for the ABL, Byrne
brought two male and two female candidates to campus for formal
interviews. Sanderford had the best qualifications by far..
</P>
<P>
   Byrne defended his selection by saying that Beck's departure
right before the summer recruiting season left little time for an
extended search and that the premium on high-profile women coaches
makes it difficult to pry them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't for a lack of trying,'' Byrne said. ``We had a tough
time getting women to return our phone calls. Great male coaches
are less expensive because of the demand to hire women. We
certainly go out and try to hire women.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Collen was an assistant for 16 years at three major programs
before he got the top job at Colorado State last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a big believer in the system working on an equitable
basis for everyone, but I felt discriminated against for a long
time,'' Collen said.
</P>
<P>
   Men, women want equal opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Women's advocates who bemoaned the loss of the administrative
control that women had during the height of the AIAW in the late
1970s have a hard time sympathizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think men are getting a fair shake,'' said Vivian Acosta, a
retired Brooklyn College physical education professor and coach who
has been tracking collegiate athletics gender numbers for 20 years.
``There are no women being considered for men's jobs. All they want
is an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   With six male head coaches among its 12 teams, SEC basketball
has the highest percentage of men in the country. It has paid off
in making the SEC the nation's dominant league. Although Tennessee,
coached by Pat Summitt, is the only SEC school to win national
championships, male coaches have guided Final Four teams at
Georgia, Auburn, Vanderbilt, Alabama and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the other five major college conferences _ ACC, Big
East, Big 10, Big 12 and Pac 10 _ are almost overwhelmingly coached
by women, and on some campuses male applicants haven't been
interviewed. The Ivy League never has had a male coach any of its
women's basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1997-98 season, men coaching the top-level
Division I teams numbered 32.6 percent. While men are coaching in
greater numbers in the lower divisions, they fear that they are
being squeezed out of a chance at the premier jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better now than it was several years ago,'' said Duquesne
coach Dan Durkin, a former Penn State assistant who like Collen was
passed over several times. ``But the big issue with some of our
Division I coaches still is, `Can I get a job?'''
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA replaced the AIAW, many female coaches who were
full-time professors returned to the classroom. Some did not want
to be part of the male sports structure. Others thought that male
athletics directors would not favor women coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common reason for that was networking. The fellas
have always known how to do that,'' said Acosta, a former coach of
men's and women's badminton. Byrne believes that's an outdated
assumption. ``That's a bale of used hay,'' he said. ``I have the
only female director of football operations in Division I-A. I have
one of three female sports information directors in Division I. I
hired them both because I thought they were the best people for the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Are women taking over coaching?
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Georgia, where three of the nine women's
sports are coached by women, athletics director Vince Dooley echoes
a similar refrain. When he was searching for a volleyball coach in
1989, only five of 105 applicants were female. He hired former
Olympic assistant coach Jim Iams, who has five NCAA appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing to us that there were so few
(female) candidates,'' Dooley said. ``We have always maintained, if
all things are equal, we want to find a woman if it's a women's
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderford is comfortable with his position but sympathizes with
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot into this game, and that's what some of us have
been perturbed about,'' Sanderford said. ``There are some people
who are concerned about getting more women into coaching, and I
understand that. If I were an AD, I would certainly try to hire a
woman, too. But I'm just trying to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Some males concerned about the trend point to how power in
women's college basketball is distributed. The Lilburn-based
Women's Basketball Coaches Association, which represents 4,500
coaches from Division I down to the youth ranks, has had just one
male, current Vanderbilt coach Jim Foster, as president in its
17-year history. High school, AAU and youth coaches, a large
majority of them male, are not granted full voting powers, thus
perpetuating exclusion, in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The WBCA membership, which is primarily from high school, is
roughly two-thirds female. In the past few years, the number of
male coaches attending the WBCA convention has fallen off
drastically, even though the organization created an advisory group
to deal with their concerns. Some threatened to form their own
association four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why they are concerned when they hear that some
people want to hire a female first,'' WBCA executive director Beth
Bass said. ``But I get frustrated when they don't come. If I don't
see them, if I don't hear them, if I don't talk to them, then I
can't help them. We need them to be here, working with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A male has never been named to lead the highly successful U.S.
women's national team, and only a few have been assistants. And the
NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Committee has had just one male
member in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   So, is there a glass ceiling for men?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, and I think it's going to stay that way,'' Georgetown
University women's coach Patrick Knapp said. ``I don't think it
will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Collen had been a major architect of two Big 10 championship
teams at Purdue. When his fellow assistant, Gail Goestenkoers, was
hired at Duke despite having less experience, Collen looked for
another route to a head coaching job. He was the top assistant at
Arkansas for three years under Gary Blair, recruiting many of the
players on last season's Final Four team, before being appointed at
Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has had its best success under Goestenkoers. Collen said he
is happy for her and applauds her success, but he thinks that
business-oriented athletics directors must look at other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As women's programs get better supported, ADs are more
inclined to get a better return on their investment,'' Collen said.
``They're expecting results, and they want us to start paying some
of the bills. If we want everything that the men have, then we have
to understand that it all comes at a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Stanley, the women's basketball coach at NAIA-affiliated
Oklahoma City University, undertook a survey of his own and found
that women are the majority of all women's basketball coaches at
four-year schools _ roughly 57 percent _ and they have larger
numbers in Divisions I, II and III. Men are the majority only in
NAIA, where the pay and prestige are the lowest, and even there
they make up just 57 percent of all coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female coaches of women's basketball are not now, nor have
they ever been, a minority group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Beutler, the Nebraska senator, the bottom-line pressures of a
big-time college athletic department shouldn't supersede the
obligations of a major public educational institution. ``It's not
Huskers Inc. It's the University of Nebraska,'' he said. ``Going to
the Final Four and having a great won-loss record are not the only
measures of success. They don't seem to be interested in following
the same policies as the rest of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after the turmoil over his hiring, Sanderford doesn't
care to revisit the debate, which in his mind took away from the
sport. But he did see a silver lining emerge from the sparring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take it personally,'' Sanderford said. ``There was
more conversation about women's basketball than ever before at this
school, and that's good.

 &HT;    Despite growth, colleges not complying
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Female college students have plenty of sports to play
and $180 million a year in scholarships to split. Crowds are
increasing rapidly, and the women's basketball NCAA Final Four
sells out.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled, say some dissatisfied movers and shakers in
women's sports. They foresee more hurdles to clear and court
battles to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Between 80 percent and 90 percent of universities remain in
violation of Title IX, the federal legislation that outlaws gender
discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal
funds, according to Donna Lopiano, executive director of the
Women's Sports Foundation. The Department of Education's Office of
Civil Rights, responsible for enforcing the law, has not followed
up on schools found in non-compliance, Lopiano said, and instead
has let them off the hook, pending correction of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, at the urging of advocates upset with the slow pace,
the NCAA has required each Division I school to show progress in
gender equity in order to gain certification. But the NCAA never
has rejected a school's certification, and not all of the 305
Division I institutions have gone through the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Civil Rights claims that it doesn't have enough
money or time to track violations. So the last resort has been
lawsuits against schools in violation.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hogshead, a Jacksonville, Fla., attorney who specializes
in Title IX cases, says she is preparing lawsuits involving four
schools that she would not identify. The cases involve either
coaches or athletes, said Hogshead, a former Olympic gold medal
swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown University is just now settling a six-year-old federal
lawsuit that led to sweeping changes in the way anti-discrimination
laws are applied in college athletics. The suit went to the U.S.
Supreme Court after Brown tried to eliminate its women's volleyball
and gymnastics teams. As a result, school officials will seek to
have the percentage of women on athletic teams reflect the student
body
</P>
<P>
   But there is still concern that some female coaches who speak
out against perceived inequities risk losing their jobs. Lawyer
Kristin Galles, who specializes in gender-equity cases, said 15
coaches fired since the end of last school year have contacted her
to discuss possible legal action. She has been hired by five of
them, including the softball coaches at Mississippi and LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start pushing for money, more scholarships, field
maintenance _ things men's programs already have _ and they run
into trouble,'' Galles said. ``I have some cases where the female
coach gets too pushy on gender equity, and (school officials) start
saying stuff like, `Well, they must be gay.' Rumors start that are
completely false.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is even reaching high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The National Women's Law Center filed suit this summer in U.S.
District Court, alleging discrimination by members of the Michigan
State High School Athletic Association. Schools were cited for,
among other things, requiring girls to play their games during
non-traditional and shortened seasons, at inconvenient times and in
inferior facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a lot of attention has focused on the college level, and
deservedly so, it's important to remember that Title IX also
applies to high school and below,'' said Marcia Greenberger,
co-president of the National Women's Law Center. ``There are still
lots of problems that young girls are facing. We haven't had the
spotlight shined as much on high schools, but we don't have reason
to think it's all that better than college, except you don't have
scholarships. We've seen the same problems with facilities and
support and practice times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter-century since President Nixon signed the landmark
Title IX legislation, the disparity in the playing fields has
lessened, although the advantage still slants in the favor of men's
programs, according to the most recent NCAA Gender-Equity Study in
1997. Among its findings were that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-five percent of funds directed to athletics programs
goes into men's sports.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ratio of those operating expenses has not budged, even
though the percentage of women in organized sports has jumped from
31 to 37 percent in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women, who comprise 53 percent of enrollment, pocket 38
percent of scholarship dollars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women receive 27 percent of the money spent to recruit new
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coaches of women's sports earn less than half the pay of the
men's team coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense that you would expect operating budgets to
be relatively similiar in the same sports,'' Lopiano said. ``So
with two basketball teams, the expenses should be pretty much the
same. I don't see where men's basketball uniforms cost any more or
less than women's uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similarly, sport-by-sport recruiting budgets should be very
close. But things aren't always close or similar, and there is
still a tremendous pay gap between men and women coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   A school generally has to pass a three-part test to comply with
Title IX:
</P>
<P>
   _ Female athletes should receive the same treatment afforded
men, ranging from locker rooms and other facilities to competition
schedules, travel budgets and recruiting budgets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scholarships should be awarded to women based on the
percentage of female athletes in the total program. The Office of
Civil Rights tightened guidelines in July so that scholarship aid
must be within 1 percentage point of the participation rates. If 35
percent of a school's varsity athletes are women, at least 34
percent of scholarships should go to women.
</P>
<P>
   _ The participation opportunities a school affords female
athletes should be equal to men's. This factor has been the most
difficult to assess.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Women's Law Center, college athletics
deserve a grade of C on gender equity. ``Some progress, ... some
barriers addressed, but more improvement necessary,'' it concluded.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, considering that universities have resisted
adhering to Title IX since its inception. In 1976, the NCAA went to
federal court, requesting a permanent injunction against
enforcement of the law. The judge later dismissed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Many college officials continue to argue that strict compliance
with Title IX will destroy football. They maintain that the size of
a football squad, which can exceed 100 players, throws off the
balance, leaving them with a difficult choice: Go into debt by
spending money to add women's sports or cut some men's sports.
Damaging football programs is foolish, they say, because football
usually pays for itself and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful football program at the University of Georgia
accounts for 41 percent of the athletics budget. Its revenue
recently provided more than $1 million for the creation of women's
softball and soccer. Slightly more than two of every three
athletics dollars go to UGA men.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, men's basketball is the high-profile program,
and it generated $5.766 million in revenues for the school year
ending June 1997, compared with $226,935 for the women's team.
Three of every four athletic dollars at Tech go to men.
</P>
<P>
   In recruiting, Tech's men outspend the women at a ratio of
3-to-1 in basketball and 5-to-1 in all sports, including football.
Georgia's successful women's basketball program has greater parity
with the men, being outspent 3-to-2, although all men's programs
still outspend the women almost 4-to-1. But Tech women's coach
Agnes Berenato said she is content with her allotment, and UGA
athletics director Vince Dooley maintains that he usually meets the
requests of both coaches for recruiting funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do whatever is required by Title IX,'' said Dooley, former
football coach at Georgia. ``It wouldn't be right if men were
flying to all the games and women were going by bus. You don't go
dollar for dollar, but you see they're getting equal treatment in
terms of travel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salary-wise, (women's basketball coach) Andy Landers makes
more in base salary than (men's coach) Ron Jirsa does, even though
there are more demands on Ron.'' Women's sports activists hear such
reasoning, and they aren't satisfied. ``We have a lot of catching
up to do,'' said tennis legend Billie Jean King, founder of the
Women's Sports Foundation. ``It's ridiculous. It's taxpayer
dollars. Are you kidding? The Office of Civil Rights hasn't been
enforcing it. I suspect it would take the threat of fines from the
federal government. You need to hurt them where it hurts the most,
and that is money.''

   WASHINGTON _ If President Clinton wants a sense of how dangerous
a place the world has become in the midst of a scandal over his
personal conduct, he might want to study the grim faces in the
audience when he rises on Monday at the green marble podium of the
U.N. General Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There will be the leaders of Asian nations that are being
convulsed by an economic crisis more severe than any since World
War II, and delegates from Russia, which is facing its own economic
and political meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   There will be diplomats from the nations surrounding Kosovo,
where a war is raging in the heart of Europe and where tens of
thousands of refugees are in danger of freezing to death; from
India and Pakistan, which now face off across their common border
with nuclear-tipped missiles, and from Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, which are still far from the peace agreement that the
United States had hoped to broker.
</P>
<P>
   And to the dismay of many in the United Nations, one face will
not be in the crowd of diplomats at the General Assembly, that of a
U.S. ambassador. The nomination of Clinton's choice for the post,
Richard Holbrooke, has been sidetracked until at least early next
year by a Justice Department inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Capitol Hill say that because of the scandal resulting
from his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, Clinton lacks the political capital to move Holbrooke's
nomination any faster _ or for that matter, to champion any
significant initiative on foreign policy that requires
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that U.S. foreign policy
was being ``sidetracked'' as a result of the president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign leaders who know about the president's difficulties,
who know about the attitude and partisanship of the Congress, are
wondering whether this is a president who can deliver,'' he said in
an interview. ``I think in a sense, foreign policy has been
paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a view stated even more forcefully by Republicans. Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is a fellow member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, returned last month from a trip to the Middle
East, where he met with government leaders in Israel, Egypt, Syria,
Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And every one of those leaders told me that as a result of the
president's problems, his motives when he acts in foreign policy
will be called into question,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coin of the realm in foreign policy is trust, and when you
are not trusted, you cannot lead,'' he said. ``If foreign leaders
don't believe that the American people and the Congress trust our
president, the next question for them is: Why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Congress has been heard to blame the sex-and-lies
scandal for last week's vote in the House to rebuff the
administration and provide only $3.4 billion in new credits to the
International Monetary Fund, a fraction of what the administration
has said is necessary for the fund to deal with a global financial
crisis. But it certainly did not help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost impossible now for President Clinton to pick up
the phone and ask a favor from a member of Congress on a tricky
matter of foreign policy,'' said a senior U.S. diplomat, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``If there is any lingering good will in
Congress, he'll want to cash that in to prevent his impeachment.''

 &HT;    Holyfield: Tough fight credit to Bean, sport
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Less a slight reddish mark under his left eye, the
heavyweight champion emerged from his latest title defense looking
like he had just gone for a late-night jog. No cuts, no bruises, no
obvious aches _ just a sweaty smile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for most of the 41,357 who packed the Georgia Dome
late Saturday night was they expected to see Evander Holyfield jog
an easy mile, not labor through a marathon. Ringside judges were
expected to be window dressing, not necessities, in the third pro
hometown bout of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that after six rounds, one judge's scorecard had
Holyfield even with . . . Vaughn Bean?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I love boxing,'' Holyfield said. ``Vaughn Bean
proved that no matter what people say about you, in the end it's up
to you. You're the last word.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another strange chapter in Holyfield's career, the
champion saw his reputation dip in victory while having his
opponent's climb in defeat. Bean was a 9-to-1 underdog but survived
a furious assault by Holyfield in the first four rounds of their
WBA/IBF title bout, won the middle rounds and came back from a
10th-round knockdown to finish strong in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield won a unanimous decision by wide margins _ 116-111,
117-110, 117-110. But he managed to score just the one knockdown,
and looked fatigued and frustrated at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like the old Evander who would do great at the
beginning and then get tired,'' said friend and Showtime executive
Jay Larkin, whose cable network carried the bout. ``He was puffing
on his stool after the fourth round. He didn't have that glow we've
been accustomed to seeing lately. I told him afterwards, `Please
don't scare me like that any more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield deflected all criticism after the fight with praise
for his opponent. Indeed, few expected that Bean would be able to
take so much punishment _ particularly to the body, given that he
weighed a bloated 231 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that (labeled) him a bum are the people who write
stories and who never had a fight,'' said Holyfield's trainer, Don
Turner. ``The guy takes a wicked punch. He's more durable than he
looks. This guy wanted to win. After the eighth round, I told
Evander, `This man can takes a hell of a shot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Between heavy breaths, Holyfield responded, ``I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield rocked Bean with body shots and uppercuts early, but
the challenger rallied in rounds four through six. (Judge Duane
Ford had the bout even at the midway point, the other two had
Holyfield with a two-point lead.) Holyfield appeared to relax in
those rounds to catch his breath but said later he was struggling
to get a fix on Bean's tendencies. As time went on, Bean's
confidence grew, and Holyfield's jab and combinations became less
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield finished the eighth round with a flurry and controlled
the ninth. Bean tired in the 10th and often tried to hold Holyfield
after being hit.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the round, Bean lunged forward after being tagged with
consecutive lefts and again tried to clutch onto Holyfield. This
time Holyfield spun out of the way, and his right forearm appeared
to help push Bean into the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   While Bean's cornermen screamed at referee Brian Garry, Bean _
standing but bent over with one arm on the ropes _ was nailed with
a right to his temple and dropped to the canvas. Somehow, he made
it up by the count of seven and survived the round.
</P>
<P>
   Bean later complained that Garry ``didn't do his job'' and that
Holyfield ``could have been more gentlemanly.'' He also said, ``I
thought I won the fight. I'm not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Garry said he was reaching in to separate Bean and Holyfield
near the ropes but that ``Evander had already started to throw his
punch.'' Bean's promoter, Butch Lewis, criticized pretty much
everything after the fight and argued with Garry in the ring during
a TV interview. Lewis stopped just short of saying he would file a
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch is not fighting,'' Holyfield said later. ``People on the
outside always have opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   If nobody else was pleased with Holyfield's performance, it
didn't bother the champion.
</P>
<P>
   Did he take Bean lightly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I take no one lightly. If he couldn't carry himself, I
wouldn't carry him.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he find Bean's defenses difficult to penetrate?
</P>
<P>
   ``He may just have a style that confuses me. It's like
(Muhammad) Ali and Ken Norton. Norton gave Ali the blues, but he
didn't give nobody else the blues.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Holyfield was concerned, there was no reason to be
depressed. He won, he retained his titles and he did so in his
hometown before the largest crowd to see a heavyweight title fight
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out, it was a pleasant shock to see all the
people,'' he said. ``I'd like to thank everybody who showed up, and
I'm glad we could give them a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a longer show than expected.

 WASHINGTON: his impeachment.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say that the president
remains fully engaged in the conduct of foreign policy. They say
that he may even be more interested in the details of foreign
policy since it provides him with a welcome diversion from his
troubles in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president directed White House meetings over the
crisis in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where the United States
is threatening to use air strikes to end a Serb onslaught against
the ethnic Albanians who make up a majority of the population
there, and over the standoff with Iraq for its refusal to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors there to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense
William Cohen have expressed confidence in the president.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, said: ``Secretary Albright
has made clear that she has never had a problem in recent months or
years in getting the president on the phone when she needs him and
doing the work that she needs to do when it needs to be done. She
has expressed her strong confidence in the president's leadership
and his ability to make sound judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the sole Republican in the Cabinet, said at the Pentagon
last week that Clinton ``continues to be effective in dealing with
national security and foreign policy issues, and as long as he's
able to do that, then he will have the support, I think, of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the evidence suggests that the president remains fully
engaged in debates within the administration over foreign policy,
his aides say they are dismayed that almost any decisive action
taken by Clinton is now being viewed in Washington and around the
world through the prism of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   That became alarmingly clear, they said, when the president
decided to bomb Afghanistan and the Sudan on Aug. 20 in retaliation
for terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, members of Congress were publicly questioning
whether the air strikes were simply an attempt to divert the
public's attention from the furor over his acknowledgment to a
federal grand jury of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of satellite television and the Internet, the news of
the president's sexual misadventures _ and the cynicism over his
motives in conducting foreign policy in light of the scandal _
spread to virtually every corner of the globe in a matter of
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, anti-American demonstrators
took to the streets the day after the bombings carrying signs that
bore cartoons depicting Ms. Lewinsky. Other protesters carried
signs with the words ``Wag the Dog,'' a reference to the recent
Hollywood comedy about a president who launches a war in Albania to
divert attention from allegations that he molested a Girl Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he feared that every critical foreign policy action
taken by the Clinton administration would now be viewed with the
same skepticism, and that it could hinder decision-making as the
White House pondered whether to launch military strikes in Kosovo
and against the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes time to pull the trigger, the White House will
have to think and expect that every serious observer in the
country, as well as every wacko, is going ask: OK, is this `Wag the
Dog'?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said he did not see how Clinton could ever again reassure
foreign leaders that his decisions were not being influenced by the
scandal. ``The fact is that when you've lost that confidence,
you've lost it forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats abroad say the scandal has begun to color the way
the United States and its leaders are being perceived abroad,
particularly among nations considered adversaries of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim clerics in Iran, where the name of Ms. Lewinsky is
becoming nearly as well known as that of the president, have cited
the scandal as proof of the decadence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that intelligence reports showed that leaders of unfriendly nations
as far-flung as Libya, Cuba and Myanmar were known to have obtained
copies of the full report to Congress by the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that it is being translated into 100 different
languages for 100 different governments, and every foreign leader
will be reading it with the same idea in mind,'' he said. ``They
see the president as tarnished, probably irretrievably, and they're
wondering how they can capitalize on it.''

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The day before President Clinton's grand jury
testimony beams into television sets across the nation, White House
officials stepped up their accusations Sunday that Republicans are
conducting a smear attack against Clinton, while a leading Democrat
suggested the president should personally visit Congress to answer
its questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a strong ally of the president's,
proposed that Clinton testify and respond to relevant questions
before the House Judiciary Committee as soon as possible. The
testimony, he said, could help the nation sort through its
conflicted feelings about the president's behavior and help it
decide what should be done next.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, supported by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass and a
Judiciary Committee member, signals the deep dissatisfaction among
many Democrats with Clinton's use of legalisms to try to explain
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern. The
White House has been scrambling to shore up the troops on Capitol
Hill, placing daily phone calls and visits to dozens of Democratic
lawmakers, some of whom have been wavering in their support for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, as well as Republicans, have mainly rejected
Clinton's narrow definition of sex and have already concluded that
he lied in saying that the two did not have a sexual relationship.
In many ways, lawmakers have shifted to the next phase of the
Judiciary Committee's mandate, as they try to decide whether the
president's actions amount to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of lying, Frank argued Sunday that Congress
needed to take into account the circumstances of Clinton's conduct.
``Was he lying to cover up some terrible misdeed?'' Frank asked on
the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' ``Was he lying to cover up
corruption? Or was it private sex he was embarrassed about?''
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to Clinton to be straightforward with Congress,
Kerry said on ``Meet the Press'' that the panel's inquiry would not
be protracted if the president cooperated fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president would be well served to explain
exactly what he did, exactly what he was thinking,'' Kerry said,
adding ``do it to the Judiciary Committee, and let's vote and let's
move on one way or the other, but the nation is being ill served by
this political water torture that's taking place in a highly
calculated, highly partisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry skirted questions, however, about whether Clinton should
resign. ``I said that the presidency is diminished, his presidency
is diminished. I think he knows that. Everybody in America
understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Sunday that it had not yet
considered Kerry's proposal and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up for the Monday morning release of the videotaped
testimony and documents from the report by the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, White House officials and Democrats took to the
airwaves Sunday and lambasted Republicans for the Judiciary
Committee's decision on Friday to release such sexually explicit
material so quickly and with so few deletions. Among the materials
to be released are Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, her
immunity agreement and information about materials recovered from
her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are going to wonder about the judgment of
people who decided to put a good deal of salacious material that is
completely irrelevant to the charges leveled at the president by
Mr. Starr,'' said John Podesta, the White House deputy chief of
staff. ``They decided that rather than just doing a document dump,
they would do a garbage dump on Monday, and I think people are
going to wonder about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior White House adviser, echoed those remarks
on the CBS News program ``Face the Nation,'' saying that
Republicans harbored a ``political goal to embarrass the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on the committee argued that they were following
the full mandate of the House, which voted to make public as much
information as possible, as quickly as possible. They accused
Democrats of trying to score political points by making it appear
as if Republicans are behaving recklessly, instead of openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important the American people would be able to
evaluate this evidence as we do in Congress so that whatever we
decide, hopefully the American people will confirm and support,''
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. and a Judiciary Committee member, said
on the ABC program ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   A CBS poll released Sunday shows that 69 percent of those
surveyed said it was not necessary to release the videotape of
Clinton's testimony, and 59 percent thought the Judiciary Committee
voted to release it to humiliate the president.
</P>
<P>
   Polls also point to a slight erosion of support for Clinton. The
CBS poll, which has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points, found that 56 percent of its respondents think he should be
censured, while 37 percent favor resignation, a slight increase
from last week.
</P>
<P>
   And the latest Newsweek poll found that 46 percent of those
surveyed said the president should consider resigning, up 7
percentage points from a week ago. Forty-one percent said Congress
should begin impeachment hearings and 64 percent said a censure or
reprimand was in order. The president's approval ratings dipped
slightly and hovered at 58 percent.

   In his remarks Sunday, Podesta once again emphasized that
Clinton had acknowledged wrongdoing. ``I think we're not attempting
to hide behind legal language,'' Podesta said. ``What he did was
wrong. He misled the public. That's what's important here, and I
think we've admitted that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Podesta said he did not believe that the president's
actions amounted to impeachable offenses, several House Judiciary
Committee members shifted their attention Sunday from the release
of the tape to the sensitive and difficult task at hand: deciding
what constitutes ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' grounds for
impeachment mentioned in the Constitution that could apply.
</P>
<P>
   Clear battle lines appear to be forming between Democrats and
Republicans over whether perjury, or more specifically lying about
an adulterous sexual affair, warrants an act as serious as
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Does perjury about sex amount to a high crime or misdemeanor?
``I doubt it, not under this circumstance,'' Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla. and a Judiciary Committee member, said on ``Meet the
Press.'' ``It's not foreign policy, it's not domestic policy, it's
not about an Article II of power. It's about an extramarital
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The Constitution doesn't say if the president
doesn't tell the truth, he's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson insisted that perjury was perjury. ``You can't put it
into compartments and say, `Well, if it's about this subject, it
doesn't matter, if it's about that subject, it does matter.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said lying before a grand jury was
tantamount to perjury, a ``slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a high crime?'' he asked on ``Meet the Press.'' The
founding fathers would say yes, he answered. But Graham added that
``it's got to be a serious crime that would subject anybody at this
table to criminal prosecution, and there's a few things in there
that might meet that standard. There's a lot that won't.''

LONG-RUNNING POLICY DISPUTE ON SUDAN MARKED COUNTERATTACK PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER and JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after investigators linked Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi exile, to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa, six of President Clinton's most senior advisers convened in
the White House situation room to plot a counterattack with cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Few national security issues in Clinton's presidency were
handled with greater secrecy or by a smaller group of people. The
administration was determined to avoid leaks, and that meant
limiting deliberations to the ``small group,'' the president's
innermost circle.
</P>
<P>
   The security precautions worked. The strikes against bin Laden's
camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan on Aug.
20 took the world by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But within days of the attack, some of the administration's
explanations for destroying the factory in Sudan proved inaccurate.
Many people inside and outside the U.S. government began to ask
whether questionable intelligence had prompted the United States to
blow up the wrong building.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials now say their case for attacking the factory
relied on inference as well as evidence that it produced chemical
weapons for bin Laden's use.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of how the ``small group'' and the president
picked the bombing targets, based on interviews with participants
and others at high levels in the national security apparatus,
offers an unusually detailed glimpse at the complexities of making
momentous decisions on the basis of shards of information gleaned
from telephone intercepts, spies and scientific analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disclosed that the decision to attack came after
several years of bitter disagreement within the administration
about how to handle Sudan after the United States placed it on its
short list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the CIA formally withdrew more than 100 of its
intelligence reports on Sudan after concluding that their source
was a fabricator.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, many of which dealt with terrorist threats against
Americans in Sudan, were withdrawn within weeks of decisions to
pull U.S. diplomats and spies out of Sudan because of the dangerous
political conditions there.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of U.S. personnel has made assembling a clear
picture of Sudan all the more difficult. In their absence, the
United States has had to rely increasingly on exiles, opposition
groups and governments of nearby countries for its information.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence that persuaded the ``small group'' and
President Clinton to attack Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan's capital, Khartoum, included a report from a ``sensitive
source'' who said bin Laden had asked Sudanese officials to help
him obtain chemical weapons that could be used against U.S.
installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden directly involved himself with the Sudanese
government, trying to get it to test poisonous gases in case they
could be tried against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia,'' a senior
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials do not know for certain that this plan was
carried out, or that Al Shifa had been directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency had been looking at Al Shifa for
18 months. The agency had obtained a soil sample from outside the
plant, revealing the presence of Empta, a chemical used to make VX
nerve gas. There were more circumstantial pieces of evidence
linking bin Laden to that factory, the agency is said to have
believed.
</P>
<P>
   CIA director George Tenet told the five other members of the
group that bin Laden had asked Sudanese leaders about three years
ago to help him make poison gas with which to attack U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed he was deep in a hunt for weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical weapons,'' said one senior
administration official who was at that meeting. ``Was it safe to
ignore that evidence? After very careful deliberation, it was
decided, on balance, that it would be irresponsible of us not to
attack the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Secretary of State
Madeline Albright were convinced that Sudan could be making weapons
for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Albright called Sudan ``a viper's nest of terrorists'' in 1996,
not long after unconfirmed intelligence reports said that
terrorists in Sudan were plotting to kill Berger's predecessor,
Anthony Lake. Berger said in an interview that the evidence at the
meeting was ``extremely convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Aug. 12, the ``small group'' met with
President Clinton in the Oval Office. Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave him a list of targets in Sudan.
The best one, all agreed, was Al Shifa. The president approved an
attack on the plant two days later.
</P>
<P>
   But now some State Department and CIA officials argue that the
government cannot justify its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American citizen, I am not convinced of the evidence,''
said one administration official who says the United States may
have made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after they launched cruise missiles at the factory on Aug.
20, senior national security advisers described Al Shifa as a
secret chemical weapons factory financed by bin Laden. But a month
after the attack, those same officials concede they had no evidence
directly linking bin Laden to the factory at the time the president
ordered the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they certain whether their soil sample proves that
Empta, the suspected precursor chemical for VX, was made at Al
Shifa or was just stored or shipped through there.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials concede that they made
inaccurate statements about the plant on Aug. 20 and did a poor job
of publicly stating their case against the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not accurate,'' a senior administration official said.
``That was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials argue that their actions have been criticized
because some of their most sensitive evidence has been kept secret.
So they are now making some of that evidence public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a piece of paper that says, in a wiring
diagram,'' that Al Shifa is connected to Sudanese
military-industrial complex, a senior intelligence official said.
But ``evidence plus inference'' creates a strong case that the
plant is connected, through the complex, to bin Laden, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said they had found financial
transactions between bin Laden and Sudan's government-run Military
Industrial Corp., which they say was the organization overseeing
chemical weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the intelligence officials did not know who owned
the plant at the time of the attack, they now say its nominal
owner, Salih Idris, is a front man for bin Laden. But his lawyer
says Idris, an adviser to Saudi Arabia's largest bank, has never
met bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has been told that Osman Sulayman, the general manager
of the plant, was deported from Saudi Arabia around 1995 for his
suspected ties to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official said: ``Al Shifa was to one degree or
another involved in chemical weapons production. I can't tell you
whether the VX precursor was produced or stored there. But the
plant is tied to Sudan's military-industrial complex, which is tied
to bin Laden.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials still doubt their own
government's explanations. One said: ``The decision to target Al
Shifa continues a tradition of operating on inadequate intelligence
about Sudan.'' That pattern of policies shaped by questionable
intelligence reports about Sudan, these skeptical officials say, is
at least three years old.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 the CIA realized that a foreign agent who had
warned repeatedly of startling terrorist threats to U.S. diplomats,
spies and their children in Khartoum was fabricating information.
</P>
<P>
   They withdrew his reports, but the climate of fear and mistrust
created by the reports bolstered the case for withdrawing personnel
from the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that the decision was also driven, in part,
by a second CIA source, who warned in 1995 that Lake, then the
national security adviser, would be assassinated by terrorists
based in Sudan. Lake moved into Blair House, a federal mansion
across the street from the White House, and then to a second
undisclosed location, after the threat was reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat to Tony Lake had a chilling effect on the National
Security Council,'' an administration official said. But the
source's reports were never verified or corroborated by any other
evidence, officials say. He disappeared from view around the time
the embassy's personnel were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy remained closed, even though, as a senior
intelligence official put it, ``the threat wasn't there'' as of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials argue that the flawed
intelligence reports had no impact on their thinking. They said
that increasing threats in 1995, including incidents in which shots
were fired at U.S. officials, had driven the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But they conceded that shutting the embassy and the CIA's
station in Sudan eroded their ability to gather intelligence about
the country and about Al Shifa.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over the closing of the embassy and the attack on
Sudan are part of a battle that has been raging inside the
government for years. On one side of this battle are officials who
want to punish and isolate Sudan. Others would change Sudan's
conduct by cajoling and engaging its leaders. The isolators have
won.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Sudan began to allow any Muslim into their country,
without a visa, in a show of Islamic solidarity. In those years,
hundreds of suspected terrorists from around the world, including
bin Laden, used Sudan as a safe haven. In 1993, the State
Department placed Sudan on its list of states sponsoring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The isolaters had evidence to support the case for closing the
embassy and sanctioning Sudan. In March 1995, two of bin Laden's
operatives shadowed an embassy official in Khartoum. In June,
Egyptian radicals based in Sudan tried to assassinate Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. The United States believes the man who was
then chief of Sudan's security service was involved. Sudan never
moved to arrest the suspects. A few months later, the CIA reported
indications that Iranian operatives in Sudan were conspiring to
attack U.S. officials, although nothing came of that threat.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, now the assistant secretary of state for african
affairs, and a leading advocate of isolating Sudan, said in an
interview that she became convinced that talking to the Sudanese
was increasingly fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the government say there was reason for hope. In
August 1994, Sudan had turned over the elusive international
terrorist who called himself Carlos; the State Department called
that ``a significant development.'' When the United States
protested to Sudan about surveillance of U.S. Embassy personnel,
Sudanese officials claimed that they had found out that this was
done by bin Laden's men and expelled them. In September 1995, Sudan
stopped allowing Arab travelers to enter the country without visas.
</P>
<P>
   And on March 8, 1996, a month after the U.S. Embassy was closed,
CIA and State Department officers met secretly with a Sudanese
official in Washington. They asked the Sudanese to turn over the
names of more than 200 bin Laden operatives allowed into Sudan
since 1994, information on Iranian and Arabic radicals in the
country, and the whereabouts of the three Egyptians suspected of
trying to kill Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, at the request of the United States and Saudi
Arabia, Sudan expelled bin Laden, who moved to Afghanistan.
Sudanese officials also say that they sent 100 of his operatives
and their dependents to Afghanistan as well.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials were convinced that the Sudanese were
insincere. ``With the exception of the expulsion of Osama bin
Laden, which was not followed by any steps to get rid of his
financial network, they have not done anything serious,'' Ms. Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1996, the dialogue between the United States and
Sudan was falling apart, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Sudanese President Oman al-Bashir sent
President Clinton a personal letter. It offered, among other
things, to allow U.S. intelligence, law-enforcement and
counterterrorism personnel to enter Sudan and to go anywhere and
see anything, to help stamp out terrorism. The United States never
replied to that letter; the isolaters derided it as a meaningless
``charm offensive'' by Sudan, in Ms. Rice's words.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Sudanese official made a similar offer directly to the
FBI six months ago _ send a counter-terrorism team to Sudan, and we
will help in any way we can, it said. The FBI wrote back more than
four months later, in June, declining the opportunity.

CLINTON FINDS SOLACE AT CONVENTION OF BLACK LEADERS

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton made his only major public
appearance of the weekend at a convention here of thousands of
black leaders, who swathed him in support and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself offered nothing of his well-publicized troubles.
In a lengthy, unemotional speech devoted to the wide-ranging
policies of his administration, he gave no explanation for his
actions, did not mention the impending release of his grand jury
testimony, and made no attempt to try to redeem himself yet again
in front of a sympathetic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He simply thanked his audience of nearly 5,000 people at the
annual convention of the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday
night for ``standing up for me and understanding the true meaning
of repentance and atonement.'' Then he went on to recount the many
ways in which he said his administration had tended to the needs of
African Americans and served the larger cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   His performance underscored what has been evident for some time
_ that African Americans form his singularly most reliable core
base of support, and that if he is ever to move beyond the scandal
that has engulfed him, he needs to remind voters bluntly of the
policies for which they supported him in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Vice President Al Gore gave a stemwinder of an
introduction. Declaring the Clinton administration ``one of the
most successful in history, not in spite of diversity, but because
of it,'' Gore listed the Cabinet and lower-level positions to which
Clinton had appointed African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Energy, agriculture, commerce, veterans affairs, transportation,
labor. As the list rolled on _ deputy attorney general, secretary
of the Army, director of the National Park Service _ its sheer
length and Gore's full-throttle rendition brought the audience to
its feet with sustained applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had gone through the same exercise only hours earlier at
the annual gathering of another sympathetic minority group _ gays
and lesbians at the Human Rights Campaign Fund. It was part of a
concerted effort by the administration to galvanize its base as
Clinton heads into another difficult week.
</P>
<P>
   Both events drew on the overt assumption that the bond with
Clinton had deepened because of a shared sense of persecution. As
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the black caucus, said
in introducing Clinton at the dinner: ``African-Americans are
uniquely qualified to know unfairness when we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, set a similar tone. ``Let us not become a nation of
hunters and the hunted, a condition that our community knows all
too well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the black caucus dinner said that the official wheels of
justice were being used to undermine Clinton and that the current
climate brought to mind the scrutiny into the personal life of Dr.
Martin Luther King by the FBI and the political attacks on Adam
Clayton Powell Jr., the late Harlem lawmaker, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a lot of Americans can see what we've been talking
about,'' said Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., standing in a throng near
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lynch-mob mentality,'' said Rev. Al Sharpton of New
York. Sharpton was one of the few to offer a qualified view of the
president, noting that some of the bills he had signed into law,
including restrictions in welfare and an increased application of
the death penalty, were offensive to blacks. He also cast a
suspicious eye at what he described as Clinton's ``scorning'' of
Rev. Jesse Jackson during the 1992 presidential campaign but his
embracing him now as his spiritual adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet,'' Sharpton said, ``we must have the moral authority
to say that he should not be victimized by an unfair set-up, and we
must show mercy on him that he didn't show on us in the welfare
bill and calling for the death penalty. The issue of fairness is
bigger than the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Several mainstays of the civil rights movement were in the
audience, including Rosa Parks and Dorothy Height, both in their
mid-80s. Ms. Parks, somewhat infirm, said simply that Clinton
should stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Height, who for four decades was president of the National
Council of Negro Women and who was seated with the president,
focused on what she described as the smear campaign. ``I've never
seen grand jury testimony used like this,'' she said. She also said
she objected to ``the effort to get us all to think alike,''
concluding, ``I don't feel that we are the last judges.''

 &HT;    Ripken ends streak; homerun derby, hot finishes on tap for final
week
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The streak is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's streak of starting in 2,633 games ended Thursday
when the Orioles third baseman pulled himself from the lineup in a
game against the Yankees, telling manager Ray Miller, ``I think the
time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak started back on May 30, 1982 and the Associated Press
reported that a Orioles official said Ripken would not play at
Sunday. Ripken also said through he team that he is not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ripken broke what was thought once to be an unbreakable
record when he played in his 2,131st straight game, passing Lou
Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mark McGwire is going deep again, Sammy Sosa and the
Chicago Cubs are falling apart and the Atlanta Braves are getting
closer to wrapping up the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire pushed his home run lead to two over Sosa with his 65th
of the season, a first-inning blast Sunday in Milwaukee. It
appeared he had hit No. 66 in the fifth when he drove a ball deep
to center which appeared to clear the fence. But a fan reached over
the low railing and interfered with the ball and second base umpire
Bob Davidson called it a ground rule double. McGwire did not argue
the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, won their 101st game of the season,
knocking off the Diammondbacks 10-0 as rookie starter Bruce Chen
pushed his record to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago and their last home game of the season, Sosa went
0-for-4 and the Cubs lost 7-3 to Cincinnati, getting swept in the
three-game series. The Mets beat the Marlins 5-0 and now have a
one-game lead over the Cubs for the NL wildcard.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL wildcard race, the Blue Jays were able to close within
four games of leader Boston. Toronto beat Tampa Bay 7-5 in 12
innings while the Red Sox lost for the third straight time, 6-4 to
the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Houston beat the Pirates 2-0 to remain within two games of the
Braves for the best record in the NL. 1/2
</P>
<P>
   In the AL West, Texas lost to Oakland 6-3 as their lead over the
Angels is now at one-half of a game. Anaheim played later Sunday
against Seattle.

JETS HEED COACH'S WARNINGS ANDWALLOP COLTS 44-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Before the Jets obliterated the hapless
Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, 44-6, there was a week of practice
that was terrible by all accounts, one that some Jets players say
they will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, miserable because of his team's 0-2 start,
was in maybe his worst mood ever. He berated some of his assistant
coaches in meetings. Players, of course, got it just as bad. Any
mistake in practice, no matter how minor, set him off. He told
several players, in particular some defensive linemen, that if they
did not perform against the Colts, they were gone. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he tells guys you're on a one-game notice, you take it to
heart,'' center Kevin Mawae said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like a head coach threatening to end your career to
provide a little motivation. And nothing like a really bad team
coming into your backyard to help salvage your season. The Jets,
who put on one of their best performances in years, would like to
thank the Colts for participating in one of the most lopsided
victories in team history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 0-2, I told the team this, you don't know if
you're ever going to win another game,'' Parcells said. ``I think
the players responded pretty well today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even Parcells, who is a tough man to make smile, has to
be pleased with how well the Jets played before the crowd of 79,469
at Giants Stadium. The Jets rushed for a startling 302 yards, only
31 yards behind the team's single-game record, set in 1972 against
New England. Running a lot to the outside, Curtis Martin rushed for
144 yards on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts came into this game with one of the few National
Football League defenses without a sack, and nothing changed. They
rarely pressured Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who threw four
touchdown passes to four different receivers. Terrible tackling by
the Colts, as well as great execution by the Jets' offensive line,
led to 505 yards of total offense for New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a plain, old-fashioned tail-whipping,'' Colts
Coach Jim Mora said. ``That's the thing that happened to us today _
we just got whipped physically. When a team can rush for 300 yards
on you, that is a physical tail-whipping.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory was big, but Jets fans should not make
Super Bowl plans just yet. The Colts (0-3) are not a good team, and
while quarterback Peyton Manning (20 of 44 for 193 yards and 2
interceptions) has superb skills, he is having a rough rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts have scored only two touchdowns this season, and their
defense has given up 97 points in only three games. They failed to
take advantage of Martin's two early fumbles in Jets territory, and
the conservative game plan of Mora, who stuck with two tight ends
for most of the afternoon and stayed with the run even after
falling behind by more than three touchdowns, did not help.
</P>
<P>
   The blowout was the result of a poorly executed Indianapolis
offense, a suddenly fired-up Jets offensive line and great
defensive play by the Jets. Of course, the offensive explosion
could lead to something else: a quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde started in place of Glenn Foley, who was on the
sideline as the third quarterback because of injured ribs.
Testaverde is sometimes Joe Montana, sometimes Scott Mitchell.
Sunday, he was Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is known to have good games, then play terrible.
Foley has good games, then gets hurt. Does Parcells go with the
quarterback who Sunday led the Jets to the most points they have
scored since they beat the Patriots _ then coached by Parcells _ by
45-7 in 1993? Or does he go back to the gunslinger Foley?
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that if Foley is healthy, he will go with him. But
Testaverde's performance will further captivate Parcells, who is
already enamored of his arm. His performance probably only
shortened the rope for Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a concern of ours now, who is going to be the
quarterback,'' said wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who had his
third straight game with a touchdown catch. ``We're just happy with
the win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' first four series typified the day. Running back Leon
Johnson, on a beautifully executed screen pass, went 82 yards for a
touchdown behind three key blocks. It was the Jets' longest pass
completion since Nov. 2, 1986, when Ken O'Brien threw 83 yards to
Wesley Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Jets faced a first-and-goal at the
1-yard line. Perhaps learning a lesson from last week, when they
were stuffed by Baltimore on four straight runs at the goal line,
Testaverde did a sweet play-action fake to Martin out of a tight
formation, then tossed a touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Later, wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who would leave the game
with a sprained left ankle, caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from
Testaverde for a 21-0 lead. Then, just as the Colts were bracing
for more attacks through the air, Leon Johnson scored on a 16-yard
run behind a brutal pancake block from tackle Jumbo Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for a team to stop that kind of varies attack,
and the Colts just got sloppier on defense as the muggy afternoon
pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we take pride in is yards after contact,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps lost in the Jets' explosion is this fact: the Jets are
now 1-0 in the American Football Conference East. They play Miami
two weeks from now, and if the Jets can win, it would be an
entirely new season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could get back to 2-2 with two division wins, we can
start the season over,'' Parcells said. &QL;

 &HT;    Ripken ends streak; homerun derby, hot finishes on tap for final
week
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS TO 2,632 games, ended Sunday (corrects from

<P>
   The streak is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's streak of starting in 2,632 games ended Sunday when
the Orioles third baseman pulled himself from the lineup in a game
against the Yankees, telling manager Ray Miller, ``I think the time
is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak started back on May 30, 1982 and the Associated Press
reported that a Orioles official said Ripken would not play at
Sunday. Ripken also said through he team that he is not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ripken broke what was thought once to be an unbreakable
record when he played in his 2,131st straight game, passing Lou
Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mark McGwire is going deep again, Sammy Sosa and the
Chicago Cubs are falling apart and the Atlanta Braves are getting
closer to wrapping up the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire pushed his home run lead to two over Sosa with his 65th
of the season, a first-inning blast Sunday in Milwaukee. It
appeared he had hit No. 66 in the fifth when he drove a ball deep
to center which appeared to clear the fence. But a fan reached over
the low railing and interfered with the ball and second base umpire
Bob Davidson called it a ground rule double. McGwire did not argue
the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, won their 101st game of the season,
knocking off the Diammondbacks 10-0 as rookie starter Bruce Chen
pushed his record to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago and their last home game of the season, Sosa went
0-for-4 and the Cubs lost 7-3 to Cincinnati, getting swept in the
three-game series. The Mets beat the Marlins 5-0 and now have a
one-game lead over the Cubs for the NL wildcard.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL wildcard race, the Blue Jays were able to close within
four games of leader Boston. Toronto beat Tampa Bay 7-5 in 12
innings while the Red Sox lost for the third straight time, 6-4 to
the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Houston beat the Pirates 2-0 to remain within two games of the
Braves for the best record in the NL. 1/2
</P>
<P>
   In the AL West, Texas lost to Oakland 6-3 as their lead over the
Angels is now at one-half of a game. Anaheim played later Sunday
against Seattle.

RABBIS ASK FOR DELAY IN RELEASE OF VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CLINTON-RDP, CLINTON-SCENE, CLINTON-BLACKCAUCUS,
CLINTON-HILLARY, CLINTON-FOREIGNPOLICY, CLINTON-TV-TAPE.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several rabbis in the Washington area have asked the House
Judiciary Committee to postpone releasing the videotape of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony until after the Jewish
holiday of Rosh Hashana, which began Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of other Jewish leaders said they were not offended
by the timing of the videotape's release. And one Orthodox Jewish
leader even called it ``a blessing in disguise'' that observant
Jews will be forced to refrain from watching television _ and hence
seeing the tape _ during the two days when they are supposed to
devote themselves to prayer and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana, which ends on Tuesday at sundown, marks the start
of the Jewish New Year and ushers in the High Holidays, a solemn
10-day period of repentance and introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Joseph Weinberg, the senior rabbi of the Washington Hebrew
Congregation, said that he and a group of other Washington-area
rabbis had tried phoning all the members of the House Judiciary
Committee on Friday to ask them to refrain from releasing the tape
on Monday. He said that no committee members responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Releasing it on Rosh Hashana is such a mean-spirited thing to
do,'' Weinberg said in a telephone interview on Sunday. ``The
officials who are doing this ought to say: `Wait a minute, there's
a whole community within our nation that is celebrating its solemn,
solemn day of the New Year. This is not the time. We'll wait two
days.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we don't expect the government to close up,'' he
added, ``but at the same time, when we are dealing with the
specifics of our nation, and what touches the hearts and souls of
so many people, it's not appropriate. If tomorrow were Christmas,
you certainly wouldn't see this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most other Jewish leaders interviewed Sunday, Rabbi
Arthur Hertzberg, the Bronfman visiting professor of the humanities
at New York University, said he found the request for delay absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are soon going to acquire a country in which it will be
wrong to release something on Kwanzaa, to release something on a
Hindu holiday, on a Buddhist holiday or a Muslim holiday,''
Hertzberg said. ``We are a plural country. There is nothing
compulsory about having our Jewish curiosity satiated on Monday. It
can wait till Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, agreed. ``I would not expect such a tape to be released
in Israel on Rosh Hashana,'' he said, ``but frankly, this is not
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The High Holidays end with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement,
when Jews take stock of their lives and repent the previous year's
misdeeds. Many rabbis have said they intend to address the Clinton
situation in their sermons. The Central Conference of American
Rabbis, which represents the United States' Reform Jewish rabbis,
called for all Americans to use the 10-day period as a time of
atonement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mandell Ganchrow, the president of the Orthodox Union, said he
considered the release of Clinton's testimony on the first day of
the High Holidays to be a blessing from God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is good for the soul of the Jews not to be looking
at those tapes for 48 hours,'' said Ganchrow, whose organization
represents approximately 1,000 Orthodox synagogues in the United
States. ``It actually gives us a chance to be concentrating on our
atonement, on our souls, and not looking at salacious material. So
let's not look for anti-Semites behind every videotape. In truth,
it's a blessing in disguise.''

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ German officials said Sunday that they were
preparing to extradite to the United States a Sudanese suspect
arrested last week in connection with the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Bavaria's interior minister, Guenther Beckstein, said the police
had identified the suspect as Mamdu Mahmud Salim, a 40-year-old
Sudanese man who U.S. authorities believe is a top lieutenant of
the Saudi exile accused of organizing and financing the bombing,
Osama bin Laden. While Salim is not disputing his identity, German
officials said he continues to deny that he is one of bin Laden's
confidants.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was arrested by the German police on Wednesday near
Munich, not long after he arrived in Germany from Spain. The police
were acting on a request from the FBI and the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Beckstein said the German government would arrange Salim's
extradition to the United States as quickly as possible.

 &HT;    Biggest new show this season? Maybe the presidential testimony
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (w) Washington and (E) Entertainment
categories.)
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today marks the official start of the fall TV season, but no
program is getting as much pre-show hype as the four-hour,
melodrama starring President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the president's videotaped grand jury testimony
is redefining what qualifies as ``must-see TV'' for millions of
Americans expecting to watch Clinton respond to questioning about
his relationship with former intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The major TV networks are planning some form of Clinton
coverage: Cable news outlets will be running unedited versions of
the tape while the commercial broadcasters will be airing censored
excerpts throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   All of them have promised to run content warnings during their
telecasts warning viewers that the tape contains sexually explicit
material.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is keeping the videotape under lock and key until 9
a.m. when a copy of the tape will be made to Fox, which will then
provide a ``pool feed'' to the other networks covering the story.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, only members of the House Judiciary Committee were
supposed to have access to the tape and the 2,000 pages of
supporting documents also released by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   TV pundits abhor a vacuum, and the tight security surrounding
the videotape didn't keep the talking heads who populate Sunday
morning news shows from reporting or just guessing what was on it.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and several other networks had obtained copies of a
five-minute opening statement Clinton made in which he describes
his contact with Lewinsky as ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough for Jonathan Turley, a professor at George
Washington University who appeared on ``Fox News Sunday'' to give
viewers a preview of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theyre going to watch a president commit a series of criminal
acts,'' said Turley, who repeated his calls for the president to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has seen the videotape, and said its
a one-sided performance thats unfair to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its like watching ``Perry Mason'' re-runs where you only get a
chance to see (TV prosecutor) Hamilton Burger, `` said Frank , also
appearing on the Fox morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Some who hadn't seen it and even swore they wouldnt watch, gave
their their opinions about how the videotape could change life on
earth as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were treating the president as if he's a date and we want to
know all about him,'' said media analyst Ken Auletta on ``CNN
Sunday.'' ``The president has lost all right to privacy. Soon it
will be Congress, and then members of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kalb, co-host of CNNs ``Reliable Sources'' was even more
dramatic, sounding as if he was describing some apocolyptic horror
movie. ``There will be a global silence as clickers of the world
tune in,'' he said.

<P>
   Today marks the official start of the fall TV season, but no
program is getting as much pre-show hype as the four-hour,
melodrama starring President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the president's videotaped grand jury testimony
is redefining what qualifies as ``must-see TV'' for millions of
Americans expecting to watch Clinton respond to questioning about
his relationship with former intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The major TV networks are planning some form of Clinton
coverage: Cable news outlets will be running unedited versions of
the tape while the commercial broadcasters will be airing censored
excerpts throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   All of them have promised to run content warnings during their
telecasts warning viewers that the tape contains sexually explicit
material.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is keeping the videotape under lock and key until 9
a.m. when a copy of the tape will be made to Fox, which will then
provide a ``pool feed'' to the other networks covering the story.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, only members of the House Judiciary Committee were
supposed to have access to the tape and the 2,000 pages of
supporting documents also released by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   TV pundits abhor a vacuum, and the tight security surrounding
the videotape didn't keep the talking heads who populate Sunday
morning news shows from reporting or just guessing what was on it.
</P>
<P>
   CNN and several other networks had obtained copies of a
five-minute opening statement Clinton made in which he describes
his contact with Lewinsky as ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough for Jonathan Turley, a professor at George
Washington University who appeared on ``Fox News Sunday'' to give
viewers a preview of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theyre going to watch a president commit a series of criminal
acts,'' said Turley, who repeated his calls for the president to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has seen the videotape, and said its
a one-sided performance thats unfair to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its like watching ``Perry Mason'' re-runs where you only get a
chance to see (TV prosecutor) Hamilton Burger, `` said Frank , also
appearing on the Fox morning show.
</P>
<P>
   Some who hadn't seen it and even swore they wouldnt watch, gave
their their opinions about how the videotape could change life on
earth as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were treating the president as if he's a date and we want to
know all about him,'' said media analyst Ken Auletta on ``CNN
Sunday.'' ``The president has lost all right to privacy. Soon it
will be Congress, and then members of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kalb, co-host of CNNs ``Reliable Sources'' was even more
dramatic, sounding as if he was describing some apocolyptic horror
movie. ``There will be a global silence as clickers of the world
tune in,'' he said.

CHINA INTENSIFIES CRACKDOWN ON APPLICANTS FOR NEW PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on
dissidents' efforts to form a political party, sending a clear
signal that despite liberalization in many areas of Chinese life
they would not allow such organized dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In three days authorities in four regions have detained
dissidents associated with the fledgling China Democratic Party.
The harsh reaction is a marked change from 10 days ago, when
dissidents who applied to start local branches of the incipient
party received what they interpreted as vaguely positive signals.
Local officials, rather than immediately rejecting the
applications, had listed the conditions for registering social
organizations like providing a list of members and paying a
registration fee.
</P>
<P>
   No parties have been allowed to be formed since the Communists
took power in 1949. And arrests and detentions over the weekend
left little room for hope that a new party would be founded soon.
These are some of the government's actions:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Shandong province one of the two dissidents who had
applied, Liu Lianjun, was detained on Saturday, according to the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China, which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Shanghai, Han Lifa, who delivered the application there,
was detained for six hours, and the application was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Beijing, Ren Wanding and Ma Shaohua, who had planned to
submit an application, were detained and warned not to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tang Yuanjuan of Jilin province was arrested on charges of
``contacts with an illegal organization,'' his family was told.
Although Tang is not a member of the fledgling party, he has
friends who had signed the applications. Tang was detained shortly
after having arrived at the house of a longtime dissident in
Beijing, Xu Wenli, and taken back to Jilin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us this is a very dangerous signal, and the situation is
extremely threatening,'' Xu said Sunday night. ``It shows that they
may destroy the party, and we need to organize fierce protests
against that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many people the China Democratic Party
represents, although the number is clearly small. It does, however,
have bylaws that stress democratic principles like free elections.
</P>
<P>
   In June dissidents in Zhejiang province tried to register a
committee to form the party. Several were jailed. Groups in
Shandong and Hubei provinces tested the waters again this month,
during a visit by Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   When the two groups encountered neither arrest not outright
rejection, three other groups _ one from the far northeast, one
from Beijing and one from Shanghai _ were emboldened to apply.

SWEDISH PARTY PLEDGING EXPANDED WELFARE GAINS SLIM VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The governing Social Democrats rode a pledge
to expand Sweden's huge welfare programs to a thin victory Sunday
night in a national election that signaled a shift to the left.
</P>
<P>
   With all the votes tabulated, the Social Democrats received 36.5
percent of the vote, and the conservative opposition Moderates 22.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though the result represented a significant drop in support for
the Social Democrats, who got a bit more than 45 percent of votes
in 1994, it appeared sufficient to allow them to form an alliance
with parties farther left. That would keep Prime Minister Goran
Persson in power and frustrate the bid by Carl Bildt, the Moderate
leader, to regain the office he occupied from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Minority governments are becoming the norm in Sweden, and so is
the leadership of the Social Democrats, who have held power for 57
of the last 66 years. This time, however, they will be even more
dependent on cooperation with the Left Party, the former
Communists, who succeeded in stealing votes from the Social
Democrats and nearly doubling their representation in Parliament.
Another likely partner will be the Greens, with 4.5 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, the former international peace mediator in Bosnia, said
he found the outcome ``disturbing for Sweden,'' and his party
secretary, Gunnar Hokmark, added, ``It puts Sweden in a left lock
that is stronger than any other country in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Persson conceded that ``things will be more difficult now'' but
said his weakened party would not adopt any radical measures or
enter any agreements that could ``undermine confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Persson, 49, is a former finance minister with a reputation for
austere spending habits, but his party won the election Sunday with
an appeal to people upset with cuts made in Sweden's sweeping
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Persson pledged more money for health
services, the elderly and day care that he said would not break
spending limits because the country now had a budget surplus from
an economic recovery that he led.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, by contrast, campaigned for tax cuts, an alluring
political proposition in almost every other country but Sweden,
even though its citizens are among the most heavily taxed on earth.
``Talking about tax cuts in this campaign is like swearing in
church,'' said Toivo Sjoren, the research director of the Sifo
opinion surveying firm.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt also argued that tax cuts would ease Sweden's
unemployment, now at 7.3 percent, by creating private sector jobs,
but Persson predicted that the number would decline in the
traditional Swedish way, a growth of the public sector. Public jobs
already account for 31 percent of Swedish employment.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes, particularly the growing aged population, have been
expressing fears about gaps in their vast social coverage. The most
repeated claim in this election was not the dynamic pledge to bring
about change common to campaigns elsewhere in Europe but a stolid
promise to restore what was.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the enthusiasm for replenishing the welfare state stems
from real anxiety over the treatment of the needy, and part
bespeaks a nostalgia for the time when Sweden and its so-called
``caring capitalism'' were seen as the international model of
politics with a social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The government already spends 46 percent of Sweden's gross
national product on welfare, more than any other industrialized
country, and its overall public spending is 63 percent of gross
national product.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The income taxes required to support this public outlay take 59
percent of the pay of people earning as little as $30,000 a year
and oblige employers to pay up to 41 percent of employee
remuneration into social security and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Broad support for increasing welfare was seen in the strong
showing by the Left Party, which attracted 12 percent of votes,
almost twice its 1994 total of 6.2 percent. Its candidate, Gudrun
Schyman, 50, campaigned to cut the work week to 35 hours, raise
company taxes and leave the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, sensing its growing acceptance by mainstream voters,
the party ordered its district branches to remove photographs of
Lenin from party office walls.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling the hopes of voters for broader welfare coverage
could be at cross purposes with Sweden's need to increase its
competitiveness in the world marketplace. The country's largest and
most successful company, the telecommunications giant Ericsson, is
threatening to move its headquarters to Britain, where it finds
business conditions better. In Sweden, industrialists have
complained of high personal income taxes and rigid labor rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has
lowered Sweden's position on its prosperity tables to 15th from
fourth in the world, ranking it behind its Scandinavian neighbors,
Denmark, Finland and Norway, as well as Ireland and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to regain the country's leadership will be a keen
disappointment to Bildt, 49, who in 1997 returned here as the most
popular public figure in Sweden after two years spent trying to end
the war in Bosnia. His ratings in the polls have since steadily
declined.
</P>
<P>
   His accomplishments abroad and his concern for the outside world
did not resonate in a country absorbed with domestic security and
stability. Bildt also failed with his calls on Sweden to become a
more aggressive leader in the Baltic region, to join NATO and to
hold a referendum on entry into the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Sweden decided with only 52.5 percent of the population
in favor to become a member of the European Union. Surveys show
that the country would reverse that decision today, with only 31
percent now in favor.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ With Hurricane Georges, the most
powerful storm of the season, bearing down on them Sunday with
135-mile-per-hour winds, Puerto Rico and a dozen smaller Caribbean
islands south and east of here braced for what authorities warned
could become a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Three damaging hurricanes have struck Puerto Rico over the past
decade, including Hugo in 1989, and residents of the island
reluctantly mobilized again after a hurricane warning was
officially issued Sunday morning for an area extending from
Dominica to the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   With gusts of up to 190 mph, Hurricane Georges was described by
meteorologists as a severe threat to life and property, likely to
cut a wide swath through the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is similar in size and strength to Hurricane Hugo,''
James Lewis Free, a research scientist at the National Hurricane
Center in Miami, said in a telephone interview. ``It is an
extremely dangerous storm.''
</P>
<P>
   In advisories issued throughout the day, the National Hurricane
Center said it was likely that the storm would make landfall in the
northern Leeward Islands late Sunday night before continuing a
west-northwest course that would take its powerful eye directly
across Puerto Rico on Monday. The hurricane s classified as a
category four storm, the second-most powerful type of hurricane,
but could gain strength.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said it was too early to tell if Hurricane
Georges could threaten the Southeast in the United States this
week. But with the course of the storm shifting somewhat north and
west during the day, that possibility is ``something that needs to
be watched very carefully,'' Free said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Sunday afternoon, Gov. Pedro Rossello
of Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency, warning the 3.8
million residents of this American commonwealth that the hurricane
represented ``a moment of crisis.'' Rossello said that although
``our people are better prepared than on previous occasions,'' the
magnitude of the storm required that the population act ``with the
utmost seriousness'' and take extra precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything indicates this hurricane has the characteristics to
be the most powerful that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in
decades,'' he said. ``If everything continues as predicted, there
is going to be extensive damage and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   All days off and vacations for police here have been canceled
until further notice, as were classes, concerts and other public
events scheduled for Sunday night and Monday. In anticipation of
the storm, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, criticized for
its slow reaction when Hurricane Andrew struck Miami in 1992, sent
early response teams to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
which also lie in the storm's path.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Puerto Rico appeared calm, covering windows with
plywood or metal shutters and flocking to stores to buy emergency
supplies. ``Here comes Georges!'' read the graffiti on the shutters
of a building in the Condado section of San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be,'' Sonia Padilla Guerra,
a homemaker, said as she emerged from a grocery store. ``I've got
plenty of water, canned food for three or four days and batteries
for my flashlights. Let's just hope this one will not be as bad as
Hugo was.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, some flights between Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport here and other Caribbean destinations had
already been canceled, leaving some passengers stranded and
nervous. American Airlines, which uses San Juan as the hub of its
Caribbean operations, announced that it was canceling all flights
from Puerto Rico Sunday night and moving its planes until the storm
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Islands east and south of Puerto Rico began feeling the first
effects of the hurricane early Sunday, in the form of rough surf,
rain and heightened winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the third time in four years, we are facing a major
hurricane,'' Lester Bird, prime minister of the twin-island nation
of Antigua and Barbuda, warned in a radio address to his country's
65,000 citizens. Antigua was hit by Luis in 1995 and Bertha in
1996, and last summer had to accommodate refugees from a volcanic
eruption that severely damaged the neighboring island of
Montserrat.

 &HT;    Braves' Chen impressive in 10-0 shutout against Arizona
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Still squirming in a headlock with 1998, the Braves
paused for a moment Sunday to ponder their future.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen worked seven shutout innings in his most impressive
work yet while Atlanta was blowing away the Arizona Diamondbacks
10-0. Ten Braves had RBIs during a 13-hit assault that only got out
of hand late, when the bench scored six times in the last two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the game was all Chen's, making just his third major
league start. After surviving a two-walk, one-hit first inning, he
allowed the Diamondbacks only two more hits while striking out
five, retiring 14 in a row in at one point. Indeed, this was the
second worst team in the league and the Diamondbacks reaffirmed
that by setting the National League strikeout record when Yamil
Benitez whiffed in the fifth for the 1,204th D-Back strikeout of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a 21-year-old kid still only six weeks removed from
Class AA. If Chen wasn't a candidate to make the 1999 Opening Day
roster before Sunday, he is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game, I was much more comfortable than the other two
games,'' Chen said. ``Even though I was missing, I stuck with my
plan. I wanted to keep the ball down and keep it away. I wasn't
like worried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Away, away, away, away,'' Benitez said. ``Nothing
over-powering. You just can't see it or something.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Atlanta's ninth in 11 games, the Braves
maintained a two-game lead over Houston for the NL's best record
while slumping San Diego, loser iof five of six, fell five games
off the pace. The shutout, completed by Rudy Seanez and Norm
Charlton, gave the Braves a major-league 21 and two in a row over
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez, making his first appearance in 15 days after sustaining
a micro-tear in a right forearm muscle, walked one and struck out
one in a hitless eighth inning, a positive sign for the postseason.
With 46 strikeouts in 33 innings, Seanez remains a vital cog in the
club's playoff plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time out there, I didn't want to go blow 'em out,''
Seanez said.. ``I was just trying to get in the swing of things. It
felt good. I felt comfortable out there but it's been a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The day contained a number of major-league firsts for Chen _ a
switch-hitter, who recorded his first major-league single in the
third off Arizona starter Amaury Telemaco. Four innings later, Chen
delivered a bunt on a suicide squeeze, scoring Javy Lopez for a 4-0
lead and his first major-league RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was how he worked into trouble and then out of it that
impressed more. The same team beat up Greg Maddux for 10 hits and
five runs in just seven innings two nights before at least had six
hits against Tom Glavine Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just locates,'' said Diamondbacks right fielder Andy Fox,
whose sixth-inning double was the hardest hit ball all day. ''It's
almost on a smaller scale like Glavine. Nothing over-powering but
you look up and you've got just two hits off the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He got untangled after the first two innings,'' said Bobby
Cox, who won career game 1,413, tying Miller Huggins for 18th place
on the all-time managers' victory list. ''He was not real sharp.
And then he got real sharp and stayed ahead of the hitters almost
the rest of the way. He threw a ton of pitches in the first two
innings (29 in the first alone). They just missed some balls,
almost hit 'em square. But they didn't. He's got that little extra
giddy-up on his fastball that surprises them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was starter Denny Neagle who joked after Chen's first win
that the Braves were now free to trade him. But with Neagle
fighting a sore shoulder, Chen's ERA (3.31) fell below Neagle's
Sunday (3.59) and while the club has had no time to plot an
offseason course, Neagle's joke may not be quite as funny today.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels pretty good,'' Chen said. ''I want to be a starter
with the Braves. It's fun to be a young guy, to come and pitch with
five great starters. I have learned a lot from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, almost by the day, are learning alot from him too.

   Breaking down the MBNA by the 100s:
</P>
<P>
   The First 100
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace blew a motor before he could complete a lap. It
failed to faze Mark Martin, however. Martin led the first lap,
Rusty Wallace the next two and from there Martin dominated over the
first 100 laps. Following a short caution for debris on the track,
Martin led a torrid pace to lap 85 before Buckshot Jones' motor
blew, sending him to his pit in a cloud of smoke. Wallace jumped in
to lead two more laps. At that point, only 13 cars were on the lead
lap. Five laps later, the Burtons collided. Ward got into some oil
and spun into Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lap leaders: Martin (92), Rusty Wallace (8)
</P>
<P>
   _ Under caution: (lap 13-15, 86-91) debris and oil on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Second 100
</P>
<P>
   The Burtons returned. By this time, it was even more evident
that it was Martin's show. He led from lap 101 to 169, lapping 13
more cars along the way. On lap 170, Kenny Irwin spun in turn two
and hit the wall. Kyle Petty had a good run going, but broke a
camshaft and was done for the day. There were only 10 cars on the
lead lap at 150.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lap leaders: Mark Martin (93), Bobby Hamilton (1), Jeff Gordon
(6)
</P>
<P>
   _ Under caution: (Lap 172-178) Irwin accident
</P>
<P>
   Third 100
</P>
<P>
   Martin led 95 of the 100 laps and Rusty Wallace the remainder. A
caution came on lap 244 while the speedway transported Irwin to
Kent Hospital for observation. He suffered back and shoulder pain,
and had hit his head against the inside of the car. Jeff Gordon
black-flagged for having right front fender stuck out beyond his
tire..
</P>
<P>
   _ Lap leaders: Martin (95), Rusty Wallace (5)
</P>
<P>
   _ Under caution: 244-251, ambulance leaving infield; 294-298
(Irwin's accident).
</P>
<P>
   Fourth 100
</P>
<P>
   Martin held off Gordon's challenge over the final 50 laps to
coast to a more than two-second victory. Jerry Nadeau, Mike Skinner
and Todd Bodine were in a turn three accident on lap 316.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lap leader: Martin (100).
</P>
<P>
   _ Under caution: 316-326, accident in turn three. 334-340, oil
on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Points update
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin won for the sixth time, he gained only 10 points
on Gordon. Dale Jarrett remained in third, but lost 39 points to
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's impact
</P>
<P>
   It was an in-your-face, take-that race day for Martin. An
enormous amount of effort for a dominating victory, but Martin will
still find it difficult to catch Gordon for the Winston Cup
championship with only seven races remaining. If Gordon finishes
fourth or better in all the remaining races, he cannot be caught.

DOLPHINS SHUT DOWN STEELERS 21-0 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ This game was billed as a slugfest, two teams that had
barely been able to throw the ball and loved to run it. So on its
first two offensive plays Sunday, Miami hurled bombs. Both fell
incomplete. Pittsburgh, on its first two offensive plays, tossed a
short pass and then a deep one. One gained 2 yards and the other
was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   Back to basics. Back to the rugged running game and to punishing
defense, the way it was supposed to be. And once the nitty-gritty
was under way, Pittsburgh, surprisingly, was not up to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It fell behind by 7-0 with 5 minutes 12 seconds left in the
first half after allowing an 11-play, 64-yard drive that consumed a
little more than 7 minutes. With 2:39 left before halftime,
Pittsburgh allowed another score that was set up when the Miami
defense intercepted a pass and returned it to the Steelers' 24. And
then with 8:06 left in the third quarter, Miami returned an
interception 17 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That was it, 21-0, Miami, in an aggressive, attacking, physical
and dominating game for the Dolphins that was absolute
embarrassment for Pittsburgh before 73,948 fans at Pro Player
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 3-0; Pittsburgh is 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliating for Pittsburgh? Check out these numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Steelers were 3 of 14 on third down (a 21 percent
conversion rate compared with Miami's 37 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The Steelers gained only 200 yards, including 78 passing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Steelers punted 10 times and missed a 47-yard field-goal
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Steelers were intercepted three times.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Steelers possessed the ball for 9 minutes 32 seconds less
than Miami (the tally was 2:11 to 12:49 in the second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an extremely poor display of offensive football,''
said Bill Cowher, the Pittsburgh head coach. ``Miami played good
defense and we played poor offensively. Those are two distinctly
different statements. I look out on the field and see too many good
football players for us to have this level of production. We will
get this thing turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   There was simply no Steelers production. It rained for most of
the second half, but well before that the Pittsburgh offense was
all wet.
</P>
<P>
   It started with quarterback Kordell Stewart. He was miserable in
the first half (4 of 15 passing for 3 yards) and finished 11 of 35
for 82 yards with a sack and three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Running Back Jerome Bettis carried 13 times for only 48 yards.
Receiver Charles Johnson caught two passes for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this was not our best day,'' Stewart said. ``Things
did not click.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettis said, ``If you go out there and you are not on all
cylinders and you play a great defense like that, you are going to
get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   A great defense? Words seldom spoken around here. But maybe
Miami finally has one.
</P>
<P>
   Its defensive front of Kenny Mixon, Tim Bowens, Daryl Gardener
and Jason Taylor won the confrontation at the point of attack. Its
linebackers, Derrick Rodgers, Zach Thomas and Robert Jones, were
adept at pass coverage and at snuffing the run.
</P>
<P>
   They eagerly took on the challenge of tackling Bettis, known as
the Bus, all 250 pounds of him, and often put him down hard. The
secondary features Terrell Buckley and Sam Madison at cornerback
and Calvin Jackson and Brock Marion at safety. Buckley and Madison
often locked in man-to-man coverage with Pittsburgh and won that
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   After Karim Abdul-Jabbar (a career-most 33 carries for 108
yards) scored on a 3-yard run, Madison made one of his two
interceptions of Stewart. The first set up an 8-yard pass from Dan
Marino to Lamar Thomas that made it 14-0. Zach Thomas returned an
interception 17 yards for the game's final points.
</P>
<P>
   This Miami defensive crew earned the Dolphins their first home
shutout in a nonstrike game since Sept. 22, 1985. That was so long
ago, Miami was playing in the Orange Bowl then.
</P>
<P>
   Zach Thomas said: ``We changed up our game plan a lot, showed
Stewart a lot of stuff, and we tried to rattle him as much as we
could and keep him in the pocket. The guy is so quick, but we did a
good job of containing him. We have another quick start, but we
want to go on from here. I know Miami teams are known for quick
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   And wimpy finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 3-0 for the fourth time in five years, but none of that
led to playoff success. The Dolphins say this team is different.
This team has a running game and defense. It can win the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 1998,'' end Jason Taylor said. ``None of the other
years matter. This team is for real. A shutout against their
offensive personnel? That speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Pittsburgh's first shutout loss in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's head coach, Jimmy Johnson, said this is the difference
in this bunch of Dolphins: ``More players and a little more
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   More confidence and more attitude. Sunday, the Dolphins put all
of that on display. &QL;

 &HT;    Donnan promises hard work in aftermath of Wyoming game
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ After a less-than-impressive showing in Saturday's
16-9 win over Wyoming, the 13th-ranked Georgia football team won't
have much time off during its bye week.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who don't play again until an Oct. 3 date at No. 6
LSU, will practice four straight days, beginning with a light
workout this afternoon, and probably won't get a day off until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't work hard, we may practice on Saturday and
Sunday,'' Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has two weeks to address several concerns on offense.
The Bulldogs lost four fumbles to Wyoming, matching the team total
all last season, and rushed for only 74 yards. The Bulldogs managed
just 93 yards offense against the Cowboys in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work on ball security,'' Donnan said. ``I'm not
worrying about the running game, based on one game. We're going to
be a good running team. I knew we were going to have problems
against Wyoming. I said that all last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan didn't expect many mistakes from freshman quarterback
Quincy Carter, who was involved in three turnovers. In the second
quarter, Carter handed off to the wrongback and later dropped a
high shotgun snap from center Miles Luckie. Midway through the
fourth quarter, Carter fumbled after taking a hit on a passing
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Quincy had a good first half,'' Donnan said. ``He
made the right plays, except for dropping that snap that hit him in
the facemask. ... We're concerned about not having more protection,
but we also were without a starting guard (sophomore Jonas
Jennings).''
</P>
<P>
   Though Donnan emphasizes mistake-free football, both were absent
Saturday. Georgia rushed for only 74 yards on 35 carries, an
average of only 2.1 yards per attempt. Senior Olandis Gary led the
Bulldogs with 26 yards on 11 carries; junior Patrick Pass had only
24 on nine attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded freshman Jasper Sanks didn't play for the third
straight game. ``We'll certainly continue to look at Sanks and see
if he gives us a chance to be successful,'' Donnan said. ``Some of
the plays (Saturday) _ Jim Brown couldn't have gained a yard. It
doesn't matter who the back was. They just did a good job of
penetrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia may have redshirt freshman quarterback Daniel Cobb of
Kennesaw available against LSU. Cobb, who has been sidelined for
several months with circulation problems in his throwing shoulder,
was taken off blood thinner last week. He'll be tested today and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan also said two-way player Champ Bailey, who had six
catches for 100 yards in the opening half, but only played
sparingly in the second with cramping in both legs, is being
evaluated by a specialist and was placed on new medication.

 &HT;    LB Uremovich's trademark is intensity
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This clip never showed up on the Matt Uremovich
highlight tape _ the one he and his brother Mike made by hooking up
two VCRs back home in Joliet, Ill., to help drum up some interest
in a young linebacker who is, as Mike Uremovich puts it, ``an inch
too short and 20 pounds too light.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech assistant coach Doug Marrone never saw this
``behind-the-scenes moment'' after watching the tape, showing it to
coach George O'Leary and getting the vigorous nod to go after the
smallish (6-1, 215) and slowish kid who might turn out to be Tech's
next great linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   It was Matt Uremovich's sophomore year at Providence Catholic,
his first year playing on the varsity, and it was the playoffs.
Uremovich had a broken arm and was in a cast, something he had no
intention of letting keep him out of the game. Trouble was, he
needed a note from a doctor to give to the referees so they would
allow him to play in a cast. But the team trainer forgot the note,
and the officials weren't going to let Uremovich play.
</P>
<P>
   As his brother Mike tells it, Uremovich slipped past his
coaches, trainer and any security at the opposing school, broke
into a maintenance closet and came out with a saw. He cut his cast
off and played in the game, helping Providence to the first of
three state championships in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me,'' Marrone said. ``He's a tough, tough
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Uremovich got that kind of reputation around Tech his scout
team year, so much so that future Atlanta Falcons first-round pick
Keith Brooking said Uremovich reminded him of himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Providence Catholic football team has a copy of Brooking's
quote up in its locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brooking) is a good player if he plays like my brother,''
said Mike Uremovich, who is two years older than Matt and has taken
time off from his studies at Purdue to be the offensive coordinator
for Providence Catholic. ``You won't find a guy who's more intense,
dedicated or wants to win more.''
</P>
<P>
   As a scout-team linebacker, Uremovich was in fights weekly. As a
second-team linebacker during the preseason, Uremovich watched the
first team practice with his toes on the sideline, eyes on the
action and his calf muscles flexed for the coaches' call to come
in.
</P>
<P>
   He was ready during the Boston College game when he came off the
bench for his first play on defense. He wrapped up running back
Mike Cloud on the play. A week later, he was in the starting lineup
at Brooking's old position of weakside linebacker and giving the
impression he might not come out for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy right now,'' Uremovich said. ``I just don't want to
screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Uremovich, who says he'll be lucky if he's half the player
Brooking was, needs to get stronger and is still in the early
stages of learning Tech's defense. But his coaches like the way
he's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uremovich plays the game the way you like it to be played,''
defensive coordinator Randy Edsall said. ``You can tell football
really means something to him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said, ``I like his attitude. And the way he's getting to
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The first glimpses Mike Uremovich saw of his brother's intensity
came when he was 11 and Matt was 9 and the two were playing
volleyball at a hotel on vacation. They were going against another
kid and his 30-something father. As Mike tells it, the pair started
cheating on line calls, and Matt and the man started arguing. Next
thing Mike knew, Matt had knocked the man down. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   As teenagers, the Uremoviches went through four Nintendos
because, after Mike or Matt would lose a video football game, he'd
bash the Nintendo. That would inevitably lead to a fight and a trip
out to the backyard to finish off their business.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Matt was a sophomore at Providence and Mike was a
senior, their wrestling coaches had the ``Uremovich rule.'' Mike
and Matt were not allowed to go against each other in practice
because they ended up in fights.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mike, who first broke Matt's nose, the one which he has
rebroken every year since his junior year either wrestling or
playing football. He broke it again during this preseason when his
chinstrap busted and the top of his helmet crashed into his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Uremovich can't breathe out of one side of his nose. He wears a
Band-Aid across the bridge of his nose to hide the cut, which
splits open regularly. Tech has ordered him a special fitted helmet
that it hopes will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   To Uremovich, the problem isn't the pain, it's the chance that
officials might take him out of a game if he has blood on his
jersey. ``It's more of a hassle.''

 FAN INTERFERENCE ROBS McGWIRE OF HOME RUN NO. 66 
 (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The greatest home run spectacle in history spawned
an outrageous subplot Sunday when Mark McGwire belted what many are
calling home run No. 65 and a half at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a two home run day, McGwire had to settle for one
homer and a near-miss after fans interfered with the second of his
drives. The umpire ruled it a ground-rule double, one fan was
ejected from the stadium and fined, and many were left debating
whether McGwire was robbed.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events began when McGwire took a mighty swing
that launched what appeared to be his 66th home run of the season
in the fifth inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' 11-6 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   As the ball headed on a line toward the left-center-field
bleachers 392 feet from home plate, dozens of fans pushed and
shoved their way toward the fence in hopes of retrieving a part of
history and perhaps a valuable souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, Michael Chapes of Waterford, Wis., and Allan
Riesbeck of Dubuque, Iowa, lunged for the ball and, judging from
videotaped replays, simultaneously caught it near the yellow home
run line above the wall. The ball landed in Chapes' glove, but
Riesbeck had his gray T-shirt in Chapes' mitt.
</P>
<P>
   The second base umpire, Bob Davidson, who was sprinting toward
the fence, thought the fans reached over the yellow line and into
the field of play and called them for fan interference.
</P>
<P>
   In that situation, the league rules call for the umpire to make
a judgment on where the ball would have landed if the fans had not
interfered. Davidson, believing that McGwire's hit would not have
cleared the yellow line, ruled it a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball got out there in about half a second,'' said
Davidson, who is in his 16th season as a major league umpire. ``I
got out there as fast as I could, and I saw it. When I saw it, the
fan was leaning over and the ball hit him below the yellow line. So
that's why I called it a ground-rule double. I saw the ball good.''
</P>
<P>
   William DeWitt Jr., the Cardinals' owner, telephoned
Commissioner Bud Selig shortly after Davidson's ruling, asking for
an official review of the tape and possible overturn of the call.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who hit his 65th home run off Scott Karl in the first
inning, said he looked at the videotape twice after the game and
believes Davidson made the wrong call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who caught the ball never came over the yellow line,''
said McGwire, who is now two homers ahead of Chicago's Sammy Sosa,
who has 63. ``The replay shows that he didn't. But then again, it's
a judgment call.''
</P>
<P>
   Though obviously disappointed, McGwire was satisfied with
hitting No. 65, a 423-foot blast that was one of five St. Louis
homers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five had a lot of meaning because that's the number my
son said he wanted me to hit,'' said McGwire, referring to
10-year-old Matthew. ``Before spring training, I asked him how many
homers he wanted me to hit, and he said 65. That's all I thought
about when I ran around the bases. What a prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dombrowski, a 21-year-old senior at the University of
Wisconsin at Whitewater, caught McGwire's home run and said he will
return it to the slugger. McGwire said he will give the ball to his
son.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be homer in the fifth was the second home run that
McGwire has had reversed in his career, the first coming during his
rookie season in Oakland in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds of Davidson's fan-interference call, security
guards, following stadium rules, ejected Chapes from the park.
Chapes, a 31-year-old physical education teacher, denied any
wrongdoing, saying that he could not reach over the three-foot moat
that separates the yellow home-run line from the fence in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 5-7. My arms aren't that long,'' said Chapes, who was
cited and fined $518.15 for trespassing. ``It was a home run. I had
the ball in my glove and somebody knocked it out. I don't
understand why the guy who ended up with the ball got to stay in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapes and Riesbeck had the ball for less than a second before
it was knocked out of the glove by rushing fans. The ball fell into
the moat between the two fences, and Johnny Luna, an 18-year-old
from New York City jumped into the moat and grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't over the fence,'' Luna said of Chapes. ``It should
have been a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Luna was one of dozens of fans in the left-field bleachers who
said that Chapes and Riesbeck were not over the yellow line and
that, consequently, McGwire had been robbed of his 66th home run.
But numerous Milwaukee County police and stadium ushers in the
bleachers said the two fans definitely interfered and leaned into
the field of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were at least eight inches over the yellow line,'' said a
security guard who wanted to remain anonymous. ``I see many, many
close home runs, and I know what to watch for. The umpire made the
right call. The ball would have hit the fence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Luna, a high school senior from the Astoria section of Queens,
rode to Milwaukee in a 1986 Ford van with four other New Yorkers:
40-year-old Gerald DiGilio; his two teen-age sons, Jerry and Joe
DiGilio, and David Schiff, 20. The group shuttled between Chicago
and Milwaukee on Friday and Saturday in hopes of catching a home
run ball by Sosa or McGwire. They will remain in Milwaukee on
Tuesday and Wednesday for the Cubs' two-game series with the
Brewers and then go to St. Louis to see McGwire's final home series
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that they could not care less about baseball, they
said their interest is strictly monetary. So even if the
controversial ruling is overturned and McGwire is granted his 66th
home run, Luna will not give him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't trading it in for nothing,'' said Gerald DiGilio, a
bridge painter from Astoria. ``We're selling it to the highest
bidder. We didn't come down here to give anything to McGwire. He
didn't come to Astoria to give us anything.''

COLUMN: CHICAGO TO SAMMY: YOU THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Trotting past Wrigley Field's ivy-covered brick
outfield wall after the ceremonies, Sammy Sosa was waving his blue
Cubs cap at the adoring applause from the bleachers when the word
suddenly arrived at Wrigley Field. Some 90 miles to the north in
Milwaukee, Mark McGwire had just hit another homer _ his 65th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstaged again,'' somebody said.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Not on his ``Day,'' when a dozen red-white-and-blue
Dominican Republic flags fluttered from the grandstand roof. Not
when a big banner on the wire screen above the left-field bleachers
bragged, ``Sammy, You're the Man.'' Not when the Friendly Confines
were never friendlier. Even if he only partly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire's the man,'' he told the television station WGN before
the game, ``but in Chicago, I am the man.'' Then, with a sly grin,
he said, ``Excuse me, Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Michael Jordan was at Wrigley Field too, peering down
at the festivities from a private sky box, too smart to risk really
upstaging the Cubs slugger. His children ``wanted to see Sammy,''
Jordan had said during the week, so he was here as a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Sammy,'' Jordan, the man in Chicago and
elsewhere for more than a decade, would say later. ``I think he's
going to hit the most homers.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Sosa needs a big last week. McGwire has six games
remaining, all in St. Louis against the Astros and the Expos. Sosa
has only five, all on the road (two in Milwaukee, three in Houston)
unless there's also a Cubs-Mets wild-card playoff at Shea Stadium.
When told after he was 0 for 5 (and 0 for 17 since his 63rd homer)
in the 7-3 loss to the Reds that McGwire's homer occurred during
Sunday's festivities, Sosa smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Mark's the man,'' Sosa said. ``I hope he continues
and hits 70.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cubs' clubhouse before his ``Day'' really began, Sosa was
wearing a sleeveless T-shirt with ``Swing, Hit, Run, Slide, Score''
on the back as he stared at photos showing that both he and
McGwire, in a way, were already in the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our `March On Maris' exhibit with you and Mark,'' the
Hall of Fame president, Don Marr, was saying. ``It's right at the
entrance as you come in.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Sosa kept staring at the photos like a little boy
would, in the wonderment of it all. His Cubs shirt and his bat from
his 62nd homer are already part of that exhibit. Finally, he
thanked Marr, shook hands and returned to his locker, where a
cereal box with Roberto Clemente's face on it was perched nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As his Latin American tribute to Clemente, the Puerto Rican
outfielder who wore No. 21 during his Hall of Fame career with the
Pittsburgh Pirates, Sosa wears No. 21 on his Cubs' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a blare of trumpets on the grass behind home plate,
Sosa accepted a crystal ``Historic Achievement Award'' from
Commissioner Bud Selig, who mentioned how ``you have handled
yourself with class and dignity that has been unparalleled. Thank
you, above all, for being what you've been.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Marichal, the onetime San Francisco Giants ace and the only
Dominican with a bronze plaque in the Hall of Fame, spoke on behalf
of Dominican President Leonel Fernandez Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard about Sammy was about 10 years ago when
the scouts were talking about him,'' Marichal would say later. ``I
saw him play on the Dominican team and you could tell he had the
speed, the arm. He struck out a lot, but the way he hit the ball
hard, you knew he had the potential to be a long-ball hitter. And
the way he composes himself, he's so good for the kids as a role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lynch, once a Mets right-hander and now the Cubs general
manager, presented Sosa with a Tiffany crystal trophy, a Malcolm
Farley painting and the traditional gift on a ballplayer's ``day''
_ an automobile _ a purple Chrysler Prowler convertible. And then
Sosa walked to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God,'' he began, ``for giving so much opportunity
to be who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Selig, the league presidents, his family, Roger
Maris' family, ``all the people from my country, the Dominican
Republic, that supported me,'' the Cubs' organization, his manager
(Jim Riggleman), his coaches and teammates, all the Latin-American
people who have supported him, especially in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago, I love you,'' the Cubs right fielder closed, ``and
the right-field bleachers, I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned away, but seeing his wife, Sonia, and his mother,
Lucretia, sitting there, he spun back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he told the sellout crowd of 40,117. ``I forgot
my family. My wife. My mother. My brothers. My friends. And one
more thing I want to say. Baseball has been very very good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has been very good to baseball. Even with a four-year,
$40 million contract, he's a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how many more homers Mark McGwire might hit before
the season ends, Sammy Sosa deserves to be the National League's
most valuable player this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easily,'' Michael Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anybody else, Michael Jordan ought to know an MVP when
he sees one.

RANGERS STUMBLE, FALL TO ATHLETICS, 6-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This is not the way the Rangers wanted to be
playing, especially at The Ballpark in Arlington and going into the
biggest series of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wanted to use the last of their home-field advantage
to strengthen their hand before heading to the West Coast. Instead,
they were outplayed for the second consecutive day by a last-place
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers stumbled through what manager Johnny Oates said was
``the most disappointing loss of the season'' and finished their
1998 home schedule with a 6-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics before
a listless crowd of 37,606 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels played the Seattle Mariners last night, and
could make the loss even worse with a victory, which would pull
them back into a first-place tie with the Rangers in the American
League West. With seven games left in the season, the two teams
open a three-game series tonight at Edison International Field of
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out flat today,'' Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore
said. ``We didn't come out like a team that's in first place. It's
one thing to lose, but the way we lost today wasn't very good. But
we've got to forget about it. We can't let it linger.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates let it linger long enough to fume afterward about bad
defense and poor pitch selection between pitcher Esteban Loaiza and
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, this should have been a shutout,'' Oates said.
``This was not one of our better cerebral games. There wasn't
anything wrong with the effort, maybe if anything we were trying a
little too hard physically. We just didn't play very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza said he made just two mistakes. Oates counted more than
that, but both were in agreement about the first-pitch, hanging
curveballs that Jason Giambi and Ben Grieve hit for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza's strength is his sinking fastball that hits 95 mph on
the radar gun. His curveball is his ``fourth or fifth'' best pitch,
Oates says, and the Rangers' pregame strategy sessions didn't call
for Loaiza to pitch that way to the Athletics' best hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got the big boys up there that can hurt you, you
don't want to mess with them,'' Oates said. ``It's not the pitch
selection, but the thought process ... what's my best chance of
getting this guy out? When in doubt, go to your strength, rather
than his weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who has allowed 14 home runs in his past nine games,
declined to dwell on pitch selection, preferring instead to blame
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four errors probably cost us the game,'' Loaiza said, and he
did have a point. Better defensive could have prevented three more
runs from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton bounced a throw past first baseman Mike
Simms on a potential double-play ball in the third inning, allowing
Eric Chavez to score. The Rangers then committed three more errors
in the fifth inning, allowing the Athletics to score twice and
break a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose it's disappointing,'' outfielder Rusty Greer
said. ``The thing we have to remember is we can't throw the towel
in now. We've played hard for 155 games to get where we are. We
just have to keep pressing with the same desire and intensity.''

REPUBLICANS NEED EIGHT SEATS TO TAKE TEXAS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moved in ``p'' category) 
(lb) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG SPRING, Texas _ It is a warm, cricket-loud Friday night in
West Texas, which means the parking lot is jammed next to the high
school football field, big enough to hold much of the town, which
it does.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few feet away from the man selling chances on a football
autographed by the whole team and the woman handing out discount
coupons for chicken-fried steak (``Fifty percent from every
purchase goes to the boys,'' she says) is Scott McLaughlin, local
wholesale plumber and Republican candidate for the Texas House.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out here are so conservative,'' McLaughlin said as he
handed out campaign pamphlets to people carrying their seat
cushions through the stadium gates. ``Either side, either party.
The Republicans, of course, are shocked about what's come out about
the president, and the Democrats have been somewhat taken aback by
it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a dozen states, including Texas, where the
turnover of a relative handful of seats this November would change
control of the legislature, at a time when an increasing share of
the nation's business is being conducted at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   And candidates and political strategists all across the country
are wondering how, if at all, President Clinton's troubles might
affect state races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's a gap between what happens at the
national level, even at the congressional level, and what happens
lower down,'' said Janice May, a professor of government at the
University of Texas in Austin. ``In the South there has been a
tremendous increase in Republican support, but it takes time to get
down to the legislative level. Still, we could very well have a
sweep for Republicans in Texas this year.''
</P>
<P>
   If eight seats change hands in the Texas House in November, the
Republicans, who have controlled the state Senate since 1996, will
have sway over the entire legislature for the first time since
Reconstruction in the 1870s. The party is giving extra money and
support to candidates, like McLaughlin, who are in key races.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts caution that a Republican turnaround is not
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a study back in June based on primary turnout and other
things in which I was absolutely sure there would be a downturn in
turnout and that would benefit the Republicans, especially in
states like Texas,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee
for the Study of the American Electorate. ``But we've got a couple
of wild cards now that make me want to hedge my bets a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the wild cards are the state of the economy. For instance,
Gans said, if the stock market dips even more, which is entirely
possible, or unemployment rises significantly, which seems much
less likely, it could burst public optimism about the economy which
has buoyed the campaigns of incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Even more vexing, he said, is whether the president's troubles
will dampen Democratic turnout, or whether perceived Republican
missteps in handling the crisis will rankle the Democratic
rank-and-file sufficiently to get them out to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, whose great-grandfather began by selling windmills
to farmers and who now sells well equipment, plumbing fixtures and
high-end kitchen appliances from a two-story building off
Interstate 20, says that he intends to include a pitch about
character and integrity in the new television spots he will shoot
next week for the fall campaign. He knows it's a way of talking
about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, he said, is to choose just the right words to raise
the character issue without making it look as if the Republicans
are taking advantage of the president's situation. He's still
working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can definitely tell you that the issue of virtue and
character will be a part of my message this fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Texas, sensing an opportunity, are redoubling
their efforts in the wake of the release of special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's report on the president.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the state party's funding efforts, a separate ``Eight in
'98'' political action committee was formed earlier this year to
feed money into targeted races, like McLaughlin's, that could shift
the balance in the House, which currently has 68 Republicans and 82
Democrats. In the state Senate, the Republicans hold 17 seats to
the Democrats' 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the president's problems are a factor, but not the
only factor,'' said Robert Black, a spokesman for the state
Republican Party. ``We've also got an extremely popular governor in
George W. Bush at the top of our ticket in November, and a strong
slate for all the statewide offices. We definitely feel we have a
good shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   No consensus has formed on what the Democratic Party's national
problems might mean in statewide races in battleground states like
Texas. Guesses are all across the map; from no impact to full
impact.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one veteran Texas prognosticator, Robert Stein, a
professor of political science at Rice University, believes that
Republicans eager for a November rout here may well be in for a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My money now is on the House staying Democrat and the Senate
possibly going back into Democratic hands,'' he said, ``although
the whole thing is very much up for grabs. A lot depends on how
good these campaigns are in the coming weeks and how much
ticket-splitting there is going to be. Mostly what you hear from
candidates is that no one wants to listen. Voters are
disinterested.''

<P>
   The 70th legislative district sprawls across 12 rural counties
in West Texas, coming up to the edge of, without entering, three of
the region's biggest cities; Lubbock, Midland and Abilene. The
district encompasses mile after mile of cotton farms, ranches and
small towns.
</P>
<P>
   The district has been represented for a decade by David Counts,
D-Knox County, on the far side of the district from McLaughlin's
home in Big Spring. McLaughlin first ran against him two years ago,
losing by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McLaughlin focused his campaign on neighborhood walks,
knocking on more than 10,000 doors. This year, he said, he will
knock on about the same number. ``I am absolutely convinced that
the way to do it, at this level, is to look as many voters in the
eye as you can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His message is drawn directly from the Ronald Reagan playbook,
by way of Newt Gingrich; smaller government, fewer regulations,
strong family values.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin spent about $140,000 on the 1996 campaign, he said,
and plans to spend roughly the same amount this year in his rematch
against Counts. Some of that money comes from local donors, but
some comes from ``Eight in '98,'' which offers logistical and
strategic advice, as well as money. ``They are a definite factor,''
McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Counts was at a Democratic event earlier this month at church
picnic grounds north of Abilene. ``The Republicans came after me
two years ago and they're doing it again,'' he said. ``They keep
trying to tie me to President Clinton, but it won't work. I
personally think this Clinton thing is going to go away real quick.
The last straw was the lurid detail that Ken Starr put in that
report. Now the people know his heart was black and his cause was
not pure.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin doesn't really know how much national political
obsessions will affect his race, nor how much he will benefit from
Bush's coattails in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to tie ourselves to Bush as much as we can,''
McLaughlin said. ``After all, we're both singing from the same
sheet of music.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has been in the district a couple of times to
campaign for himself and for local Republicans, and each visit has
meant a boost for McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, McLaughlin is asked, if Clinton came to the
70th district to campaign for his opponent?
</P>
<P>
   A smile spread across his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election would be over,'' he said.

trying to tie me to President Clinton, but it won't work. I
personally think this Clinton thing is going to go away real quick.
The last straw was the lurid detail that Ken Starr put in that
report. Now the people know his heart was black and his cause was

   McLaughlin doesn't really know how much national political
obsessions will affect his race, nor how much he will benefit from

McLaughlin said. ``After all, we're both singing from the same

   UMATILLA RESERVATION, Ore. _ The mercury had pushed over the
100-degree mark again here in the high desert, but the tourists
from Germany were undeterred, looking for clues to life in the
American West before every small town had an espresso bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``As children we used to play cowboys and native Americans,''
Klaus Pumple, a 37-year-old construction manager from Stuttgart,
Germany, said recently. ``Now when you pass through the native
American zones in this country, it's kind of depressing, not like
you expected. But also, it is so very interesting to see how these
people live today.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Blackfoot Indian Reservation in Montana, at the high
drama nexus of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, Vicky
Kilian of the Netherlands had just spent another night sleeping on
a dirt floor inside a tent and was wondering whether she could ever
return to her life as a business consultant in a very flat country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sleep in the teepee, I feel a lot of connection to the
earth,'' said Ms. Kilian, 29, who is on her first visit to America.
``I have had a fire every night and I have been able to walk over
the prairie. It has a very special energy.''
</P>
<P>
   American Indian reservations, long considered economic deserts
in a landscape of general prosperity, are finding that they have a
lot more to offer the world than casinos and art galleries _ they
have their homes, their backyards, their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, especially a growing number of Europeans, are
traveling to some of the country's most remote places, like this
Indian reservation in central Oregon, in search of life many
Americans overlook on their vacations. No theme parks built around
fantasies for these travelers. In fact, some of the biggest new
attractions are rooted in today's world and in authenticity _ even
if it leaves visitors feeling more guilt than vacation relief.
Tourists to Indian country spend their holidays hearing tales of
heart-numbing atrocities or listening to songs in languages that
never show up in Frommer's guides. They come away thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   And for Indians who have figured just how to market this niche
of native society, business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans have been visiting Indian country since the time of
Columbus, but what's really new is Indians getting control of it,''
said Gordon Bronitsky, a Denver tourism marketer who has just
produced a catalog of Indian travel packages that is going out to
5,000 travel agents in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise ship full of Germans will tie up next spring near the
western Oneida Reservation, next to Green Bay, Wis., after the tour
operator reported that visitors requested a stop at an Indian
reservation as part of their itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit there and say, `How,' and paint our
faces,'' said Jeff House, a spokesman for the Oneida. ``We will try
to give an impression of how people live today. We're business
people. We go to Packer games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tribes are trying to blend the old with the new. Will
Tsosie runs what might be called an Indian bed and breakfast on the
Navajo Reservation not far from Canyon de Chelly National Monument
in Arizona. He charges $85 a night to stay in a traditional
earthen-floored hogan, a cylindrical house with no running water,
and a structure in which few Indians live. But he also takes people
to visit the local community college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our European guests are very well-prepared and very well-read
_ unlike most Americans,'' Tsosie said. ``If they show up with too
much of the wrong attitude, we turn them away.'' Recently, he said,
some people came to the Hopi Reservation looking for a sun dance,
and asked whether they could be ``pierced'' in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them they had the wrong Indians,'' Tsosie said. ``Try
a thousand miles to the north, with the Lakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Conner, director of the new $18 million Tamastslikt
Cultural Center, on the Umatilla Reservation, said, ``We get a lot
of people who expect they are going to find the Hollywood
stereotypes, the beads and feather Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, whose Indian name means interpreter, opened this
summer after nearly 10 years of planning and is drawing visitors
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tamastslikt is the only Indian-run, Indian-owned interpretive
center along the entire length of the old Oregon Trail, Ms. Conner
said. The trail, from St. Louis to Western Oregon, has long been a
magnet for fans of heritage tourism. With the opening of
Tamastslikt, she said, there is now another side of the story of
Westward expansion, as well as a history of the Indians who have
long lived in this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Umatilla and the two other tribes that live on the
reservation, the Cayuse and the Walla Walla, sent a delegation to
Berlin this year, to the world's biggest tourism trade show. They
handed out posters of a Cayuse Indian leader in a buffalo headdress
with the slogan ``Nicht Ihr Durchschnittlicher Reisefuhrer,'' Not
Your Average Tour Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is often the focus of the marketing because the country
has more than 300 Indian clubs, where people adopt a tribe or a
chief and study the history. Plus, millions of Germans have grown
up on the books of Karl May, a German author who wrote a series of
stories about an Apache and his white sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sort of noble savage image, unfettered by
civilization, which they like,'' Bronitsky said. ``God forbid that
anyone should ever discuss that Indians have VCR's and
microwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But a central thrust of the new interpretative center, which is
part of a resort that includes a casino, an 18-hole golf course, a
hotel and recreational vehicle park, is to show how Indians of the
Columbia Plateau live today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be perceived as dynamic, evolving, healthy
people,'' Ms. Conner said. ``That's not exactly what people expect
to see when they visit a reservation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that these Columbia Plateau Indians have lived
in roughly the same places for thousands of years is a tourist draw
in a country where so many of the human attachments to the land are
ephemeral, tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much live where we've always lived, and people are
fascinated by that,'' Ms. Conner said. The center tells a story of
independent people whose lives were forever changed by the
schooners that came over the Oregon Trail. It shows the effect of
disease, of boarding schools that disrupted families, and of
poverty. And it ends on a hopeful note, with visions of a tribe
flourishing anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very moved by it,'' Ms. Conner said. ``We get these
notes in the suggestion box: `I'm sorry for everything we've done
to you people.' It awakens a lot of trauma, a lot of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guilt-swollen effect of some heritage tour sites,
tour operators outside the reservation say there is great interest
in all things Indian. A record number of people, about 600,000,
visited the National Museum of the American Indian in lower
Manhattan last year, double the attendance of the year before. And
out near the reservations, museums report a similar trend.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the Plains Indian, on the Blackfoot
Reservation, near Browning, Mont., nearly half the visitors this
year have been from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A huge majority of the guests at Darrell Norman's village and
horse ranch on the Blackfoot Reservation are Europeans. They take
pictures of the bison herds that wander around the reservation,
ride horses that are descendants of the mustangs brought to the
Americas by the Spanish and learn about the culture of Northern
Plains tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know what the Blackfoot are all about,'' Norman
said. ``They want to taste our food. They want to sleep on the
ground _ the whole package. They may show up with stereotypical
image, but they leave with the sense that we have a very alive
culture. We do not have dead arts, dead language.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kilian, the Dutch visitor to the Blackfoot, said she had
considered going to China on her vacation, but chose the Blackfoot
Reservation instead. ``Before I came here I heard that they had a
dislike for whites,'' she said. ``That is not true. I have felt
very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem that concerns the tribes is trying to hold the line
between sharing culture and exploitation. The Umatilla, for
example, found that many Germans want to stay with Indian families
_ but the Indians themselves do not feel like opening their homes.
The Blackfoot, who are enjoying a banner year for tourism, are
grappling with the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been this question,'' said Ray Montoya, the
Blackfoot tribal planning director, ``of how far we develop this
industry while maintaining a pristine environment and our
culture.''  &QL;

LOCKHEED TO BUY COMSAT FOR $2.7 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving away from the military business and toward global
telecommunications, Lockheed Martin Corp. announced Sunday a $2.7
billion acquisition of Comsat Corp., a communications satellite
company created by the government more than three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a strategic shift for Lockheed Martin, which
only three months ago abandoned a planned $8.3 billion takeover of
Northrop Grumman Corp., a move that would have pushed Lockheed
deeper into military products. The Northrop deal collapsed in the
face of Defense Department opposition on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Comsat acquisition would build on Lockheed's existing
satellite services business, which primarily focuses on satellite
design and launches. Comsat is a leading provider of voice, data,
video and other satellite communications services between the
United States and other countries, and is the mechanism by which
such companies as AT&AMP;T, MCI Communications and Sprint send their
telephone calls overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must still be approved by the Federal Communications
Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as shareholders.
But John Sponyeo, chief executive of Lockheed's global
telecommunications division, said he did not anticipate antitrust
problems with this acquisition, since Comsat and Lockheed are not
in overlapping businesses. The Defense Department does not have to
review this deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area of growth and telecommunication services is
something our company has been looking at for a long time,''
Sponyeo said. ``We are heavily involved in the manufacture of
satellite launches and this brings us more heavily into global
information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Lockheed created the new global
telecommunications division, one of six major business lines, in a
move that initially signaled a strategic shift. According to
Sponyeo, the Comsat acquisition had been in the discussion stage
for at least 18 months, and would have gone ahead even had the
Northrop deal been successful. ``They were on two parallel
tracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Chao, an aerospace industry analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, said the Comsat acquisition was a good fit for
Lockheed, adding, ``It's great in terms of providing long-term
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed. ``In one fell swoop, Lockheed has become a major
player in the global telecommunications industry and, in
particular, in that part of the industry that exploits the use of
space-based technology,'' said Loren Thompson, chief operating
officer at Lexington Institute, a military research group based in
Arlington, Va. ``This signals that telecommunications will become a
major long-term strategic thrust for Lockheed, and it's a decisive
departure from the traditional Cold War definition of the defense
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the first phase of the deal, Lockheed Martin will acquire
up to 49 percent of Comsat's common stock for $45.50 a share in
cash, or about $1.3 billion. That price represents a 33 percent
premium over Comsat's stock price, which closed Friday at $34.125,
down 62.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase, Lockheed Martin will merge a new
telecommunications subsidiary with Comsat, in a stock swap under
which Comsat shareholders will receive a half-share of Lockheed
Martin for each Comsat share. The companies value this transaction
at $1.4 billion, based on recent market prices. Lockheed Martin's
shares ended trading Friday at $100, down $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Lockheed Martin will assume Comsat's debt,
which was $700 million as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the deal is contingent on changes in federal
law to remove restrictions on the ownership of Comsat voting stock.
Charles Manor, a Lockheed spokesman, said he anticipated no
congressional problems with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we propose fits into the desires of Congress,'' Manor
said, adding that Lockheed will ``reach out to Congress'' to
explain the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Alewine, chief executive of Comsat, which, like Lockheed,
is based in Bethesda, Md., said the partnership with Lockheed
``makes strategic and competitive sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partnership with Lockheed will provide us with the
resources to compete effectively in the years to come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat owns 18 percent of Intelsat, an international consortium
that is the world's largest communications satellite network. In
the last two years, Comsat has been working to increase profits by
spinning off nontelecommunications businesses. Ms. Alewine said no
reduction in the Comsat work force was anticipated as a result of
the merger. ``There is an exploding market for telecommunications
services and what Lockheed is buying are our major assets, our
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson of the Lexington Institute said, ``This deal gives
Lockheed the ability to leverage its military technology in this
area to a far broader range of markets and applications.''

OKLAHOMA CABBIE TAXIS TO GREAT AMERICAN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Chalk one up for the good old USA.
</P>
<P>
   Against an international field that included drivers from Ghana,
Thailand, Pakistan and Eritrea, Johnny Carney of Ardmore, Okla.,
defended the honor of America with a victory in the Great American
Taxi Race yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Carney, who has worked 10 years driving cabs in the Fort
Worth-Dallas area, outdueled India's Baldren Bassra over a course
set up in the frontstretch and pit road that was designed to test
various skills involved in operating a taxi. He won $500 and a
trophy to commemorate his victory in the afternoon preliminary to
the Indy Racing League's Lone Star 500K.
</P>
<P>
   Driving for the team from Big Tex Taxi, Carney brought van No.
820 around the course at tire-screeching speeds, driving with
abandon around the turns and earning cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I'd be at a disadvantage driving a van
against the cars, but I told them I could take any one of these and
do the same thing,'' said Carney, who led Big Tex to the team title
over Terminal Taxi and Choice Cabs. ``It's the driver. I drive
70,000 miles a year, so I know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He took his van to the edge in navigating a course that included
a stop sign, a toll booth, an obstacle course, a required stop to
pick up and deliver ``passengers'' _ dummies placed in the back
seat _ and parallel parking. But Carney pointed out that he doesn't
drive that fast every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the difference,'' he said with a smile. ``When I have
passengers on board, those people are trusting me with their
lives.''

PREVIN'S `STREETCAR' OFF THE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ Amid all the pomp and hullabaloo surrounding
Saturday night's world premiere of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' _
the operatic version, that is, commissioned by the San Francisco
Opera from composer Andre Previn _ the true focus of attention was
a dead man who had nothing to do with the project.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Tennessee Williams, whose classic play lent a
little reflected light to this adaptation but more often simply
upstaged it.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere of this three-act opera, Previn's first, was
unmistakably a major event. The War Memorial Opera House was
buzzing beforehand with the sort of curious anticipation that
rarely attends opera openings, and it seemed as though every member
of the international music press was on hand to weigh in on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most succinct criticism, though, came from the man
I overheard on the way out of the Opera House, saying to his wife,
``I didn't think they'd just put the play to music. I thought
there'd be some (set ital)songs.(end ital)''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are a few _ one gorgeous aria apiece for Stella and
Mitch, and a steady stream of virtuoso lyric showpieces for Blanche
DuBois, the fading Southern belle whose descent into madness is
charted with terrifying clarity in the play.
</P>
<P>
   But what's striking about this opera, which has a libretto by
Philip Littell, is how little it adds to Williams' dramatic
conception. There are long stretches in which the experience of
watching Previn's work is scarcely distinguishable from watching
the original play _ other than the fact that the famous words are
sung rather than spoken.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, of course, the project has a certain canny
appeal. Even when Previn's music is at its most timorous and
faceless, the audience is still watching ``Streetcar,'' and how bad
can that be?
</P>
<P>
   Williams' great melodrama has managed to outlive the definitive
early performances by Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Jessica Tandy
and Kim Hunter. For all its overheated rhetoric, the play's
depiction of the collision between Blanche's fragile, self-deluded
devotion to the ``finer things'' in life and the animal sexuality
embodied by her brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski retains its tragic
power.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Previn's score, in fact, is the way it
embodies that duality in music, through a stylistic shorthand that
perhaps only this composer _ with his extensive background in jazz,
film music and the classical tradition _ could have pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   The code is a simple but effective one, in which jazz stands for
the harsh pull of sexual desire while the bland melodies of
contemporary opera _ those watery vocal lines, derivative of
Strauss and Puccini, that make up today's sorry operatic lingua
franca _ define Blanche's dedication to art and culture.
</P>
<P>
   At times this device is clumsily used, as in the wailing tenor
saxophone that follows the mention of the seedy Hotel Flamingo (the
site of Blanche's secret descent into nymphomania) or the similar
riff that greets Stanley's testosterone-driven entrance in lurid
red pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, it helps clarify the rift between Blanche
and Stanley, with Stella caught poignantly between the two. The
opera's most deeply eloquent moments, in fact, are Stella's,
beginning with the Act 1 aria in which she tries to explain to
Blanche the hold that her undeniably ``common'' husband has on her.
This short, resplendent ballad (``I can hardly stand it when he's
away for a night'') displays the gentility of Stella's upbringing,
but the aching triads underneath are redolent of pure erotic
longing.
</P>
<P>
   Better still _ probably the opera's most magical moment _ is the
duet for the two sisters that ends Act 1. This is the morning after
Stella has confounded Blanche by returning to Stanley after he
drunkenly beats her and lets loose with his famous howl of
repentance, and Previn gives her a sinuous, wordless hum that is as
expressive of erotic satiety as any music ever written.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche, meanwhile, twitters around in uncomprehending
counterpoint, her stately, angular melodies showing how little she
understands of her sister's happiness. Previn may not have intended
to use contemporary operatic style to denote cluelessness, but the
rest of Blanche's role often has that effect. One aria after
another rolls out of her mouth, each one pretty and forgettable;
nothing could spell more clearly the effeteness and decay of the
Old South.
</P>
<P>
   The one major character without an aria, interestingly, is
Stanley. The omission must certainly have been deliberate _
Stanley, after all, would not go in for such highfalutin stuff _
but the problem is that it robs him of some spark of humanity. Much
more than in the original, this Stanley is a heavy _ brutal and
brooding, with none of the dangerous wit that should also be there.
</P>
<P>
   Littell's role as librettist has mostly been editorial _ almost
everything here is taken directly from Williams. And the two major
interpolations are both excruciatingly bad. One is Mitch's Act 2
aria, a stretch of Hallmark Card banality (``You know when it's the
right thing/ You just know it!/ And you do it ... That's all there
is to love.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The other is an odd expansion of the part of the Mexican woman
who appears at the end of the play selling flowers for the dead.
Williams' introduction of that figure in Blanche's darkest hour
(delectably parodied by Edward Albee in ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'') may have been a little coy, but certainly no one missed
its import, or required this weirdly demonic outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Even the production, directed by veteran Colin Graham, seems
largely concerned with being faithful to the source material.
Michael Yeargan's set, with its spare two-room flat and large,
circling outer staircase, conjures up the classic 1951 film, as
does Thomas J. Munn's film noir-ish lighting.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderfully strong cast, the weakest link, unfortunately,
is Renee Fleming's Blanche. She attacks this grueling role with
commitment and insight, and she is capable of arresting bursts of
lyrical splendor. But her light soprano tends to fade out at
untoward moments, and her dramatic characterization is similarly
flickery _ now sharply focused, now vague and impassive.
</P>
<P>
   As Stanley, Rodney Gilfry embodies the part decisively _ he
looks phenomenally good with his shirt off (take that, Samuel
Ramey!), and he can sing and chew gum at the same time. He makes
the role's barking, petulant outbursts sound so musical, in fact,
that it's a shame Previn and Littell couldn't find an occasion for
him to stretch out into some kind of lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   But the most exciting performances came in the secondary roles,
particularly soprano Elizabeth Futral's magnificent company debut
as Stella. This is a singer who has it all _ a bright, superbly
beautiful tone, flawless technical control, dramatic intelligence
and sheer sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Dean Griffey brought a sweet, limpid tenor to the part
of Mitch, bringing out the character's touching blend of insecurity
and moralism. Josepha Gayer sang the Mexican Woman with dark gusto,
and Jeffrey Lentz made an alluring company debut as the young
paperboy. Previn's conducting was a little stiff but forceful.
</P>
<P>
   Could this project have turned out otherwise? It's impossible to
say. An opera based on ``Streetcar'' has been a cherished dream of
general director Lotfi Mansouri for some 20 years now, and I at
least have never understood why.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of evidence from nearly four centuries of opera,
after all, makes it perfectly clear that the greatest plays are
(set ital)not(end ital) the ones that become great operas. They're
too strong, and they simply overpower all but the mightiest
composers. On one side of the ledger in this argument is Verdi's
``Otello''; on the other side, everything else.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Streetcar'' calls to mind, in fact, is not so much
``Otello'' as Ambroise Thomas' ``Hamlet,'' in which the famous
soliloquy frightened the composer so much that he scarcely did
anything with it at all. Previn seems to have been similarly cowed
in the face of Williams' genius. Like Thomas, he was probably right
to be.

 &HT;    Murder probe forces man into spotlight
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg and Monika Gonzalez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLE GLADE, Fla. _ Jose Antonio Alvarez has become a reluctant
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Cuban immigrant, just four years in America, is
part of a murder investigation stretching from upper-crust
Manhattan to a neighborhood flush against the sugar fields of
western Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   New York police are convinced the itinerant handyman,
construction worker, fast-food worker and truck driver played no
role in the disappearance and feared murder of socialite Irene
Silverman. But that hasn't stopped New York and Florida reporters
from calling him or descending on the two mobile homes at the
Alvarez family lot.
</P>
<P>
   The family isn't handling its renown well: Jose Alvarez
terminated a fleeting interview by chasing two reporters and a
photographer away from his Belle Glade home with a camping hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   Blame a family named Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working for them and that was the extent of the whole
thing,'' New York police Detective Dan Rodriguez said. ``The guy's
a victim. They used him like they use a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes, 61, and her son, Kenneth Kimes Jr., 23, are in
jail. ``All information we're gathering right now is pointing'' to
the idea that the pair murdered Silverman, an 82-year-old heiress
and former Radio City Music Hall ballerina who rented them a
$6,000-a-month apartment in her upper East Side mansion, Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   When New York police picked up the Kimeses, they found a gym bag
stuffed with items belonging to Silverman as well as a deed giving
the Kimeses her $4 million mansion for $390,000.
</P>
<P>
   But police haven't found Silverman _ and that's why they went
looking for Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   When they saw him on a mansion security videotape, they tracked
him to Florida _ they won't say how _ and flew down to talk to him.
And when he said Kenneth Kimes had told him a New Jersey field
``would be a good place to bury something,'' New York police
assaulted the field with Weed Whackers,TM lawnmowers and other
garden tools in search of Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Kimeses are charged with wrangling a credit card in
the name of Palm Beach lawyer Max Schorr (``They knew all about me
_ my date of birth, my mother's name,'' Schorr said last week) and
buying a $14,000 Lincoln with a bum check.
</P>
<P>
   Manalapan police also believe they bought an $84,000 motor home
with two rubber checks they handed over May 30 in the lobby of the
Ritz-Carlton. The dealer's representative believes Alvarez may have
been the third person he saw in the lobby, Manalapan detective Tom
Clark said. He said Alvarez may have been only an unwitting puppet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess, just from the way the whole scenario went down, is
he was more of a `go-fer' kind of guy,'' Clark said. But he said he
wants to talk to Alvarez before making sure.
</P>
<P>
   Police have described Sante Kimes as a vicious woman who,
despite inheriting millions when her ex-husband died in 1994,
conned and stole from friends, business associates, insurance
companies and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Silverman case, the Kimeses are also suspected of
foul play in the cases of a Los Angeles businessman shot in the
head, a lawyer for the Kimeses who disappeared with them on a trip
to Costa Rica, and an Arab banker who vanished just after meeting
Sante Kimes in the Bahamas. They were even briefly suspected in the
disappearance of Palm Beach furniture heiress Jacqueline Levitz
from her Mississippi home.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses recruited Alvarez in May in front of the Pollo
Tropical restaurant on Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach,
where he had worked for only a month, Rodriguez said. He said the
Kimeses hired Alvarez as a handyman at the villa they were renting
in the Palm Beach Polo Club in Wellington, then took him with them
in June to New York. Police either don't know or won't discuss what
else the trio did in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has told police he left the Kimeses June 23, long before
Silverman disappeared. New York detective Rodriguez said Alvarez
found himself stranded in Manhattan but was able to cash his last
Pollo Tropical paycheck for bus fare home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated me fine, but they were kind of strange, so I
left,'' Alvarez told a New York television station.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Manalapan detectives still want to talk to Alvarez. But
New York police say they're done with him _ and still looking for
Irene Silverman.
</P>

Post, West Palm Beach, Fla. Researcher Lynne Palombo contributed to
this report, which was supplemented by Palm Beach Post archives and
wire services.

 &HT;    Treasure salvors win battle, bring coins back to U.S.
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ A fortune in silver from a 17th century
shipwreck is headed to Florida, its journey delayed for more than a
year while treasure salvors battled with Ecuador's government over
the booty of coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad it's over, and we are happy the split was finally
honored,'' said Rob McClung of West Palm Beach, the expedition
leader who recovered nearly 6,000 coins from the shipwreck in early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador will keep half of the coins. The other half is being
transported to a Central Florida lab for cleaning and inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The coins are from the Spanish galleon La Capitana, which sank
off the Ecuador coast in 1654 when the pilot made a navigation
error and ran the 130-foot ship aground. Most of the 216 treasure
chests aboard were salvaged, but McClung found thousands of coins
buried beneath the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The coins had been stored since May 1997 in the Central Bank of
Ecuador in Quayaquil. They were kept there as the salvors fended
off claims from rivals that coins were being smuggled out of
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The government exonerated the salvors and granted the expedition
company its 50 percent share on Sept. 9, said German Moro of
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Moro's Sudamerica Discovery Inc. held the permit for the salvage
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a year-and-a-half of hardball legal maneuvering to
force the government to do the split,'' said Moro.
</P>
<P>
   The salvors stopped digging in April and filed a $25 million
lawsuit against government officials to force a division of the
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Moro said representatives from the Ecuadorean finance, education
and defense spent five minutes examining the two piles of coins and
chose the one topped with a gold cross and a pair of chart
dividers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be the instrument the pilot used when he
made his mistake,'' Moro said.
</P>
<P>
   The salvor's half, which Moro estimates has a value of more than
$1 million, will be divided among investors in Ecuador and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   McClung's Oceanic International Corp. has a 5 percent share of
the treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone will get rich, but there will be enough
to make a nice return for the investors,'' Moro said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the coins, McClung's divers brought up silver bars,
bronze cannon balls, candelabra and dinnerware from the treasure
galleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's never been the treasure since I was not getting
the lion's share of it'' McClung said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his reward was finding the ship and the vindication of
allegations from rival treasure hunters that he plundered the
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing comes easily, but not everything should be that
hard,'' he said Friday from his home in Lake Clarke Shores.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, McClung vowed never to return to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said he's thinking of returning because Moro's group was
issued a new permit by the government to continue digging at the
site.

SOSA DRAWS THE COLLAR AS CUBS SLIP BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As Sammy Sosa goes, so go the Cubs, and Sunday Sosa
failed for the fourth straight game to hit a home run, going 0 for
5 in a 7-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on a day dedicated to
celebrating his season.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a sunny, festive afternoon quickly turned into a
dreary evening for the Cubs at Wrigley Field. After a 64-minute
rain delay, Bret Boone, the Reds' second baseman, drove in six runs
on three home runs, the last of which the umpires in the crowd
believed to be a foul ball. The Cubs fell a game behind the Mets in
the race for the wild-card spot in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sosa fell two behind the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark
McGwire for the season home run lead. McGwire hit his 65th home run
in an 11-6 victory at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game celebration here included presentations of a
trophy, a painting and a new car to Sosa. Before appearances by
Commissioner Bud Selig, Juan Marichal, and the Cub legend Ernie
Banks, the emcee, Chip Caray, read a note of congratulations sent
by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Congratulations on your special day at Wrigley Field.
We have shared an exciting and historic season that will be
remembered for years to come. You have handled yourself with class
and dignity and are to be commended for a fantastic 1998 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa addressed the sold-out crowd of 40,117, thanking the fans,
and then concluded with a celebratory lap around the field before
being swarmed by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the run around the field because I just want to show the
fans how much I love them,'' Sosa said after the Cubs' last
regular-season home game.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said the intense news media pressure over the last few
weeks was not affecting him, but he conceded that increased
attention this weekend from friends and fans from the Dominican
Republic, his home country, may have caused him to swing for the
fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably trying to do too much,'' he said. ``But they
also pitched me really well.''
</P>
<P>
   In sweeping the three-game series, Reds pitchers held Sosa to 0
for 13. Sosa struck out twice Sunday, popped up to first base and
second base, and reached on an error by third baseman Aaron Boone
in the third inning. The Cubs were swept in a three-game series at
home for only the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   On the day post-season tickets went on sale, a rarity in
Chicago, the Mets defeated Florida, 5-0. Both the Mets and the Cubs
have five games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the two innings after the rain delay, the Cubs' starter,
Kevin Tapani, who was shooting for his 20th victory of the season,
gave up five runs, including two of the Boone home runs. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one dons black tie for the annual Inkslinger's
Ball. That would be in bad taste. A tux would cover up too much
skin.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, many of the best-dressed men carry their shirts
under their arms as they snake through the crowd, and many of the
women wear backless tops.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is one of the United States' biggest conventions of
tattoo artists, also known as ink slingers. And for the last seven
years, ink slingers from around the world, most from the West
Coast, have gathered in Hollywood for three days of tattoo
contests, tattoo tips and tattooing.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the last day of this year's ball, and one of the
promoters, Fred Saunders, estimated that more than 9,000 people
paid $15 each to get in, once they were patted down by security
guards at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   One man who never has to pay is Jack Armstrong, a baldheaded,
white-bearded legend who has been giving and receiving tattoos for
70 of his 79 years. Wherever ink slingers gather, Armstrong's name
is spoken with respect and awe. ``I've been doing it longer than
anyone in the history of tattooing,'' he said. ``I have ink running
through my veins.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not hard to believe. Armstrong was born in Seattle in
the back of his mother's tattoo parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She birthed me herself,'' he said. ``She was tattooing a
sailor who was getting his whole body done when right in the middle
she said, `Well Gus, I'm going to have to take a break.' She went
into the room in the back, birthed me and then got up and finished
the tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong received his first tattoo when he was 7. He did it
himself and ``got a beating I can still feel.'' When he was 9,
after stealing ink and needles from his mother, he set out on his
own, crisscrossing the country by bicycle, pulling a little red
wagon and inking tattoos for a nickel. He got a lot of business
outside bars around closing time.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, he settled in Portland, Ore., and opened a parlor, Jack's
House of Tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, you could go into a toilet and tattoo,''
Armstrong said. ``I used to use the same needle on 50 people. You
can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Armstrong lives in Las Vegas and does not do much
tattooing anymore. But he still loves to get tattoos. Four years
ago, two renowned tattoo artists at a convention in Memphis, Tenn.,
each inked a skull in one of Armstrong's ears, just above his
hearing aids. ``They did it right on stage,'' said Armstrong, who
gets around in a motorized chair, a cane across his lap. ``The
whole convention stopped for 30 minutes while Jack Armstrong got
skulls in his ears.''
</P>
<P>
   After telling that story, Armstrong hoisted himself up out of
his chair and hooked his cane over his wrist. ``Are you ready for
this?'' he asked, pulling off his shirt and turning his back to
reveal a huge tattoo of Jesus, two dozen past presidents of the
Mormon Church and himself, looking like Santa Claus in a baseball
cap. ``I'm religious,'' Armstrong said. ``I'm a Mormon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the youngest artists at the convention were 17-year-old
twin sisters La-c and Amber Greenwood of Tyler, Texas Like
Armstrong they began tattooing because their family owned a parlor.
They started slinging ink when they were 13. ``This is how we're
going to send ourselves to college,'' La-c said.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the Greenwood sisters' booth, one of 107 at the
convention, Victor Popkow was showing a videotape of the latest
laser technique for removing tattoos. His brother, who is a doctor,
performs the procedure at a clinic in West Los Angeles. ``We aren't
anti-tattoo,'' Popkow said. ``This is our third year here, and we
just want to give people an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a lot of people with homemade tattoos that they've
regretted for years want them removed or lightened enough so that
professional ones can be inked in their place. After every
convention, calls at the clinic increase significantly, Popkow
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the convention the hum of tattoo needles is constant as
people get old tattoos freshened or new ones added at booths such
as Tattoo Mania, Psycho City and Freakshow Tattoo, where Mike
Ferguson, 26, was working on John Zimmerman's already heavily
tattooed right arm. ``The arms don't hurt so much,'' Zimmerman, 29,
said. ``But getting the back done hurts, and the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost covering his back was a family of tattooed skulls, which
has caused him a few problems. Zimmerman is a custodian at a public
school in Simi Valley. He and Ferguson said other people often look
down on people who have tattoos. ``Let me put it to you this way,''
Zimmerman said. ``It took me six years to become a custodian.''
</P>
<P>
   James Grande, 28, a telephone installer in New York, said he had
not had any trouble because of tattoos. He came to Los Angeles to
visit relatives and to attend the Inkslingers Ball.
</P>
<P>
   He planned on entering the best color tattoo contest for a green
and yellow pagan god on his left arm. On his chest was a tattoo of
a fairy named Buttercup in honor of his daughter Heather, 5, and a
fairy named Forget Me Not for his other daughter, Amira, 9. He also
had a tattoo of a paw print for his cat, Dirty Frank. ``It's a fun
form of self-expression,'' Grande said. ``I'm relatively new to the
scene but I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as his T-shirt said, ``I Ink Therefore I Am.''

AMERICANS DIG DEEP, AND SOLHEIM CUP STAYS PUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Disappointed in their performance, desperate for
points and angry at Dottie Pepper, Europe's players had ample
motivation for Sunday's final round of the Solheim Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Europe mounted a comeback. But when the day
ended, Pepper was still unbeaten, Europe was still disappointed and
the United States still had the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Ending an emotional weekend that featured great golf as well as
some episodes that should only increase the intensity of this
biennial rivalry, the United States retained the cup with a 16-12
victory at Muirfield Village Golf Club. Sherri Steinhauer won the
match that gave the United States the 14 points it needed to retain
the cup, making a birdie on the 15th hole to insure that she would
at least tie her match. She then made a 6-foot birdie putt at the
par-4 No. 16 to defeat Catriona Matthew, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   When Steinhauer's putt fell at No. 16, she was mobbed by
teammates, many of them emotionally spent after three days of
pressure golf. The United States took a 10 1/2-5 1/2 lead into
Sunday's final 12 singles matches, but Europe stormed back, winning
the first four matches. But Pepper, Kelly Robbins and Rosie Jones
delivered key victories, putting Steinhauer in position for the
clincher. The fierce competition ended with Meg Mallon of the
United States conceding the final hole to Sophie Gustafson after
both players hit approach shots to the 18th green, ending their
match in a tie.
</P>
<P>
   For another two years, the United States will retain the cup.
And for another two years, until the sixth Solheim Cup is played in
Europe in 2000, the United States can savor a victory that did not
come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fearful all day that this thing could turn wrong,'' said
Judy Rankin, the American captain, who also captained the winning
1996 team. ``You can just never relax. But this has been a
magnificent experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said: ``I think from one to 12, we're better players. But
I also think we dug deep. Every time it looked like we might be
outplayed, we dug deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper was the only player to finish with a perfect record
(4-0), a brilliant performance that only added to her reputation as
an intimidating match play golfer. Changing the momentum after
Laura Davies, Helen Alfredsson, Annika Sorenstam and Liselotte
Neumann scored early victories Sunday for Europe, Pepper defeated
Trish Johnson, 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper had become a lightning rod for controversy on Saturday
morning, after some European players took offense at her actions.
An intense foursome match featuring Pepper and Juli Inkster against
Alfredsson and Marie Laure de Lorenzi came down to the 18th hole
with the score tied. Inkster hit a crucial 45-foot putt for birdie
that stopped 2 feet short of the hole, and Europe conceded the putt
for par with de Lorenzi still facing a difficult chip shot. At that
point, Pepper picked up her ball and hugged Inkster, knowing they
had probably secured at least a half-point. Then de Lorenzi's chip
rolled 15 feet past the hole and Alfredsson missed her putt for
par, giving Inkster and Pepper a dramatic victory. Pepper waved her
arms to the gallery, urging them to cheer louder.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pepper did not wave her arms to the crowd until the
match was over, several Europeans were angered. ``That was
unprofessional, unnecessary, and it spurred us on,'' Davies said.
``It was a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the European players' anger, Pepper was undaunted.
``I took it as a compliment,'' said Pepper, who raised her Solheim
Cup record to 12-4-1. ``If they had to come up with somebody they
needed to rally around, I'm glad it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had crossed the line of sportsmanship, Pepper said:
``Not once. Emotion is part of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Europe's players felt that their desperate situation,
trailing by 5 points going into the final day, was more inspiring
than Pepper. ``They were killing us,'' said Neumann, who defeated
Brandie Burton on Sunday, 1 up. ``I think everybody had had it. We
said, `Let's go out and play some golf. This is ridiculous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Dottie, she's always been intense, so why should she
change? And she can bring excitement to her team. More power to
her. I think we need to do the same, get fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   By earning seven points Sunday, Europe earned respect and
possibly ended any chance that the Solheim Cup will be changed to a
different format, such as North America against the World.

   CHIPLEY, Fla. _ Wade Jackson, a farmer near this Panhandle city,
remembers traveling to Punta Gorda in the southwestern part of the
state some 15 years ago to visit a nephew. That was as far south as
he has ever gone in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never had the desire to visit,'' Jackson said of South
Florida, which he has heard is crowded (``You have to live jammed
up'') and full of both immigrants from the North (``the Yankees'')
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 62, is a native Floridian, but his Florida is not the
one of urban sprawl and sun-and-fun tourist spots that most people
know. It is the other Florida, the one that grows peanuts, cotton
and timber and calls itself ``lower Alabama,'' the one of family
generations, Democratic tradition and black-and-white demographics
and the one that holds the votes that can swing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts call it the ``cracker vote,'' that of rural
whites in the Panhandle and central parts of the state who are
registered Democrats out of loyalty but have no trouble voting
Republican out of belief. And in a year when Republicans need
crossover voters to solidify their power in state government with
the governorship, the November election highlights not only the
importance of this ``other Florida'' but the diversity of a state
where campaigns must play as well with Southerners as with
transplanted Yankees, in the Bible Belt as in concrete canyons and
in cracker as in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think Florida is a Southern state, but it was the
third state to secede from the union,'' said Lance deHaven-Smith,
associate director of the Florida Institute of Government at
Florida State University in Tallahassee and co-author of the
institute's ``Almanac of Florida Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1920s it led the nation in the number of lynchings per
year,'' deHaven-Smith said. ``Until the 1950s, very few people
lived south of Orlando.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, areas like Washington County, just below the Alabama
border, and South Florida counties like Miami-Dade, at the tip of
the Florida peninsula, offer one of the starkest contrasts found in
a state that doubled its population, to 14.7 million from 6.8
million, in the last quarter-century. With most of that growth
concentrated in the southern half of the state, Miami-Dade County
has bulged into the largest county in Florida with two million
residents, nearly half of them foreign-born and 56 percent of
Hispanic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of Washington County's 20,000 residents, by
contrast, are Florida natives, 83 percent white and 15 percent
black. About a quarter of the county's population lives in Chipley.
</P>
<P>
   Washington County is the kind of place where the word redneck is
not derogatory, and where one of the landmarks is a monument along
Highway 77 to the possum, ``an important aid to human survival in
times of distress and critical need'' and the subject of a festival
and parade every August. Here, they root not for the Florida
Marlins or the Miami Dolphins but for closer teams, the Atlanta
Braves and New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   While Miami suffers the ills of big population centers _
corruption, drug trafficking and ethnic conflict _ Washington
County's worst law-enforcement problem is domestic violence. The
sale of liquor and beer is prohibited in the county, where churches
wield strong influence and where voters hold public officials to
high moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Peel, 51, who had been sheriff for 16 years, found this out
in 1992, when he was voted out of office after he divorced his
wife. In 1996, after he married someone else, voters reinstated
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a religious issue for a lot of people,'' Peel said
of divorce. ``Voters here are very intolerant of anything
associated with character flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Corbus, 33, moved here from St. Petersburg five years ago
to escape what she said was increasing development and congestion.
``In Florida, you have to go north to be in the Deep South,'' Ms.
Corbus said.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, ``sometimes it seems like we're kind of out here by
ourselves,'' Ms. Corbus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems anything west of Tallahassee is like it's not part of
Florida,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling of isolation is bolstered by the diminishing power
of areas like the Panhandle as other regions of the state
experienced explosive growth. Washington County has one state
representative and one state senator. Miami-Dade County alone has
20 state representatives and seven state senators.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Panhandle residents say, sometimes they are
subjected to laws, from management of growth to gun control, that
make more sense in the south than in the north of Florida. And the
region, they complain, is often shortchanged when money is doled
out by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a liberal-conservative rift that while tenuous _
conservatives dominate among both Democrats and Republicans in the
state Legislature _ surfaces every now and then. For instance, a
Democratic senator representing several counties near the Georgia
border blamed ``South Florida Jewish senators who do not believe in
Jesus'' for defeating a 1994 school prayer bill.
</P>
<P>
   Broward and Palm Beach counties, north of Miami and the second
and third most populous areas in the state with more than one
million residents each, are the state's liberal Democratic
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   But demographers say the population movement has been shifting
to the north over the last decade, and areas like Washington County
are growing with refugees from South and Central Florida looking
for more room and a more relaxed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But growth is not universally welcomed here. Many residents fear
harm to what they regard as the area's pluses _ low crime rates,
good schools, plentiful and reasonably priced land, friendly people
_ and also worry about new demands on services and public works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our small-town flavor,'' said Jan Morris, editor of
The Washington County News. ``We're experiencing a massive influx
from South Florida right now. The problem is they come here but
they want infrastructure, like paved roads. They locate here and
suddenly they want all the amenities.''

</P>
<P>
   While small as a percentage of the electorate, cracker voters
are crucial in statewide and national elections in which
Republicans and liberal Democrats balance each other out, said
deHaven-Smith. What determines the outcome in these elections, he
said, is the bloc of conservative Democrats that sometimes votes
Republican and sometimes Democratic, depending on factors like
familiarity with the candidate and conservative views on issues
like taxes and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat who is a native of Central
Florida, understood the need to appeal to rural whites when, in the
last televised debate before the 1994 election, he warned his
Republican opponent, Jeb Bush, ``The old he-coon walks just before
the light of day.'' The cracker saying was crystal clear here but
indecipherable to Bush, who moved to Miami in 1980, as well as to
thousands watching the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The Miami Herald had to run articles explaining
what he had meant, quoting in one a Hispanic man who said he had
learned ``how people feel when we speak Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   He-coon, it turned out, means the smart raccoon that waits until
just before dawn to come out of hiding, when hunting dogs have
tired of chasing younger, less-smart raccoons. ``He-coon was a
cracker saying I knew crackers would identify with,'' Chiles, 68,
said in a recent interview. He won re-election by about 64,000
votes out of 4.2 million votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush again running for governor, the Democratic contender,
Lt. Gov. Kenneth MacKay, may need more than cracker sayings. While
Democrats lead Republicans in registered voters in Florida, 45
percent to 40 percent, Republican gains reached a watershed in 1996
when voters installed a Republican majority in the state
Legislature for the first time this century.
</P>
<P>
   Around North Florida, the ability to vote in the Democratic
primary in races like sheriff and county commissioner keeps many
from switching party registration. But already Republicans have
taken over local posts in some counties. Chiles and other Democrats
blame an influx of Republicans into the state and redistricting for
their party's losses, but in the Panhandle, Republicans who are
former Democrats say the party has lost its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're against prayer in school and for abortion, it's
clear-cut,'' Durell Peaden Jr., a doctor who represents four
Panhandle counties in the state House of Representatives, said to
explain why he switched to the Republican side last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't change and leave the party,'' Peaden said. ``The
party changed and left us. The Democratic Party became a lot more
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a Democratic majority among registered voters in
Washington County, Bush carried the county over Chiles in the last
election and many voters remain firmly behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here by and large all hold down jobs and are
entrepreneurial,'' said Allen Clark, 41, an insurance and real
estate businessman who is among the Democrats here who support
Bush. ``Jeb Bush is a big entrepreneurial person. People don't want
a handout, just opportunity, and that's more Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Jackson, the farmer, plan to vote for MacKay out
of tradition, but Jackson said he would not be distressed if Bush
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics don't worry me,'' Jackson said. ``You can put a
Democrat and a Republican in a burlap bag and shake them up and
they'd fall out at the same time. There's no difference.''

   TV NETWORKS ARE HEADING FOR TOUGHEST FALL FIGHT YET
</P>
<P>
   The new fall television season officially opens Monday night,
and executives of the six broadcast networks are expecting their
bloodiest battle yet for ratings as they squeeze 36 new shows into
an already crowded prime time. Indeed, there is a sense of
desperation in the industry, because the risks are so great and the
stakes so high.
</P>
<P>
   That desperation is reflected in deals like the $13 million an
episode that NBC will pay for ``ER,'' TV's biggest hit. And the
networks are anxiously shuffling their schedules to seek an edge on
specific nights; Fox, for example, is moving its animated series
``King of the Hill'' to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SURFING VS. CHANNEL SURFING
</P>
<P>
   Are Web surfers spending less time watching television? Several
surveys have said yes. But a new survey for the Discovery Channel
indicates that even though teen-agers watch less television as
households begin to use the Internet, everyone else watches more.
</P>
<P>
   A WATERGATE SOURCE UNMASKED?
</P>
<P>
   The man known as Deep Throat is credited with being the source
of explosive articles written by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as
they unraveled the Nixon administration's abuses of power. Now, a
new book contends that Deep Throat was not just one man, but a
composite and a plot device in the book and the film version of
``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   CHASING THE ONLINE MUSIC MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Lured by an online music market that the research firm Jupiter
Communications predicts will reach $2.8 billion a year by 2002, the
record industry has struggled with finding a way to use Internet
technologies to realize better margins. But like everything on the
Internet, there is no road map to profits from online music.
</P>
<P>
   BEARS UNNERVE SOME ENTREPRENEURS
</P>
<P>
   For entrepreneurs, going public is the ultimate payoff for their
work. Many founders of start-ups set their sights on taking their
companies public before they even file their incorporation papers.
But the turmoil in the stock market and fears of a bear market have
created a quandary for new-media entrepreneurs and others: should
they try to sell stock now or wait?
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS OPPOSE YEAR 2000 PLAN
</P>
<P>
   A compromise effort by Congress and the Clinton administration
to promote candid information about Year 2000 problems in the
nation's computers is being assailed by trial lawyers because a
cornerstone of the plan would grant computer and chip makers
immunity from liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   MULTICULTURAL MARKETING EXPANDS
</P>
<P>
   rue North Communications, the giant ad agency company, is
stepping up its efforts in multicultural marketing, forming a unit
devoted to encouraging advertisers to keep pace with the changing
face of consumers by increasing sales pitches aimed at ethnic
groups.

<P>
   STEAMY REPORT FOR A STAID PUBLISHER
</P>
<P>
   The literature of choice at the year-old Public Affairs
publishing house is intelligent and reflective _ serious nonfiction
that would normally not be a best seller. But the leading title on
its debut list this fall is a steamy one, otherwise known as ``The
Starr Report.''

GALAXY SHUT OUT BY SAN JOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ This isn't how the Los Angeles Galaxy wanted
to get ready for the playoffs _ unable to find the net against what
was, until Sunday, Major League Soccer's worst club.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Galaxy stands just 10 days before its
postseason opener, its storied attack shut out for the second time
in five days by the lowly San Jose Clash, this one a meaningless
1-0 defeat played out before 11,123 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Think the Galaxy is concerned?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' replied defender Robin Fraser. ``This team?
No chance. I'm not concerned at all. We've got more guns than any
team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   That they do, with an MLS-record 84 goals through its first 29
matches and at least two players, Cobi Jones and Welton, battling
for the scoring title. But with the Clash willing to defend with
numbers _ a tactic the Galaxy (23-8, 65 points) can expect from
Dallas in the first-round series beginning Oct. 1 _ L.A. could
create only so many decent opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And so it's been 182 minutes since the team has scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally and tactically we were not disciplined,'' Galaxy
coach Octavio Zambrano said. ``That's certainly a reason to be
concerned. I expect more. I expect more discipline in those two
aspects; they are crucial to aspire to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Galaxy's goal, and neither Wednesday's 1-0 shootout
win in San Jose nor Sunday's loss had any impact on its chances.
But if L.A. can't finish in a couple of weeks, its quest will end
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had its chances Sunday, the two best by Jones and
Welton in a three-minute span late in the first half. Jones, who
trails Columbus' Stern John by a point in the MLS scoring race, hit
the underside of the crossbar in the 36th minute, and Welton
whiffed on a nifty feed from Mauricio Cienfuegos in the 39th.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Ronald Cerritos netted the Clash's goal,
curling a 21-yard free kick over a three-man wall and inside the
near post. Goalkeeper Matt Reis, getting a start in place of Kevin
Hartman, got a late jump on the ball. He said he looked away for a
split second just as Cerritos hit it and couldn't make the stop
despite getting his fingertips on it.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose (12-19, 30) managed little else against the Galaxy
defense, but after midfielder Clint Mathis was ejected for a
retaliatory kick at Martin Vasquez in the 66th minute, L.A.
couldn't do much, either.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Jones from adding to his scoring total, although he
nearly bagged an assist after setting up Cienfuegos with five
minutes to go; the shot ripped into Clash defender Eddie Lewis and
bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the scoring crown would only mean so much, Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the last couple years, Roy Lassiter and Preki
won the scoring titles,'' said Jones, who was hobbling after
hitting knees with Vicente Figueroa in the 78th minute. ``But what
everybody remembers most is that D.C. United won the championship
both years.... That's the most important thing.''

NEVADA COMMISSION MADE RIGHT DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission made the appropriate
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson agreed at a hearing on Saturday to be evaluated by a
psychiatrist whom he doesn't know and return with the findings on
Oct 3. If that doctor says he's stable, then his chances of
regaining his license to box in that state look good.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's no way to know how he'll react if he's faced with
another stressful situation in the ring. However, a green light by
a qualified, independent therapist not being paid by Tyson is about
as close as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   And the fighter repeatedly has shown great remorse after biting
off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear last year, and he seems to
understand the damage _ to both himself and others _ he has caused.
</P>
<P>
   An incident last month in a Washington D.C. suburb in which
Tyson was accused of punching one man and kicking another is a
legitimate concern and ultimately could kill his chances of
regaining his license.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, if he is guilty of committing these violent acts it
demonstrates that he still cannot control his temper and has no
business in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   However, the commissioners are in a tough position.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson must be presumed innocent until he's proven guilty even
though no one will be surprised if it turns out Tyson !ital!did
commit these acts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there appears to be a way out: The commission
can simply revoke his license again if he's convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the case might not be resolved before
his return to the ring, which could come as early as November.
Thus, there's a chance he might fight and then be convicted of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Given the circumstances, it's a reasonable risk, one which the
commissioners are likely to take if Tyson receives a positive
mental evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Magic touch?: Former Lakers star Magic Johnson was at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   He has applied for his promoter's license in Nevada _ he already
has one in California _ and hopes to promote Tyson's fights when
and if he comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Also present on Saturday was Dan Goossen of America Presents,
who also hopes to play a role in Tyson's career.
</P>
<P>
   Sad day: Julio Cesar Chavez can be excused for quitting against
Oscar De La Hoya on Friday, although even that is difficult to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken scores of punches from one of the best fighters in
the world Friday night in Las Vegas, he was bleeding from a deep
cut in his mouth and, at 36, he was dead tired.
</P>
<P>
   Some fighters, fighters with bigger hearts, would've kept
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Ring doctor Flip Homansky looked at the cut and said Chavez
could continue. That he didn't was disappointing, but it can be
defended. Perhaps, he simply had nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   The fact he lied about it _ saying his cornermen stopped the
bout _ cannot be excused.
</P>
<P>
   He can be seen in replays shaking his head as he sat on his
stool after the eighth round, which seems to indicate that he had
had enough. And De La Hoya said afterward that Chavez told him as
much.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the post-fight news conference, he denied it was his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, really: There's a precedent. He also quit when
he was cut on the forehead in the second Frankie Randall fight, in
1994, even though the ring doctor said he could go on.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will go down in history as one of the sport's great
champions. The fact he doesn't behave like one is disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   A real champ: De La Hoya didn't beat a surprisingly tough Chavez
as easily as almost everyone expected. However, it was a great
night in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Had he stayed on the outside, he could've won every round. But
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He risked a great deal _ his perfect record and perhaps a lot of
money, to be specific _ by fighting Chavez's fight simply to make a
point. He said he was trying to give his fans a good fight.
</P>
<P>
   He should be commended for his uncommon courage.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, De La Hoya became a great champion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Gabriel Ruelas and James Leija have agreed to
fight Oct. 24 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, who grew up in Arleta, easily outpointed Leija to win
the WBC super featherweight championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more confident because of the way I beat him the last
time,'' Ruelas said. ``It's nowhere near to say, `Oh man, I beat
him. All I have to do is train and I'll beat him again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to train real hard for this fight. We're both a lot
more experienced now.''...
</P>
<P>
   Two other L.A.-area fighters are in action soon.
</P>
<P>
   IBF lightweight champ Shane Mosley of Pomona defends his title
against Eduardo Morales on Tuesday in New York on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   And on Oct. 3 at the Las Vegas Hilton, Genaro Hernandez of L.A.
defends his WBC super featherweight title against Olympian Floyd
Mayweather....
</P>
<P>
   The second almost-anonymous heavyweight title bout in two weeks
is set for Saturday, when Lennox Lewis defends his WBC heavyweight
crown against Zelijko Mavrovic in Uncasville, Conn. On paper, it's
a better matchup than Evander Holyfield's successful title defense
against Vaughn Bean on Saturday....

ORIOLES' RIPKEN ENDS STREAK AT 2,632 GAMES

 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Cal Ripken, the Baltimore Orioles third baseman who
had not missed a game since 1982, removed himself from the starting
lineup here Sunday night after playing in 2,632 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, 38, walked into the office of Orioles manager Ray Miller
about half an hour before Sunday night's game and said, ``I think
the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   His staggering feat of endurance is credited with helping major
league baseball regain the loyalty of its fans three summers ago,
when he broke Lou Gehrig's longstanding record of 2,130 consecutive
games played. While it was possible that Ripken would enter later
in the game, it appeared likely that his own streak would end
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The late change in the Orioles' lineup was not reflected until
just minutes before the start of the game. When the name of Ryan
Minor was inserted in Ripken's place at third base on the
scoreboard, only a few fans at Camden Yards reacted, pointing at
the change.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Baltimore starters ran onto the field to begin
the game with the Yankees, Ripken wrestled playfully with a
teammate in the Orioles' dugout. When Minor jogged to Ripken's
position, fans still did not seem sure of what was taking place.
But after New York's Chuck Knoblauch, the game's first batter,
grounded out to shortstop, the entire Yankees team emerged from the
visiting dugout and tipped their caps across the field, to Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles fans, who stood and cheered Ripken for more than 22
minutes when he broke Gehrig's record on Sept. 6, 1995, stood at
8:11 p.m. to salute him once again.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken burst from the Orioles' dugout, playfully waving for the
fans to sit, but they would not stop cheering and the Yankees would
not stop clapping. Ripken returned to the Orioles' dugout and the
standing ovation continued. Derek Jeter, on deck, stood out of the
batter's box, and the Orioles' pitcher, Doug Johns, waited, having
no intention of interfering with the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken emerged once again, raising both hands, intermittently
turning to face all corners of Camden Yards and acknowledging the
three minutes of cheers before motioning to Johns to throw his next
pitch. Johns obliged him, and for the first time since May 29,
1982, an Orioles' game was being played without Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ripken tied and broke Gehrig's record, baseball was
coming back from labor strife that had led to the cancellation of
the 1994 World Series. The national respect and adulation for
Ripken at that time was seen as extremely important to the recovery
of baseball; the celebration of the game on the nights of Sept. 5
and Sept. 6 was comparable to how the country has reacted this
summer to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa as they broke Roger Maris'
single-season record for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's production has gradually diminished as he has aged,
though the Orioles' coaching staff values him because of his
intensity and his reliability. Ripken, the Orioles' shortstop since
the first year of the streak, was moved to third base permanently
after the 1996 season, and in 1997, Ripken suffered a lower back
problem so painful that he said he nearly walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   There had been growing sentiment within the Baltimore
organization since 1995 that Ripken's streak should be ended, that
he would benefit from additional rest and that other players would
be helped by getting additional playing time in his place. Ripken
had said all along that the decision to end his consecutive-game
streak lay solely in the hands of his manager, but each manager
disagreed, understanding the magnitude of Ripken's accomplishment
and its significance in the history of the sport. Davey Johnson,
Ripken's manager in 1995 and 1996, once said that only God or
Ripken himself could end the streak.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Orioles officials had discussed the possibility of ending
Ripken's streak this summer. One executive had said in May that the
streak could end by July, and for several years club executives
have felt that Ripken's autonomy _ a status created by the streak _
was damaging to the spirit of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Otanez, a third baseman who hit 30 home runs for Class
AAA Rochester this season, was called up last month, and because of
Ripken's streak, Otanez played out of position, in right field, and
broke his wrist awkwardly attempting a diving catch. Ripken
continued to play, with his run production the worst among American
League third basemen, and criticism of the streak had grown.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Maroon, the club's spokesman, Ripken and
Miller had privately discussed the possibility of ending the streak
for several weeks. Ripken felt the timing was right: The Orioles
played their final home game here Sunday night; the club is on the
verge of elimination from the playoff race, and the team has
several young infielders available who are seen as part of the
team's future, including Minor, who will go down in history as the
man who replaced a legend.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes before Sunday night's game, Maroon received an
urgent call from Miller, and Maroon hustled to the manager's
office, where Ripken sat in full uniform. ``Hey, man, I'm not
starting,'' Ripken said to Maroon, his tone even.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig ended his streak in 1939, going to Yankees manager Joe
McCarthy frustrated and confused by his lack of production. Gehrig
did not know at the time that he was dying of a disease that now
takes his name.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was born and raised in Maryland, the son of an Orioles
minor league manager, seemingly fated to play for Baltimore.
Drafted by the Orioles in 1978, Ripken was 6 feet 4 inches and 220
pounds, by conventional standards too big to play shortstop. But
Earl Weaver, then the Orioles' manager, shifted Ripken from third
base to shortstop in 1982 because of his exceptional hands, his
ability to anticipate and his instinctive understanding of the
game. Ripken won the American League most valuable player award in
1983 and again in 1991, and he holds numerous offensive and
defensive records for shortstops.

NO STOPPING OLERUD AS METS GRAB THE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photos of John Olerud, Al Leiter and Turk Wendell are
being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036. 
(lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What John Olerud is going through right now is, as he
put it, ``kind of like the chicken and the egg thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The question could have come from straight from Clint Eastwood.
``Are you hot or are you lucky?'' Olerud was asked Sunday after his
two-run home run helped the Mets to a 5-0 victory over Florida and
gave them the National League wild-card lead, where they hope to
stay for five more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say more hot,'' Olerud, who is 9 for his last 9 and
has reached base in 14 consecutive plate appearances, one short of
the NL record and two off the major-league mark. ``But definitely,
there's a lot of luck involved, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud raised his average to .354 by going 2-for-2 Sunday and
reaching base all four times he came to the plate in the victory,
which gave the Mets (88-69) a one-game lead over Chicago in the
wild-card race. The Cubs lost, 7-3, to the Cincinnati Reds and
former Met right-hander Pete Harnisch Sunday at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   With five games to go, the Mets _ who are trying to qualify for
the postseason for the first time in a decade _ have not only
matched their victory total of last season, but also have pulled 19
games over .500 for the first time since 1990. And they now have
the upper hand on the Cubs again, thanks to three Bret Boone home
runs in Chicago and eight shutout innings from Al Leiter (17-5)
before a sellout crowd of 52,767 at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's two-run third-inning home run off the Florida
right-hander Brian Meadows (10-13) provided Leiter _ who allowed
just five hits and one walk, while striking out nine _ with all the
runs he would need as he set a career high for victories with 17.
Meanwhile, by homering, doubling and walking twice, Olerud pulled
closer to Colorado's Larry Walker, the NL's leading hitter at .356.
</P>
<P>
   Just how hot is the Mets' pensive first baseman?
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, would join Ed Delahanty (1899 and 1902), at present the
only players to win batting titles in both leagues, should he
overtake Walker down the stretch. He did not make one single out in
the three-game series the Mets just completed with the Marlins. The
last pitcher to retire Olerud was the left-hander Mike Hampton in
Houston on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With two hits Sunday, Olerud has 192 on the season, second most
in club history to Lance Johnson's 227 in 1996 _ and one more than
Felix Millan's 191 in 1975. His nine consecutive hits ties the
franchise record established by Jose Vizcaino in 1996. Olerud is
one off the NL record of 10 (set nine times) and three off the
major-league mark of 12 (held by Boston's Pinky Higgins in 1938 and
Detroit's Walt Dropo in 1952).
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive of all is the company Olerud will surpass if he
reaches base safely in his next three plate appearances. Barry
Bonds established the NL record by reaching base 15 straight times
this season. Ted Williams, considered by many the greatest hitter
ever, holds the major-league record of 16, which he set in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   To his brush with greatness, Olerud reacts with a variation of
``aw, shucks.'' Luckily for the Mets, Olerud _ whom his Toronto
teammates used to jokingly call Gabby _ speaks volumes with his
bat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the moment, one would assume that the baseball looks as big
as a blimp to Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it looks bigger,'' Olerud said. ``I just
think I'm seeing it better. If anything, it seems like the ball
slows down.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why someone with 20/18 vision keeps hitting it so
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of the last time I've had a streak like this,''
said Olerud, who flirted with .400 in 1993 before winning the
American League batting title with a .363 average.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only one of Olerud's first eight full seasons in
the majors in which he hit .300 or better. This year, Olerud _ a
career .293 hitter when the season began _ is a virtual lock to hit
.300 for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's not going to get on base every time up from now
to the end of the season,'' Tom Robson, the Mets' hitting coach,
said. ``But he's got a chance. And he's been absolutely perfect
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud walked in his first at-bat against Meadows, one of
Florida's many rookies, then belted a changeup the other way for a
two-out opposite-field homer in the third after Tony Phillips had
walked.
</P>
<P>
   In this third plate appearance, Olerud doubled hard over first
base to lead off the sixth and later scored on Lenny Harris'
two-out single to right. (The slow-footed Olerud somehow beat Mark
Kotsay's online throw, sliding under Randy Knorr's tag for a 3-0
lead.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after the Mets had added a fourth run on Phillips'
run-scoring double in the seventh, Olerud drew another walk (this
time against Antonio Alfonseca) to reach base for the 14th
consecutive time, shortly before he took his 10-day-old son,
Garrett John, on his first tour of the Met clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Garrett John had never seen him hit,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He wanted to show him his best. I've never seen a
guy on base as frequently as he. He's just seeing the ball really
well and a couple of balls he hit he placed really well. He really
placed that changeup well over the left-center-field fence. He's a
pretty good hitter, folks. But that's not a scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell, who is becoming something of a folk hero at Shea
Stadium, pitched the ninth inning to tie a franchise record by
appearing in seven straight games. Jesse Orosco had set the Mets'
record in 1986. On Sunday, the Mets' seventh sellout crowd of the
season cheered madly every time Wendell slammed the rosin bag
behind the pitcher's mound. ``I wanted him to get the appreciation
for the job he's done,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said, in
explaining why he used his right-handed setup man in a 5-0 game.
``He wasn't going to throw more than 15 pitches, and he didn't.''
Wendell threw 13. As for his arm? ``They can rebuild it,'' Wendell
said, echoing an old television show. ``It won't fall off.'

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Manhattan from New Jersey, I took my
9-year-old son, Brendan, on the subway. I noticed he looked a bit
nervous walking through the station at Port Authority, as his
subway experience was very limited. As the doors shut on the car, I
could see the uneasiness on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The train started moving, and as we came to a bend in the
tracks, the conductor loudly announced something that was
unintelligible because of the defective speaker system. I noticed
Brendan listening intently, trying to understand the instructions.
The train was screeching around a sharp right turn, and he was
leaning over sideways in his seat, almost as though he were trying
to help steer the train with his body.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him if he was OK, he looked at me frantically and
yelled, ``Did he say `lean right'?''

   File under You Know You're No Longer Newlyweds When:
</P>
<P>
   For at least a year, Debra Nussbaum Cohen had been after her
husband, Marc Cohen, to have his hearing checked. Though it had
never been a problem in their eight years together, she now needed
to repeat everything she said, sometimes twice, and it was, in her
words, ``driving me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of increasingly annoyed nudging, her husband made
an appointment. Before the tests began, the audiologist asked why
he had come, and Cohen explained the reason. The doctor nodded
sagely. The tests were conducted and the diagnosis was that Cohen's
hearing was perfect. The audiologist's advice to Cohen was this:
``Start listening to your wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said that every day he saw at least one man propelled
into his office by a frustrated wife, only to be told that his
hearing was perfect. It seems that inattentive husbands of
long-suffering wives are part of the bread-and-butter of the
audiologist business.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   This story took place around 1965 at the Municipal Cafeteria on
Canal Street, between Centre and Lafayette streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those cafeterias (a few of them are still around)
where you passed through a turnstile, and in the process picked up
a ticket. As you removed the ticket from the machine, a loud
``bong'' sounded. The tickets were punched by the servers behind
the counters as you selected your meal. There were numeric
increments imprinted starting with 5 cents and progressing to a
dollar, $2, $3, $4, $5 and maybe $10.
</P>
<P>
   One day I was at the coffee and dessert counter, which was
served by an orange-haired, gum-chewing waitress. She was pouring
coffee, pushing Danish across the counter, punching tickets and
shouting, ``Next.'' The four-step progression had a musicality
about it. We crowded around this minor deity, who was elevated by a
behind-the-counter platform, raised our tickets and gave our
orders.
</P>
<P>
   A small man in our midst elbowed his way into visibility and
tried to get her attention. ``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he
called out. Without a word, she continued what she was doing.
``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he said again. She continued to
ignore him. Still louder, there was another ``Lady, I want a cup of
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point she leaned forward and and in a voice of great

   Mary Donohue is, according to her daughter, Lorraine Forrier,
``sometimes forgetful.'' During a visit to Ms. Forrier in
Connecticut, the two shopped, lunched and saw the movie ``There's
Something About Mary.'' The mother then telephoned her older sister
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``I'm having a wonderful time. We're shopping and having
lunch, and we saw a movie.''

   Aunt: ``Oh, so what did you see?''

   It was halftime at a Knicks game at the Garden earlier this year
and Barry Baum was standing in line at the ATM, in front of four
boys, each around 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to buy the Knicks shorts,'' said the one boy with an
ATM card. ``But my mother said I can only use the ATM machine for
emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends had no doubts. They nodded their heads in agreement
as one spoke out. ``But this is an emergency,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Baum finished his transaction, walked a few steps away and
turned back to see the decision. The card carrier was eagerly
typing the code into the machine.

   Saul Bellow and his wife were guests at a dinner party held by
our neighbors, Dorothy and Phil Zaro, at their vacation home in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Some days later, back in Westchester County, Dorothy Zaro was
having her hair done. ``I had Saul Bellow for dinner this past
weekend,'' she said. There was silence for a moment. Then the
hairdresser replied: ``Do you know, I have never had that dish. Was
it good?''

   The group at the Brooklyn Museum of Art was beginning its tour
of American paintings and Lillian Kanfer, a guide at the museum,
was about to start her lecture. Suddenly a woman in the group
rushed to the front and pointed to a figure in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't touch,'' another member of the group warned her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' asked the woman. ``It's not wet.''

   Michael Stinchcomb, a weekend gardener in the Hamptons, was
grateful to a friend who told him that she used inverted wine
bottles full of water to keep her potted plants from drying out
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   One weekend he lent his house to a horticulturally challenged
Manhattanite, left some inverted wine bottles and told his friend
to be sure to water the flowers when he arrived. When Stinchcomb
picked up his telephone messages, he was amused to hear: ``I don't
know what to do. Which plants drink chardonnay, which drink merlot
and which drink champagne?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Son, let's talk about the word (begin
ital)respect(end ital) for a moment here.
</P>
<P>
   Definition 1: It's what baseball supposedly failed to give El
Cube' slugger Sammy Sosa after he belatedly hit post-McGwire taters
numbered 61 and 62 around a birthday greeting to some 117-year-old
fan in Withering Heights, Ill., who claims to remember the last
Cubbie title.
</P>
<P>
   So, a week after it happened, the team tried to amend. It flew
in the touring Maris kids (who sang the seventh-inning stretch
ritual), guilted the commish to miss the Brewers' home game against
the Cards (where McAndro muscled out No. 65 and half of No. 66),
taped up a ``Sammy: You're The Man'' banner over the left-field
bleachers to block out some freeloaders across Waveland, gave him
the obligatory convertible on a day when there was a third-inning
downpour, made sure to show out-of-work MJ in attendance on the WGN
telecast, paid someone to warble through the Dominican Republic's
national anthem and had one of those jet-formation fly-bys
(unfortunately, just as Kevin Tapani was about to pitch to the
second batter in the Reds lineup) during a full-on ``Celebratin'
Sammy'' spectacular before the Wrigleys' final home game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bret Boone launches two of his own, the umps give him
another, Sosa pops out to Boone to end it and the Cubs lose to wrap
up a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   This, from a team that has been paying respect to the memory of
a man who has a son named Skip and a grandson named Chip by wearing
a cartoon patch on their right sleeves all year....
</P>
<P>
   Definition 2: It's what Oscar De La Hoya claims he wanted but
never got the first time from Julio Cesar Chavez. That's why on
Friday, they each respectfully agreed to pocket a buncha more cash
_ again _ so that it could be more clearly articulated. Apparently,
there was nothing lost in the translation this time....
</P>
<P>
   Definition 3: It's what Rap Master Blaster Shaq Daddy O'Neal has
titled his new hip-hop CD.
</P>
<P>
   One of the singles is ``Blaq Supaman.'' Kids, that's apparently
how it's spelled. No clownin'.
</P>
<P>
   So what did sports teach us here?
</P>
<P>
   Respect can come belated.
</P>
<P>
   Respect can be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Respect can be lyrically requested (it even rhymes with
``expect.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the stern lesson someone's gotta learn is that until it's
earned, stop yearning....
</P>
<P>
   The difference in priorities these days at Fox and Disney: One
wants ``King of the Hill'' and ``Ally McBeal'' to start strong, the
other wants Ken Hill and Jack McDowell to finish strong....
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West can put the L.A. sports-legend spin on Michael
Ovitz's NFL stadium plan in Carson _ apparently Magic Johnson
wasn't enough _ but Mr. Clutch might double clutch when he moves
into that Staples Center cubicle. Make sure your key fits. The city
politicians who thought you and the Lakers were down with the
revitalized downtown area now know where your priorities lie....
</P>
<P>
   NBA commish David Stern has volunteered to have his pay held
during the lockout, you know, to take one for the team of
financially strapped owners who stand to lose some gate receipts
this year. And sometime this week, they'll probably announce the
start of training camps won't happen in early October as planned.
When will this nightmare end?...
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson should have to apply for a learner's permit before
he's issued a new license....
</P>
<P>
   Reports are that Roger Taylor of the band Queen (are they still
around?) has put up $16 Grand to help organize a buncha blokes to
keep King Rupert Murdoch from buying Manchester United. Why not
just build a moat around the stadium?...
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's next quest: bid $2.2 bil for a six-year pay-TV
contract for Italian soccer, according to the Financial Times.
What, American soccer isn't good enough?...
</P>
<P>
   And with the soon-to-be bachelor putting his Beverly Hills
fixer-upper on the market for a mere $19.5 million, enough money
will soon be scraped together for that rebuilt Dodger Stadium....
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's Keith Olbermann ``has quickly established himself as
perhaps the most thoughtful of the cable guys chewing over'' the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, claims resected Washington Post TV critic
Howard Kurtz. Olbermann takes the lead over fellow ex-
``SportsCenter'' cohort and soon-to-be ex-``Daily Show'' host Craig
Kilborn....
</P>
<P>
   Al Pacino has been hanging around NFL games and practices to
soak up belligerent behavior for his role as a coach in the
upcoming Ollie Stone expose ``On Any Given Sunday,'' which the
league whole-heartedly unendorses....
</P>
<P>
   The final bill for the damage: McGwire 70, Sosa 68 and the MVP,
Griffey 60, and Ramirez wishin' there was a month left. &QL;

A NOVEL(TY) APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until last year, Bill Stratton's Internet link to
NFL greatness was achieved by clicking on to the Denver Broncos'
home site to see what was up with Granada Hills High schoolmate
John Elway (Class of '79).
</P>
<P>
   Then came Stratton's business Web site called Sports
Collectibles Heaven (!bold!http://www.nflcollectibles.com).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that if Elway needs a 4.3 cubic foot refrigerator
with reversible hinge, CanStor door liner and _ the most essential
element _ with a a big ol' Broncos logo on the door, he's got to
track down Stratton to buy it. (Item W69, $355).
</P>
<P>
   Stratton's site for sore eyes has more than 100 NFL-licensed
items for sale that you just can't make up. Or, pretty much, find
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone sells hats, jerseys and jackets,'' said Stratton, a
devoted Dallas Cowboys collector who runs the site out of his
Granada Hills home. ``I didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has essential novelties for the ultimate NFL fans,
such as:
</P>
<P>
   Hot dog holders: Two foot-long boards that look like a small
jaialai stick, holding up to six dogs in a bun. Item W31, $24.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy Susan: Or, in this case, a lazy Seahawk, Saint, Steeler,
etc. Item W28, $50.
</P>
<P>
   Helmet TVs: A 5-inch black-and-white TV crammed inside a team
helmet with AM/FM radio and AC adapter. Thankfully, with removable
facemask. Item W70, $329.99.
</P>
<P>
   Dash mats: For your car's dashboard, of course. Item W32A, $78
(personalized for $92).
</P>
<P>
   Nesting dolls: Those hand-painted wooden egg-shaped things that
all fit into each other. Just like the ones you find in Solvang.
Item W68, now $80. (Sorry, Dolphins and Steelers only).
</P>
<P>
   Boots: Yeah, for your feet. Thermal winter ``Coldbusters'' with
team logos. Not so much for Southern Californians, but... Item W61A
(men sizes 5-14) and W61B (women sizes 6-12), $139.95.
</P>
<P>
   Tapestry comforters and valances: What's a valance? Look it up.
Item W54D (54'' x 16''), $49.95; Item W53C (Queen-sized comforter
with 2 shams), $349.95.
</P>
<P>
   Inflatable chairs: Holds up to 250 pounds, pre-beer intake. Item
W56A&AMP;B (child and adult chair) $27.50/$52.50.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta: Shaped like little footballs, with your favorite team
listed as the brand. Item W84A&AMP;B (3 or 6 bags), $17.95/$32.95.
</P>
<P>
   Kettle and water sold separately. &QL; 
Note: Sports Collectibles Heaven also has a mail-order catalog that
can be obtained by writing to P.O. Box 33141-WWW, Granada Hills CA
91394, or phoning 1-800-NFL-6SCH.

JOHN PAUL JR. WINS LONE STAR 500K
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For the majority of its up-and-coming
drivers, the Pep Boys Indy Racing League is about starting a
career.
</P>
<P>
   For veteran John Paul Jr., the IRL is about a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's once-promising future in Indy-cars and prototype sports
cars was shelved in the late 1980s after he pleaded guilty to a
charge of racketeering in a drug case that also involved his
father, endurance racing champion John Paul Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Jr., who served a 28-month term in a federal prison, was
labeled as tainted goods upon his return to racing in 1989. He was
relegated to a succession of either one-time or low-budget rides.
But Paul joined Jonathan Byrd's well-stocked IRL team for the True
Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway in June, and began repaying his
car owner's faith yesterday with a victory in the inaugural Lone
Star 500-kilometer race.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things (personal problems) are in the past,'' Paul
said after scoring his first IRL victory and first in an Indy-car
since the Championship Auto Racing Teams' Michigan 500 in 1983.
``It's been a long 15 years. I'm looking forward to today and to
the future. With Jonathan's support we're looking for many more
wins down the line. I appreciate everyone waiting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking then to the media, but earlier in Victory Lane
Paul thanked God, his wife and his children for standing by him.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's breakthrough victory before an estimated 81,000 fans came
at the expense of IRL rookie Robby Unser, who finished second by
1.577 seconds. Track temperatures were reported between 130-137
degrees led to a rash of blistered Goodyear tires, spins/crashes
and debris that led to more cut tires.
</P>
<P>
   Only the cars of Paul, Unser, Jeff Ward and Roberto Guerrero
were on the lead lap at the conclusion of the 208-lap event. And
only half of the 28-car field was running at the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relieved to win my first IRL race,'' said Paul, a
38-year-old resident of West Palm Beach, Fla., who became the
league's sixth different winner of 1998. ``I'm very proud to be
associated with the series. To come on board after Indy this year,
we've been competitive from the start. They all know we've got a
car capable of winning a race, and today we showed it. It's a very
special moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who led four times for 31 laps, took the point for the
final time on lap 192 when former motorcycle champion Ward and 1996
Indy 500 champion Buddy Lazier pitted for fuel and tires. Paul, who
had made his last pit stop on lap 164, was told by Byrd he had
enough fuel to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Title contender Davey Hamilton brought out the race's eighth and
final caution on lap 197, when a right rear tire on his car failed
down the front straight of the 1.5-mile trioval and sent him
spinning through the infield grass. That bunched up the field for a
restart, although only Paul and Unser were running on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   When the race went green on lap 203, Ward and then Guerrero _
who had brought the crowd to its feet by racing side-by-side for
the point on laps 183 and 184 _ passed Paul to get back on the lead
lap. Those moves basically were uncontested by Paul, who managed to
keep Unser in the one mirror remaining on his car to the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flat-out every lap, other than restarts,'' said Paul,
whose No. 10 VisionAire-Bryant Heating &AMP; Cooling G Force/Aurora was
shod with Firestone Firehawk tires. ``The last 20 laps, I was
flat-out every lap, then that last yellow occurred. I was a little
nervous and let two guys get by me, but I didn't want to make a
mistake at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who won the International Motor Sports Association GT
championship in 1982, pleaded guilty in August 1985 to a charge of
racketeering, involving the unloading of a boat containing
marijuana and helping in preparing to use the boat to haul
marijuana from Colombia to Louisiana. Paul spent 28 months in a
federal prison from 1986-88.
</P>
<P>
   His father still is serving a 25-year term for drug trafficking
and attempted murder of a witness in a federal drug case.
</P>
<P>
   With that background for his driver, Byrd said this victory _
his second in the 3-year-old IRL _ was ``more special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one we had to overcome so much adversity,'' Byrd said.
``John Paul is a pleasure to work with. The crew did a wonderful
job. The Firestone tires were fantastic _ we never blistered a
thing. We were having to slow him down a bit because we had such a
good pit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we didn't have to make another pit stop and knew the
guys in front of us had to. To be able to tell the driver, `You've
got everybody covered and it's going to come to you' ... it was a
pleasure to watch a professional out there at work.''
</P>
<P>
   The race saw 10 drivers lead, with reigning series champion Tony
Stewart pacing a race-high 51 laps before exiting with an engine
problem in his No. 1 Glidden-Menards Dallara/Aurora. He finished
20th in the 28-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, who had won the three previous races but finished
fifth yesterday, began the day with a 23-point lead in the driver's
championship over Hamilton and Stewart. Brack exited Texas with a
31-point lead over Hamilton and a 43-point pad over Stewart heading
into the season ender at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Brack can lock up his first championship and the Pep Boys
Million by finishing seventh or better, even if Hamilton wins the
pole and race and leads the most laps.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur S. Lall, an Indian diplomat of the Jawaharlal Nehru
generation who helped secure his newly independent country a place
near the center of world affairs in the 1950s and 60s, died on
Sept. 13 in New York. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Lall, who settled in Manhattan at the end of his diplomatic
career and taught international relations at the Columbia
University School of International and Public Affairs, was consul
general for India and then India's representative at the United
Nations in New York in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   He later represented India at the Conference on Disarmament in
Geneva, where he was active in early arms talks between the United
States and the Soviet Union. Lall was a lifelong opponent of
nuclear weapons and nuclear testing. India, he argued in 1962, was
``against tests by anyone, anywhere, any time.'' But he lived to
see India set off nuclear explosions two times, in 1974 and this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He belonged to a generation of Indian diplomats when the
Indian Foreign Service used to recruit the very best of what India
has to offer,'' said Sumit Ganguly, a professor of political
science at the City University of New York. ``This was the time of
extraordinary international activism in Indian diplomacy, and
people like Arthur Lall were linchpins.''
</P>
<P>
   Lall is perhaps best remembered for the role he played behind
the scenes at the United Nations when the abrasive and viscerally
anti-American K.P. Krishna Menon was India's leading voice in
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Conor Cruise O'Brien described Lall as the intellectual
force and moderating influence behind the Menon diplomatic team.
``Arthur Lall was, by general consent, the brains behind the
delegation; he was also its patience and its urbanity,'' O'Brien
wrote in a review of one of Lall's numerous books, ``Modern
International Negotiations: Principles and Practices'' (Columbia
University Press, 1967).
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Lall wrote ``How China Negotiates,'' based in large
measure on his experiences and knowledge. In 1981 he took a last
academic look at his homeland in ``The Emergence of Modern India.''
</P>
<P>
   Lall, a quietly good-humored and elegant man with a shock of
snow-white hair who was a familiar figure in New York research and
policy organizations, also wrote poetry and fiction. He wrote two
novels, ``The House at Adampur'' in 1956 and ``Seasons of Jupiter''
in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Samuel Lall was born on July 14, 1911, in Lahore, the
intellectual center of the northern tier of British India. Lahore
remains the cultural capital of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   After partition his family settled in India, where his brother
John, a leading scholar on foreign affairs, served for a number of
years as Dewan, the Indian-appointed prime minister of Sikkim, an
independent Buddhist kingdom eventually swallowed up by India in
the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a Christian family, Arthur Lall was educated at Punjab
University in Lahore and at Oxford. Before arriving in the United
States, where he spent much of his diplomatic career, Lall was
India's first Trade Commissioner in London and a government
official in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 he married Betty Goetz, a former professor of labor
relations at Cornell and an arms-control specialist whom he met in
1962 at a disarmament conference in Geneva. Mrs. Lall survives him,
along with his brother and a sister, Joy.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is to be held at 10 a.m. on Oct. 7 at the
Church Center for the United Nations, 777 United Nations Plaza.

PEYTON MANNING IS LEARNING THE HARD WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Peyton Manning and his father, Archie,
stood in a tunnel leading out of Giants Stadium Sunday and spoke
quietly for a few minutes. Peyton wiped a towel across his face
between words, and when enough was said, he left with a hug from
his father. Quietly, Archie implored him, ``Head up.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The father knows what the son is going through. Archie Manning
walked off the field with the same blank expression many times
during his 14 National Football League seasons. He could tell
Peyton about the expectations and the disappointments. And he could
tell him that there would be days like this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third game of what promises to be a tough learning
experience for Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts was a
humiliating 44-6 rout by the Jets. While Manning was hardly to
blame for the defeat, he did little to stop it, either, learning on
the job and only able to look enviously at the other side of the
field, where he saw the Jets laughing and celebrating. Archie
Manning has been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably say it now,'' Archie Manning said. ``Before
the season, even if I thought there were going to be days like
this, I didn't want to bring it up, because don't bring something
up and hopefully it won't happen. But now it's happened, and you
just say, `Yeah, these type of days here, you've got to pick
yourself up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Archie Manning, the No. 2 pick in the 1971 draft, endured a
career in which his teams reached .500 only once. He began his
career by scoring the game-winning touchdown on the final play to
beat the Los Angeles Rams. Maybe it never got much better than
that, but he answered the questions on that first day.
</P>
<P>
   For Peyton, the first overall pick in this year's draft, the
questions will come from within and from around him. In three
straight losses, he has thrown eight interceptions and been sacked
six times. Sacks were not an official statistic when his father
played, but it is safe to say that Archie took a beating in New
Orleans. And just like Archie, Peyton has no time to stand on the
sideline with a headset and a clipboard and learn the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought that it would help, I would do it, I really
would,'' Colts Coach Jim Mora said of not starting Manning. ``If I
thought that would help him or our football team, I would do it.
But I don't think it would. I think the best thing for Peyton is to
play, and I'm even more convinced of that now than I was last week
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the best thing for his development and his
progress and our football team's progress is for him to go out
there and play and suffer the adversity and make his mistakes and
do the good things and learn from it, because he's the type of guy
that will learn from it. I don't believe that it will destroy his
confidence and put him in the tank emotionally, where he won't be
able to respond. He's our best quarterback, so I don't want to
stick him on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning agreed. ``It's not fun, not much fun at all,'' he
said. ``You're not going to accept losing, and you never want to
get used to losing. But we have 13 games left. All we can do is
learn from it. I have the same goals every week: that's just to win
the game, no matter how I play or my numbers, do whatever it takes
to win. When you lose, as the quarterback, you feel like you didn't
do your job. All you can do is keep working.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the score quickly grew out of reach Sunday, the Colts stayed
with their game plan, taking what the Jets would give them. Manning
threw quick slants and short dump-offs, finishing the game 20-of-44
for 193 yards with two interceptions; he resisted the urge to try
to save the day by himself. Those lessons come from Mora. The
lessons relayed in his brief post-game meeting with his father, and
those that pass between father and son in telephone calls during
the week, are not steeped in technical advice or football-speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him to learn from it, study film hard, try to correct
some mistakes, and keep going,'' Archie Manning said. ``It's just
learning. I've been there. I feel like I can really relate. But
you've got to understand, we don't have a relationship where after
every game I've got to go tell him something. He's got coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't ask for advice; he didn't much in college. We just
kind of made an agreement, that that wasn't the right way. I'm
certainly not perfect. A lot of people have made me out to be
something perfect. I'm not. But I'm like any other father. I love
my son and I'm proud of him.''

EDITORIAL: SAFER DIETS FOR COWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Microbiologists at Cornell University have found that what
cattle eat can affect the safety of hamburgers, opening a whole new
path to controlling food-borne illnesses. Strains of E. coli
bacteria have caused illness and death in humans who have eaten
undercooked ground beef, lettuce and unpasteurized fruit juice.
Thus far most efforts to control the spread of E. coli have focused
on improving safety in slaughtering and food-handling practices.
But the new research shows that the E. coli problem can also be
managed by changing the diet of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that cattle fed mostly grain are more likely to
harbor harmful E. coli bacteria than cattle fed hay or grass.
Grain-fed cattle develop more acid in their colons, which promotes
acid-resistant bacteria in their digestive tracts. Such bacteria
are more likely to survive in the human stomach, causing illness.
Switching the cattle to hay or grass for even five days can reduce
acid and virtually eliminate acid-resistant E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   The data should prompt the cattle industry to adjust its feed
practices. There is little chance that U.S. cattle will be fed hay
alone because grain feeding is efficient and economical. But widely
publicized incidents in recent years of E. coli contamination in
beef have been highly costly for the industry. Making the change to
hay for the few days prior to slaughter would likely involve only
minimal expense. It is unclear whether the Department of
Agriculture can require such a change. But meat-packing plants,
armed with the new research, may find it in their financial
interest to insist that producers certify that their animals meet
these dietary standards.

   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter slipped into the chauffeured car on the
Upper East Side Sunday with a cup of coffee and a bagel and
immediately bombarded John Olerud, his Met teammate and fellow
passenger, with his game plan for pitching against the awful
Marlins. Leiter, who is as effusive as a radio talk-show host,
discussed strategy while Olerud, who is as taciturn as a mannequin,
simply listened.
</P>

   The 20-minute ride from Manhattan to Shea Stadium involved a lot
of chewing by Leiter, both on the bagel and on Olerud's ear. Leiter
explained his feelings about attacking Mark Kotsay and Todd
Dunwoody. Who? There is no doubt that Leiter was the only person in
New York who was dissecting Dunwoody's swing at 10:30 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   But that is typical of Leiter, who lets the baseball fan inside
him speak almost as much as the pitcher does. Leiter reminded
Olerud how critical Sunday's game was, then he reminded himself a
few dozen times and then he reminded the Marlins how important it
was to him and to the Mets by dominating Florida in a 5-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted this game badly,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``He pitched like he wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter wanted it, the Mets got it. After Turk Wendell, the human
pitching machine, relieved Leiter and notched three outs in a noisy
ninth, the remaining fans from the crowd of 52,767 howled because
the Mets had nudged ahead of the Chicago Cubs for the National
League wild-card lead by one-half game. When the Cubs later
stumbled to the Cincinnati Reds, 7-3, the Mets danced in front by
one full game with five games remaining. Leiter orchestrated
Sunday's snazzy waltz.
</P>
<P>
   The public-address system blared ``Wild Boys'' by Duran Duran as
Wendell led the Mets through some chest-bumps and high-fives. The
focus might have shifted temporarily to the hyperactive Wendell,
but it really belonged on Leiter. He overcame an interesting hurdle
in the first inning and coasted through eight solid innings with
nine strikeouts, while permitting five hits and one walk. No wonder
Leiter sounded more like a fan than a pitcher after his biggest
triumph of a still-percolating season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fun day,'' Leiter said. ``It was one of those days
where everything was working.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Almost everything. Jim Leyland, who managed Leiter when the
Marlins won the World Series last season, played Strat-O-Matic and
tossed the first curveball of the afternoon by loading his lineup
with five left-handed batters, including four straight, against the
left-handed Leiter. Leiter kept pointing at the lineup card as he
discussed the hitters with catcher Mike Piazza, looking like a
tourist who had lost at three-card monte. Leyland threw the curve
because right-handed hitters entered the day batting .203 in 516
at-bats against Leiter and left-handed-hitters were at .298 over
104 at-bats against him. Besides, the Class AAA Marlins had nothing
to lose by experimenting.
</P>
<P>
   After Luis Castillo grounded out to open the game, the
procession of lefties started with Dunwoody and Kotsay each
singling. Sensing that Leiter was frazzled, Valentine made a rare
first-inning jaunt to the mound. Leiter had thrown only 10 pitches,
but Valentine had a stern message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let Al know that he was a great pitcher,''
Valentine said. ``It didn't matter who was in there or if they were
standing on their head. Just stay aggressive. I didn't want to
regret not saying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter spotted Valentine, he was surprised. But he looked
the manager in the eye, listened intently and nodded when Valentine
retreated. Although Valentine has been criticized for overmanaging,
counseling Leiter was the shrewdest decision he made all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to give me the old rah-rah thing, get my behind
in gear,'' Leiter said. ``I appreciated it. It worked. Obviously,
whatever he said worked. I did step it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter pumped two strikes on his next three pitches to the
cleanup hitter, Cliff Floyd. He was not deterred when Floyd
followed by fouling off three straight pitches and got him to chase
a nasty slider for the strikeout. Ryan Jackson was an easier victim
as Leiter dispatched him on four pitches, whiffing him with a sweet
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter's mastery over Leyland's lefties extended beyond the
first inning and beyond Valentine's timely lecture. Leiter wound up
holding left-handed hitters without a hit in the 15 at-bats after
Valentine visited him, which is why he won his career-best 17th
game and why the giddy Mets were hollering in their clubhouse as
the Reds went ahead of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   A determined Leiter helped position the Mets one precious game
ahead for the wild-card playoff spot, which is surely what he
wanted to discuss on the ride home last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that I did my job to help keep this team in the race
and possibly go into the postseason is the way everyone has to look
at it,'' Leiter said. ``Today, I did my job.''

   A Combined Phone-Palm Pilot Impresses the Techno-Elite
</P>
<P>
   Mixing technical and political evangelism, the annual Telecosm
conference, sponsored by George Gilder and his libertarian friends
from Forbes magazine, is one of the highest-powered gatherings of
technology experts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But at last week's conference, held at Lake Tahoe, Calif., the
most provocative moment came not on the ballroom stage but when
Paul Jacobs, a top executive for Qualcomm Inc., conducted a
private, late-night demonstration of his company's latest creation:
a digital wireless phone fully integrated with a Palm Pilot
hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who runs Qualcomm's consumer products group, was willing
to show off the new unit because it will be formally introduced
Monday _ although it will not be widely available until next year.
If the new Qualcomm product, called the pdQ, lives up to Jacobs'
demonstration, it could become the most popular item among the
techno-elite since the Palm Pilot itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential importance of the pdQ goes beyond novelty.
Digital experts these days are betting that the ultimate challenge
to Microsoft's desktop dominance will not come at the desktop but
from mobile devices that blur the line between computing and
communications. The pdQ could be the first to fulfill that vision.
</P>
<P>
   The potential pdQ applications range from e-mail messages that
will automatically dial a phone number to wireless stock trading
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The pdQ is smaller, lighter and easier to use than the Nokia
9000 Communicator, the first integrated phone and hand-held
computer. In the next week Qualcomm intends to distribute
programming tools to help the thousands of enthusiastic Palm
developers come up with new applications to take advantage of the
integration of wireless communications features into the
traditional Palm Pilot.

   Microsoft Word as Pundit: Software Maker Says It Isn't So
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been buzzing with all sorts of pranks and
trivia related to President Clinton's troubles. But an e-mail tip
that was widely circulated last week made the programmers of
Microsoft Word, the word-processing software, seem predictive.
</P>
<P>
   The tip was this: Type the sentence ``I'd like to see Bill
Clinton resign'' in a Word document, highlight it, and then run it
through the program's thesaurus (with the key combination Shift-F7
or by selecting Tools-Language-Thesaurus from the task-bar menu).
The waggish thesaurus retorts with the phrase ``I'll drink to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the trick works even in versions of Word that predate
Clinton's election to the White House. Did political oracles help
compile Word?
</P>
<P>
   No. As it turns out, the Word thesaurus issues the same response
with the phrases ``I'd like to see Bill Gates go broke'' and ``I'd
like to see my stocks go up'' _ and any other phrase beginning with
simply ``I'd ....'' People closely familiar with Word have known
about the quirk for years. Apparently, one of them recently started
spreading the Clinton resignation item.
</P>
<P>
   Planting hidden pranks in software is a time-honored
programmers' tradition, of course. And Microsoft Word is known to
have its fair share of these. Run the sequence of letters ``zzzz''
through Word's spell-checker, for example, and the program suggests
that you really meant to type ``sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``I'll drink to that'' wasn't the result of programmer
mischief. Rather, explained John Duncan, a Microsoft product
manager, the natural-language thesaurus in Word offers phrases,
listed alphabetically, that it considers to be possible
alternatives for the word used.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he explains, the natural-language feature, in the
effort to simulate conversational human speech, unknowingly gets a
little too creative.
</P>
<P>
   In all but the latest edition of Word, for example, if a user
checks the phrase ``Unable to follow directions'' with the
thesaurus, the first suggested alternative is ``Unable to have an
erection.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said the latest version of Word omits these two
potentially embarrassing phrase suggestions. ``We want to be
sensitive to customers,'' he said.
</P>

   What's in a Web Name? Sometimes, Mistaken Identity
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woods, the owner of an Internet service provider to Raleigh
and Durham, N.C., has discovered that using an address, or domain
name, that people associate with a well-known company may not be
worth the free publicity that comes with mistaken identity. He owns
delta.com, a domain name he chose in 1993 for his company,
Deltacomm Internet Services.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, nearly everyone who comes to his Web site
(www.delta.com) is really looking for the site of Delta Air Lines _
sometimes as many as 10,000 people a day. Over the years, as
traffic on the World Wide Web has meant more and more mistakes,
Woods has tried to sell the address to Delta Air Lines. But the
airline, which does business on the Web as www.delta-air.com, has
repeatedly rejected his asking price as too high.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he had lowered the price, to a ``five-figure
amount,'' which he contends will barely cover the cost of
reprinting brochures and manuals and changing his customers' e-mail
addresses to a new domain.
</P>
<P>
   Because he pays another Internet company to carry his Web site's
traffic, Woods says, he is incurring extra costs to redirect
Delta's traffic. And he says he gets no extra advertising value
from most of the people who visit in search of the airline, because
his business serves only customers in the Raleigh-Durham area.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines disputes Woods' economics. ``His asking price is
much higher than his cost to migrate his customers,'' a spokesman,
Kip Smith, said. ``We don't feel that Delta should subsidize his
business interests.'' And besides, Smith said, Delta Air Lines has
a recognized Web address that has been in place since December
1995. ``We're really not interested in pursuing it, although we are
always open to discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently. The airline recently acquired another Web-site name,
www.deltaairlines.com from Dennis Toeppen, a speculator in Internet
names, who had originally registered it along with 100 or so other
corporate names. Delta would not comment on the terms of that deal.
</P>
<P>
   After one conversation with Delta that did not go to his liking,
Woods removed all links to Delta Air Lines' official site. But he
soon received so many complaints that he restored the link.
</P>
<P>
   To goad Delta, he also stuck in a link to its main rival,
American Airlines, with a free testimonial that reads, ``If you're
looking for an airline, try American Airlines, the frequent-flier
airline the owners and staff of Deltacomm Internet Services flew
100,000 miles on in 1997.''

TENNESSEE USES DEFENSE TO SHAKE THINGS UP IN THE POLLS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The scoreboard displayed: Tennessee 20,
Florida 17. And thousands in the school-record crowd of 107,653
were rolling onto the field at Neyland Stadium to pound on the goal
posts. In the middle of them, Al Wilson stood his ground as he had
for four quarters and a thrilling overtime finish against the
Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Three and one-half hours earlier on Florida's opening drive,
Wilson, the Tennessee middle linebacker, set a punishing tone when
he separated the ball from Florida running back Terry Jackson at
the goal line. It was the first of three fumbles that Wilson caused
_ a school record _ and that his teammates recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It began an eight-tackle, one-sack performance that did not come
close to measuring the trouble he gave Florida quarterbacks Jess
Palmer and Doug Johnson, who were often flattened by Wilson after
hurrying their throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense sells tickets,'' said Wilson, an ebullient senior.
``The defense wins championships.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no titles to hand out this early in the season, but
smothering defenses in games across the country on Saturday
revealed the contenders for the national title. Ohio State kept The
Associated Press' No. 1 ranking by holding determined Missouri to
66 second-half yards and turning a 14-13 first-half deficit into a
35-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State limited Heisman Trophy candidate Ricky
Williams to 43 yards rushing, forced four turnovers and crushed
Texas, 48-7. Louisiana State returned one interception for a
touchdown and scored off two others to beat Auburn, 31-19, and move
up to No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Tennessee defense that most affected the title
picture: The Volunteers moved up two slots to No. 4 and the Gators
dropped six to No 8.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee turned to big plays to end a five-game losing streak
to Florida. The Volunteers picked up four fumbles, snagged an
interception, had five sacks and limited Florida to three points on
two possessions inside their 5-yard line. They also kept Jackson,
who had been averaging 9 yards a carry, to 26 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't run worth a dog,'' said Florida Coach Steve
Spurrier, whose team fell to 2-1. ``Our running game was
nonexistent. We messed up a whole bunch of protection assignments.
We made enough mistakes to lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Gators had a chance to win in overtime. Florida won
the coin toss and decided to defend first, which Spurrier conceded
was a message to Tennessee that his highly vaunted defense could
hold the Volunteers to a field-goal attempt. They did most of the
night, limiting Tennessee to only three points off the five
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Lewis, a Tennessee sophomore, carried 21 times for 82
yards, but the Florida defense frustrated quarterback Tee Martin.
He was 7-for-20 passing for 64 yards and an interception, though he
found Peerless Price for a 29-yard touchdown toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a little bit on us,'' Spurrier said. ``And the
touchdown pass was a jump-ball situation. But I thought our defense
played very hard. A touchdown I thought would win it.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the overtime gamble would pay off when Tennessee
began its possession on the Florida 25 and Martin promptly threw
two incomplete passes. On third-and-10, he kept the ball but was
thrown for a loss, which was compounded by a holding penalty.
Suddenly, Tennessee was on Florida's 37-yard line facing
third-and-23.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who is a combined 16-for-46 in his two starts,
turned what looked like a sack into a 14-yard scramble that put the
game on kicker Jeff Hall's foot for the second straight week. Hall
drilled a 41-yarder through the center of the posts.
</P>
<P>
   It took Florida only two plays to get a first down on
Tennessee's 15. On first down, Travis Taylor had a half step on
Steve Johnson on the left side of the end zone, but the pass was
high and he got only one hand on it. The next play, Wilson broke
through the line and batted down Palmer's pass. Then on third down,
Florida's Johnson threw wide to Taylor in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   So it was up to Collins Cooper to boot a 32-yarder to keep
overtime alive. The Florida kicker had not attempted a field goal
this year, and it showed. The ball began to drift left as soon as
he hit it. Asked what he told Cooper, Spurrier said he told him to
keep his head up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `It wasn't all your fault. You had one of the many
bad plays we had in the game,''' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson and the Volunteers' defense forced most of them.

FOR THIRD TIME, FANS GET GOOD SHOW FROM IRL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They show up. They sign autographs. They
drive 220 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They don't complain.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, occasionally A.J. Foyt slaps the winner upside the
head, but that's racing.
</P>
<P>
   Three times now the Indy Racing League has gone to the starting
line at Texas Motor Speedway, and three times the IRL gang has put
on an engaging, entertaining show.
</P>
<P>
   High speeds. Large, though not Woodstock-sized, crowds. And
wimp-free racing.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Jr.'s victory yesterday in the inaugural Lone Star
500K also stands as vivid testimony of IRL's claim as a haven of
opportunity. Paul's trip to the finish line took 13 years and one
lamentable detour through a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up, Robby Unser, is another IRL opportunist. As the
sixth _ or 60th, I've lost count _ member of the racing Unser
family, 30-year-old Robby finished 1.577 seconds behind the winner
and strengthened his case for being named the circuit's rookie of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unser's 36-year-old cousin is two-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser
Jr., who would have been here except some wise Solomon split the
Indy-car baby two years ago. The Andrettis, Rahals and European
millionaires went one way; the non-marquee cousins went the other.
</P>
<P>
   Al Jr. rides on the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART)
circuit, but the speedway at Indy is IRL territory now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's got to be eating him up,'' Robby said. ``Not only
can't he run at Indy, but he can't run against his cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry is a friendly one. ``But we're Unsers,'' Robby said.
``We're racers. All we do is compete.''
</P>
<P>
   When Indy Motor Speedway president Tony George founded the IRL,
young, under-financed drivers like Robby were probably what he had
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for talent here,'' said the younger Unser
cousin. ``The other circuit is full of Europeans with money. There
just wasn't room for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Eddie Cheever Jr.'s Team Cheever, Robby found both a
ride and a league of his own.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not a half-bad league, now that it has broken its ties
to the U.S. Auto Club. The first Indy-car race at TMS was
submarined by timing mishaps, protests and Foyt's memorable
head-slap of Arie Luyendyk in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like miles ago. At TMS yesterday, there was no
Armageddon traffic snarl. There were no hourlong waits for the
restrooms. The crowd was announced as 81,000 _ modest numbers by
NASCAR Winston Cup standards, but not bad for a warm September
Sunday in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had three great races with the IRL,'' Speedway general
manager Eddie Gossage said. ``On Saturday, they stood out here in
the heat and signed literally thousands of autographs. These guys
do such a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage admits that TMS went through its growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like an expansion team,'' he said. ``And now we're
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speedway and the IRL, therefore, have always seemed to be
cousins, of sorts, themselves. New guys on the block, just trying
to wind through the traffic and find a niche.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part _ the loudest sounds yesterday came from the
car engines, not from drivers bleating about an alleged unfair race
track.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the third time in three races here, the IRL event
was spiced by a brief side-by-side joust at 220 mph. Jeff Ward and
Roberto Guerrero's fates were eventually dashed by a final pit
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guys were out there running two wide, just an inch off the
guy,'' Unser noted. ``You just don't see that everywhere. We're
going to do well, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   As he worked his way back to his trailer late yesterday
afternoon, Unser kept stopping to sign autographs and pose for
pictures. Admittedly, he has a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Besides cousin Al Jr.'s two Indy wins, uncle Al Sr. won the Indy
500 four times. Robby's dad, Bobby, was a three-time Indy winner.
</P>
<P>
   But Unsers, Robby said, support Unsers no matter which path the
race track may take them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great series going,'' he said. ``This is where I
want my name to be _ my first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here. I have no doubt that Tony George's dream
is going to become a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue here. The two IRL races at the Speedway this
year have gone off with some flying tire rubber, maybe, not
otherwise nary a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Wimp-free racing, if I may borrow an expression. I think we
could get used to it.

FUMBLES FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Sunday began as a nightmare for New York
Jets running back Curtis Martin. In the beginning of the Jets' 44-6
victory over Indianapolis, the Jets were on their own 25-yard line.
Seconds after getting the handoff, Martin fumbled when safety Jason
Belser poked the ball loose. Luckily, quarterback Vinny Testaverde
pounced on it.
</P>
<P>
   On the very next series, Martin fumbled again. This time, guard
Todd Burger recovered. As Martin walked to the sideline after the
second fumble, one thought raced through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `God, I'm not going to panic, but I need
your help right now,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, is the kind of player who can make two bad
plays but then, on the next 10, show the kind of explosion and
game-breaking ability that few running backs have. By the time his
day was over, those two fumbles were forgotten. He finished with
144 yards rushing on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Jets' backs had a good day. Fullback Jerald Sowell
had eight carries for 82 yards, and Leon Johnson had eight for 52
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' backs even caught the ball well. Martin, Johnson and
Keith Byars combined for four catches for 141 yards and one
touchdown. Byars' catch, his 587th, tied him with Marcus Allen for
most career catches by a back.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet Sprains Ankle
</P>
<P>
   The only bad news for the Jets was that wide receiver Wayne
Chrebet sprained his left ankle after making a catch early in the
third quarter. After the game, Chrebet had a cast placed on the
ankle as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it might be worse,'' Jets Coach Bill Parcells said.
``It wasn't, thank goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet's 11-yard catch at the end of the first quarter gave him
221 for his career, placing him 10th on the Jets' list.
</P>
<P>
   It's Up, It's No Good
</P>
<P>
   Kicker John Hall had an extra point blocked, ending his streak
of 43 straight attempts without a miss.

FREDERICK KORTH, 89, FORMER SECRETARY OF NAVY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Korth, a Texas banker who served for two years as
secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy administration, died on Sept.
14 at his home in El Paso, Texas. He was 89, and had retired from
his practice at a Washington law firm in December.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his son, Fritz-Alan, of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Korth, who was named secretary of the Navy in 1961, succeeded
John Connally, who resigned to run for governor of Texas. But Korth
resigned after two stormy years as the Navy's civilian chief.
</P>
<P>
   He was criticized for having a conflict of interest in awarding
a multibillion-dollar aircraft contract to General Dynamics Corp.
of Fort Worth, Texas, and of using Navy stationery for matters
pertaining to a Fort Worth bank with which he was associated. A
congressional committee investigating the accusations concluded
that they were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Korth also clashed with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara over a
proposal to build the nation's first nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier and over a shift of responsibility for the Middle East and
India from the Navy to the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Texas banker and rancher, Korth grew up on the
family ranch in Karnes County, in central Texas. He graduated from
the University of Texas and received a law degree from George
Washington University, where he met his future wife, Vera Sansom
Connell, a fellow Texan who was attending a Washington finishing
school.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Fort Worth to practice law, he joined the Air
Transport Command of the Army Air Forces in World War II. After the
war, he became president of Continental National Bank, a post he
left for two years to serve as an assistant secretary of the Army
in the Truman administration.
</P>
<P>
   Korth was a member of the Southwestern Texas Cattle Raisers
Association and served on the board of Meridian International in
Washington, a private foundation whose focus is international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Korth, whose first marriage ended in divorce,
is survived by his wife, Charlotte, of El Paso; a daughter, Nina
Maria Cole of Fort Worth; six grandchildren, and four
great-grandchildren.

SEN. KERRY URGES CLINTON TO TESTIFY BEFORE JUDICIARY PANEL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sought solace in church Sunday in
the final hours before a fresh torrent of lurid evidence, including
a potentially explosive videotape, is made public today by a House
panel investigating his sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton listened to a minister draw on a biblical passage
that begins, ``Judge not, lest ye be judged,'' much of the nation
prepared to view the unedited, four-hour videotape of his grand
jury testimony and receive many other details of his affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the turbulent buildup to the latest disclosures, Senator John
F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, called on Clinton to volunteer
immediately to testify before the House Judiciary Committee to
spare the country a protracted impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the panel, which is reviewing 11 possibly
impeachable allegations against Clinton, endorsed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president would be well served to explain
exactly what he did, exactly what he was thinking, do it to the
Judiciary Committee, and let's vote and let's move on one way or
the other,'' said Kerry, a Clinton ally who has sharply criticized
his conduct in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufbite &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Unsupervised children are apt to view the testimony. B3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is being ill served by this political water torture
that is taking place in a highly calculated, highly partisan way,''
Kerry said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Los Angeles Times, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said that Kerry's proposal is ``certainly worth
considering'' and that the administration does ``not rule out'' the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were occupied Sunday with putting a
positive spin on the videotape, which will be televised nationally,
providing the first images of an American president being
questioned under oath as a target of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately enraged, evasive, embarrassed, and apologetic,
Clinton repeatedly loses the polish and poise of his public
persona, according to lawmakers who have seen the videotape. At
times, they said, it effectively presents a portrait of a cornered
suspect squirming amid a devastating interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The session began with Clinton acknowledging engaging in
``inappropriate intimate contact'' and ``inappropriate sexual
banter'' in telephone conversations with Lewinsky, according to a
text of his opening statement released by his lawyers Sunday. The
text was published Sunday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Under withering questioning by prosecutors for the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, Clinton painstakingly refused time and
gain to discuss details of the illicit affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of privacy considerations affecting my family, myself,
and others, and in an effort to preserve the dignity of the office
I hold, this is all I will say about the specifics of these
particular matters,'' he said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a 445-page report to Congress, said he was compelled
to lay out the sexually explicit narrative of Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky because it was crucial to his claim that Clinton committed
perjury during a deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit in January. Clinton denied in the deposition
that he had had sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood by the denial before the grand jury, saying he and
Lewinsky had never had sexual intercourse, which he understood to
be the definition of sex that was issued by the judge in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's tortured effort to sustain the denial may cause
him particular embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't pull it off well,'' said Representative Lindsey O.
Graham, a South Carolina Republican who serves on the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Clinton is ``dancing on the head of a pin to try to
describe what sexual relations are, and it gets to be humorous,''
Graham said. ``But it's not going to be a knockout blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have seen the videotape agree about its potential
impact, including Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat, who also serves on the judiciary panel. ``I don't think
it will have a great positive or negative effect,'' Meehan said on
ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Some segments of Clinton's testimony are expected to strike a
chord with much of the public, particularly those in which he
excoriates Starr for waging a four-year investigation of him and
building a criminal case out of private sexual contact between
consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also accused House Republicans of
unnecessarily releasing the videotape and reams of other explicit
details about Clinton's affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ripped away the veneer of bipartisanship and fairness,''
said Rahm Emanuel, a White House adviser. ``At the core is a
political goal to embarrass this president.''
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, a White House deputy chief of staff, said Starr's
allegations are ``simply an attempt to drag all this sexual
material into the record for the purpose of humiliating the
president, and I think with the hopes of forcing him from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most damaging material to be released today will be
contained in 2,800 pages of documents, including the transcript of
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony and 20 FBI interviews with her. The
material includes many more details of sexual encounters and
sexually explicit phone conversations.

HERO WHO FOUND SUSPECT DECLINES OFFERS TO TELL STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fascinated by Cesar Quintero's incredible story,
tabloid magazines, a TV show and movie producers alike have offered
him thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   They've told him that he's a hero because he was a murder
suspect for a slaying he didn't commit _ and then exonerated
himself by finding the man whom police say is the real killer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Quintero has refused the offers, even though the money would
nicely supplement the salary from his job changing oil at an auto
shop. The 20-year-old Reseda man said he simply can't fathom
benefiting financially from the sorrow of the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them to think I'm taking advantage of what
happened to their son,'' Quintero said.
</P>
<P>
   For this, the mother of the victim said she is grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly appreciate that,'' said Lorraine Redden, grieving for
her son, Steve, 20, who was stabbed to death on Mother's Day.
``It's a tough thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden said she hasn't met Quintero, but ``now I really have to
see him to thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she, too, has been offered movie deals through
friends in the entertainment industry, but like Quintero, she
refused. ``Hey, excuse me,'' she said she told them, ``I lost a
20-year-old son. Sorry, I'm not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth it. I'll stay poor, because nothing is going to
bring my son back,'' Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero realizes why his story is so captivating. But he also
can't forget the trauma he and his family endured while police
investigated them until he found the man police say committed the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to deal with it anymore. It really scares me even
thinking about it _ spending the rest of my life in jail,'' he said
from his home in suburban Reseda recently.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer has offered him $3,000 if the tabloid
could interview him and use his picture, Quintero said. The
television news magazine show ``Extra'' also offered him a deal, as
well as various talk shows, Quintero said.
</P>
<P>
   But he turned them all down.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Detective Ron Vega, the main investigator on
the case, said movie and TV producers have contacted him for rights
to the story. But Vega said it's Quintero's prerogative to turn
down offers, and he will honor it as well and not take the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to deal with it. It's his way of dealing with it,''
Vega said. ``You want both, the right and left arm. If he's not
going to go for it, then I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Vega said the fact that Quintero exonerated himself by finding
the man who ended up charged with murder is no less than ``divine
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Vega and detectives believed Quintero was
responsible for the slaying. They said he fit eyewitness
descriptions of the man who killed Redden in North Hollywood
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero became the focus of a grueling investigation that
included his cousin, Rogelio Galindo. Detectives searched
Quintero's home and put him at the top of their suspect list in
mid-June but couldn't muster enough evidence to arrest him, let
alone seek charges.
</P>
<P>
   One day in June, Quintero was working at an oil-change shop when
in drove a red Fiero _ just like the one identified at the scene of
the stabbing and nearly identical to Quintero's. And then he saw
the driver, a man Quintero said resembled him so much that he could
have been his brother.
</P>
<P>
   It was Edgar Adolfo Barrientos, 20. Quintero alerted the police,
and now Barrientos is charged with murder. Barrientos has pleaded
not guilty to the slaying and is due to appear in Superior Court on
Friday for a pretrial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much money producers and editors offer Quintero,
he cannot help thinking of the families affected by the deadly
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand their sorrow,'' Quintero said. ``I don't
really care for that money. I don't think it's worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he'll take the $25,000 police reward that will
likely be offered to him for turning in the real suspect. It is
more than he earns in a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it compensation for what I went through,'' said
Quintero, adding that he plans to use the reward as tuition for an
automotive engineering degree.
</P>
<P>
   Vega has sent in an application recommending Quintero for the
reward, which must be formally approved by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   And Quintero did grant an interview to ``LAPD Life on the
Beat,'' a TV program that documents the workdays of officers on
patrol. But he will not be paid for the interview, which is
scheduled to air within the next few weeks, he said. Quintero said
he agreed to the interview as a public service.

   They include his mother (Linda Lavin), his overbearing sister

the cast, as a burned-out colleague of Conrad's.
</P>

   NBC overshot its natural limit of ``chickcoms'' _ they're
female, they're single, they're in the city, and they have lousy

</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that Feuerstein doesn't have the comedic heft
to carry a show, despite capable help from Lavin and a few other

by locating a software plant there.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Neal plays the older brother who once eclipsed Gosselaar.
Raymond J. Barry is their father. Sydney Penny is Gosselaar's sleek

HOW THE INTERNET COULD CHANGE PATIENT CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The Internet someday could revolutionize the way consumers relate
to their health plans and their doctors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But _ with one big exception _ you wouldn't ever guess that from
the Web pages produced by health plans today.
</P>
<P>
   All of California's largest health plans now have Web pages
aimed at their members and potential members. But most plans simply
use their Web pages as electronic brochures _ listing benefits they
offer or reprinting information that's already been published in
paper form.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Kaiser Permanente, which is boldly
experimenting with interactive services like online-advice nurses
and appointment-making and electronic discussion groups for
patients suffering from a common ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general impression is that most health plans are doing
marketing online, and Kaiser is the exception that is doing
something substantial,'' said Tom Ferguson, a University of Texas
professor who edits a newsletter about online health information.
</P>
<P>
   How COULD the Internet someday change the relationship between
health plans and their members?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when your medical records are available in a
private electronic file that you can view over the Internet.
Certain words in the file will link you to other Web resources: If
your doctor types in ``asthma,'' for instance, you might see links
to a half-dozen asthma support groups across the country or to a
bibliography of the latest asthma research.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when you routinely exchange e-mail with your
doctor or pharmacist. Or when you can consult with specialists in
New York by e-mail _ and show them your medical chart over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time when the claims process is entirely visible over
the Web so that you can see whether your health plan has processed
a particular bill. Or when you can file a complaint by e-mail and
get a response in just a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think the action in health on the Web will be in
providing information, but where it really will be is in
interaction and people-to-people connections,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, such innovative electronic services remain a distant
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what almost all health insurers now provide on their Web
sites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Descriptions of the plans they offer but not the prices for
each plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lists of doctors affiliated with their plan. Most health plan
Web sites let you type in your address and get names of nearby
doctors. Some sites give you more information than others _ such as
which hospitals each doctor works with, or whether doctors are
accepting new patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basic preventive health information, such as articles on
low-fat cooking, or timetables for when children should get
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some but not all sites provide the health plan's
formulary _ the list of drugs covered by the plan. A few offer
links to other health-related sites, such as the American Cancer
Society's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Some health plan Web pages feature information that looks
colorful but has little relevance to anyone's health.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross of California, for instance, has a site that might be
mistaken for a travel agency. It includes listings of where to rent
hot-air balloons in the Napa Valley or how much it costs to rent a
houseboat on Lake Shasta. (Visit the Web site at
www.bluecrossca.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What a state! You can surf Malibu one day and ski the Sierra
the next,'' Blue Cross says in the welcome to its site.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of plans provide in-depth health information that can
be extremely useful.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's site includes a health encyclopedia that it developed
with Johns Hopkins University, where visitors can search for
detailed information on everything from arthritis to vertigo. (Go
to www.aetnaushc.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kaiser offers a 20,000-page online health
encyclopedia _ much more information than can be found in the
150-page printed health handbook typically given to Kaiser members.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's health encyclopedia is part of an experimental
interactive Web site that it's gradually rolling out to members in
Northern California, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The members-only site is at www.kponline.org, which is different
from Kaiser's general corporate Web site. It is expected to be
available to all Northern California Kaiser members by the end of
this year. (Non-members can tour the site at
www.kaiserpermanente.org /membersonly/overview.htm.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's members-only site offers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Online health assessments that identify your biggest health
risk and provide links to follow-up information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online access to advice nurses and pharmacists, who will
respond by e-mail within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online appointment making.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online discussion groups on topics ranging from HIV to
parenting. Some are moderated by doctors and nurses, while others
are led by rank-and-file Kaiser members who have received special
training.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials say they envision a ``virtual medical center''
that will someday meet as wide a range of patient needs as today's
brick-and-mortar medical centers do.
</P>
<P>
   Such a goal may be easier to achieve for Kaiser than for other
health plans, which don't have their own doctors, pharmacies and
hospitals all under one corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's current lead in Web services is due partly to this
centralization: Kaiser doesn't have to cajole dozens of different
doctors' groups into linking their appointment books with its
computer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also due to some forethought. Kaiser started looking at how
interactive technology could help its members as early as 1992.
That's given the HMO time to work out issues like how to protect
patient confidentiality, while allowing online interactions.
</P>
<P>
   But other health plans are likely to follow Kaiser down this
path as quickly as they can. Health Net and Blue Cross, for
instance, say they're almost ready to let members check the status
of claims online.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how far down the road you look, the Web doesn't
replace in-person care or telephone access,'' said Tim Kieschnik,
who is overseeing Kaiser's Internet strategy. ``Medicine will
always have a hands-on component. However, a lot of pieces of
medicine can be greatly enhanced by using the Web. We just need to
use it to connect the patient with the physician, rather than to
keep patients and physicians apart.''

WHAT TO DO ABOUT A BULLY IN THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I have a small but irritating problem with a co-worker. Every
time he sees me, he insists on calling me by a nickname,
``Stretch.'' (I am a tall woman.) I've asked him repeatedly to stop
it, but like a schoolyard bully, he apparently takes great pleasure
from the fact that it annoys me. I don't want to bring something
this trivial to the attention of management, though I sometimes
have wondered whether it verges on sexual harassment, given its
unwelcome nature. How should I handle this?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; You're smart not to take this issue to management. The last
thing a supervisor wants is to be dragged into the role of
playground monitor in personal spats. And this doesn't fit the
definition of sexual harassment because there's nothing sexual or
gender-based about it.
</P>
<P>
   I posed your question to Ronna Lichtenberg, author of the book
``Work Would Be Great If It Weren't for the People: Ronna and Her
Evil Twin's Guide to Making Office Politics Work for You.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenberg happens to be short, and she has had to deal with
co-workers who insisted on calling her ``Little Missy.'' She tried
everything from being ``super-aggressive'' to calling them
nicknames in turn, and nothing ever stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice? Ignore him and don't let the nickname bug you. In
fact, think of it as a compliment. He may come from a family where
people show affection for each other by nice and not-so-nice
nicknames. Or he may be jealous of your abilities and is looking
for a way to bring you down a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should just let go of this,'' Lichtenberg advises. ``As
soon as you get to the point where you enjoy it and think it's
funny, he'll stop doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a good idea to sit down and reflect a bit about
why his name-calling gets under your skin so much.
</P>
<P>
   Plan a response to help you keep your cool: Remind yourself
before work each morning that if he passes you in the hallway and
says, ``Hey, Stretch,'' you'll just smile, nod and keep walking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I'm a midlevel manager. When I'm applying for a job, how do
I know if the number of stock options I'm being offered is
competitive?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; This is a simple question with no simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options are an increasingly common employment perk _ the
right to buy a certain number of shares of the company's stock at a
certain price.
</P>
<P>
   There are some general rules about how options are distributed.
Generally, high-ranking executives in a company get more options
than people at middle and low levels.
</P>
<P>
   And startup firms are likely to offer more options than big
established firms _ because startups use options as a way to make
up for salaries that are lower and jobs that are less secure than
at bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond such general guidelines, things get cloudy. Unlike
salaries, there are no public surveys of how many options are
granted in different industries or professions.
</P>
<P>
   Some compensation experts have developed their own formulas to
determine the size and value of options packages. Matt Ward, CEO of
WestWard Pay Strategies in San Francisco, tells his corporate
clients that the median options package for a high-tech executive
earning $112,500 a year amounts to 36.1 percent of his or her base
salary, or $40,569. The median options package for someone in high
tech earning $62,500 a year is 23 percent of base salary, or
$14,390.
</P>
<P>
   But other compensation experts say it's impossible to come up
with a one-size-fits-all formula. And even if you do settle on a
figure like 23 percent of base salary, there's a lot of guesswork
involved in determining the potential dollar-value of the options.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you're offered the option to buy stock at $5 a share in
a company that hasn't gone public yet. It's anybody's guess whether
the company will go public at $6 or $13, or whether it will flop
before it ever gets on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty, there are still a few useful questions
you can ask. Try to find out if there's a standard options package
for current employees at your level _ and whether what you're being
offered is comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Also ask how many shares of stock the company has issued. That
partly will determine the value of the options you're being
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one client company with just 1,200 shares of stock
outstanding, so every single option is worth a lot,'' said Bill
Metzger, a compensation analyst with Assets Unlimited in Campbell.
``I have another client company with 250 million share outstanding.
Obviously, one option there is not worth as much.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I've worked as a bank teller for nine years, which often
involves lifting heavy boxes of coins. Last March, I started
feeling severe back pain and went out on short-term disability
leave. My doctor initially wrote that the problem came about from
my doing housework, rather than from my job. But last month, I had
further tests that found a lot of damage to my spine and a
herniated disk. The doctor now says the injury is the bank's fault
and that I should apply for workers' compensation. Can I do this
even though he initially diagnosed it as unrelated to work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Yes, you still can receive workers' comp even if your
doctor initially misdiagnosed the cause of your injury _ as long as
your injury truly is work-related.
</P>
<P>
   You can apply for workers' comp benefits anytime within a year
of when you found out that your injury was work related, according
to Julius Young, a workers' comp attorney with Boxer &AMP; Gerson in
Oakland. In your case, that would give you until August 1999 to
file your application.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your doctor writes a report that clearly explains why
he or she changed the diagnosis and explains how these new tests
showed that your injury was related to work.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' comp insurance company may send you to a doctor of
their own choice for a second opinion. If the insurance company
denies your claim, you have the choice of seeking a third medical
opinion to back up your own doctor or hiring a lawyer to fight the
denial.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it may be worth hiring an attorney even before your
claim is denied _ if the insurance company wants to take a legal
statement from you. ``Is this a person who can legally fend for
herself? Or is there a risk that the insurer's lawyer might put
words in her mouth?'' said Young. ``If that's the case, she should
get her own lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   To find a good lawyer, talk to friends who have filed successful
workers' comp claims. Look in the Yellow Pages for a lawyer who is
a certified workers' comp specialist. Or call the California
Applicant Attorneys Association at (916) 444-5155.

MINORU NIIZUMA, 67, SCULPTOR AND EDUCATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, N.Y.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Minoru Niizuma, a sculptor and educator who taught at
the Brooklyn Museum of Art and Columbia University, died on Sept. 5
at the University Hospital and Medical Center of Stony Brook on
Long Island. He was 67 and lived in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a stroke, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma was born in Tokyo in 1930 and graduated from the
National Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1955. He moved to New
York in 1959 and had his first solo show in New York at the Howard
Wise Gallery in 1966. He was subsequently represented by the Gimpel
&AMP; Weitzenhoffer Gallery in New York and Zurich, Switzerland. He had
retrospectives at the Seibu Museum of Art in Tokyo in 1976 and at
the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School from 1964 to
1970, and then taught sculpture at Columbia University for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Niizuma worked predominantly in stone,
especially marble, and was known for his sensitive use of its
textures and veins. His designs ranged from the geometric to the
organic and sometimes used patterns reminiscent of folk art,
fabrics and ritual vessels.
</P>
<P>
   His work is represented in public collections in the United
States, Europe and Japan, including the Museum of Modern Art, the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and
the National Museum of Modern Art in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Niizuma is survived by his wife, Yuko; three sons, Ta Andre, of
Tokyo, and Ko Christopher and Arata Peter, of New York, and one
grandchild.

NEW FIRM CAN HELP RESOLVE PROBLEMS WITH HEALTH INSURER  
 BY ILANA DEBARE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Frustrated because your health insurer won't pay for the drugs you
need? Fed up because you can't get a referral to a specialist? Or
simply stumped about how to choose a health plan?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Care Counsel is a new San Rafael company that helps people
resolve such health insurance dilemmas _ as part of their employee
benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   Care Counsel contracts with employers who pay a fixed monthly
sum of approximately $1 to $1.50 per worker. Those workers then can
call up Care Counsel any time they need help navigating the complex
world of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have long been able to hire lawyers or other advocates
to represent them on an individual basis in health care disputes.
But Care Counsel is the first firm in California to sell
patient-advocacy services as an employee benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say it hasn't arrived a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more bang for our buck with Care Counsel than with any
other benefit we provide,'' said Lon Records, CEO of Target
Specialty Products, a Los Angeles County distributor of specialty
agricultural chemicals that signed up with Care Counsel last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first wrote up this idea several years ago, people gave
me blank stares,'' said Care Counsel CEO Lawrence Gelb. ``Now, I
tell people what we do and everyone says, `That's a great idea.' ''
Care Counsel is still small. Founded last year, it now covers about
10,000 workers and family members at three companies, including San
Francisco's Fritz Cos. It hasn't yet turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But Gelb hopes to expand the firm's client base to 100,000
workers and family members by the end of 1999 _ well past his
estimated breakeven of 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb came up with the idea for Care Counsel after years spent
working for employee-assistance programs, advising workers with
mental health or substance abuse problems on how to get help from
their health plans. In 1992, the program he worked for was bought
by a large health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working inside (the HMO) really reinforced my belief in the
need for a third force to help consumers work through these
cumbersome bureaucracies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict that demand for Care Counsel's kind of
service will be limited to small or midsize firms. They say most
big firms can field basic health coverage questions through their
own personnel departments and should have enough clout with health
plans to demand good service for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most large employers, this should be unnecessary,'' said
Jeffrey Klonoff, manager of the employee-benefits consulting group
at Hewitt Associates in San Francisco. ``If you need a third party
to continuously advocate for your employees, there's a problem with
the employer/health plan relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Target Specialty Products, top executives started
looking for some kind of outside patient-advocacy service long
before they'd ever heard of Care Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees of the 110-person firm had faced major
problems in getting the care they needed from their health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Records, the CEO, had to call up the plan himself to make sure
that one employee who needed heart surgery was able to get it. He
lobbied personally on behalf of another employee who was being
denied access to a cancer specialist at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the time to do that for every employee,'' Records
said. ``Care Counsel fills a big, big gap in the health care chain
that really needed filling. It's given me a great deal of peace of
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employee calls that Care Counsel gets are far less
dramatic than the life-or-death disputes that Records fielded.
</P>
<P>
   The most common ones, Gelb said, are from people who are
perplexed about choosing a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   One recent call was from Nancy Voorhees, a Bay Area sales
representative for Target Specialty who lives in Half Moon Bay.
Voorhees' 6-year-old daughter, Kirsten, had broken her leg while
skiing last spring. Voorhees took Kirsten by ambulance to a Truckee
hospital where she had surgery and stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks later, her daughter's cast was off. But her health
plan still hadn't paid the $6,000 in medical bills. Voorhees was
getting threatening notices from the hospital but couldn't reach a
live person at her insurer. She was missing important phone calls
at work because she was spending 15-minute blocks of time listening
to &UR;  &LR; Muzak on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Care Counsel and faxed them the bills I was
getting,'' Voorhees said. ``They followed up. Every single day,
they'd call and tell me what they'd managed to find out. It was a
total relief, especially because they kept calling me to tell me
when things were resolved. I could just wash my hands of the whole
thing.''

WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN PICKING A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Autumn is here, along with the shopping season that fills many
consumers with dread.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not holiday shopping _ health plan shopping.
</P>
<P>
   September marks the start of open enrollment, the month or two
each year when most companies let their employees change health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about how to make the best choice so your plan leaves
you healthier and happier, rather than raising your blood pressure
with red tape and runarounds?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. Things are getting easier, thanks to tried-and-true
guidelines and a growing number of independent ratings you can use
to compare plans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the California Cooperative Healthcare Reporting
Initiative _ a coalition of health care purchasers, plans and
providers _ released its annual report card on health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California health plans that scored the best in
member satisfaction were Kaiser Permanente and Health Plan of the
Redwoods. The ones that scored the best in preventive care were
Kaiser and Lifeguard. (See charts on pages B3 and B4.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Business Group on Health released a similar report
card last week, rating HMOs and hospitals. (See the PBGH Web site
at www.healthscope.org or call (888) 244-2124 for a copy.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW SERVICES
</P>
<P>
   Health plans are touting a number of new services this year. If
these interest you, ask if they're offered by any of the plans
you're considering:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Advice lines. &LR;  More plans now offer 24-hour health advice
lines staffed by nurses _ a useful service when it's 3 a.m. and
your child is running a 103-degree fever. Kaiser has gone a step
further, offering access to nurses over the Internet. (See story on
Page B3.)
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Doctor ratings. &LR;  Last year, the Pacific Business Group on
Health drew up a report card on doctors groups around the state,
and it plans to issue an updated version this winter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, two HMOs _ PacifiCare and Health Net _ decided to
issue their own report cards on doctors in their networks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Such ratings can help you choose a doctors' group. The ratings
are also an incentive for doctors to improve, so in the long run
they may raise the overall quality of health care within a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that the (doctors') groups with the best
practices will accrue the most members,'' said Dr. Sam Ho, vice
president of PacifiCare. ``We want to use the marketplace to
improve the quality of care by our providers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Third-party review. &LR;  Health Net launched a new program this
year that lets members appeal medical decisions to an outside body
and get an answer within 30 days _ the first such program offered
by a California HMO. So if your request to see a specialist outside
the Health Net system is denied, there's a quick way to challenge
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very positive development and an important step in
reinforcing the trust people have in their health plan,'' said
Margaret Stanley, health benefits administrator for the California
Public Employees Retirement System, a major purchaser of health
insurance for state workers.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Speedy referrals. &LR;  HMOs used to require members to get a
referral from their primary care doctor every time they wanted to
see a specialist. But now some plans will let you go directly to
certain specialists like allergists or gynecologists, without
having to get a referral from your primary care doctor.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Health support programs.  &LR; Most health plans now offer programs
aimed at fostering good health _ everything from parenting classes
to health club discounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Alternative medicine.  &LR; Most health plans are continuing to
expand their coverage of alternative medicine, such as acupuncture
and chiropractic treatments. Blue Cross of California, for
instance, started offering a rider to its standard policies this
year that will pay for herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   SAGE ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   With all these new bells and whistles, health care experts say
you still shouldn't neglect some old guidelines when choosing a
health plan:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Start by choosing a doctor and/or medical group.  &LR; When HMO
members choose a primary care doctor, they're automatically
choosing that doctor's medical group.
</P>
<P>
   Your selection of a medical group may prove to be even more
important than your choice of a health plan. Medical groups set
many of the rules for treatment and referrals. They determine which
hospital you'll be admitted to and which specialists you'll be able
to see.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Make sure the doctor you've chosen is accepting new &LR; 
 &UR; patients.  &LR; Sometimes doctors listed as part of an HMO's network
have stopped taking new patients.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Consider your personal medical needs.  &LR; If someone in your
family has mental health problems, which plan will pay for the most
counseling sessions? If you're having trouble getting pregnant,
which plan will cover fertility treatments? Some plans cover things
like hospice care or orthopedic shoes, while others don't.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ If there's a particular medication you need, ask to see &LR; 
 &UR; each plan's formulary _ the list of drugs that it covers. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Compare out-of-pocket costs.  &LR; These might include monthly
premiums and co-payments for doctor visits, drugs and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are the least expensive kind of plan, but usually limit you
to a list of doctors affiliated with the plan. Preferred provider
organizations (PPOs) give you more choice in doctors, but will end
up costing you more in premiums and co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   Want more information on the different kinds of health plans and
how to choose among them?
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union offers a three-page tip sheet on choosing a
health plan that you can get by calling (415) 431-6747 or going to
www.consunion.org on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco, also
offers a brochure on choosing an HMO. Send a self-addressed
envelope with 55 cents in postage to Consumer Action/HMO, 717
Market St. 310, San Francisco, Calif. 94103. Or visit its Web site

`WILL &AMP; GRACE' HAS THE RIGHT STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The TV season is official right now, today, Monday, Year of Our
Tube 50 or so, but who's counting when we're having this much fun?
</P>
<P>
   Synchronize those watches. Secure snacks, sit down, await
further instructions.
</P>
<P>
   And what a night this is, with six new network series (first
instruction: gasp excitedly) premiering in one heart-pounding
evening.
</P>
<P>
   You even have critical dispensation to watch two of them _
``Will &AMP; Grace'' on NBC and ``L.A. Doctors'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is keenly anticipated because it is the first
post-``Ellen'' sign of gay topicality on big-time TV. It's also a
slick, relatively sophisticated comedy. But that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) are best friends
in New York who will, sometime after Monday night's premiere,
become roommates.
</P>
<P>
   She's straight, he's gay. The show's co-creator, Max Mutchnick,
is also gay. And, just to get this over with, Grace has a sex life.
Will, having conveniently just broken up with someone or other,
won't have a sex life anytime soon. Mutchnick _ well, we don't know
about Mutchnick.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is. After ``Ellen,'' gay romance may be so slow that
you don't even see it happening. The word from NBC is that ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' is simply a series about a male-female relationship
unencumbered by sex. Sometimes they call this marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's pilot begins with a tease. Will and Grace are in
separate beds, exchanging pillow talk over the phone, until at last
it's clear that they'll always play in separate stadiums. Then the
show thickens into Will advising Grace not to marry her boyfriend,
Grace taking offense, and finally a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl, but with a whole
new slant to the ancient ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The two leads work nicely together _ Messing, a beauty with a
comic flair, has been in search of the right vehicle ever since
Fox's ``Ned and Stacey'' _ James Burrows' direction is as sharp as
usual, the writing is above average and the supporting cast is an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Mullally is a wealthy flake amusing herself as Karen, the
secretary for Grace's interior-design business. Sean Hayes is
Will's flamer friend, Jack, who insists that most people assume
he's straight. ``Jack,'' says Will, ``blind and deaf people know
you're gay. Dead people know you're gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Jack protests, Grace didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Grace: ``My (set ital)dog(end ital) knew.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``L.A. Doctors'' bears more than a comfortable resemblance
to ``L.A. Law,'' raising prospects for an entire ``L.A.'' franchise
down the road. ``L.A. Accountants,'' ``L.A. Bankers'' and, perhaps
suitable for late night, ``L.A. Talent Agents.''
</P>
<P>
   But if one TV show is going to resemble another, at least ``L.A.
Law'' is a respectable model.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cattan (Ken Olin), Tim Lonner (Matt Craven) and Evan
Newman (Rick Roberts) are three doctors who open their own clinic
and, Monday night, recruit another physician, Sarah Church (Sheryl
Lee), to join them.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to see the characterizations take shape _
Cattan as the materialistic Arnie Becker type, Lonner as the
earnest practitioner and family man, Newman as an idealistic
divorced doctor who'll probably become the show's top romantic gun
and Church as the distaff altruist.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' is CBS' best shot in two seasons at a fall
keeper, and the show appears to be carefully refined for the
network. Its look and attitude suggest an NBC demographic _ younger
Baby Boomers _ but the storytelling is cautious and linear, to
include the older CBS crowd. Clever, really.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather still be watching Olin wend his way through the
corrupt netherworld of ``EZ Streets,'' but maybe ``L.A. Doctors''
is the commercial hit he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   If you caught an ABC show called ``That's Life'' last season,
you've essentially seen CBS' ``The King of Queens.'' You wouldn't
brag about watching either show. Still, as blue-collar comedies go,
not horrible. But ``That's Life'' is gone and forgotten, which
might not bode well for ``The King of Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about a delivery guy in Queens, N.Y. (Kevin James), who's
happily married (Leah Remini plays his wife) and doubly delighted
to have a new TV set that's roughly the size of an aircraft
carrier. Then he ends up having to share his little house with his
crude father-in-law (Jerry Stiller) and sister-in-law (Lisa
Rieffel).
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, more noise than humor ensues. There's something kind
of sweet and sad about James, though. He reminds me of Jackie
Gleason's old ``Poor Soul'' character.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``The Brian Benben Show'' finds the star of HBO's ``Dream

LEMON DROP KID MUDDIES JUVENILE PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The leading 2-year-old colt in the country, Yes
It's True, the winner in six of his seven starts, tripped over a
bump on the long road to the Kentucky Derby Sunday when he was run
down in the homestretch of the Belmont Futurity and beaten by a
neck by his foremost rival, Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second victory in four starts for Lemon Drop Kid, a
son of Kingmambo and grandson of Seattle Slew. But it was the
second of the day for Jeanne Vance, his owner, and Scotty
Schulhofer, his trainer, who also won the fifth race with a
3-year-old filly named Sequence, with John Velazquez riding both.
</P>
<P>
   Yes It's True seemed to have a lot of high cards in his hand
entering the race. He is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, a master at
developing juvenile horses, and he already had won four stakes. But
he lent credence to some suspicions about his range when he led his
four rivals into the homestretch after some slow fractions, led the
hard-closing Lemon Drop Kid by two lengths as they neared the
finish, then yielded.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, Lemon Drop Kid had half a length on the beaten
favorite, who had nine lengths on Medievil Hero. The winner ran the
mile in 1:37 2/5 on a dull track, paid $14.80 for a $2 bet to win
and earned $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of figured there'd be a slow pace,'' Schulhofer said.
``But at the end, he really dug in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas agreed that the pace had been slow and said: ``It's a
learning process. But we might have gotten ourselves a little bit
too relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the twin stakes for fillies, the 12-1 long shot Oh What a
Windfall outran the three top choices in the Matron when she
outlasted Arrested Dreams by a nose after a rousing duel down the
homestretch. She also outran the next two favorites, Marley Vale,
who finished third, and Confessional, fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Confessional, a daughter of Holy Bull, ran up front for nearly
three-quarters of a mile, then was collared by Arrested Dreams, who
was nailed in the deep stretch by Oh What a Windfall. The winner,
sired by Seeking the Gold and trained by Shug McGaughey for Ogden
Phipps, ran the mile in 1:39 1/5 under Shane Sellers, paid $27 for
$2 and earned $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her debut in July by 20 lengths, won her second start,
and then lost the Spinaway by 11 lengths. She is a sister to
Heavenly Prize, one of the former stars of the Phipps barn.
Sellers, riding her for the first time in place of the injured Mike
Smith, said: ``When I saw her in the paddock, she looked like a
typical Phipps horse _ big, long and good-looking. You know,
they're all bred to run.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Backstage at Belmont, where Skip Away was holding court, the
king was declared fit after his resounding victory in the Woodward
on Saturday, and Sonny Hine reported: ``He acts like he wants to go
again. He'll walk for a couple of days, then go back to training.''
</P>
<P>
   Next for Skip Away, who has won nine straight stakes and $9.5
million: the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park on Oct. 10, which
he has won the last two years. The purse is $1 million, the
winner's share $600,000, which would vault Skip Away past Cigar
into the $10 million bracket, where no race horse has trod before.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, who ran second in the Woodward, was said to be
leaning toward the $200,000 Kelso Handicap at one mile on the turf
at Belmont Park on Oct. 17, then the Breeders' Cup Mile on the
grass. But Dick Mandella, his trainer, said the Jockey Club Gold
Cup was still a possibility. Running Stag, the horse from Europe
who finished third at 43-1, will stay at Belmont and run in the
Gold Cup. Free House, who ran a disappointing fourth, did not have
a future plan in place.
</P>
<P>
   As for Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old star who led Skip Away
for nearly half a mile before tiring and finishing fifth and last,
he was also a mystery. But McGaughey, his trainer, said the colt
had come out of the race well, and added: ``Just draw a line
through that race and cross it out. He didn't fire at all. We tried
to do things a little too quickly with this horse by running him.
Nobody was going to beat Skip Away, anyway.''

HEALTH-PLAN'S CLINICS ELIMINATING LANGUAGE BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE BROWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
SAN FRANCISCO _ Kaiser Permanente had a serious problem with its
Chinese members three years ago: They were leaving the health plan
faster than any other ethnic group.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Kaiser's San Francisco Medical Center
established a specialized clinic to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off. With the help of the clinic, the HMO actually
saw its market share of Chinese-speaking patients grow by 1,600
members last year, exceeding its original target of 1,200 members.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores the importance that the HMO attaches to
accommodating the needs of a growing number of patients who speak
English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, patient surveys in 1995 by Kaiser Permanente pointed out
that language was considered the biggest barrier for patients
during medical visits.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO not only has a specialized clinic or ``module'' at its
medical center to serve Chinese-speaking patients, it also has a
clinic for Spanish-speaking ones.
</P>
<P>
   These clinics have separate offices and facilities as well as a
shared waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doctors, the support staff _ including clerical
staff, medical assistants and nursing staff _ is bilingual and
bicultural.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic modules offer a range of related services, including
interpreting (face-to-face) services and written translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is hard enough for English-speaking people to
maneuver, let alone non-English speaking clients,'' said Gayle
Tang, director of cultural competence for Northern California at
Kaiser Permanente. ``The major focus of these (ethnic) clinics is
to provide language-appropriate, culturally relevant health care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first step in addressing a very multicultural
population,'' adds Dennis Lum, a Kaiser Permanente official.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of setting up the clinics have been nominal. Lum said
the major cost has gone to marketing research ($30,000), with the
remainder achieved through organizational restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Forty languages now are spoken at the medical center. ``We know
we can't do every ethnic community at once,'' Tang says. ``So the
initial focus was on the largest groups in the San Francisco area,
the Chinese and Latino communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the San Francisco Medical Center's 160,000 members,
one-sixth are Chinese _ that is, more than 27,000 patients, 80
percent of whom do not speak English as their native language.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials said they have been able to monitor the
movement of Chinese-speaking patients through their system by
tracking their surnames. That isn't possible, however, with the
Latino patient population.
</P>
<P>
   Tang, a registered nurse and medical anthropologist, says Kaiser
recently added language-preference data to the computer information
for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in to receive health care, the position we're
taking is `What language do you PREFER to speak in?' and `Which is
your preferred written language?' Many patients prefer to receive
material in their own language.''
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, Kaiser has developed a bilingual
Chinese-language newsletter that is distributed to more than 14,000
members. It also has a special phone hotline for Chinese patients,
and it publishes patient handbooks for Spanish- and
Chinese-speaking members.
</P>
<P>
   In the modules, at least three certified medical interpreters
who speak Chinese and other Asian languages are available every
day. There also are at least two Spanish-speaking interpreters on
hand in the Latino module.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bay Area HMOs, including Blue Cross, HealthNet and
CaliforniaCare, are making inroads in outreach to ethnic patient
populations. All provide translated patient information materials,
offer multicultural patient-appreciation days and open houses, and
provide interpreter services.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaiser Permanente, with its bilingual modules, is the most
proactive Bay Area HMO in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language issue as it relates to health care is very
personal _ it's kind of like food,'' Tang says. ``When people are
sick, they tend to go back to what makes them most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, if you had asked me which language I would
prefer to get my health care in, I would have said English,'' says
Tang, who has lived in the United States since age 10. ``But now, I
would say Cantonese. When I became seriously ill two years ago, I
found myself wishing for a Chinese-speaking doctor. It really hit
home _ this is how our patients must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   All eight doctors in Kaiser's Bilingual Chinese Module speak
both Chinese and English. Apart from Cantonese, four are fluent in
Mandarin and four in Toishanese.
</P>
<P>
   The Western approach to health concerns can be foreign to people
from other cultures, Tang says.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in the Chinese module, our physicians must be competent as
far as the culture goes,'' Tang says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the model is still (the) Western biochemical model,
our doctors need to understand and accept alternative medicine,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese- and Spanish-speaking patients are not forced into the
ethnic modules, Tang stresses. ``We ask them for their preferences.
Sometimes, they say, `No, I'd rather use an interpreter and see a
white doctor.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome on patient health is direct,'' she says. As a
nurse who worked in ob-gyn, Tang says she saw too many women coming
in with end-stage cancer, when intervention could have happened if
they were comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese patients would postpone consultation because they feared
making appointments by phone and feared seeing a doctor and being
unable to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These patients can be labeled as `difficult' or
`nonresponsive,' '' Tang says, ``when it may be that we are not
doing our job in communicating.''

TIRE TROUBLES LEAVE DRIVERS FLAT AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As far back as anyone can remember, Goodyear
has made a tire Indy-car drivers and owners swear by.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway, Goodyear brought a tire that
car owner A.J. Foyt was swearing at.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, the notoriously short-fused owner of cars driven by Kenny
Brack and Billy Boat, let loose a profanity-laced tirade after a
shredded right rear tire, his second puncture of the day, caused
Boat's car to crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodyear brought the hard-compound tire,'' said Foyt, who
spent part of his day in the pits, personally inspecting his cars'
tires. ``I told them not to bring it. They did anyway, and now
we're paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's drivers weren't the only ones. In all, nine drivers in
yesterday's Lone Star 500K lost ground as a result of cut or
blistered tires _ seven of them on Goodyears. Boat and Scott Sharp
each had two blowouts, the second of which ran them into the wall.
Boat was able to return to the track, but his chance for a second
consecutive victory at TMS was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Contenders Jeff Ward and Davey Hamilton both had problems with
their Goodyears late in the race, while Brack, the Indy Racing
League points leader, said his tires forced him to run
conservatively rather than making a run at victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a race of survival,'' Brack said, ``and that's
not how I like to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear officials weren't thrilled with it, either. Lead
engineer Todd Carpenter fell short of ``mea culpa,'' but did say
the company, which has provided tires for the winners of seven of
the 10 IRL races this year, was ``disappointed with our tire
performance today.''
</P>
<P>
   One Goodyear official apologized to the drivers for the tires,
admitting they were unable to hold up in the heat generated on the
track. When the race began at 2 p.m., Goodyear engineers measured
the track temperature at 140 degrees. The heat caused the tire
pressure to increase, making the tires more susceptible to damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodyear is a great company, but they had a bad day,'' Boat
said. ``I don't think anyone there expected to see these kinds of
tire temperatures. To win this race, you had to baby your tires.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, you were riding on Firestones, which proved to
be far more durable. Winner John Paul Jr. ran as many as 87 laps on
a single set of tires and had no problems all day. The only
punctures for Firestone drivers came from running over debris on
the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tires have consistently held up better in the heat,''
Firestone spokesman Mark Robinson said. ``That's one of the
trademarks of our tires.''

CAMPO'S STATURE ALONE CAN'T MAKE DEFENSE BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny how these things work. Last week in Denver, Dave Campo,
respected NFL defensive coordinator, had his head handed to him by
Mike Shanahan, respected NFL offensive mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, much more goes into the process than simply Campo being
out-football-foxed by Shanahan. But the bottom line in the media
and among fandom will always read as such.
</P>
<P>
   Like what happened a year ago when the Cowboys opened the '97
season in Pittsburgh. That was a Denver role reversal for Campo,
who was widely credited with a brilliant game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers' offensive coordinator seemed to stay a play behind
all day. Campo stripped him naked and hid his clothes. Six months
later, a fully dressed Chan Gailey showed up at Valley Ranch to be
introduced as the new head coach of the Cowboys. He was hired, of
course, for his offensive mind.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of story: Base nothing on one bad game, or for that
matter, one good game. Those who can coach, will. And over a period
of weeks, months and seasons, the Gaileys on offense and the Campos
on defense prove their worth.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is absolutely no consolation to Campo after
what happened in that first-half-from-hell last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction,'' Campo said, ``was personal embarrassment.
My second reaction was being hacked off. I'd say both are normal
when something like that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo admitted his immediate postgame coaching thought was not
to dwell long on what had been defensive doomsday in Denver. During
the past week at Valley Ranch, he mainly isolated himself from the
media, and hunkered down in preparing for the Giants tonight at the
Meadowlands. But the Broncos-bust also wouldn't quickly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things concern me,'' he said late last week. ``One, make
sure all of us are totally prepared for the Giants. Denver is gone.
This is a new challenge. But the second concern is putting out any
lingering fire from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the physical preparation in the world for the Giants won't
have us ready Monday night if there's a psychological aftershock.
To forget it, however, we first had to talk about it. And the good
thing is, I really like what I've heard and seen from our players
all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo was asked to keep it simple in explaining the Mile High
low. ``As basic as I can make it,'' he said, ``is they came out in
formations against our packages that we were not ready for. They
gave us new looks, and as a group, starting with me, we didn't
handle the adjustments well at all. Confusion _ yes. Panic _
some.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the halftime dressing room, defensive despair gave way
to regrouping. The Broncos came out with the same offensive plan in
the third quarter, but 35 points late, the Cowboys had most all of
the defensive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily see the second half as a silver lining,
but I do appreciate the players not quitting after halftime,''
Campo said. ``Chan gave the challenge in the locker room that we at
least try to leave there with our heads held high. And as a team,
nobody packed it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense, built almost totally on a running game, is
much more simplistic than Denver's. ``But,'' Campo said, ``it
wouldn't surprise me to see them try to do some of the things
Denver did. Probably not, but we have to be ready for it. When you
are beaten like we were beaten, every team may want a piece of
that. Can't say I blame 'em, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver, of course, was all about the Cowboys being whiplashed by
the big play. ``Those are correctable,'' Campo said. ``As bad as it
was, it would have been much worse if they'd kept grinding us down
one play after another. That's when it becomes hopeless. This is
not hopeless at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver was a very bad day and out of character for our
defense. We will be a good defense this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That last statement from Campo died when I didn't care to second
the motion. Who stops the run? Who rushes the passer? The Cowboys
had the same questions last season, and despite a bogus No. 2
defensive ranking, there was no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, for now anyway, is ignoring any temptation to return to
last season's ill-fated desperation strategy of wild-eyed blitzing
to create pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want that, and we can get pressure without it,'' he
said. ``I know it doesn't look that way now, but it's a long
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett's best friend tonight would be a defense that
makes it a low-scoring game. Campo's worst enemy, however, would be
any lingering Denver demons.
</P>
<P>
   Only Campo's excellent track record allows us to consider the
possibility of things being much improved a week later. Even so,
coaching respect can only carry a guy so far, then players have to
play. Otherwise, a lot of Denvers will happen.

WHITE HOUSE STRUGGLING FOR A WAY TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to insert word ``no'' in seventh graf.)  (See also: CLINTON-RDP, CLINTON-BLACKCAUCUS, CLINTON-HILLARY,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He goes to work, they go to work. He keeps his chin
up, they keep their heads down. But nothing is quite the same for
President Clinton and his senior aides, advisers and friends these
days, and they make little pretense that the White House is other
than a shaken, static place, groping for a way to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't talk about this,'' said one longtime aide,
speaking, like all his colleagues, on condition of anonymity. ``I
honestly don't know who he's talking to.'' But, this aide added of
the president, ``There's now a whole man I've never even met. I
don't believe anything any more from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime adviser said: ``He's always pretty tough,
resolute when we talk,'' but added, ``I try to really avoid saying,
`How are you feeling?'''
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide in a Cabinet department, who has been with
Clinton since the 1992 campaign, said: ``The one thing that
dominates over there more than anything else is a sense of sadness,
especially among what's left of the old guard. They're having a
wake for someone who's not dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, as the White House braces for the release on Monday
of the president's videotaped testimony before Kenneth Starr's
grand jury, aides acknowledge that no one knows quite what to do
about an impeachment process that is rolling along under its own
power on Capitol Hill and not susceptible to White House influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oddly powerless time,'' one senior aide said. ``We're
passengers on the bus, and someone else is driving the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The daily 8 a.m. staff strategy session led by John Podesta, the
deputy chief of staff, usually a scene of jocular intensity
punctuated by ironic jeremiads from the senior aide Rahm Emanuel,
is ``recently just grim,'' according to one aide who can no longer
bear to attend, though another who still goes said that some of
``the raucous, gallows humor has returned.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the laughs in the West Wing come in lieu of tears, when
the press office lists the roster of guests on the Sunday talk
shows and the line-up invariably boils down to faceoffs between
Clinton's Republican congressional critics and his Democratic ones,
and the practical talk involves making sure the president will not
be close enough to reporters to risk unwanted questions.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official summed up the feeling of futility:
``There's no great amount of, shall we say, organization there.
What power does this White House have?''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official was even blunter, saying,
``There's no White House there.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reich, Clinton's former labor secretary and friend of 30
years, said on ABC's ``Nightline'' last week: ``We have almost a
virtual impeachment, a Potemkin president. He's going through the
motions of being a president, but he doesn't have very much power
or authority left.''
</P>
<P>
   Penetrating the mood of the president and his inner circle is
dicey in the best of times, since the White House is at once a huge
public stage and a place of deep secrets, as the Monica Lewinsky
affair itself shows. Now more than ever, insiders keep their own
counsel and outsiders are reduced to studying shadows and proferred
peeks past the veil.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, aides insist that Clinton's famous capacity for
compartmentalizing his life has once again come to the fore, and he
``takes solace in his work,'' one aide says. The president keeps to
his schedule, raising money for Democratic candidates, touching
base with interest groups, campaigning for his policies, like, for
example, a patient's bill of medical rights, which he touted in a
speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
convention here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president began those remarks by saying how much his wife
liked the group, then surprised his speechwriters by ad-libbing a
riff sympathizing with well-meaning bureaucrats who may initially
refuse to allow certain medical procedures because they know they
are ``never going to get in trouble for saying no,'' a sentiment
bound to ring true with a union audience.
</P>

   ``You have to remember that for the last eight months, the White
House has been the only place in America where you can have an
hourlong conversation about Bill Clinton that's only about
policy,'' one senior aide said of the work of speechwriting,
scheduling and planning. ``It's the eye of the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aide insisted, ``He's paying attention, not just going
through the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton is not without a certain rueful sense of humor. When
Suzan D. Johnson Cook of the President's Advisory Board on Race
presented him with a little book called ``Too Blessed to Be
Stressed'' at a ceremony marking the end of the commission's work
in the Oval Office on Friday, he replied, ``I think I need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Clinton embarks on one more campaign _ to stay in
office _ a looming sense of a long, grim, unavoidable ordeal
pervades the place.
</P>

   ``My feelings are like the weather in Oklahoma,'' one longtime
adviser to the president said. ``You know, you might have a cold
front, or a tornado come through, and then a hot spell and a
drought. What makes me low is when I think how long all of this is
going to take.''

   Another outside adviser said that the president understands the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he understands that while these top-line, national
poll numbers are fine, that there's a potential problem with the
public and a serious problem on the Hill,'' this adviser said.
``The Republicans are determined to conduct a Chinese water-torture
impeachment process. And there's been a slow, slow, slow, but
clearly perceptible, change in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The official White House word is that Clinton well understands
the damage he has done to himself and is trying to make amends. But
one senior aide said he worried that the president, in telephone
calls to Democrats in Congress, was still trying to play down his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This same aide, when told that some other administration
officials said Clinton had complained that his anger at Starr
prompted him to seek relief with Ms. Lewinsky, exploded in
irritation: ``Oh, yeah, I forgot. It's all Ken's fault.''
</P>

   So far, no one has quit. But press secretary Mike McCurry is
leaving as long planned at the end of the month. Emanuel, who has
also long planned to leave, has a new baby and is househunting in
his hometown of Chicago. The chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, who
has also long wanted to leave, perhaps to run for governor in his
home state of North Carolina, is said to finally be serious about
going home.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, the 1992 campaign veteran, who was among the
president's most visible and vocal defenders after Clinton's
initial denials last winter, is not leaving, but he has told
friends he will no longer appear on television, either.
</P>
<P>
   One outside adviser said that, with the hiring of Gregory Craig
as the White House's new damage control point man, and Podesta's
continuing efforts, the staff at last has a mechanism for
coordinating the supporters it has left, from old Friends of Bill
around the country to black elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can handle some of the incoming and finally channel it
into an outgoing,'' this adviser said. But he added that the future
remained deeply unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there's going to be either a really smart move
or a really dumb move by either side that's going to more or less
define things,'' he said. ``I just hope it won't be a dumb move by
us.''
