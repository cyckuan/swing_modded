   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _Mike Skinner's goal heading into North
Carolina Speedway this weekend was to leave ``The Rock'' with all
fenders intact on his Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner exited the 1.017-mile oval not only with straight sheet
metal but also as points-leader of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner finished sixth in the Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400 yesterday,
a week after he ran fourth in the season-opening Daytona 500. His
combined results _ and Jeff Gordon's uncharacteristic 39th-place
result here via a blown engine _ vaulted Skinner to the top of the
points heap after two of 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner has a 29-point lead over Rusty Wallace, the 1989 Cup
champion. They are the only drivers to begin the season with two
top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we struggled here at Rockingham, this is like a win
for this team,'' said Skinner, driver of the No. 31 Lowe's Chevy
Monte Carlo owned by Richard Childress. ``This was pretty awesome.
If we're leading the points headed into the last race of the
season, then I'll think we've got a shot to win it \Rthe
championship\S. We're still the hunter. We're still hunting our
first win.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner is winless in 78 career Cup starts as teammate to
seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. But Skinner knows how to
win. He captured the first race of NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series
in 1995 and its first championship. Skinner's crew chief is Larry
McReynolds, one of Winston Cup's top strategists and a veteran of
points races at Robert Yates Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The points-leader situation is certainly something to be proud
of, but we just got going,'' McReynolds said. ``It's like saying we
led the first 10 laps of a 500-mile race. It's nice to do, but
you've still got a long way to go.'' EARNHARDT HAS CHASSIS PROBLEMS
While Skinner moved into NASCAR's high-rent district, teammate
Earnhardt was saddled with a 41st-place finish after brushing a
wall after 275 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who finished second at Daytona and was second in
points overall, said he missed the setup here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really off on the chassis,'' said Earnhardt, driver of
the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy. ``We were off after 15
or 20 laps. I probably should have gone softer on the back and
softer on the front, too. Me and \Rcrew chief\S Kevin Hamlin worked
awful hard to come up with it. But I was fighting it the whole
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is 17th in points, 105 behind his front-running
teammate. FAST LAPS Second-place Dale Jarrett remains winless in 24
races at North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Third-place Bobby Labonte scored his second top-five in 13 races
at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-place Jeremy Mayfield, Wallace's teammate, posted his
first top-10 finish in 10 races at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   Race-winner Mark Martin, fourth-place Jeff Burton and Jarrett
made the points moves of the race, each gaining 23 positions in the
Cup standings. Martin moved from 31st to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart's 12th-place result was the highest among series
rookies for the second consecutive race. LAST WORDS ``I love these
Chevys. That's all I needed. We're going to win some races.''

GIULIANI'S POSSIBLE RUN PROMPTS TALK OF CHANGING NYC CHARTER ON
SUCCESSION  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Knowing full well that the election of Sen. Rudolph
Giuliani would mean the appointment of Mayor Mark J. Green, some
Democratic officials are quietly looking into tinkering with the
city charter to deny Green, the city's public advocate, the right
to automatically succeed the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The officials _ particularly the city comptroller, Alan G.
Hevesi _ are testing the feasibility of altering the charter to
require a special election to fill out Mayor Giuliani's term should
he resign to run for U.S. Senate before his second term ends in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions in the corridors of City Hall and in the
Legislature in Albany reveal much about the intensity of the
competition among Democratic politicians over who will ultimately
succeed Giuliani, who is barred from running for a third term.
Hevesi is considered a leading contender, and has been raising
money toward a possible run.
</P>
<P>
   The charter places Green, a Democrat who has also been raising
money for a possible mayoral campaign, first in line to succeed
Giuliani. His appointment would make him the incumbent in 2001, to
the considerable disadvantage of other mayoral aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Hevesi said he had made no formal
proposals on the topic of succession. But aides say he has
discussed changing the charter to require a special election with
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver; the City Council speaker, Peter F.
Vallone, and other elected officials in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't taken an official position in the sense of having
thought through all the alternative ways to legally deal with
succession,'' Hevesi said. ``But I am tending toward the notion
that you go to the voters. I believe in elections. If you forget
who is helped and who is hurt, if you can separate the politics,
the issue seems clear. Should the voters decide or not? I think
they should.''
</P>
<P>
   But separating the politics has proven to be difficult. Green
recommends that the charter be left alone and suggests that
Hevesi's suggestions are politically motivated. ``It's so
politically inspired to now change the city's constitution in order
to stop a particular official from succession that it doesn't pass
the smell test,'' Green said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't burn down the house to roast a pig,'' Green said.
``And you don't alter a 167-year constitutional precedent to stop
the public advocate from being the next-in-line successor to the
mayor for an undeniably political purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Green said, it would be more valuable for Hevesi
and others interested in changing the charter ``to help the best
Democrat possible win the Senate seat in 2000 _ so that the issue
of mayoral succession never arises.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, not many public officials seem to favor such a change.
``I recognize that the current system can confer a political
advantage,'' said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who
is also raising money for a potential mayoral campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't like the way things are, run against that
person. To change as important a document as the charter because
you are motivated by personal convenience is not a sufficiently
good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the issue has contributed to the growing
tension between Green and Hevesi, aides to the two men suggest.
When the two Democrats ran together on a ticket with David N.
Dinkins on the top in 1993, they developed a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, however, their names surfaced as potential rivals for
the Democratic mayoral nomination in 2001. And in 1997, Hevesi
endorsed the short-lived candidacy of one of Green's opponents for
the public advocate seat, Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not said whether he will run for the Senate seat
now held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who plans to retire at the end
of next year. The mayor has repeatedly made it clear that he
harbors no affection for Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``state of the city'' message in January, Giuliani said
he was interested in revising the charter, but on other matters.
Colleen Roche, the mayor's press secretary, said recently that
Giuliani had taken no position on any revision of the charter to
affect mayoral succession.
</P>
<P>
   But any plan to revise the charter on the topic of mayoral
succession is likely to become a cumbersome, politically thorny
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green and others opposed to changing the charter cite a
1952 New York state law that states that a mayoral vacancy must be
filled by an official elected citywide at the same time the mayor
was, so a new state law would be required.
</P>
<P>
   While Hevesi has discussed the matter with Silver, the assembly
speaker is said by officials in Albany to be highly uncomfortable
with the idea of seeing any such legislation pass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some politicians contend that a change in mayoral
succession could be achieved through a referendum, which could be
initiated by the mayor, the City Council or the petitioning of at
least 50,000 New York City residents. Meanwhile, Hevesi said he
believed that revising the charter remained a viable idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Green has argued that voters have spoken by adopting a
charter,'' Hevesi said. ``But the same charter recognizes that
there are anomalies in the charter. The same charter provides that
the voters can change the charter by referendum. If the public
wants to change the charter, it can do so. It's not a revolutionary
idea.''

ANALYSTS' REPORTS ON STOCK LACK ANY STANDARDIZED GRADING SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Doublespeak, thy name is Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As if financial concepts aren't hard enough to understand,
analyst ratings that are supposed to make it easier for investors
to buy, hold or sell stocks end up doing just the opposite:
confusing folks who need help.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because there are no standardized ratings. Each brokerage
or research firm has its own way of ranking stocks. Collectively,
that can be as clear as mud.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ratings by Goldman Sachs in descending order are
Trading Buy, Market Outperform, Market Perform and Market
Underperform. The word ``sell'' is not seen at all, although
investors might assume that the lowest rating is a recommendation
to dump the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Everen has only three ratings: Outperformer, Marketperformer and
Underperformer. No buy or sell in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch uses the words ``buy'' and ``sell'' in its
recommendations, but also uses ``accumulate,'' ``neutral'' and
``reduce.'' What's the difference between ``buy'' and
``accumulate''? Apparently it's the added word ``particularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the Merrill Lynch definition: A stock is a buy if it is
``considered to have a particularly attractive potential for
appreciation.'' It's an accumulate if it has an ``attractive
potential for appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   This linguistic alphabet soup seems just plain silly to David
Forrest, analyst for The Motley Fool, an Alexandria, Va.-based
online investment forum.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to investors: ``Just ignore it. We generally tell
people to pay no attention to that nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest has seen an analyst from a brokerage firm change a
stock's rating from ``short-term outperform'' to ``long-term
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they saying in the long-term it's no good but in the
short-term it's going to do well?'' asked Forrest, a former broker.
``It's an incredibly confusing system.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks one reason the ratings are obtuse is to make investors
more dependent on their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Another may be a brokerage firm's reluctance to give bad ratings
to a stock, especially if it has an investment banking relationship
with that company. After all, ``market underperform'' sounds better
than ``sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wall Street, the investment banking department of a
brokerage firm handles a company's public offering while analysts
in another department of the same firm are grading the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a fire wall between the two,'' he said, but
that doesn't always stop influence from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   While the two departments should not influence each other,
there's often implied pressure on analysts not to trash a client's
stock, said Hal Lenhart, a chartered financial analyst at the
College for Financial Planning, a Denver-based organization that
educates investment professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chip Review in Portland, Ore. calls itself unbiased in
its analysis because it's primarily a research firm. It doesn't
have investment bankers, brokers or a trading desk. It makes money
by charging subscription fees to its customer base, most of whom
are individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not after an investment banking deal,'' said Louis
Feldman, an analyst at Red Chip. ``We don't make a market on any of
these stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean its rating system is flawless. While Red
Chip uses a relatively easy-to-understand ``A'' to ``D'' rating,
based on the strength of the company, there's one confusing
ranking: the ``NA.''
</P>
<P>
   It's used on a stock for which it cannot ``justify any valuation
based on the information available.'' But it's not clear how ``NA''
is distinct from ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the nature of the business, said Margaret Draper,
spokeswoman for the Securities Industry Association in New York, a
trade association for brokerage firms and mutual fund companies.
Investors who aren't sure what the ratings mean should consult
their financial advisers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If used properly, the ratings have value, many advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Lenhart and others recommend that investors compare several
analysts' recommendations to see if there's agreement. Do many of
them recommend a buy or are their ratings all over the board?
</P>
<P>
   And most advisers say investors should look at analyst ratings
only as one part of the research made into a company. It shouldn't
be the only factor in an investment.
</P>
<P>
   But if many analysts agree that a stock deserves their highest
ranking -- whether it's called ``buy,'' ``accumulate'' or ``get
lots of'' -- and that affirms other research done on the company,
then the ratings strengthen any investment decision.

TCU HOPES CONFERENCE DREAMS CAN MATCH REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If people at TCU wanted to, they could drive
themselves crazy with the ifs and maybes.
</P>
<P>
   If TCU had funneled additional funds into athletics 10 years ago
instead of now, maybe TCU would be talking of keeping up instead of
catching up. If TCU had done that, maybe Horned Frogs fans would be
discussing remaining a player in big-time Division I athletics
instead of trying to become one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, TCU procrastinated, and two conferences later finds
itself in a tug of war between the image of where it wants to be in
the larger scheme of college athletics and the reality of where it
can actually go.
</P>
<P>
   That battle has taken on a certain immediacy with the breakup of
Conference No. 2, the Western Athletic Conference, looming in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the big hope is to be in one of the major
basketball- and football-playing conferences,'' said Jack
Hesselbrock, TCU associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has invested almost $10 million in athletic facilities and
$1 million in coaching salary increases in hopes of being on par
with nationally prominent athletic programs such as Texas and Texas
A&AMP;M when, and if, conference realignment happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't making this kind of financial commitment to
improve relationships with Tulsa, UT-El Paso and San Jose,'' said
Fred Jacoby, former Southwest Conference commissioner. ``I think
what they are doing is positioning themselves that if something
fragments in the Big 12 Conference they'll be able to jump in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby had a ringside seat for TCU's wake-up call when Texas,
Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech and Baylor bolted from the Southwest
Conference for the Big 12 after the 1995-96 season. TCU, along with
SMU, Rice and Houston, was left behind to wonder what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years of standing pat had caught up with the Frogs, and
they've been scrambling to catch up since.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Notre Dame turning down a chance to join the Big Ten,
the question has become what school will step in to that
conference. When that domino falls, another round of conference
musical chairs will likely begin, and TCU will get a chance to see
how far they've come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we're better prepared,'' Hesselbrock said. ``We were
going along for so long thinking: `This is good enough.' It
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby looks at TCU and finds two problems lingering from the
old SWC days that can't be solved by throwing money at them _
ticket sales and TV attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Simple numbers explain that gap.
</P>
<P>
   TCU averaged 27,181 fans a football game in 1998. Texas A&AMP;M's
lowest turnout of the season was 54,506, on Nov. 6 against Oklahoma
for a game played in a driving rain.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, a small private university, draws from a student body of
7,240 and an alumni base of about 50,000, while Texas A&AMP;M has a
student body of 42,572 and an alumni base of about 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is whether the school has a marquee reputation
and national appeal, not size,'' said Mike Aresco, vice president
of programming at CBS Sports. ``TCU would not have it as much, but
would not be unknown either. ... TCU is certainly in that middle
level of teams that people know a little about but doesn't have the
same marquee name as say a Florida State or an Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Aresco said TCU showed potential in a Sun Bowl upset of Southern
Cal that was televised nationally by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   TCU drew a 6.2 rating and a 16 share in a Fort Worth-Dallas
market, meaning 6 percent of all television sets and 16 percent of
those that were turned on were tuned in to the game. In comparison,
Texas A&AMP;M and Kansas State's Big 12 Championship game Dec. 5, 1998,
drew a 13.9 with a 28 share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say `Can TCU make that step up like
Texas or Texas A&AMP;M?' '' Horned Frogs men's basketball coach Billy
Tubbs said. ``I think it's better to say `Can TCU make that step up
like a Duke or a Miami of Florida or a USC?' I'm talking more or
less about the private institutions that are a factor on the
national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, Miami and USC play in strong, national conferences. TCU
does not.
</P>
<P>
   TCU thought it would be when it joined the 16-team Western
Athletic Conference for the 1996-97 school year. The conference
didn't last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little tougher sledding because there were not as
many regional rivalries and marquee names,'' Aresco said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, at this time, there will be fewer. The WAC will be an
eight-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Half its members announced in May plans to leave and form a
rival conference. Come July, the Mountain West Conference will
begin and the WAC will attempt to begin again.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC is without a television deal and an NCAA automatic bid
for basketball. TCU is left to ponder whether the WAC is where it
needs to be if it's going to be a player instead of merely a
spectator in big-time college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's possible we could \Rbe a player\S if we stay in
the WAC,'' TCU football coach Dennis Franchione said. ``And I think
it's possible that we could have to make a move. But we won't be
able to make a move without doing the things we're doing and then
being good in the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we have to do is not talk about other
conferences but talk about being good in this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of other conferences is common at TCU nowadays. The Big 12
Conference and Conference USA are the most frequent topics of
conversation. Horned Frogs alumni and fans dream of basketball
games with Louisville and Cincinnati in Conference USA and football
games with Texas and Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   That Conference USA says expansion isn't a priority doesn't
really seem to matter. Speculation continues because everybody
knows that something needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   One TCU assistant coach was on the road recruiting recently and
had a player tell him that an opposing coach said TCU and SMU would
be playing in a conference that basically amounted to the Southland
II next year.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains: What is realistic for TCU? Is it a
triumphant return to national prominence in a league with Texas and
Texas A&AMP;M or is it a conference with Tulsa and SMU and a future as
a midmajor more likely?
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 1 to 10,'' Jacoby said, handicapping TCU's
chances of achieving the former instead of the latter, ``no more
than a five, at best a six and at worst a three.''

CONFERENCE USA IS ONE OF THE NATION'S MORE DIVERSE CONFERENCES
</HEADLINE>

By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its logo doesn't include an image of the Statue of Liberty. But
for universities looking to better themselves by emigrating,
Conference USA is a beacon of hope.
</P>
<P>
   TCU and SMU are just two of the schools connected in rumors
regarding C-USA, a four-year-old league born during the conference
shuffling earlier this decade. And while C-USA presidents met
earlier this month to discuss strategic planning, expansion is
hardly a hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidents talked about expansion more as a concept,''
C-USA commissioner Mike Slive said. ``Right now, we're in the
fourth year of our initial five-year plan and we're in the process
of developing our plan for the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA had six football-playing schools in 1996, but
will have nine in 1999. That rapid growth has caused scheduling
problems, but is not indicative of expansion wanderlust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about getting to 12 in order to play a football
championship game would be for two or three reasons,'' Slive said.
``Would it strengthen the league? Do we want a championship game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that going to 12 strengthens our league. Now is
the first time we've thought about that as a part of a strategic
plan. We will not add schools in order to get to 12. We'll only add
if it makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   And, with 12 basketball-playing schools, there is little desire
among member schools to go beyond that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very solid and stable league,'' said
Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich, who formerly was the
athletic director at Colorado State. ``I know \Rcommissioner Mike\S
Slive fields calls from all over the country from schools that want
to be in this league. This is a league that's working very smoothly
as it's currently set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA, like many other conferences, is waiting to see
if the Big Ten Conference decides to expand from 11 to 12. Slive
believes that even if the Big Ten initiates another round of
musical chairs there is no guarantee that C-USA will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA's four goals during its first five years were:
(1), develop football at the national championship level; (2),
maintain men's basketball at the national championship level; (3),
maximize opportunities in men's and women's sports; (4), ensure the
league has a voice in NCAA legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Slive believes that C-USA is 4-for-4. However in football, it's
a ``glass is half full, glass is half empty'' argument.
</P>
<P>
   This past season, C-USA member Tulane finished 12-0, but was an
also-ran in the football Bowl Championship Series. The Green Wave
played BYU in the Liberty Bowl, which has a deal with the league to
take its champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that hurt us. I think it helped because
everybody was talking about it,'' Jurich said of Tulane not being a
championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   Slive points out that C-USA placed three teams in bowl games
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a short period of time we've established ourselves
as a pretty good football conference,'' Slive said. ``We expect our
basketball to be good, but there's a lot of life and vibrancy in
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA could also be called the Diversity Conference.
Membership ranges from public schools like Cincinnati and South
Florida (each with an enrollment of approximately 36,000) to
private schools like Saint Louis (enrollment, 12,100) and Marquette
(10,000).
</P>
<P>
   And geographically, C-USA ranges from West Point, N.Y., south to
Tampa, west to Houston and north to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has 12 member schools. Five _ DePaul, Marquette,
Saint Louis and South Florida _ don't play Division I-A football.
And even though that makes for an odd mixture of conference
schools, there is little sentiment for dumping the non-football
schools in order to bring in more football schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The football schools and the non-football schools have a great
relationship,'' said Marquette's Bill Cords, who is chair of
C-USA's athletic directors. ``We don't view ourselves as simply a
basketball school in a I-A football conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA also would have a difficult time justifying
ridding itself of major markets such as Chicago (DePaul), Milwaukee
(Marquette), Tampa, Fla., (South Florida), St. Louis and Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league married football and basketball in a way that made
sense to both groups,'' Slive said. ``It was a compatible marriage,
and we don't have football vs. basketball issues. We would be very
wary of walking away from those markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference has two football-only members _ Army and East
Carolina. Next season, Alabama-Birmingham's football program will
start playing in C-USA, giving the league nine football teams.
</P>
<P>
   And South Florida, after two football seasons at Division I-AA,
is hoping to move up to I-A status soon. That could give C-USA a
10th football team in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looked upon now as a total conference,'' Jurich said.
``Obviously, we've got some marquee basketball programs, but
there's a huge commitment to football. It's a very young league,
but it's already achieved a ton. I think this is one of the premier
conferences going.''

`BLOWED UP' GORDON FALLS FROM LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Jeff Gordon's remarkable run of NASCAR
consistency came to an abrupt halt yesterday when, in Winston Cup
garage parlance, he `blowed up.'
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the engine in Gordon's Chevrolet expired after he
had completed 310 of the 393 laps that made up the Dura-Lube/Big
Kmart 400 at the North Carolina Speedway. Gordon was running fifth
when his car slowed. A week after starting the season with a
victory worth $2.1 million in the Daytona 500, Gordon coasted
around to pit road and immediately turned left into the garage
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate,'' said Gordon, who won both races at ``The
Rock'' last year and was working on a streak of three consecutive
series victories dating to the end of last season. ``We led at
times. I think we were going to be a big factor at the end. These
guys \Rat Hendrick Motorsports\S don't let me down very often,
especially with the engine department. Today it just blew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the three-time and reigning series champion, was
credited with a 39th-place finish. Gordon's last DNF _ Did Not
Finish _ occurred at Richmond International Raceway last June. The
last time Gordon failed to finish a Cup race because of an engine
failure was in March 1997 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where he
placed 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew they \Rhis crew\S were human,'' said Gordon,
driver of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Refinishes Monte Carlo.
``Maybe everybody else didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome dropped Gordon from first at the start of the day _
10 points ahead of Dale Earnhardt _ to 11th in the Cup points chase
after two of 34 events. Gordon's DNF cleared the way for Mike
Skinner, who finished sixth, to assume the points lead for the
first time in his series career.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon came into the event having finished in the top 10 _ and
on the lead lap _ in 21 consecutive races. In a word, he had become
practically bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are bound to happen eventually,'' said Gordon,
who led the race seven times for 90 laps. ``Today pretty much shows
that it doesn't matter what you do in Daytona. You've got to do it
every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, who finished third in the No. 88 Quality Care
Service/Ford Credit Taurus, said he was too busy trying to keep
pace with eventual winner Mark Martin and Roush Racing teammate
Jeff Burton to notice what had become of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking for him,'' Jarrett deadpanned, ``but we
appreciate him waiting on us.''
</P>
<P>
   As consolation, Gordon was voted winner of the Goody's Headache
Powder Award by the media for suffering the day's worst luck. The
award pays $3,600.

SMOOTH CREW HELPS MARTIN CAPTURE CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Nearly 10 years have passed since Mark Martin
and Jack Roush celebrated their first NASCAR Winston Cup victory at
the North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and car-owner were relative series neophytes when Martin,
making his 113th career Cup start, won the fall race here on Oct.
22, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Mark was dying to win a race at that time,'' Roush
said yesterday at the same Sandhills racetrack. ``We were probably
lucky that day. I do not remember how we won that race. We were
probably lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Martin admittedly was not as good as teammate Jeff
Burton around the abrasive 1.017-mile oval. But Martin and his pit
crew were better than everybody along pit road, which is where they
combined to win the Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was running second to Burton when debris on the
backstretch brought out the day's fourth caution flag on Lap 357 of
the scheduled 393. Martin entered the pits second but exited first,
courtesy of crew chief Jimmy Fennig and a team that changed four
tires, refueled the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus and put the veteran
driver into a lead he would hold for the remaining 35 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Martin remained at the point despite two additional late-race
cautions and restarts, pulling away from Dale Jarrett to record his
30th career Cup victory. It was Martin's initial visit to Victory
Lane in 1999 and first return visit at ``The Rock'' since that
October race nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was another example of what a great race team I work
with,'' said Martin, whose crew adjusted the car to the end.
``They've been awesome and they've worked at it and they deserve
it. Their hard work has paid off and we'll see if we can keep that
going and make it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after he trailed Burton home in a 1-2 Roush sweep during
the Alltel 200 NASCAR Busch Grand National Series race here, Martin
came to grips with a track that traditionally has given him
handling fits. It is a track, Martin said, on which Burton excels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, Jeff Burton is the master here,'' said Martin,
after his teammate had led eight times for a race-high 227 laps.
``And he is the master at Darlington and he may be the master at
Martinsville and he's awfully good at Richmond, too. These are all
places where you can spin the tires, and I'm not good at those
places. I like to be able to slam it to the floor. I know how to go
fast and give it gas and when you can't, I can't stand it. And I
give it the gas anyway and peel the rear tires off.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin kept enough Goodyear Eagle rubber intact to finish 1.397
seconds ahead of Jarrett, who like Martin, was swept up in a 12-car
wreck in the season-opening Daytona 500 on Feb. 14. Martin finished
31st and Jarrett 37th in that race won by Gordon, who saw how the
other half lives yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The defending race champion, Gordon's quest for a fourth
consecutive victory over two seasons was ended when the engine in
the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Refinishes Chevrolet blew after he
completed 310 laps. Gordon, who was running fifth when his engine
quit, was relegated to a 39th-place finish and dropped from first
to 11th in Cup points.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's exit paved the way for the first Ford victory in the
first unrestricted engine race this year. Martin and Jarrett were
followed home by Bobby Labonte's Pontiac Grand Prix, and the Fords
of Burton and Jeremy Mayfield completed the top five.
</P>
<P>
   The race was run in temperatures that only reached the low 40s,
and before a rare non-sellout crowd estimated at 45,000 in an arena
that seats approximately 67,000.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who scored a career-high seven victories last year while
finishing second to Gordon in the points chase, successfully held
the lead on restarts on Lap 376 and Lap 385. Jarrett was second on
both occasions but could not reel Martin in. Jarrett now has
finished second in six of the last seven races at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made at least two adjustments on every pit stop,'' said
Jarrett, who failed to lead a lap in the No. 88 Quality Care
Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``The \Rlast\S restart was pretty good,
but once we got down into Turn 2 he got away. Mark's car was just
better at getting in the throttle. That was gonna be my one shot,
if I could do something on the restart.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin led five times for 50 laps. But given his unstable
history on this slick racetrack, he said every restart was
nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of things that go wrong on restarts,'' said
Martin, who averaged 120.750 mph in a race that took 3 hours, 18
minutes and 36 seconds. ``I never count them until I can get to
where I can coast to the start-finish line. Then I start
hollering.''

RANGERS STILL HAVE OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There are at least two good things about the
Rangers losing the Roger Clemens derby:
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   One is staying, and the other? ... Well, tune in in August, if
I'm reading the Philadelphia Phillies' odd mind-set correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Infatuated with the pinstripes and, perhaps, the drive home
through the South Bronx after night games, Clemens became a New
York Yankee last week.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Rangers fan, you sighed. You shook your head. You
called him Benedict Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I had always thought Rockhead Roger would sign with
the Houston Astros. Silly me. I thought the Toronto Blue Jays might
have something to do with where Clemens played these next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had what the Rangers didn't _ an array of
major-league bodies _ to throw at Blue Jays general manager Gord
Ash, who thinks his team can finish in second place. But the Astros
clung tightly to the two young players that Toronto reportedly
valued most, pitcher Scott Elarton and outfielder Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about the Rangers' earnestness that they were
willing to part with ``their'' Hidalgo, young Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   But was there ever a chance?
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto papers have reported that Ash's grocery list for the
off-season included a left-handed starting pitcher, a second
baseman and help for the bullpen. The Yankees filled that list on
all three counts.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Rangers could have come was last July, when
lefty starter Darren Oliver was still with the team (the Royce
Clayton-Todd Stottlemyre deal) and second-base prospect Warren
Morris was still with the organization. Morris was traded to
Pittsburgh in the deal that brought Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   The meter never stops running, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockhead wanted to be a Yankee. The rich got richer. Let it
be a lesson to Melvin and owner Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, let it strengthen their resolve to trump
the Yankees' move in the months ahead. Clemens isn't the only No. 1
starter that will be available.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phillies' Florida camp on the day after the Clemens
trade, pitcher Schilling was quoted as saying, ``I want to be here
and contend on this club. But if that's not going to happen in the
immediate future, and they can move me to a club that's contending,
then I would be willing to see if we can work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Note to Schilling: The Atlanta Braves are in your division. The
New York Mets, who spent a queen's ransom on new contracts, are in
the Phillies' division. The Giants, Cubs, Cardinals, Padres _
wild-card candidates all _ have better playoff chances than the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is younger than Clemens. He throws, for all practical
purposes, just as hard as Clemens. He has better control than
Clemens. And he is every bit the prime-time competitor that Clemens
is.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, Schilling could do everything for the Rangers that
Clemens could. If it makes a difference, he could learn the words
to The Eyes of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Phillies general manager Ed Wade is down in spring
training, talking as if his team is going to provoke more than a
shrug from the Braves. I don't see it, not with Rico Brogna at
first, Ron Gant in left, and Wade trying to pull four rabbits of
the hat for a rotation behind Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people we're not moving him,'' Wade told the
Associated Press on Friday. ``For the whole season? I can't answer
that. But our desire is to build around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Hicks, did you hear that?
</P>
<P>
   In February, everybody is a keeper. Every team is a contender.
</P>
<P>
   OK, every team except the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to hold on to their designated franchise bedrock,
their Junior Griffey, their Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But in the heat of July, reality casts a broad shadow.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a chance for Rockhead Roger, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   But Owner Hicks _ don't you have six pence for a Schilling?

A TIME FOR MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it another annual rite of spring passage. With less
than two weeks to Selection Sunday, the NCAA men's tournament
committee again is faced with the problem of too many teams for too
few spots.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into last weekend, there were nearly 100 teams with 16
victories. And while a few dozen of those teams are from smaller
conferences and have padded their victory totals against schedules
too weak to earn serious consideration, nevertheless the at-large
pool is Olympic sized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every year we're getting more teams that are on
the bubble, and there are just a lot of teams that look alike,''
said Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, chair of the
tournament committee. ``It's difficult to evaluate those teams in
terms of selecting them as at-large teams and as far as seeding
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting March 5, the nine-member committee will meet in Kansas
City, Mo. Over three days, they'll select 34 at-large teams to go
along with 30 teams that qualified by winning their conferences'
automatic bids. The committee also will seed and place the teams in
the 64-team bracket.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of which teams are in and where they're going
will be made on Sunday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first order of business is selecting the right teams, and
then we worry about seeding them,'' Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the top four seeds are set: Duke, Connecticut, Auburn
and Michigan State. The questions remain, though, where those teams
will be assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is atop the polls and published power rankings. However,
Connecticut, which spent nearly two months ranked No. 1, is also an
Eastern team. Which team gets to be the No. 1 seed in the East
Region?
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, probably. If assigned to the East, Duke likely
would start play in Charlotte, N.C. If it wins its two games there,
it would advance to the East Region in East Rutherford, N.J., where
the Blue Devils have qualified for the Final Four on four different
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   With Michigan State probably set as the top seed in the Midwest,
the committee must decide whether to ship Connecticut to the West
or South. If the Huskies go West, then Auburn would remain in its
natural region, the South.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, there are two interesting story lines:
</P>
<P>
   TCU, which last year made the field as a No. 5 seed, is sweating
its selection as an at-large team. Tonight's game at Nevada-Las
Vegas, another team on the at-large bubble, will carry significant
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which started 2-7, has rallied to build a 17-10 record.
The Longhorns' strong finish should catch the committee's
attention. Also, if Texas wins the Big 12 Conference's
regular-season title, that could be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we always consider is the regular season and
regular-season conference champions,'' Newton said. ``We want to
make sure we don't overlook any conference champion on that
at-large board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big 12 is an example of the jumble of teams the committee
must sort through. The Big 12 has seven teams with at least 17
victories, but none had fewer than six losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when we got down to the last eight to 10 teams for
the last few spots, it got really, really difficult,'' Newton said.
``At that point, we look at every piece of information we have.''

OATES HINTS AT WHO MIGHT BAT THIRD FOR RANGERS (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ It remains to be seen whether left
fielder Rusty Greer will continue to hit third in the Rangers'
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates hinted this winter that Greer would, but
remains noncommittal. First baseman Rafael Palmeiro, whom the
Rangers signed as a free agent Dec. 1, made it known of his desire
to hit third in front of right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to hit wherever they want me to hit, but I feel like
I can hit third,'' said Greer, who arrived in camp early and
participated during yesterday's workout. ``I feel comfortable
there, but I'll do whatever is good for this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer likely will hit third this season and be followed in the
order by Gonzalez, Palmeiro and catcher Ivan Rodriguez. MORE MONEY,
SAME SELE Right-hander Aaron Sele appeared astonished yesterday
after learning he became the highest-paid starting pitcher in
Rangers' history earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sele and the Rangers avoided an arbitration hearing and reached
an agreement on a one-year contract worth $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' said Sele, who went 19-11 with a 4.23
earned-run average during 33 starts for the Rangers. ``You know me.
I'm going to go out there and work hard and have the same approach
I've always had. I would never change who I am.'' PATTERSON'S
PROGRESS Right-hander Danny Patterson entered camp a year ago
rehabilitating his right shoulder after undergoing arthroscopic
surgery to repair partial tears of his labrum and rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   It showed in his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson missed the first 17 days of the 1998 season and
finished it with a 2-5 record and 4.45 ERA, recording only 33
strikeouts during 60 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth/Dallas chapter of the Baseball Writers
Association of America selected Patterson as the Rangers' Rookie of
the Year after the 1997 season. Patterson went 10-6 with a 3.42 ERA
and recorded 69 strikeouts during 71 innings that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patterson is so far ahead _ not only physically, but mentally
_ of where he was a year ago,'' Oates said. ``He's not even the
same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson agrees, and his changeup proves it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was working about 75-80 percent of the time today,''
Patterson said. ``That's better than the 20 percent it was last
year.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Cesar King, who will begin this season at either
Double-A Tulsa or Triple-A Oklahoma, will be sidelined 2-4 weeks
after sustaining a fracture to a bone in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Tony Fossas sustained a bruise to his right hand
after being hit with a ball during yesterday's workout. He should
be able to participate in today's workout.

RANGERS' STAR SEARCH CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ His name is Joaquin Benoit. Remember it.
The Rangers hope one day he'll be as familiar to people in Texas as
Kevin Brown, Bobby Witt and Kenny Rogers once were.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more so.
</P>
<P>
   He is 20, a right-handed pitcher from the Dominican Republic who
can throw hard. His minor-league record is 13-11 with a 2.71
earned-run average with 167 strikeouts in 209 innings and 52 walks.
</P>
<P>
   He is only a blip on the Rangers' minor-league screen. He's not
in major-league camp and his name has yet to be mentioned in
magazine lists of baseball's top prospects. He hasn't pitched above
Class A.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers know who he is. So do other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name has been brought up in trade talks,'' Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin said. ``He's got a great arm.''
</P>
<P>
   They've said that, though, about so many through the years, but
the Rangers still await the eye-popping player who can shake up
their camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' farm system once turned out pretty good front-line
pitchers, including Brown, Witt, Rogers, Darren Oliver, Roger
Pavlik and Robb Nen. But Rick Helling in 1994 is the last rookie to
make the starting rotation out of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any Kerry Woods in our camp lately,'' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``But there are probably 24 other major-league
managers saying the same thing. Guys like that don't come down the
pike very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates would love to see one. He was watching his team work out
yesterday when he was startled by a loud pop on a minor-league
field. He turned to see a 6-foot-4 pitcher pummeling the catcher's
glove with an impressive fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Oates strolled over to watch 19-year-old Justin Backsmeyer, the
organization's 10th-round draft pick out of Missouri who pitched
eight innings last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Doug, I like 6-4 right-handers or left-handers,''
Oates said. ``That's what I've been looking for. You never know if
you're looking at a 19-year-old Roger Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one, he's not in the Rangers' big-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``good arms'' here that are a year or more away from
being ready. Ryan Glynn, 9-6 with a 3.44 ERA at Double-A Tulsa last
season, and Corey Lee, 10-9 with a 4.51 ERA at Tulsa, are likely
headed for Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Johnson, the Rangers' No. 1 pick in 1995, will likely
be there for a third consecutive season. So too will Matt Perisho,
who got hit hard last June, then ended up having shoulder surgery,
and Eric Moody.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde King, a former Yankees pitching coach who is considered a
shrewd judge of arms, once told Melvin: ``Take your top five
pitching prospects. You'll be lucky if just one of them ever makes
it big and real lucky if two of them have success in the big
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers like two younger pitchers in camp. Doug Davis, a
left-hander from City College of San Francisco, led the Class-A
Florida State League with 173 strikeouts in 1551/3 innings.
Right-hander Derrick Cook was 13-7 with a 3.66 ERA in the Florida
State League. Both will start at Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   There are others not in big-league camp who are still to come.
</P>
<P>
   R.A. Dickey, the 1996 No. 1 draft pick without an ulnar ligament
in his right elbow, is trying to make it as a reliever after
recording 38 saves in Class A last season. Sam Marsonek, the other
first-round pick in 1996, pitched 11 innings last season because of
a bad elbow, but he's only 20 and is pitching pain-free in the
minor-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Dittfurth, last year's No. 5 pick, impressed Rangers
officials with a 1.34 ERA in the Gulf Coast League. Oates would be
impressed with him as well. He's 6-6 and 19.
</P>
<P>
   But he's still a blip on the radar screen. The long-awaited stud
simply isn't here yet.

TCU TOURNEY HOPES ON THE ROPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ His smile vanished, exchanged for a
furrowed brow and a lowered gaze.
</P>
<P>
   TCU guard Ryan Carroll had been asked what results were needed
from a two-game swing through Air Force and Nevada-Las Vegas to
assure an NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sweep,'' Carroll said finally, his smile returning. ``We
need a sweep, and I think we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   His words provided a painful reminder as he and his teammates
quietly filed onto a bus after an 81-78 loss to hapless Air Force
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A sweep had become impossible, getting swept a sudden
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   So when TCU finishes this two-game swing against Mountain
Division-leading UNLV at 11 tonight at Thomas &AMP; Mack Center, it is
no longer to assure an NCAA berth but to prevent itself from being
knocked from consideration altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs responded
curtly when asked what the loss did to his team's chances for an
NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   It probably means that the Frogs must win the Western Athletic
Conference tournament in Las Vegas to get in. It definitely means
that the Frogs need to get to the WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That trip isn't guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (17-8, 5-6 WAC) dropped to sixth place in the WAC's Mountain
Division with three games remaining. Only the top six teams in each
division make the tournament. The Frogs are in a battle with
Wyoming, which lost 80-75 to Colorado State on Saturday night, for
the sixth and final spot.
</P>
<P>
   A victory against UNLV (15-9, 8-3) will go a long way toward
getting the Frogs in both tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But Tubbs said he realizes that the Frogs need to play much
better than they did against Air Force to stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were ready to play like we have to play,''
Tubbs said of the Air Force game. ``I just don't think we were
combat ready, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of weeks ago, Lee Nailon and Prince Fowler called
a players-only meeting to try to try to address a somewhat
lackadaisical attitude that pervaded the team.
</P>
<P>
   The problems had begun with a 95-88 overtime loss to UNLV on
Jan. 23. Nailon was ejected for fighting less than 60 seconds into
that game. It began a four-game losing streak for the Frogs, with
Nailon missing two games and being a nonfactor in the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Victories against Wyoming and Colorado State followed the
meeting, and the Frogs appeared to have the problem addressed. This
trip was supposed to be TCU's take-a-look-at-us,
you-can't-possibly-leave-us-out-of-the-NCAA-tournament tour.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to culminate with a big finale in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs would get the victory, Nailon would get a little
redemption and Dick Vitale would be there to lay on superlatives
for the ESPN audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes what's at stake,'' Carroll said before TCU
left on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes remain high for the Horned Frogs, although it's no
longer about assurances but survival.

STARS-AVALANCHE CLASH ENDS IN TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Consider yesterday's game between the Stars and
Colorado Avalanche a television miniseries of sorts. Mark it: ``To
be continued.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Western Conference's top teams settled nothing at
Reunion Arena in a 1-1 matinee tie which, ironically enough, leaves
their season series at 1-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   And while there were plenty of highlights, big plays and
breakdowns, the general feeling afterward for both sides was: We'll
see you later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anytime you play a team like Colorado, it's going
to be a bigger game,'' veteran winger Dave Reid said. ``But the
bottom line is I think both teams came out of it with a healthy
respect for the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move their unbeaten streak to six games (5-0-1) and
their league-best record to 35-10-9. The Avalanche (29-21-7)
stretches its winless streak to five games (0-2-3), but gave the
Stars plenty to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it felt very much like a playoff game,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. `It was a well-played hockey game with a
tremendous amount of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative aspect was a knee injury to Stars defenseman
Darryl Sydor, who is listed as day-to-day pending a re-evaluation
today by team doctor Dan Cooper. Hitchcock said he doesn't expect
Sydor to be out more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars' power play struggled mightily without Sydor,
who leads the team in man-advantage scoring at 30 points (seven
goals, 23 assists). Sydor, in fact, ranks fifth in the NHL in
power-play points.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars missed his presence at the left point, especially
after Sydor set up Brett Hull perfectly for a power-play goal at
the 7:58 mark of the first period. After Mike Modano did a gritty
job of digging the puck in the left corner, Sydor one-timed a pass
to Hull, who made an amazing redirection into the net from 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Sydor then bruised his left knee in a
knee-to-knee collision with Colorado winger Stephan Yelle and had
to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars went 0-for-6 on the power play the rest of the day and
looked disjointed as Shawn Chambers, Derian Hatcher and Mike Modano
all tried to fill the role of Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy. When you lose a guy who's so
important to your power play and offensively to your team,'' Ludwig
said. ``You don't expect something like that, so we haven't really
been using other players out there. The chemistry was off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars failed to take advantage of six power-play chances in
the first two periods, and the Avalanche bounced back to tie the
game on a hard-working play by winger Adam Deadmarsh, which led to
a goal by rookie Chris Drury at the 11:30 mark of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Deadmarsh brought the puck up the right wing and took so much of
the attention of the Stars' defense that he was able to pass back
into the left circle to feed a wide-open Drury. It was the only
goal Ed Belfour would allow against 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the rink, Colorado's Patrick Roy was equal
to the task. After shutting out the Stars two weeks ago on 27
shots, he turned away 23 shots yesterday, including two in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both goalies were very good,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also was pleased with a strong team effort, which
included a 30:30 performance from Hatcher, a 29:34 day from Sergei
Zubov and a 26:56 effort from Modano, who also added an assist.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was the perfect set up to the next meeting between
the Stars and the Avalanche, the final game of the regular season
on Sunday, April 18 in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is the season, we learned that in the past,'' Roy
said. ``And the playoffs are the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, stay tuned.

THIS TIME, BELFOUR'S NO SLOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL KRUGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In his well-documented, ``worst game in recent memory''
two weeks ago, Ed Belfour let three of 12 Colorado shots get under,
around and through him.
</P>
<P>
   That's .333 of all the shots he faced in a 3-0 loss against the
Avalanche. Not a bad batting average, but not a memorable day
minding the net.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to yesterday, when the tough-minded and
tough-to-beat Ed Belfour returned to Reunion Arena. He seemed so
focused on not letting anything get past him, when Avalanche winger
Valeri Kamensky tumbled toward the goal in the second period,
Belfour kick-saved him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour might have said there was no redemption on the line
yesterday, but in stopping 17 of 18 shots, his play seemed to
indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely didn't have my best game the last time they were
here,'' Belfour confirmed after the Stars' 1-1 tie with Colorado
yesterday. ``So, you try to make up for it in the next game you
play against them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy noted, Belfour looked ``sharp''
from the outset. A minute into the game, Avalanche right winger
Milan Hejduk slapped a shot that echoed through the arena after
bouncing off Belfour's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Though 18 shots isn't exactly working overtime, Colorado coach
Bob Hartley said Belfour ``made the big saves when he had to.''
Three of those came with the Avalanche pressing on a 4-on-3 power
play when Belfour stopped defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh twice from the
slot then snuffed a rebound by sharp-shooting center Peter
Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   On the one shot Colorado did get past Belfour _ a one-timer from
the doorstep by Chris Drury off a pass through the goal mouth by
Adam Deadmarsh _ Drury said, ``I was lucky to get it in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   And this seemed to be one of those Belfour performances in which
the opponent needed some luck to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really view it as a bounce-back game, he viewed it
as a challenge,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of Belfour. ``The
thing I liked about him was he was really strong positionally. He
outwaited people, especially when we really needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Belfour might as well have been playing the waiting
game for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime one of our guys has a bad game, we want to make up for
it,'' Belfour said. ``You don't like feeling that you let your team
down. That's the case for me, too.'' /

SHAQ IN A FOUL MOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Shaquille O'Neal's shot faltered Sunday, his usually
automatic two-footers clanging like hail off aluminum siding, but
while the Seattle SuperSonics momentarily silenced his game,
nothing could quell his postgame rant.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq's shooting percentage plummeted in a 92-89 loss to the
Sonics, but he more than compensated by shooting his mouth off
afterward. O'Neal missed an uncharacteristic 9 of 14 shots in the
first half _ and didn't make a single trip to the foul line _ while
the Sonics took a lead they would never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of thing that puts a 7-foot-1, 320-pound
Superman in a bad mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make these B.S. rules up, then they don't enforce them,''
he said, and he was referring to Rule 12B, Section 1, Parts A
through K _ personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal, in a mood to get fined, was only getting started. In
his semiannual address on the issue, O'Neal claimed to be the
victim of constant hacking, rarely whistled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game, seven years, for every game,'' he said. ``All
those guys say they want to hack-a-Shaq. It's in all the papers,
it's on TV, I still don't get the calls. That's cool. I know what I
gotta do. I'm gonna have to start acting crazy to get something in
this sorry league. . . . I gotta start acting like a wild man.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he didn't threaten to break anyone's nose. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice would have been high on the list of candidates,
though. Polynice, signed by the Sonics in January, proved an
effective answer to O'Neal in the paint, an answer Seattle never
had when Jim McIlvaine was the center.
</P>
<P>
   Though O'Neal eventually got 27 points, he scored only two
points in the second quarter, while the Sonics built a nine-point
halftime lead. He finished 11 of 24 for the game, a far cry from
his usual 57-percent shooting. And Polynice grabbed a season-high
17 rebounds to go with 15 points and a lot of purposeful
fist-pumping to incite the KeyArena crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It figured. Polynice worked out with the Lakers after the
lockout, openly lobbied for a job with them and has been a general
irritant to them ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He derided $49 million backup center Elden Campbell as ``the
albatross.'' And once Polynice signed with Seattle, he created a
national stir by divulging that O'Neal and Kobe Bryant had once
fought in practice, intimating some kind of power struggle that was
more media-spun fantasy than reality.
</P>
<P>
   So here was Polynice, again getting under the Lakers' skin,
accomplishing the mission Seattle had in mind when it signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they brought me in here,'' he said of neutralizing
O'Neal. ``I'm not intimidated by anyone. I respect people's games,
but I'm not intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice did the job long enough to let the Sonics' main weapons
do their job _ Gary Payton scoring 26 points and Vin Baker 19.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers watched their winning streak end with a whimper
at three games as they shot 41 percent and rarely threatened the
Sonics' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had 23 points and 13 rebounds but shot 8 for 20 and
committed four turnovers. Eddie Jones got the Lakers back in the
game with an outstanding third quarter and finished with 17 points
but along with his teammates came up short in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The three-point final deficit was deceptive. The Lakers hit 8 of
22 shots in the fourth and were down eight points with 28.9 seconds
to go. And they would have lost by six if not for a buzzer-beating
3-pointer by Derek Harper to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   They had long ago been done in by a sluggish first half in which
Bryant and O'Neal combined to go 10 for 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, I thought we were trying to do too much on
our own,'' coach Del Harris said. ``All the shots were taken by
Kobe or Shaq, the ball movement just wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq and I saw so many gaps . . . we were like licking our
chops, not knowing which way to go. So oftentimes it kind of got
confused,'' he said. ``That's all right, chalk it up to experience.
We won't make the same mistake again.''

YANKEES CAN'T COMPLETELY KILL RANGERS' SPIRITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The sun illuminated the Florida sky. The
isolated clouds above moved slowly across the blue background with
assistance from the cool, gentle breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Tony Fossas described yesterday as ``the perfect
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, despite not having right-hander Roger Clemens on hand
at the Charlotte County Stadium complex, Rangers manager Johnny
Oates continued to supervise his pitchers, catchers and the few
position players who reported early.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some pronouncements that the Yankees _ by virtue of
their trade for Clemens on Thursday _ have secured the American
League pennant before a game has been played, the other 13 AL teams
did not cancel camp and the season.
</P>
<P>
   The National League teams, however, are ready for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll need Roger when they play us in the fall classic in
October,'' Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone told
reporters. ``It'll be fun. It will be nice to see Kevin Brown and
Roger Clemens matched up in October.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Rangers players would be better served using this time
and weather improving their handicaps at nearby Riverwood Golf
Course or a leisurely afternoon along the Gulf Coast's sandy
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already asked for four tickets in Los Angeles and New
York,'' Oates said, ``but I know I can get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers continued preparations to defend their AL West
title and, despite Malone's bold proclamation, perhaps challenge
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not chopped liver, and there's not anyone in here who's
scared of them,'' designated hitter Lee Stevens said. ``We didn't
do it in '96 or '98, but there's too much competitive juice in here
to be in awe of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't misunderstand Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the team to beat every year until someone knocks them
off,'' he said. ``They're the most dominating team in the American
League. They could be the Chicago Bulls of major-league baseball if
their team stays intact and wins a couple more World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, though, must prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're wasting our time,'' said left fielder
Rusty Greer, who reported early to camp yesterday. ``Obviously,
they were a great team before they got Clemens. He's only going to
add to their firepower, but we believe we can go out and play with
anybody. I imagine that's the way everyone in baseball feels right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone shares Greer's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well pack up and go home,'' Boston Red Sox
right-hander Tim Wakefield told reporters after learning of the
Yankees' acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, though, ``by no means are a lock to win the World
Series again,'' Rangers right-hander Rick Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone realizes how close we were last year,''
the 20-game winner said. ``Nobody else even sniffed them during the
playoffs. We had a chance to beat them in all three games, but
that's why they were who they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling referred to the Yankees' three-game sweep of the Rangers
in the 1998 Division Series despite scoring only nine runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're better than we were last year,'' Helling said,
``and hopefully we'll find ways to win those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, though, lacks faith.

SOUTH KOREA AMNESTY WILL FREE DISSIDENT JAILED FOR 41 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korea said on Monday that it would release the
last long-term political prisoners held in its jails, including the
world's longest-serving prisoner of conscience, to commemorate the
first anniversary of the inauguration of President Kim Dae Jung,
himself a former political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the government will offer amnesty to some 8,800
prisoners, most of whom have been convicted of minor offenses like
inciting labor unrest but are not serving prison terms, a
government spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among 17 long-term prisoners scheduled to be released on
Thursday is Woo Yong Gak, the longest-serving detainee, who was
captured 41 years ago as a member of a North Korean military
reconnaissance team whose boat was seized when it entered South
Korean waters, a government spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Woo and the other prisoners were to have been let go last August
on the 50th anniversary of the end of the Japanese occupation of
Korea. But they refused to renounce their commitment to North
Korea's radical Stalinist doctrine and agree to abide by South
Korea's National Security Law. The law can be so broadly construed
that it has ensnared labor leaders and even those caught listening
to North Korean radio broadcasts and distributing pamphlets about
Communism.
</P>
<P>
   When the amnesty of last year was announced, advocates said the
requirement to abide by the South Korea law effectively undercut
the government's decision to abandon its demand that prisoners
renounce their ideological beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for that reason, the amnesty failed to empty South
Korea's prisons of political prisoners like Woo, who has
steadfastly refused to abandon his principles.

GETTING LOST IN RIVIERA'S CORRIDOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Augusta National Golf Club has Amen Corner.
Riviera Country Club has Eucalyptus Corridor, and as Ernie Els will
attest, it is one sticky stretch of scenery. Els gummed up the
11th, 12th and 13th holes but good Saturday at the Nissan Open and
it cost him the 54-hole lead.
</P>
<P>
   He needed 16 strokes _ 3 over par _ to navigate the 1,394 yards
during the third round, which is why he was chasing Ted Tryba. The
three tight holes tucked like a military fold into the left corner
of the 6,946-yard Pacific Palisades layout were pivotal again on
Sunday. The difference was that this time both the gusts and the
putts broke Els' way.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied all three holes in that sinewy stretch, trimming six
strokes off his previous day's score. That reduction loomed large
in Els' two-stroke victory over Tryba, Tiger Woods and Davis Love
III.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of a tournament-record 56,723 fans was the finishing
hole and the failure of Tryba and Woods to manufacture the birdies
they needed to force a playoff with Els. But neither Woods nor
Tryba likely would have found themselves in such an unenviable
position _ with a wicked wind in their faces and the weight of the
tournament on their shoulders _ had either been able to cut
Eucalyptus Corridor down to size as did the 29-year-old Els.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really nice to play that stretch well,'' Els said.
``That was a key to my win.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Eucalyptus Corridor was where the aptly named Tryba
(pronounced TREE-buh) branched out from the faceless clump on the
tour in which he long has been bunched. He went eagle-birdie-birdie
to sustain the charge that culminated in a course-record
10-under-par 61.
</P>
<P>
   The wind and the pressure picked up on Sunday and try as he
might, Tryba couldn't come close to his previous day's feats. He
birdied No.11, gave the stroke right back with a bogey on 12 and
parred 13.
</P>
<P>
   His playing partner, Woods, also covered the stretch in a
pedestrian 1 over par. With his prodigious length, you would expect
Woods to leave skid marks on the par-5 11th, not spin his wheels as
he did in parring it three of the four days.
</P>
<P>
   Among Els' closest challengers, only Love, who played the three
holes in 1 under par, gained any momentum heading into the wind
tunnel that was the rest of the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winds started switching and swirling on 10 and 11 and it
made it very difficult,'' said Tryba after his closing 72. ``You'd
hit a perfect shot and it would fly the green. When you hit a good
shot, you like to get the most out of it. We weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th, 12th and 13th fairways are as slender as fingernails
anyway. When the winds started gusting, they became harder and
harder for shots to graze. Too, the greens grew as hard as the
hearts of the PGA officials who settled on Sunday's pin placements.
</P>
<P>
   Els loves playing Riviera, but he can be forgiven for not having
a soft spot for Eucalyptus Corridor. The three holes are grooved
for the golfer who draws the ball and Els plays a fade.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small wonder he hasn't been tempted to take some of those
eucalyptus leaves off the trees lining the three fairways and chew
on them between shots. For all the trouble he's found on the holes
in his three visits here, Els could play the ``medicinal purposes''
card without anyone batting an eyelash.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared no relief was in sight when Els pulled his drive
into the left rough on No.11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've come close to hitting that fairway,'' Els
lamented.
</P>
<P>
   An adequate 8-iron and a satisfactory 7-iron left him with a
30-foot birdie putt, which he sank. That lifted his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real big turnaround,'' said Els, who thought he was
staring hard at a 5 or, gulp, even a 6.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the par-4 12th was a snap: driver, sand wedge to 8
feet, birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Then came No.13, which was very unlucky for Els on Saturday. You
don't soon forget hitting your drive out of bounds and slinking off
with a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let it, it can get to you a little bit,'' said Els, who
managed to block out the events of the previous day and rebound as
resolutely as a certain power forward the Lakers might or might not
finally welcome into the fold today.
</P>
<P>
   Els hit a 4-wood off the tee, drilled an 8-iron to 5 feet and
drained the birdie putt to exact a measure of revenge on the hole.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained was for Els to collect some compensation for
his final-round collapse here during the 1995 PGA Championships.
Which he did as dusk approached when he accepted the winner's
trophy and a check for $504,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the back nine the way I should have today,'' Els said
and it effectively started at Eucalyptus Corridor. &QL;

THIS TIME, BLUES MAY BE VULNERABLE

</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Outcome aside, Kings coach Larry Robinson said
Sunday he didn't have much to complain about when he looked back on
his team's start to its season-long six-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (21-31-5) blew a 2-0 lead and settled for a 2-2 tie
Saturday night in Calgary, then flew to St. Louis on Sunday for
tonight's game against the Blues (22-23-10) at the Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at our film,'' Robinson said Sunday afternoon. ``We
had a couple of guys who I didn't think played well, but overall,
we had good scoring chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, probably with Stephane Fiset in goal, the Kings will
try to beat a team they've struggled against in recent seasons,
most memorably when they were swept out of the first round of last
season's playoffs by the Blues. In their past six visits to St.
Louis, including a 5-2 loss earlier this season and two losses in
last year's playoffs, the Kings are 0-6-1.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Louis has been struggling recently, and for one of the
few times this season, the Kings _ who did not practice Sunday _
will be facing a team with more injuries than they have.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' top four players are defenseman Rob Blake, left wing
Luc Robitaille, right wing Glen Murray and center Jozef Stumpel,
and Saturday's game marked just the eighth time this season that
all four have been in the lineup and healthy. In those games, the
Kings have a 6-1-1 record. All four were in the lineup for nine
games early in the season, but Stumpel was playing hurt at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blues' injury woes were mentioned to him, Robinson was
unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to get any sympathy from this side,'' he
said. ``When it comes to injuries, that's been our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's return: Murray played Saturday for the first time since
injuring his right knee seven weeks earlier, bringing to the lineup
his speed, willingness to go to the net and talents on the power
play and on the penalty-killing unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first game,'' Murray said. ``I felt a little behind
the play and thinking too much. But it's a fast game, especially
when you miss 19 games. For most of it, though, I felt all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray came close to winning the game with consecutive
one-timers from the slot about 12 minutes into the third period,
but was stopped both times by Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite. He
played 23 minutes, 51 seconds, fourth-most on the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his timing is completely there,'' Robinson said,
``but I think once he got going, it got better.''

SONICS DRAW THE WRATH OF SHAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Emergency alert for Denver tonight and Vancouver
tomorrow: Prepare the shelters, stock up on batteries and water,
and put extra rotations in the hospital ERs.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq Diesel is coming, and jeez, is he mad.
</P>
<P>
   The next two stops on the Los Angeles Lakers' road trip will
feel the wrath of Shaquille O'Neal's Sunday afternoon in Seattle,
where Olden Polynice, Vin Baker and the rest of the green meanies
wailed on his pitiful 7-foot-1, 315-pound self. They were abetted
by an officiating crew he called ``cheating bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal vowed afterwards, in his usual quiet voice, to seek
vengeance upon the hapless hordes wherever they lurk.
</P>
<P>
   In enunciating his own personal jihad, it wasn't quite as
eloquent as, say, ``My sword shall run with the blood of the
infidels,'' but the point was no less unmistakable after Sunday's
92-89 defeat in which the Lakers never led:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going,'' he said, ``to break people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well. So much for the new, fan-friendly NBA. Imagine paying $650
for a courtside seat only to have one's Armani soiled with the
entrails of the hometown heroes.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, send the dry-cleaning bill to Polynice. It was
his fault, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad I got away with it,'' said Polynice, a faint nee-ner,
neener somewhere in the back of his voice. Then he changed to a
more conciliatory posture, knowing that there are further crossings
of elbows to come with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell Shaq: `I love you still.' I'm sorry he feels that
way. I love him as a person, and consider him a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Now he says it. Where was this compassion on KeyArena's
low blocks Sunday? How can Polynice not appreciate his rival's
persecution? Where's his empathy for travail of the giant?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's like the big kid in the park,'' Polynice said.
``He's too big for any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein rubs the rub.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and the Lakers are convinced that, as coach Del Harris
put it, ``Shaq gets more (uncalled) fouls on him than anybody in
the league.'' Harris went on to say that referees have told him
that if O'Neal were a smaller guy, he would probably draw more
fouls. But the conventional NBA wisdom is that for opponents to
have a chance against His Largeness, they must be allowed heavier
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   To which O'Neal said: ``It's been this way every game for seven
years. It's written down: Hack-a-Shaq. I'm not going to take it any
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to act crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. I thought that's why the Lakers were trying to sign Dennis
Rodman. How many cartoon characters is a single NBA team allowed to
have?
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that O'Neal's threat of lightning from his
terrible, swift sword may be a set-up for Rodman's entrance, which
could be announced this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers currently are a flawed team less formidable than when
they wasted the Sonics 4-1 in the second round of last spring's
playoffs. Sunday they were missing from the '98 team forward Robert
Horry (heart problems) and guard Nick Van Exel (gone to Denver),
two players whose advantages in quickness were difference-makers in
the Seattle series.
</P>
<P>
   Their replacements in the starting lineup are slow-footed
forward Travis Knight and ancient guard Derek Harper, believed to
have once teamed with Bob Cousy in the same backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles were compounded by the fact that wunderkind forward
Kobe Bryant is still packing way too much mustard for his hot dog
of a game, as well as the Laker bench supplying just 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was O'Neal, with his lower lip stuck so far out it
was like a sixth defender for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   This team could definitely use Rodman, if for no other reason
than one glaring statistic from the game: O'Neal didn't get a
single rebound in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine His Largeness blaming the officials for
that one. Rebounding is chiefly a matter of positioning and effort.
If he wants to use the excuse that the Sonics held him, too, that
whopper deserves a place alongside the presidential assurance that
he never had sex with that woman.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the current Lakers nearly have been caught by
the Sonics in one area that separated them last May: Interior size
and toughness. Polynice's 15 points and 17 rebounds were almost 15
points and 17 rebounds more than the Sonics obtained from Jim
McIlvaine and Sam Perkins against L.A.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not likely that Polynice can maintain those numbers,
it's also unlikely that the rest of the Sonics will continue to be
as wretched on offense. The best 3-point shooting team in the NBA
last year missed 15 of 17 triplets Sunday, suggesting that if just
one guy finally heats up, the Sonics will border on the
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Lakers are the worry of other teams. The Sonics
don't have to play the them again until March 5, which is enough
time for O'Neal to be subdued by the National Guard, Power Rangers,
Jackie Chan or the Wide Warrior himself, Commissioner David Stern.

` BOTTLE' EDGES OUT `PAYBACK' AT BOX OFFICE

   LOS ANGELES _ Romance won out over revenge as ``Message in a
Bottle'' edged ``Payback'' in a steady performance at the nation's
multiplexes with an estimated $10.3 million at 2,545 theaters
during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend of Warner Bros.' love story, starring Kevin
Costner and Robin Wright Penn, led by about 1 percent over
Paramount's third weekend of ``Payback'' with $10.2 million at
2,768 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But the positions could be reversed today when final figures are
released if there are slight shifts in Sunday's totals.
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers took the first five slots as a trio of new entries
failed to generate much excitement among customers. Analysts noted
that the weekend following the Presidents' Day holiday is
traditionally slow, leading studios to hold back top-tier titles
for periods with more potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is usually a pretty dead weekend,'' said movie analyst
Arthur Rockwell. ``I'm a little surprised that `Message in a
Bottle' held up so well, but part of that is due to there not being
any heavy-duty new films.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said ``Message'' benefited from being the only major movie
in the market for adult audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message,'' which has received mixed reviews, has seen its
cumulative gross top $32 &UR;  &LR; million while Mel Gibson's ``Payback''
has gone past $57 &UR;  &LR; million to become the top grosser for 1999 films
so far. Rockwell said its success is due to Gibson's ongoing box
office appeal, adding, `` &UR;  &LR; `Payback' is a strong film with an
incredibly strong star.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedies took the next three slots, led by Disney's second
weekend of ``My Favorite Martian'' in third with $6.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
2,312 locations, followed by New Line's second weekend of ``Blast
From the Past'' with $6.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,544 sites and Miramax's
11th weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love'' with $5.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,030
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare,'' which received an impressive 13 Academy Award
nominations on Feb. 9, has topped $54 &UR;  &LR; million overall and should
continue to perform well, Bucksbaum said. ``There is a lot of buzz
right now for `Shakespeare in Love,' &UR;  &LR; '' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's opening of ``October Sky,'' a family drama set in a
coal-mining town at the dawn of the space age, performed moderately
with $5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,495 theaters. Bucksbaum said ``Sky,'' which
has received generally positive reviews, could benefit from strong
word-of-mouth among moviegoers but will face a tough marketplace
with studios usually opening four new films each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a lot of room for all these films,''
Bucksbaum said, adding that next weekend's strongest entries appear
to be Disney's family drama ``The Other Sister'' and Sony's
thriller ``8mm'' with Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's fourth weekend of ``She's All That'' continued to draw
respectably with $5.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,639 theaters to top
$49 &UR;  &LR; million overall, followed by 20th Century Fox's opening of
corporate comedy ``Office Space'' with a barely adequate
$4.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,740 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``Rushmore'' finished ninth with
$2.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 764 screens, followed by DreamWorks' 31st weekend
of ``Saving Private Ryan'' with 2.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,139 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan,'' which has 11 Oscar nominations, has topped
$203 &UR;  &LR; million overall and passed ``Armageddon'' for 24th spot on
the all-time domestic chart.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for 11th at $2.3 &UR;  &LR; million each were Universal's ninth
weekend of ``Patch Adams'' and Miramax's 18th weekend of ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' The former has about $130 &UR;  &LR; million overall; the
latter, with seven Oscar nods, is near $24 &UR;  &LR; million and already has
the highest gross in U.S. theaters for a foreign language movie.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening saw moviegoers mostly ignore
Sony's teen-horror comedy ``Jawbreakers'' with $1.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 801
sites. Also finishing well below the top 10 was Fox's ninth weekend
of ``The Thin Red Line'' with about $900,000 at 900 theaters as the
studio and exhibitors continue to pull the war drama from screens
despite its Best Picture Academy Award nomination. The studio made
its major push for ``Line'' in early January, and its grosses have
totaled a somewhat disappointing $34 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of shocked that a Best Picture candidate is losing
screens like this,'' Bucksbaum said, noting that the number of
screens was above 1,600 two weeks ago. ``Usually, business would be
improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney reported strong response for sneak screenings Saturday at
1,030 theaters for ``The Other Sister,'' starring Juliette Lewis as
a mentally challenged woman finding romance. Warner Bros. also
showed sneaks of ``Analyze This,'' a Billy Crystal comedy due March
5.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled about $77 million, down from the same
weekend last year when ``Titanic'' topped the slate for the 10th
straight time. Year-to-date totals are down about 12 percent due
largely to ``Titanic,'' which went on to gross more than $600
million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``8mm'' and ``The Other Sister,'' two other films will
open this Friday _ MGM's romance-drama ``Just the Ticket'' and
Paramount's ensemble comedy ``200 Cigarettes.''

JAPANESE SLUGGER IN FOR A LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Goodwill isn't the only reason the greatest
player in Japanese baseball is coming to the Peoria Sports Complex
on Monday. Mutual curiosity is bringing Ichiro Suzuki and the
Mariners together.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a coincidence that Suzuki is the first player to wear
No. 51 for the M's since the Randy Johnson trade. But there's no
doubt he's a star.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki has his own clothing line and endorsement deals for
Japanese car, soft drink and food companies. He wears his first
name, not his last, on the back of his uniform. On Dec. 16 _ just
two days after Kevin Brown became this country's first $100 million
player _ he signed a contract making him the first Japanese player
to earn 500 million yen in a season.
</P>
<P>
   That's roughly $4.15 million in U.S. dollars, and the Orix Blue
Wave has every reason to make Suzuki happy. A lifetime .350 hitter,
he's won the batting title and a Gold Glove in each of the past
five years, three times adding a Most Valuable Player award.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 25-year-old wants to take his act to the American major
leagues _ and seems to favor Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personally has told me one of his dreams is to play in the
same outfield as Ken Griffey Jr.,'' said Mariners president Chuck
Armstrong, who saw Suzuki twice last offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked every day,'' said Jamie Moyer, who visited Japan
with a team of major league stars in November. ``His biggest
question was always, `Can I play in the U.S.?' I said, `I don't
know, I've only seen you play two or three games, but you've got a
lot of ability. ... '
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's trying to make the club; I have no idea
of that perspective. But I do know it seemed in Japan that he
wanted to play for the Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki is one of three Blue Wave players who arrive in spring
training Monday and stay through March 7. He and pitchers Nobuyuki
Hoshino and Nobuyuki Ebisu will be eligible to play in the
Mariners' first four spring training games. The M's are expected to
reciprocate by sending players to Japan in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If Suzuki impresses _ and the Mariners will be watching closely
_ it could increase the likelihood of him playing for the Mariners
one day. In Japanese baseball, a player is bound to his club for
nine years before becoming a free agent. Few in Japan expect Suzuki
to stay four more years, but he has conceded that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the first player to show what Japanese batters
can do in the major leagues,'' Suzuki said in November. `` ... Of
course I would like to try to play in America, but it basically
depends on my bosses letting me. What is important to me is
choosing a city where I am able to relax away from baseball, like
Seattle or Los Angeles (or) San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Jongewaard, the Mariners' vice president for scouting and
player development, gives Suzuki a ``plus'' rating in four of the
five position-player categories: hitting, arm strength, fielding
and speed. Suzuki's power is below average, but it's not for lack
of trying. Seeking to boost his home run total, Suzuki reportedly
began patterning his swing after Griffey's last year. (The
experiment resulted in just 13 homers.)
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki's arm strength, Moyer said, is equal to or better than
anyone's in the majors. But what the M's like most is Suzuki's
speed. He has stolen as many as 49 bases in a season, and Moyer
said he's the kind of player who could bunt for a single and be on
third base two pitches later. Suzuki could get 20 to 30 infield
hits a year if he puts the ball in play regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's faster than anybody over here, from what I saw of
him,'' Moyer said. ``Every lead he takes, he's got both feet on the
carpet. He's got great instincts on the basepaths, and from that
standpoint, he would give us some great team speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners failed in their efforts to land a speedster this
winter, and it's tantalizing to think of Suzuki batting just before
Alex Rodriguez and Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be a leadoff hitter or a No. 2 hitter and get a
couple hundred hits for us, steal some bases,'' Jongewaard said.
``He'd be perfect in our lineup. We're looking for speed, someone
to get on base in front of Alex and Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki had 210 hits in 130 games for Orix in 1994, a feat that
enthralled Japanese sports fans. Hide Sueyoshi, a former Blue Wave
staffer who now works in the Mariners scouting department, said
that performance was significant for Japanese baseball, which had
been losing fans to an upstart soccer league that started in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many fans came back to the ballpark,'' Sueyoshi said. ``He's
kind of the phenom of Japanese baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that, Armstrong, Sueyoshi and Jongewaard stressed
the team would follow protocol if it wanted to pursue Suzuki. With
Nintendo owning 60 percent of the franchise, the Mariners are
conscious of their image in Japan. If Suzuki's visit comes off as
goodwill, and not an audition, the M's will look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously very important to us that we have a presence in
Japan, and that it be a favorable impression,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Armstrong has been assured that the M's will play
regular-season games in Japan as soon as baseball finalizes the
plans. Also, the M's have had a working agreement with the Blue
Wave since last February.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Wave, which plays in Seattle's sister city of Kobe,
exchanges player information and cross-markets with the Mariners.
The Mariner Moose has visited Japan, the Blue Wave's mascot has
frolicked in the Kingdome and the clubs sell each others'
merchandise at home games.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving that agreement is important, Jongewaard said. If
Suzuki does become free, the Mariners think their history of good
relations with Orix could give them an edge in signing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the working agreement with the Blue Wave, obviously
we're not trying to steal him away or do anything under the
table,'' Jongewaard said. ``But we'd hope with our relationship
with them, it might be something we could work out down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Mariners' full squad reports today, with all players
expected to arrive. ... New outfielder Butch Huskey has been placed
on an advanced workout program in hopes that he'll quickly shed 10
pounds. ... Manager Lou Piniella made a quick exit Sunday for a
golf date with Armstrong, M's CEO John Ellis, and vice president of
baseball operations Woody Woodward.

ALL EYES ON GRETZKY BUT LACROIX WINS IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Midway through Sunday night's game between
the Rangers and the Oilers, defenseman Marty McSorley of Edmonton
checked Wayne Gretzky of New York and held him along the boards
with a tight grip that stretched Gretzky's blue jersey. Perhaps
McSorley, in addition to covering his man, was trying to get a
claim on a souvenir shirt from what could have been an historic
game.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been Gretzky's last appearance in Edmonton in a
magnificent hockey career. And there was still a chance that it
could have been the night Gretzky added another line to his large
page in hockey's history book. Alas, Gretzky did not score, but
Marc Savard did, and so did Eric Lacroix, who joined the Rangers
this month and is playing for his third team this season. Savard's
goal tied the score late in the third period, and Lacroix's goal
gave the Rangers a 2-1 victory in the first minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Rangers a 3-1 record in their last four
games and moved them into 11th place in the Eastern Conference, 4
points behind the Florida Panthers, who hold the eighth and final
playoff berth in that bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Savard's goal on a breakaway at 11 minutes 31 seconds of the
third period came after a turnover near the Oilers blue line by
Boris Mironov. His pass hit John MacLean of the Rangers. Savard
took the puck, waited until Kevin Stevens cleared the zone and got
on side, then moved in on the goalie. Taking his time to make a
couple fakes, Savard dropped the goalie to the ice and then put the
puck into the net with a forehand shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous game, a 6-1 victory over Pittsburgh Friday night
at Madison Square Garden, Savard had three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix's goal came from short range after Mike Knuble and Petr
Nedved worked the puck low in the Edmonton zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers appeared to score what would have been a game-winning
goal in the final minute, when Bill Guerin put a rebound past Mike
Richter. But the goal was disallowed after video review because
Aleksandr Selivanov was illegally in the goal crease.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has 1,071 goals in both the World Hockey Association and
the National Hockey League, including both regular season and
playoffs. The number equals that of Gordie Howe, who also played in
both leagues. Howe's career began in 1946 and ended in 1980.
Gretzky's career began in 1978-79, the final year of the WHA. He
played most of the season with Edmonton after beginning the season
with Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only appearance here this season for Gretzky and the
Rangers. The sellout crowd arrived early, many to watch Gretzky in
warm-ups. The Great One's road appearances are always a bigger deal
than his home games, and no city welcomes him with more emotion
than Edmonton, where he played for 10 seasons, one in the WHA and
nine in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   When the preparation for the game began, Gretzky was the last
Ranger to take the ice, and his first step was greeted with a big
cheer and a burst of flashbulbs. High above the ice, just below the
Molson Canadian billboard, was a large handmade sign, black
lettering on a white sheet, that said, ``We Still Miss You,
Gretz.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is without a goal in seven games and has scored but one
in his last 17. For the season, he has eight goals and 48 assists
while playing in all 57 Rangers games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth game in 10 nights for the Rangers, who play
their seventh in 11 when they visit Calgary on Monday night to play
the Flames. In their only previous meeting with the Oilers this
season, the Rangers won a 3-2 decision at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played again without Todd Harvey, their aggressive
right wing, who missed his second consecutive game with a fractured
right thumb. They also were without defensemen Jeff Beukeboom and
Peter Popovic. Beukeboom is out for about two more weeks with a
concussion. Popovic has blood in his right eye because he was hit
in the eye with a puck a week ago. The healthy scratches were Derek
Armstrong and Rumun Ndur.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in goal for the Rangers was Richter, who had failed to
finish the first period in two starts last week. Richter gave up no
goals in the first period Sunday night and stopped 17 Edmonton
shots in those 20 minutes. The one that got by him, by Mironov, hit
the goal post.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 12 minutes of the game, the Rangers were outshot by
13-3. They improved in the next eight minutes and Kevin Stevens hit
a goal post behind Oilers goalie Bob Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Rangers played better, but the Oilers
got the only goal of the session and held a 1-0 lead after 40
minutes. Mike Grier scored, shaking off a checking attempt by
Nedved and putting a rebound past Richter.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective Ranger forward in this span was Adam Graves,
Gretzky's left wing, who leads the team with 27 goals. Graves put
on some stick-handling displays, not usually his style, one of them
drawing a penalty against McSorley late in the period. Gretzky set
up a couple of scoring chances, the best by Ulf Samuelsson, who
took the right-to-left pass and fired from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the third period, the Oilers had a 27-19 edge in
shots on goal. Gretzky had one of the Rangers' shots. &QL;

PUMPED-UP POLYNICE IGNITES SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ ``OK, let's go. Stop talking,'' Gary Payton said
Sunday, sticking his razor-clean head into the scrum of reporters
surrounding the Sonics' star of the day, Olden Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough of that,'' Payton said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' guard was thrilled with the team's new center, even
if Payton was harping on Polynice to quit yakking and get dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I'm sorry,'' Polynice said. ``But I'm loving this.''
</P>
<P>
   You bet Polynice is loving this.
</P>
<P>
   Call it escape from Sacramento, where before Chris Webber, Vlade
Divac and Jason Williams showed up, it was 82 games of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't wait to get out of there,'' said Polynice, who used
to look jealously at the standings, knowing his then-former team
became a contender after he was traded away in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Polynice wakes up every day and makes a point of
reading the NBA standings. He likes to see his Sonics are in first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new to me. The other guys may be used to being in
first place, but I'm loving it. I could be working nine to five
right now. I could be making minimum wage. I could be living in a
Third World country. I could still be in Haiti right now, still
suffering,'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   And you can bet Payton and the Sonics are loving Polynice, too,
especially after the center went toe-to-toe with Shaquille O'Neal _
hand-to-hand, too _ and came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 92-89 victory was courtesy of their new man in the
middle, who 15 seconds into the game opened the scoring with a
17-foot jumper and spent the rest of the game shaking, rattling and
rolling O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it was the raw emotion that Polynice injected that
helped lift the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's brought up the whole morale of the team,'' Kobe
Bryant said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Polynice's raised arms and pumping fists and words of
encouragement gave the Sonics an edge, especially over the
bickering Lakers, whose problems can only get worse _ with or
without Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   It was 39 minutes for Shaq and 39 minutes for Polynice _ who won
the psychological battle under the boards even of O'Neal later
protested about all the pushing and shoving that NBA refs are not
calling.
</P>
<P>
   It was 27 points for Shaq, whom you can't really stop, but it
was 17 big boards for Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   Where there once was Jim McIlvaine and a prayer holding up the
middle ground in the Sonics' rotation, there is now O.P.
</P>
<P>
   Where there once was McIlvaine averaging 3 points and 3 rebounds
in 15 minutes, there is now O.P., who Sunday hung 15 points, 17
rebounds and one bone-jarring blocked shot against Shaq and the
Land of the Lost Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the dumb plays when I tried to block his dunk.
When I blocked it, my hand hit the rim. You don't think about that
kind of thing during the game, you just play,'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the smartest thing to try and do but at the same
time, I had to challenge him and let him know it wasn't going to be
an easy night.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice has been waiting for these kinds of games. In
Sacramento, NBC did not send Bob Costas and Ahmad Rashad to many
Kings games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only NBC I saw were the games I watched on TV,'' Polynice
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the games Polynice saw were the Sonics' playoff
match-ups, including the Lakers' resounding second-round slaughter
of the overrotating Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the whole thing. I saw what happened. McIlvaine
didn't play much, but I thought regardless, he should have played.
He's got six fouls. He's big enough to bang and beat Shaq. But they
tried to put Vin (Baker) on him and that was tough for Vin. I mean,
shoot, that was tough on me tonight. I'm ready to go home and lay
down and this was just one game,'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin isn't used to guarding someone like that for five games.
It was tough on him. They were able to spot up. Eddie Jones could
shoot jumpers. But it was different tonight. I knew coming in, that
was one of the things the (Sonics) needed. Our whole thing is to
get between the big fella and the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it helped that Polynice was tuned in to all the bad
karma swirling around the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hear them yelling and cussing at each other during the
game. I mean, there was one play and someone said, `You're not
going to talk to me that way.' There were a lot of cuss words and I
was like, whoa,'' Polynice said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Polynice had any advantage over Shaq, perhaps it came
from a summer of workouts. Polynice lives in Los Angeles with his
wife and two kids and, during the lockout, he worked out with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers even told Polynice to hang around, that they would
sign him. But after the Lakers signed Travis Knight, the Sonics
called up Polynice and told him to pack his bags and head north to
take the place of McIlvaine, whom Sonics president Wally Walker
shuffled off to New Jersey for ... it doesn't matter. McIlvaine was
gone and there was someone potent to take up that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real good piece of the puzzle for them,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about the caliber of player that Jim is and the
caliber of player that Olden is, there's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been backhanded, considering McIlvaine's
considerable shortcomings, but Polynice should take it as a
compliment.

SONICS GET PHYSICAL WITH LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Well after the locker-room rush had subsided, Sonics
center Olden Polynice still was inebriated by the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in a towel, sweat-drenched and chatty about his
encounter with mammoth Shaquille O'Neal. A 15-round heavyweight
boxing match might have been easier, although Polynice was far from
punch drunk.
</P>
<P>
   That was O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Polynice delivered the first blow, it did not take long
for the rest of the Sonics to join in and deflate the Lakers 92-89
in a nationally televised game at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped the Sonics' two-game losing streak and gave
the team's offense a much-needed shot in the arm. With five players
scoring in double figures, the Sonics (7-2) threw every weapon they
had at the Lakers (6-4) in rebounding from Saturday's 30-point
drubbing at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed,'' Sonics forward Vin Baker said of the
Utah game. ``(Sunday) wasn't a strategy game. It was about playing
hard and playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice was the spark from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   His 15 points and 17 rebounds were not identical to O'Neal's 27
points and 10 boards. But Polynice stood up to the Laker giant and
kept him from totally dominating the paint.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of performance that the Sonics had not been used
to against the league's dominant centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not intimidated by anyone. I respect people's game, but if
you're intimidated, you've already lost,'' Polynice said. ``I know
he wants to dunk the ball. I wanted to limit the dunks. ... I had
to challenge a couple of them to let him know it wasn't going to be
an easy night.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice stirred things up so much that O'Neal vented afterward,
talking more about the officiating than his Sonic counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does what everyone else does: Two hands in the back and
push,'' O'Neal said. ``They (the officials) did an awful job. They
are some cheating bastards. They make up (expletive) rules and
don't enforce them. You can fine me, double-fine, triple-fine me. I
guess I'm going to have to start breaking people up.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of O'Neal's comments, Polynice wondered if the two had
just played the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a superstar so I know I'm not being protected,''
Polynice said of the officiating. `` ... If that's how he feels,
maybe he should talk to (commissioner) David Stern and maybe they
can work something out. I just went out there and did what I had to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice scored eight of the Sonics first 14 points _ all on
strong moves to the basket _ and established his inside presence by
blocking one of O'Neal's early dunk attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice played recklessly from the start, leaning on O'Neal and
holding him to 5-for-14 shooting and just 10 points in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Polynice was so effective that Sonics coach Paul Westphal
rotated his center in and out of the game with O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that really helps a lot is to have a center that
makes the other center earn whatever he gets,'' Westphal said. ``We
don't expect him to score big. The thing about Olden is he can
score if the ball comes to him. We're not running plays for him,
but at the same time he knows what to do with it when he gets the
ball, and he's all over the offensive boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Polynice's willingness to bang with O'Neal led to the Sonics'
45-44 rebounding edge. The Sonics also played straight-up defense
most of the game and were were the aggressors on both ends of the
floor from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Sonics attacked the basket. They immediately
took advantage of mismatches in the paint with Baker and Detlef
Schrempf making concentrated efforts to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Baker finished with 19 points and Schrempf added 15 in two of
their better offensive outputs so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think about how I've been playing _ standing
around _ and I wanted to do something about it,'' Schrempf said.
``I've been a postup player for many years. I might take some
postups from Gary (Payton) and Vin, but I have to take advantage of
my height and get some easy baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never trailed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see Det and Vin doing what they did last year,''
said Payton, who led the Sonics with 26 points after scoring a
season-low seven on Saturday. ``If they play like that
consistently, we're going to be a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' biggest lead was 65-50 after Schrempf sank a
16-footer with 4:44 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made several runs, but each time the Sonics responded
with a big shot. Baker's dunk with 33.5 seconds left in the game
put the Sonics ahead 88-80 and iced the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a roller-coaster and crazy league, a crazy Western
Conference,'' Westphal said. ``After playing the way we did
(Saturday), we came back and played the way we think we can play.''

ELS HOLDS ON THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Were it anybody else but No. 1-in-the-world Tiger
Woods or course record-holder Ted Tryba out there fingering their
wedges, Nissan Open champion Ernie Els might have been wading
through well-wishers a bit earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the big South African with the silky smooth swing was
trying hard not to think of the PGA Championship of 1995, where his
tournament lead disappeared in a final-nine collapse on this same
Riviera Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that just to tie Els on the last hole Sunday would
require either a downhill birdie chip out of club-grabbing kukuya
grass by Tryba or a less-likely birdie pitch into the cup by Woods
from somewhere below the beer tent.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Easy fretted anxiously just the same _ then wound up
winning by a comfortable two-stroke margin as first Tryba, then
Woods bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really sweet for me,'' said Els, who earned a
tournament-record $504,000 with his 14-under-par total of 270.
``But I finished almost the way I did in the PGA _ not good.''
</P>
<P>
   But not bad, either. Els' closing round of 3-under-par 68 was
not only the third-best score of the day but also accomplished in
the face of gusting winds that made everyone's homestretch a
tribulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was a big factor out there,'' said Tryba, whose
closing 72 left him tied for second with Woods (70) and Davis Love
III (70), all at 272. ``It made any shot on the last four holes _
even putting _ difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Els managed to shoot in the 60s, something only 12
players accomplished Sunday after 31 had done so Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Els' final-hole bogey, which gave Woods and Tryba a chance
to tie, was hardly a collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The uphill, into-the-wind, 451-yard 18th hole produced 24 bogeys
Sunday, including eight by the final nine golfers of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The lone late exception was Love, whose par on No. 18 earned him
a share of second-place money. It was one of the few things that
went right for the 1997 PGA champion, who missed many opportunities
to close while third-round leader Tryba and Woods were jockeying
early before Els made his move with three consecutive back-nine
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, who shot a course-record 61 in the third round, was
caught by Woods on the seventh hole Sunday. Then both were passed
by Els before Tryba regained a share of the lead with a birdie on
No. 10 and stayed tied with his fourth and final birdie of the
round on No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th was also the start of the three-birdie stretch by Els,
bringing him to 5 under par for the day, 16 under for the
tournament, and giving him an undisputed lead he would not lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess No. 11 really gave it back to me today,'' said Els,
whose double bogey on the 11th hole Saturday launched a slump that
had him dropping four strokes to par in three holes while on pace
to match Tryba's record.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of fortune on Sunday overcame a slow start that
dropped Els four strokes off Tryba's lead after a fourth-hole
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I kind of got on a roll,'' said Els, whose three-hole
surge kept the pressure on Woods and Tryba, playing one group back.
They continued to push Els but couldn't push past him.
</P>
<P>
   Woods dropped four strokes off the pace with a bogey on No. 12
but got back within two shots soon after when he birdied No. 15
while Els was taking bogey on No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Els bogeyed No. 18, Woods and Tryba were within
final-hole birdies of a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The wind blew away most of Woods' opportunity, gusting his
179-yard, 5-iron approach into the gallery right of the 18th green,
then on a bounce into the beer tent. Tryba's approach, from 224
yards, landed in the rough on the hill left of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left my blade open, and it caught the wind,'' said Woods,
who felt he missed earlier opportunities. ``I had my chances for
birdies and wasn't able to convert. You have to be able to make
those in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryba, who lost, then regained the lead Sunday before fading in
the face of Els' three-birdie run, said he was happy about his
tournament for more than the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed myself that when I'm playing well, I can play with
the best players in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those players were on hand at Riviera, where the list of
also-rans resembled a Who's Who of professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time major winner Nick Price (69 Sunday) and David Duval
(also 69), ranked No. 2 in the world, shared fifth at 273, a stroke
ahead of Scott Hoch (66) and midway Nissan leader Bob Estes (69).
Mark Brooks, the 1996 PGA champion, also closed with a 66 to join a
four-way tie at 275.
</P>
<P>
   The final Nissan top-10 included five of the players ranked in
the current world top-10, including No. 3-ranked Love. Els was so
satisfied to outlast that kind of competition he wished he would
have brought a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the leaderboard looked today, I should have taken a
picture of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have players of that caliber in the field and all of
those guys competing for the championship and you're in the middle
of it, coming out on top must be very satisfying, to say the least.
You don't beat guys like that very often.''
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of Els' satisfaction in beating away Riviera
ghosts that have haunted him since his final-round 72 in the '95
PGA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first three rounds in the PGA were probably the best
I've ever played (a 54-hole tournament record of 13-under-par 197
before losing a three-stroke lead and the tournament on the back
nine),'' he said. ``But I finished the job this time.''

POLITICIANS TURN TO TEEN ACTIVISTS IN CAMPAIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lowrider car club member, the straight-A
Mission College sophomore and the teen-age mom from the Pacoima
housing project _ at one time political candidates dismissed these
young adults and others as inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates and political consultants alike say the race for the
7th District Los Angeles City Council seat may hinge on who
marshals the biggest and best army of young volunteers. Candidates
in the Northeast San Fernando Valley increasingly rely upon
teen-agers to get out their message and enlist support in wards
where the young have influence with newly registered Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were absolutely a phenomenal force in my race,'' said
Richard Alarcon, who left the 7th District council seat to run for
the state Senate seat that he won. ``I believe when you compare the
volunteer operation of my campaign to my opponent's campaign,
clearly the youth made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a 15-year-old who weighs 100 pounds and looks like
she's 12 knocking on your door saying, `Why haven't you voted? I
can't vote, but you can.' It really has a compelling impact and
gets voters out,'' said Alarcon. ``It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponent he defeated, former Assemblyman Richard Katz,
credited Alarcon and state Assemblyman Tony Cardenas with using
young volunteers effectively in their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy and dynamics that young people bring to the
campaign is irreplaceable,'' said Katz, an eight-term assemblyman
for the 39th District who also recruited young volunteers for his
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Alarcon drew 150 volunteers, while Cardenas more than
doubled that figure in 1996 with 350. Last spring, Alarcon had a
volunteer machine of more than 650 volunteers, and more than half
of them were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In Alarcon's council campaigns, youngsters entirely ran his
absentee ballot program.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, D-Panorama City, agrees that young volunteers are
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were instrumental in bringing a great, great energy to my
campaign,'' said Cardenas. ``They got people to recognize me as a
viable candidate. Without a doubt they were instrumental in my
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a twist to traditional politics where adult volunteers bring
their children on the campaign trail, the young volunteers in
Cardenas' campaigns got their parents involved.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 400 volunteers knocking on doors, stuffing envelopes
and staffing phone banks, other neighborhood residents saw
teen-agers and young adults in action and were inspired, Cardenas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People commented that they were going to vote for me because
they saw that I was working with youth and that youth were doing
something positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not entirely new but has gained new momentum
in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, where persuading new citizens
and newly registered voters to take part in the political process
goes beyond traditional campaign work, according to political
consultant Leo Briones.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Alarcon, Cardenas and former San Fernando
Mayor Raul Godinez II inspired teen-agers to participate in
unprecedented numbers, said Briones, founder of the Los
Angeles-based political campaign firm Centaur North Strategic
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers, many of whom were bilingual, were trained to
explain the ballot process to first-time voters, said Briones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard-working, grass-roots effort, and (for) the
youth working those campaigns, it's not just doing phone banking
and reading a script. It's a lot of hard work and dedication,''
said Briones.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's more than politics that has gone up in the San
Fernando Valley. To me it's been the campaigns that have provided
hope for people,'' said Briones.
</P>
<P>
   According to public affairs consultant Richard Lichtenstein,
political volunteerism has waned in the last decade and been
replaced by advertising in most regions, but the volunteer force in
the Northeast Valley has steadily grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why youth volunteers have had an extraordinary impact.
There's no question Alarcon won the state Senate race by that
(narrow) margin because of his ability to surpass Katz's ground
campaign,'' said Lichtenstein, president of Marathon
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful draw for young, minority volunteers has been the
chance to work for candidates with similar backgrounds, said
Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: with similar backgrounds, said Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brand new phenomenon for these (minority volunteers)
and these cultures to participate this way,'' said Lichtenstein,
who worked on Alarcon's first council race.
</P>
<P>
   The message is not lost on Barbara Perkins, a candidate for the
7th District race who said she has recruited young volunteers.
Youthful volunteers have the energy to commit themselves to
intensive campaign work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is going to be impacted by who can walk that
district, not by who can get the larger political endorsements,''
said Perkins, a community college executive. ``I think it is about
people to people, and my campaign is focused on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The intergenerational dialogue that will take place between
precinct-walking teen-agers and other residents is what society
needs, said Perkins, a resident of the Sylmar community in the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should see that our young people are doing more
than hanging out on a corner,'' said Perkins. ``The youth are
sending the message that they're productive citizens. The only
difference is they're young.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon and Cardenas said they put their faith in a combination
of high-achieving teens and teens who had been largely ignored and
at risk of being alienated from the political system. During his
first Assembly campaign in 1996, Cardenas' concern was that
Northeast San Fernando Valley teen-agers were stereotyped as having
no ambition and not encouraged to go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youth deserve to have a choice, and when they get involved
in politics they realize that's another choice they have,'' said
Cardenas. ``Not only are they capable of doing that, but they make
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said he also saw a void in opportunities for teens when
he ran for the 7th District council seat for the first time in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an outcry for youth involvement and, being a former
teacher and carrying a very strong youth agenda, I rallied for
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered it imperative for teen-agers and young
adults to get involved in political campaigns because many of the
7th District's issues _ such as gangs, graffiti, unemployment and
education _ affect them personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we integrated them into every aspect because youth
volunteers make every difference in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They include Alejandro Padilla, 25, who organized the young
force in Cardenas' 1996 campaign and tapped into the same network
to buoy Alarcon's successful campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now Padilla is running himself _ for the 7th District council
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteers were significant,'' said Padilla about the two
campaigns he helped run for others. ``There were so many of them
involved. I don't think we would have achieved the level of success
we did without their help.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Padilla began recruiting young volunteers the only way
he knew how: He thumbed through phone books for cousins, friends
and acquaintances, even former Little League pals. Cardenas headed
to the local schools to speak to government and politics classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was tremendous,'' said Cardenas. Many of the
volunteers were green, but that didn't stop Padilla. The campaign
office held orientation sessions every day. On any day 30
volunteers were likely to show up to help, Padilla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally walked through the process of this is a precinct,
this is a list of voters, this is what you say when you go to the
door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each election cycle created a bigger batch of young volunteers
who returned time and again.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ There has been nothing special or out of the
ordinary about the Astros' first week of spring training, which
amounts to little more than games of catch-and-toss.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just don't tell Chris Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Holt no longer takes for granted the simple task of throwing a
ball _ albeit at speeds approaching 90 mph. Nor does he ignore the
pain when his arm says it has had enough. Not this time around.
</P>
<P>
   And if he needs a reminder, he only has to stare at the scar
along his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It was here last spring that Holt, still in the recovery process
from offseason rotator-cuff surgery, arrived behind schedule but
optimistic he could start the season with the rest of his
teammates. Instead, he encountered a dead end everywhere he turned,
and what was supposed to be the second year of his major-league
career was wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   A year older and wiser and feeling a lot less pain, the
27-year-old righthander is ready to put his 16-month ordeal behind
him and start relocating the touch that made him a key contributor
for the Astros' 1997 division winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm back to square one,'' Holt said. ``I've got to
battle and make this team. I know if I'm healthy I can. They know
what I'm capable of doing. It's just coming back from arm surgery
that you don't know how someone is going to bounce back. They have
their concerns, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? Holt missed all of last season after a
failed attempt to rebound from what he originally described as
nothing more than ``an annoyance.'' It wasn't until the end of his
rookie season in October '97 that Holt had his shoulder examined,
but the pain originated 3{ months earlier. After the Astros were
eliminated from the playoffs, surgery was performed to correct the
problem, and the original prognosis had Holt missing three weeks of
the following season at most.
</P>
<P>
   But his last appearance in a game remains a one-inning relief
outing against the Cubs on Sept. 25, 1997, in which he struck out
three batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I tried to heat it up, I would start feeling it,''
Holt said. ``I would shut it down for a week, then I would go for
another couple of weeks and feel good. I was thinking I would be
ready to go, and there was another setback. Finally, it became a
fact it constantly was bothering me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training 1998 proved to be one long disappointment. Some
days were better than others, but each almost always ended with
some kind of setback. A couple of days of pain-free pitching were
offset by several days when it felt impossible for Holt to throw a
baseball. The Astros purposely held him out during stretches to see
if things improved.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the club left camp, Holt was nowhere close to being
ready to begin the season. During the next several weeks, he
pitched countless simulated outings _ ``Pretty soon they were
calling me Mr. Simulator,'' he says _ and flew halfway across the
country to work game situations in the organization's farm system.
Holt underwent a second surgical procedure in June to relieve
tightness in his shoulder, officially ending his hopes of pitching
for the Astros in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a constant roller coaster that he was on that
created an enormous frustration level for all of us to the point
where he finally realized pitching in 1998 was probably not going
to happen,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``This clearly
was a more difficult recovery than the normal recovery from an
operation, in that when he came to spring training (last year), the
expectation was he would be behind but only for a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been worse for Holt, who despite the
pain pitched his best ball in the second half of the 1997 season.
He finished 8-12 with a 3.52 ERA, logging 210 innings and 32
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no good time to be injured, but for a kid that had
just gone through his rookie year and just gotten his feet on the
ground, to have a major setback like this has to be difficult,''
Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Holt is prepared to put everything behind him and start
afresh. He had a successful 1{-month stint in the Puerto Rican
Winter League, continues to do rehab exercises and feels less pain
each day. The Astros' goal isn't to rush Holt's recovery but rather
take it at his speed.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker says it's too early to pronounce Holt's shoulder fully
recovered or even to think he can withstand the rigors of pitching
on a regular basis. Because of the nature of his injury, the Astros
are reluctant to use Holt in a relief role, so it's likely his only
chance to make the roster is to win a spot in the starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to be answered this week or next week or the
following week,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's probably not going to be
answered for another couple of months until we see whether his arm
can physically go through that routine without having any
significant setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on his short time here (this spring), he's a totally
different pitcher than he was a year ago. Last year, he was stiff,
he couldn't get his arm loose, couldn't extend his arm on his
follow-through. This year, there is none of that. He looks as good
as I've ever seen him. Having said that, it's easy to get overly
optimistic the first week of camp. It's important that we don't get
the cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holt, it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's all behind me,'' he said. ``If I'm healthy, I
know I'm a big-league pitcher. I've proven that.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ORLANDO, Fla. _ The road-weary Rockets awoke Sunday morning to a
pleasant surprise from a thoughtful, considerate, faraway source.
</P>
<P>
   A note slipped under their hotel-room doors told them Charles
Barkley was picking up the tab for breakfast. Too bad he couldn't
be at the O-rena to stop them from losing their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely what you might have expected from a team on
bald tires with an empty gas tank, playing its fifth game in its
fifth city in six days.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic was the windshield, and the Rockets were the bugs.
Armadillos with their stubby little legs sticking straight up into
the air. Roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight afternoon, the Rockets ran into a club
that plays aggressive, suffocating defense. And for the second
straight time, they could not breathe.
</P>
<P>
   On back-to-back days, the Rockets suffered a third-quarter
meltdown, this time scoring just 10 points against the Magic. Coach
Rudy Tomjanovich pondered whether drinking Diet Pepsi or coffee at
halftime would give them a jolt of energy.
</P>
<P>
   They turned the ball over 22 times. They were taken out of their
offensive rhythm. They lost their poise and eventually their
dignity in getting mauled 109-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a lot of this all season,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``You have the combination of the incredibly hard schedule
and no practice time, and it's going to make for some breakdowns
that will occasionally put good teams on bad streaks. Traveling or
playing just about every day means you don't get a chance to work
things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 games into this scrambling season, Rudy T is doing more
frantic improvisation than a one-armed paperhanger with his hair on
fire. He has been forced to hold chalk-talk sessions on the run and
pre-game walk-throughs in hotel ballrooms. At any opportunity, he
has tried to tutor and nurture all of his young, green talent with
a timely comment or observation.
</P>
<P>
   They need practice time and rest time that will never come. Not
with the schedule delivering them back to Houston for a pair of
rugged home dates with Seattle and Atlanta before immediately
slingshotting them back on the road to Vancouver and LA for another
match with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   What they also need desperately is Barkley, and not just for 19
points and 17 rebounds per game or his generosity in buying meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Charles as a kind of security blanket when we get into
those helter-skelter situations,'' Rudy T said. ``Things are going
on wild and crazy, and we can call his play to settle us down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Charles to run our offense through him,'' said Hakeem
Olajuwon. ``With him on the floor, it changes the whole game for
us. It opens things up and makes it easier to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Charles for his veteran leadership,'' said Scottie
Pippen. ``Right now, we're showing a lack of poise in a lot of
situations, and we need him to be a kind of calming influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Next we'll have calls going out for Calvin Klein
to lead the fight for restraint in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, they do miss Barkley in so many different ways,
not the least of which is his ability to slow down the offense,
draw double-teaming defenses and open up the rest of the floor for
his teammates, precisely the thing that infuriates his critics.
</P>
<P>
   While all they see is Barkley yo-yoing the ball with his dribble
while the 24-second clock runs down, he is also making it easier to
get the ball to Olajuwon and creating the open shots on the
perimeter that are half the ingredients in the Rockets'
bread-and-butter diet.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's absence may, in large part, be responsible for the
disappearance of Matt Maloney from the offense. Maloney was benched
in favor of Cuttino Mobley, and though he made some good plays on
his own, the rookie did not set up the inside game.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's presence prevents defenses from consistently fronting
Olajuwon, who looked fresh at the end of the trip with 21 points
and 10 rebounds but could have and should have been milked for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's return will take the burden off Pippen, who is
obviously straining at times to force himself into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   We know Barkley will use sheer determination to get more than
his share of boards and find a way to score inside by cleaning up
all the garbage. But what makes him so invaluable _ and what the
Rockets miss as much _ are the other personality traits. Picking up
Maloney or a Michael Dickerson and telling him to keep gunning even
if the shots don't fall. Putting a lid on the precocious Mobley's
play when it boils out of control. Making individual challenges to
his teammates and himself. And backing them up with his pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be different when Charles comes back,'' Olajuwon said.
``We will be our real selves again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't for a few more weeks,'' Pippen said. ``We can't
just sit back and wait. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   That the genial host, Charles Barkley, can only pick up their
meal tabs, not their game.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ORLANDO, Fla. _ For most of their first grueling road trip of the
season, the roof was sagging badly on the Rockets, springing leaks,
threatening disaster. But they repeatedly found ways to prop it up,
even raising the roof in an overtime win in New Jersey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, with the Rockets lacking the strength or savvy to fix
the holes again, the roof caved in. The Orlando Magic blew out the
Rockets in the second half Sunday for a 109-83 rout to send the
Rockets home from their four-games-in-five-days road trip with just
one victory and a long list of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting an all-rookie backcourt for the first time in franchise
history, the Rockets collapsed under the weight of the Magic's
ball-hawking defense. Matt Maloney, a starter in all 167 games of
his NBA career, was benched, playing only the last four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen enjoyed a dazzling second quarter in which he
carried the Rockets from a 13-point deficit to within three. But he
then had his second scoreless half in as many days and was ejected
after being called for his second technical in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And though Hakeem Olajuwon and Othella Harrington continued the
torrid shooting pace that has made the Rockets one of the most
accurate shooting teams in the NBA, they again could not get enough
chances to carry the offense or set up the Rockets' collection of
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   When it began to crumble, it all fell apart around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a buzz saw, a great defensive team,'' Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``That happens a lot. I call it the
dam breaking. They're like piranhas. They smell that blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had bled in every game throughout the four-game road
trip. But against the Nets and Heat, they were able to regroup and
rally, beating the Nets and giving themselves a chance to catch the
Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, after a largely ineffective afternoon in Miami, carried
them back out of another hole in the second quarter, scoring 16 of
his 19 points in the period as the Rockets rallied from 13 down to
within 46-43 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was phenomenal,'' Tomjanovich said of Pippen's run. ``I was
ready to take him out. He has been playing a lot of minutes. But I
pulled the guy back twice, he was going so well. He's a
tremendously conditioned guy. He played 42 minutes (Saturday) and
24 minutes in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets turned the ball over eight times in the first half,
but that didn't offer a hint as to what would come. They outshot
and outrebounded the Magic and trailed only because they could not
get the ball inside to Olajuwon or Harrington with any regularity.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second consecutive afternoon, the Rockets collapsed
in the third quarter. After scoring nine points in the third
quarter Saturday, the worst third quarter in franchise history,
they managed 10 against the Magic. But instead of failing to get
good shots and shooting poorly, the Rockets could not run their
offense, committing 10 turnovers in the quarter and falling behind
72-53.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the difference in the game,'' Pippen said. ``We
didn't execute in the second half. We turned the ball over a lot in
the third quarter, and they took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start executing better under pressure. The
turnovers (the Rockets finished with 22) really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie backcourt did not collect turnovers as rookies often
will, as later demonstrated by Bryce Drew. But Cuttino Mobley and
Michael Dickerson had trouble running plays, particularly against
the pressure of Darrell Armstrong off the bench with Penny Hardaway
and Bo Outlaw roaming the passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets shot well inside with Olajuwon getting 21 points and
making nine of 13 shots, and Harrington scoring 12 on 6-of-10
shooting. But between them, they took just 10 shots in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a second late realizing this is the play we're
running and you've got an aggressive defensive team, you can't even
make the entry pass,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Our young guys are
learning a lot. We wanted to isolate to run some plays for Michael,
but he couldn't get open. Those are growing pains. They're going to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said playing five games in six nights, the last four
on the road, was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish it on anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule might have shown up in the Rockets' outside
shooting. Matt Bullard missed all seven of his attempts, Brent
Price missed two, and Dickerson was 2-of-6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets pointed to their inability to attack the Magic's
defensive pressure. Outlaw pressured Pippen in the second half, and
the Magic guards disrupted plays before they could get started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bo at halftime, `Keep playing Scottie physically,'''
Hardaway said. ``He was giving him too much space in the first
half, and he got going. I said, `Get out on him, and if he gets by,
we'll help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come in as a rookie and play myself and Nick
(Anderson). We're big guards. Once Cuttino committed himself to one
side, I overplayed that side and they couldn't get into the offense
until the shot clock was running down.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Pippen was about to be run off the court and the
Rockets had run out of comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tough one,'' Olajuwon said. ``We made a lot of
mistakes. We have every once in a while a game like this. We have
to go home and regroup.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Being a part-time musician and budding
entertainer, Jose Lima is familiar with the term.
</P>
<P>
   One-hit wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In this otherwise virtually worry-free spring training, it is
the one question and concern hovering over Lima and the 1999
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the real Jose Lima? Or Vanilla Ice?
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of proven veterans Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and
Ken Caminiti holding down the 1999 offense and Shane Reynolds and
Mike Hampton having proved their stability on the mound, the
legitimacy of Lima's 16-8 record last year is an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lima's breakout season of last year, his professional
baseball career was more like that of a garage band than a
headliner. Lots of noise, little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a no-hitter in the minor leagues a few years back,
then some decent outings in Detroit. Scouts all over talked about
Lima's potential.
</P>
<P>
   But then there proved to be more forgettable outings than good
ones and growing concern that the potential of this fun-loving
salsa aficionado never would be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was called up to Motown one day, sent back to the minors
another. He wanted his game to bounce like Tito Puente, but it was
more like Tito Jackson. He compiled a three-year record of 8-16 in
Detroit with a 6.24 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a real chance to start in Detroit,'' Lima said.
``That's what I am. I am a starting pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the development of a wicked if inconsistent changeup,
a few nice winter seasons in the Latin American leagues and then
the trade to Houston, which offered new hope.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Astros, it was back to the pen, and at first the
calls to Lima were made out of necessity. The results were mixed.
In 52 appearances (51 in relief) with the Astros in 1997, Lima was
just 1-6 with a 5.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He contended throughout that being a starter would change
everything. But as recently as last spring, after an unimpressive
Grapefruit League season and an exhibition outing against the
Kansas City Royals in which nearly every pitch Lima tried was
shredded, his status with the team was tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   He was called into a meeting with Astros manager Larry Dierker
and general manager Gerry Hunsicker and told that the starting job
about which he dreamed instead would go to Pete Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were honest with him,'' Hunsicker said. ``We told him he
wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But days later, a nagging shoulder injury forced Schourek out,
and Dierker gave the ball to Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job became Jose's by default, really,'' Hunsicker said.
``He didn't have a very good spring, but then look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima took the ball and danced around opposing batters, stunning
the league with his fiery attitude, confounding changeup and grit
on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   He became a fan favorite. He showed not just skill as a starter
but poise, consistently pitching out of trouble and coming up big
in big games.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Astros traded for Randy Johnson, Lima was
concerned his starting spot again would be in jeopardy. He went out
and pitched a 10-strikeout five-hitter against Pittsburgh,
declaring in the clubhouse afterward, ``I hope I sent a message. I
should be in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, his game was a smash hit. But was it real?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unreasonable to want him to prove it wasn't a
fluke,'' Hunsicker said. ``What he did last year he'd never done
before. I want him to prove it, too. But based on his age (26) and
where he is in his career, there's no reason to believe he's going
to take a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is one question constantly being asked this spring:
Will Lima's 1998 season go the way of Billy Ray Cyrus _ winning
achy, breaky hearts one year but crumbling into oblivion the next?
</P>
<P>
   Lima, like all Astros pitchers, has yet to face live action this
spring. On Sunday, there was some concern when he sat out pitching
drills with a sore back and throwing shoulder. But by the end of
the workout, he was running with pitchers and promising to provide
answers for the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear those things,'' Lima said. ``I told people last year
that I would be a starting pitcher and I would win 15 games.
Everybody laughed. But what did I do? I won 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I got the opportunity, and it changed my life.
Right now, I am telling you that if I'm healthy, I'm going to pitch
good again and I could win 20 games. Why not? With this team, I'm
going to win. People will say, `Jose Lima can't do it.' But I can.
I'm going to make my noise on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set. But Lima, the consummate entertainer, should
know one thing more than anyone else. The toughest part of the show
is the encore.

CITIZEN COMPLAINTS HIGH ON INTERIM LAPD INSPECTOR GENERAL'S
PRIORITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Deirdre Hill is cautiously approaching her
job of interim LAPD inspector general, she believes a number of
issues need close attention, including charges of retaliatory
complaints between officers and police treatment of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Christopher Commission issued its landmark report on
the Los Angeles Police Department in 1991, the department's citizen
complaint procedures have improved dramatically, Hill said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But she said more study is needed to see if discipline for
police misconduct against citizens is adequate and whether internal
disciplinary processes are fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who served as Police Commission president from 1993 to
1996, took over the post seven weeks ago from former Inspector
General Katherine Mader, who resigned early this year amid
frustration with department brass and conflicts with commission
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The department's citizen complaint procedures are vastly more
open and accessible than in the past, and discourtesy toward
citizens is viewed more seriously, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, it's unclear whether cases of misconduct
toward civilians receive discipline commensurate to the severity of
the offense, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a question as to how the department values
misconduct related to citizens and whether that evaluation is in
accordance with what the public would expect,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has been historically hard on its internal
policies and procedures and not as hard on use of force and civil
rights violations,'' she said, adding that historic distrust of
police persists in the inner city despite recent reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation by the Inspector General's Office would confirm
whether the investigation of civilian complaints is serious and
thorough, and the discipline appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the department is doing an excellent job at it,
as has been the perception, but people need to know it is being
looked at, for deterrence'' of future offenses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the internal complaint process must be
examined for fairness and consistency. Worry about those issues has
rippled through the ranks in recent months, but systematic analysis
is needed to discover whether those fears are based on fact, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the department, the employees have always been
concerned that there may not be consistency between discipline at
the level of the command staff, for example, and the patrol officer
on the beat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's concern that discipline may change from one Board of
Rights to another for the same event. And there are other questions
of inequity that the goal of this office is to look at. Whether or
not that perception is reality I don't think we know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   She said retaliation between officers is pervasive, and that the
internal complaint process has become a tool with which some
officers lash out at others to stall promotions or strike back for
complaints filed against themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really astonishing the number of complaints that
employees bring against each other,'' she said. ``And in a
private-sector environment, you would never see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said her office must look at the extent of that retaliation
and the time period for resolving those matters for officers on the
promotional list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there preference given to someone whom the management wants
to be promoted?'' she asked. ``Is it inordinately long for someone
who is not a favored son?''
</P>
<P>
   Mader said she agrees with Hill's areas of concern and added
that some of her own studies validated those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We documented numerous instances of retaliation, and I agree
with Deirdre that retaliation against persons, particularly on the
inside who try to report misconduct, is a very serious issue,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish said the department supports Hill's
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's position is that's healthy and that's what
the inspector general should be doing: auditing and looking at
systems and outcomes,'' he said.

 TOLERANT MILAN BECOMES TERRIFIED OF IMMIGRANTS  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN _ The Milanese have long taken pride in being ``the least
Italian'' of Italians. In a nation plagued by bureaucratic anarchy,
emotional excess and resistance to change, they were paragons of
efficiency, restraint _ and a cosmopolitan openness to new people
and customs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ``We had a strong tradition of tolerance, a belief in the
value of diversity,'' says Franco Mirabelli, local secretary of
Italy's ruling Democrats of the Left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians awake!'' read a flyer plastered on walls all over the
city in January. ``Rise up against the arrogance of the immigrant
thugs of every race and color in our streets. Take back our
neighborhoods!''
</P>
<P>
   Milan the tolerant, in 1999, has become a metropolis of fear _ a
testing ground for urban Europe's ability to remain tolerant, once
its population diversity reaches critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   Geography explains why that critical mass has been reached in
Milan. It commands nearly all of the major highways and rail lines
that link the Italian Mediterranean to the rest of Europe. One
result is that Milan is the richest city in Italy, a world banking
and fashion capital with a per capita gross domestic product higher
than western Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it is a major destination on the clandestine
road between the Third World and the affluent heart of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1,200 emigrants are landing daily on the southern
Italian coast, mostly illegally, from as far away as China and Sri
Lanka. All but a few head immediately for the industrial north, and
Milan is where the north begins.
</P>
<P>
   The city is now home to more than 100,000 undocumented
foreigners, according to police sources, plus thousands more who
spend a few months working in Milan as menial laborers before
crossing the European Union's open internal borders en route to
teeming immigrant communities in France, Germany, Holland or
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the undocumented arrive with nothing in their pockets,
and many are burdened with substantial debts to the underworld
syndicates that preside over Europe's enormous traffic in
clandestine immigrants. Like Italy's own immigrants to the United
States before World War I, they find themselves caught between two
unsavory options: acute exploitation or crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 18 months, says Milan Mayor Gabriele Albertini, his
city has seen ``an intolerable growth in episodes of small-scale
criminality,'' such as purse-snatching, muggings and petty
burglary.
</P>
<P>
   But far more worrisome, he says, is evidence of
``ever-increasing violence, tied to clandestine immigration,'' and
the recruitment of undocumented newcomers in protection rackets and
sex rings.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study published by La Repubblica, Italy's leading
daily newspaper, 25,000 of the estimated 30,000 full-time
prostitutes in the country today are foreigners, chiefly from
Eastern Europe and Africa. More than a third are girls under 18,
many of whom have been forcibly kidnapped in their homelands and
sold to middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop calling them prostitutes,'' says Maria Stella
Conte, a Roman journalist who has written extensively on the
immigrant flesh trade. ``They are slaves. The private property of
human dregs. Meat to chew and spit out.''
</P>
<P>
   Milanese anxiety over the crime problem skyrocketed in early
January, when immigrant gang wars over prostitution and drug turf
took nine lives in the first nine days of the year. It reached
crisis proportions January 21 with the fatal knifing of Father
Renzo Beretta, a 78-year-old priest who ran a homeless shelter in
the suburban town of Chiasso, by a undocumented Moroccan immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a code of behavior, even among criminals: You
don't hurt children or women. You don't kill priests,'' says
Massimo Turci, legislative director for the National Alliance party
in Lombardy, the region surrounding Milan. ``These new criminals
from outside of our borders have no code, no scruples at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan industrialist Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the
neofascist National Alliance and the separatist Northern League _
the right-wing political parties that dominate local politics _ led
protests against crime that drew tens of thousands of marchers in
January and February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clandestine immigration is the new barbarian invasion,''
thundered Umberto Bossi, founder of the violently xenophobic
Northern League. ``We say no, not now or ever, to a multiracial
society in Lombardy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, multiracial society has already taken root in the large
cities of the European Union, and its chief expression is not crime
but an explosion of rudimentary free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Albertini's office estimates that 2,000 newcomers per
week, legally and illegally, are settling in Milan. They are the
vanguard of a revolution _ visible and hidden _ in the city of 4.2
million, assembling an American-style ethnic mosaic on the Lombard
plain between Lake Como and the River Po.
</P>
<P>
   The blocks north of the Cathedral of Milan in the city center
have bloomed with Eritrean restaurants, Senegalese beauty shops and
Tunisian grocery stores. When a visiting reporter sat down recently
to a dish of risotto Milanese at the Ristorante il Capriccioso near
the Public Gardens, he was startled to learn that the owners and
head chef were from Nanjing, China.
</P>
<P>
   Their counterparts elsewhere in the EU include the proprietors
of 35,000 Turkish-owned businesses in Germany, and France's
ubiquitous ``petits Arabs du coin'' _ ``little Arab corner
groceries,'' usually open to midnight, that supply Paris with
late-night vin rouge and Brie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to work longer hours, for less money, than most
Italians. It's as simple as that,'' said Mohammed Moharam, the
Egyptian founder of Milan's Pyramid Cleaning, echoing the classic
refrain of immigrant entrepreneurs in San Francisco and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid offers janitorial services for homes and offices, window
washing, furniture moving, junk removal and painting, all at
``prezzi modici,'' reasonable prices. Its staff is a rainbow team
of Arabs, Sir Lankans and East and West Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high, unfilled demand for basic labor in northern
Italy,'' says Mirabelli. ``The immigrants accept jobs that very few
Italians are prepared to consider anymore, even if they are
unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, ``it's taken for granted nowadays that the dirtiest,
hardest tasks will be carried out by black people,'' notes Mohamed
Djalo, a social worker in a heavily African Paris neighborhood and
himself an immigrant from Guinea. ``They're the ones who are paid
by the day, without benefits, to carry loads of bricks on their
backs at construction sites. They're the cleaning ladies and the
street sweepers.`'
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arab corner groceries, Turkish entrepreneurs and the
crushing labor of Africans do not command headlines. It is the
stabbing of a priest or the outbreak of a gang war that drives
political campaigns and popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the Lebanon of the '80s, or Algeria,'' Italian
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema reminded the Milanese in a public
meeting with Mayor Albertini. Warning against ``racist hysteria,''
he pointed out that ``organized crime is nourished only partly by
clandestine immigration and remains for the most part absolutely
native (Italian).''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema was rewarded for his efforts with a volley of rotten
eggs thrown from the audience, and he eventually agreed to
subsidize 600 extra police in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the extremist National Front has been a significant
political force for a decade, thanks to relentless diatribes
against ``lawless foreigners.'' Its founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and
his rival Bruno Megret, who leads an extremist splinter group, have
both exploited growing concern over the role of organized crime in
the immigration crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle investigation found evidence that half a dozen
well-established mafias, from the Sicilian original to its
spin-offs and collaborators in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, are
deeply involved in the clandestine influx.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by human rights-preaching Europe and the United
States, the self-proclaimed ``liberation armies'' of Kurds in
Turkey and Iraq, Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, Kosovo Albanians and a
host of ethnic separatist movements in black and Arab Africa, have
effectively thrown their lot in with the dons. In return for arms,
money and places in smuggling networks that land their human cargo
on the Italian and Spanish coasts, many are now foot soldiers in
the empire of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a diabolically vicious circle, say worried human
rights activists, in which immigrant crime feeds directly into
anti-immigrant xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Front and the drug dealers are de facto allies,''
says Fode Sylla, president of SOS-Racism, the leading pressure
group against anti-immigrant discrimination. ``Neither has any
interest in seeing troubled areas get out of the mess they're in.
As long as nothing changes, the extreme right will continue to play
on people's fears, and the dealers will tranquilly pursue their
establishment of Mafia rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1988 and 1995, the National Front became the top
vote-getter among working class Frenchmen with its call for the
forcible repatriation of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   A similar right-wing backlash is brewing in Italy, where the
center-left government has proposed regularizing the status of
nearly 300,000 undocumented immigrants at a single stroke, on the
theory that it is precisely their clandestine existence that drives
them to crime. In response, ``the question of public security, and
an alleged immigrant threat to it, are being pushed very hard by
the Italian right,'' says Mirabelli. ``They see it as the major
issue on which they can court frightened voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for rightist parties are quick to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illegal immigration and crime are the first concerns of the
National Alliance,'' says Massimo Turci. ``After 6 p.m., it's the
foreign gangs that govern here. That can't go on, we tell voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects will be clear in June, when national elections are
held in Italy. ``But we already know, from our own public opinion
surveys, that our prospects have become much better as a result of
this crisis,'' Turci said.

LAW-AND-ORDER POLITICS: LEFTISTS COMPETE WITH THE RIGHT
FOR  HARD-LINE STANCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (sidebar to MILAN-IMMIGRANTS) 
 &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Immigrant crime _ and mounting hysteria over it _ are not unique to
northern Italy.
<P>
   Since 1987, nearly 2 million refugees have poured into Germany,
legally and illegally, part of an overall immigrant or foreign-born
population of 10.7 million. As in Italy, a small but conspicuous
number of them have drifted into the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Poles are especially active in organized car theft.
Prostitution is dominated by the Russian mafia, and drug dealers
come most often from southeast Europe or black Africa,'' Social
Democratic Party chief Gerhard Schroeder said in a 1997 speech,
prior to his election as German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those (foreigners) who violate our hospitality, there is
only one solution,'' Schroeder said: ``Get out of Germany, fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Riots in France's ``quartiers difficiles'' _ the bleak high-rise
immigrant suburbs of Paris, Lyon and other large French cities _
have become commonplace in the past few years, with 8,000 cars
burned by mobs of young people in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in these areas have witnessed a sharp increase in
delinquency since the decade opened. Between 1995 and 1996, in the
largely nonwhite suburb of St. Denis where last year's soccer World
Cup final was held, the number of schoolyard assaults rose by 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under public pressure to act, the Socialist government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin has proposed sending an army of 7,000
additional policemen into immigrant neighborhoods, building 50 new
detention centers and 87 reform schools for juvenile offenders in
the troubled districts, and imposing a nighttime curfew on
youngsters under 12.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's police measures, like Schroeder's speech, reflect a
stark paradox in the assumption of power by center-left political
parties across much of Europe in the late 1990s. To win election,
and remain in government afterward, mainstream socialist parties
have been drawn into an acrimonious law-and-order competition with
the political right.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, law and order has been redefined as ``immigrant
control,'' pushing the debate into dangerous terrain for centrist
parties of any stripe, government critics warn. Politicians who
play this card ``exploit the theme of fear, allowing people to
believe that waves of foreigners are out to destroy the well-being
of Germans,'' says Gunter Verheugen, a Social Democratic expert on
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are greatest for the immigrants themselves. On
February 14, in what has become a grimly familiar drama in Germany,
a 28-year-old Algerian immigrant severed an artery in his knee and
bled to death while trying to escape a band of neo-Nazi bullies in
the eastern state of Brandenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences of fear hit home for the Social
Democrats in regional elections February 7. Waging a mudslinging
assault on government plans to make citizenship possible for as
many as 4 million of the 7.3 million legally settled immigrants in
Germany, the conservative Christian Democratic Union won control of
the western state of Hesse for the first time since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls, just 39 percent of Germans say they support
the proposed new citizenship policy.
</P>
<P>
   The election results in Hesse _ Germany's richest state and the
location of its financial hub, Frankfurt _ also meant the loss of a
Social Democratic majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the
national legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term winners are likely to be extremists, says
Verheugen. An anti-immigrant campaign strategy ``is very dangerous,
and makes a comfortable bed for the extreme right in Germany.''

   1. BITTER HARVEST : TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER ON THE ARREST
</P>
<P>
   OF THE KURDISH LEADER Bulent Ecevit, 73, became prime minister
of Turkey last month for the fourth time. In this exclusive
interview, Ecevit fiercely defends Turkey's arrest of the Kurdish
chief Abdullah Ocalan. He says European governments, particularly
those of Germany and Italy, bear partial responsibility for the
rioting and deaths that followed the arrest because they tolerate
the presence of terrorists on their soil. Ecevit says that with
Oclan's arrest, Kurdish separatism is near its end. From Der
Spiegel. 800 words (English translation available.) Q&AMP;A format. 2.
WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR, MAMA? During Salvador's nightmarish
civil war, hundreds of babies and young children were taken from
villages by the military. Now, nearly a generation later, many of
those who survived are being reunited with their biological
families. It isn't always an easy occasion because sometimes
politics can be thicker than blood. By Tina Rosenberg. From The New
York Times Magazine. Full-length (8,500 words) + edited article
available. 3. BURYING KHOMEINI The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
returned to Iran from exile 20 years ago to spark an Islamic
revolution that, in the eyes of many, dragged Iran back to the
seventh century. In fact, it was a pure product of this
blood-soaked century and its excesses. By Fouad Ajami. From The New
York Times Magazine. 1,000 words. 4. THE REBEL CODE Free to anyone
on the Internet, the Linus operating system, created by a
journalist's son, has mutated in recent months from a geek fetish
to a challenger to Microsoft Windows. By Amy Harmon. From The New
York Times Magazine. 2,500 words.

   A. TOO MUCH, TOO YOUNG Children are not simply miniature adults.
They react to chemicals quite differently. Few drugs are tested on
children, so doctors are having to gamble on suitable doses - often
with dangerous consequences. By Janet Fricker. 1,000 words. B.
WHAT'S THIS VOLCANO TRYING TO TELL US? Deep gurgles and belches
from far underground could be the early warning volcanologists have

</P>
<P>
   D. GALACTIC VISIONARIES Europe's astronomers reckon they can
build a telescope bigger than all its predecessors put together,
and thousands of times more powerful than the best we have today,
says Marcus Chown. 2,000 words.

really so similar to people that they should have specific legal
rights? By Rachel Nowak. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   F. ZAP IT AND SEE Could ultrasound reduce the stress of tumour
surgery? By Duncan Graham-Rowe. 400 words. 6. From NATURE NEWS
SERVICE N/A France and Spain. Embargo : 19h00 GMT Wednesday, Feb.
25
</P>
<P>
   A. SPRING FORWARD, FALL BACK Spring is springing earlier in
Europe. Certainly, as far as plants and animals are concerned - 6
days earlier than it did thirty or so years ago. And autumn sticks
around for 5 days more than it used to. The shifts can be
attributed to changes in air temperature.
</P>
<P>
   B. MAKING A DIN FOR SOME DINNER How does the single cuckoo chick
- the imposter in the nest - trick its foster parents into
providing it with as much food as they would normally provide for a
whole brood of their own chicks? How does it get them to feed it at
all?

TRUST ME, NO MATH IS SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter who says what, I'm not a math illiterate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I can multiply, say, 10 by 11 on a calculator and
get, uh, whatever the answer is. I can balance my checkbook. And I
can find the numbers on my phone to dial my wife's office, though I
don't need to anymore because I'm clever enough to have put her on
speed dial (in case I need a quick reminder of what she told me
earlier today that I've already forgotten). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as for topology, well, what I know about topology you could
put in a tiny 2-hectare (or whatever) thimble. In fact, I confess
that although the word topology seems uncomplicated _ almost common
_ I'm not sure I'd ever heard of it before I read a recent
Sacramento Bee story. (Oh, that is, too, the name of the newspaper
there, but it's not something I'd brag about.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Topology, it turns out, is a modern form of math that might or
might not be related to geometry. If I have space later I'll
explain it more. If not, look it up. In my encyclopedia it comes
not long after Topeka, a name that may mean ``a good place to dig
potatoes.'' Really. You could look that up, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Topology (not Topeka) figured in the recent Sacramento story
because a famous math puzzle that, the Bee said, had confounded
experts for at least 70 years, recently was solved. The guy who
mastered it was an alumnus of Sacramento State University, which no
doubt was why the Bee cared anything about this news, its ``Math
Section'' being no larger than that of your average daily American
newspaper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (As for something that has confounded experts for some 70 years,
Strom Thurmond also comes to mind. But I can't imagine any branch
of math that could help us unravel that mystery, so let it go.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mathematician-painter who solved this long-standing puzzle
is Vladimir Akis, who teaches math at a Los Angeles college. Akis
recently returned to his alma mater to present his solution. Among
those in the audience was his mentor, Charles Hagopian, a
Sacramento State math teacher who had tried for three decades to
figure out the puzzle himself. Hagopian had the decency not to
gripe about Akis' cleverness. Instead, he called it a ``happy
day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to pretend to explain both the puzzle and Akis'
solution, but you would discover almost immediately that my
explanation comes from someone who has no idea what he's talking
about, which would remind you of Strom Thurmond again, and I'm
doing my best to keep Strom Thurmond out of this altogether. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So instead I'll pass on some of the results of my semi-vast
research into topology. That information, after all, may help you
win a radio quiz or some such almost immediately, whereas the
puzzle explanation would have to be so long and bizarre that you'd
give up in exhaustion if you tried to grasp it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A name prominently associated with topology (which does not, by
the way, have to do with the study of toy tops) is L.E.J. Brouwer,
a Dutch mathematician and founder of ``Intuitionism'' who lived
from 1881 to 1966. One source I consulted said his most important
work in topology was done between 1909 and 1913, which made me
wonder how he blew the rest of his life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   L.E.J., by the way, stood for Luitzen Egbertus Jan, which
explains why he went by the initials. Brouwer postulated something
called a fixed-point theorem, which says, roughly, that if you
change the shape of a flat surface from a square to a triangle
using the same material, at least one point in the reshaped
triangle will lie exactly above the point where it originally lay
in the square. Can you imagine figuring out such a thing? Me
either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's not surprising. I also can't imagine what I would
have said if I'd had enough space to explain topology to you. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 21, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Kurds, Bosnians, Scots, former
Soviet republics, central African tribes, Marshall Islanders and
others: there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism is militantly bucking the trend toward
globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a new vengeance
from a half-century of enforced quiescence. Or is it? Many of the
new nationalistic movements are fighting not each other but simply
trying to better position themselves in the new global marketplace.
By Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLICE-BRUTALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Can the `zero tolerance'
anti-crime policies that have come into vogue over the last decade
be implemented without the trampling of innocent people's rights?
Embedded in the public angst over police brutality, there is a dark
underbelly to the superficially unassailable goal of stamping out
crime: Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of
brutality from their police officers, but also, in ways subtle and
unsubtle, to encourage it. By Frank Bruni. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-MORALS-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Angered and puzzled
by President Clinton's acquittal, some conservatives have come to
an extraordinary realization, which may carry grim implications for
the their movement: They blame not themselves for mishandling the
whole episode, but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
But blaming the prevailing public will can be risky, particularly
in an age when politicians find that public to be increasingly
aloof. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATORS-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ State legislatures have
always had their farmers, teachers, engineers and entrepreneurs,
but from the early days of the Republic, no group has been as
over-represented as lawyers. But for the last three decades, even
as the profession has grown in numbers, its grip on state capitols
has steadily slipped, a trend that continued in the turnover
brought by the 1998 elections. By Richard Perez-Pena. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-JOBS-REVIEW (Bad River Reservation, Wis.) _ Many Indians
are returning to their ancestral homes, not just for funerals and
weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has spawned a
windfall of new employment in casinos, hotels and restaurants. And
the profits are often invested locally, enlivening formerly
moribund tribal economies. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-CLEMENS-REVIEW (New York) _ Roger Clemens, the best
starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15 seasons and one of
the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance, possibly his last, for
the World Series ring that will validate his career. The Yanks get
the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or close to it. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL-POLICE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the growing trend
in Congress to federalize crimes that are traditionally handled by
state and local authorities. Federal law enforcement agents are
being asked to track down car-jackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers
and low-level drug dealers. Some legal experts warn of the
emergence of a national police force. By Steven A. Holmes. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TABLOIDS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The National Enquirer and the
Star have seen their circulations plummet in the last five years as
the median age of their readers has risen from just over 35 to
around 40. A look at some recent headlines and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   TOY-FAIR-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the 96th American
International Toy Fair, where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle
their wares to 20,000 buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't
hit stores yet. Some are still prototypes and failed in
demonstrations; others succeeded in demonstrations and will still
fail in stores. A look at some of the toys exhibited. By Jenny Lyn
Bader.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon does not like to say
it, but almost-daily skirmishes between U.S. pilots and Iraqi
forces have quickly turned into a low-level war of attrition that
appears to have no end in sight. Not since the Persian Gulf War in
1991 _ and, before that, Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such
routine combat in such a sustained way over such a prolonged
period. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the political
consequences of the recent economic crisis in East Asia and Brazil;
they are as varied as the countries themselves. Even as the world
economy seems to be stabilizing after 20 months of chaos, the
political tensions engendered by those events are only worsening.
From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who once talked,
Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a globally
integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of the
pool. By David E. Sanger.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Feb. 21, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONALISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Kurds, Bosnians, Scots, former
Soviet republics, central African tribes, Marshall Islanders and
others: there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism is militantly bucking the trend toward
globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a new vengeance
from a half-century of enforced quiescence. Or is it? Many of the
new nationalistic movements are fighting not each other but simply
trying to better position themselves in the new global marketplace.
By Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLICE-BRUTALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Can the `zero tolerance'
anti-crime policies that have come into vogue over the last decade
be implemented without the trampling of innocent people's rights?
Embedded in the public angst over police brutality, there is a dark
underbelly to the superficially unassailable goal of stamping out
crime: Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of
brutality from their police officers, but also, in ways subtle and
unsubtle, to encourage it. By Frank Bruni. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-MORALS-REVIEW (Nashua, N.H.) _ Angered and puzzled
by President Clinton's acquittal, some conservatives have come to
an extraordinary realization, which may carry grim implications for
the their movement: They blame not themselves for mishandling the
whole episode, but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
But blaming the prevailing public will can be risky, particularly
in an age when politicians find that public to be increasingly
aloof. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATORS-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ State legislatures have
always had their farmers, teachers, engineers and entrepreneurs,
but from the early days of the Republic, no group has been as
over-represented as lawyers. But for the last three decades, even
as the profession has grown in numbers, its grip on state capitols
has steadily slipped, a trend that continued in the turnover
brought by the 1998 elections. By Richard Perez-Pena. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-JOBS-REVIEW (Bad River Reservation, Wis.) _ Many Indians
are returning to their ancestral homes, not just for funerals and
weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has spawned a
windfall of new employment in casinos, hotels and restaurants. And
the profits are often invested locally, enlivening formerly
moribund tribal economies. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   YANKS-CLEMENS-REVIEW (New York) _ Roger Clemens, the best
starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15 seasons and one of
the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance, possibly his last, for
the World Series ring that will validate his career. The Yanks get
the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or close to it. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL-POLICE-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the growing trend
in Congress to federalize crimes that are traditionally handled by
state and local authorities. Federal law enforcement agents are
being asked to track down car-jackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers
and low-level drug dealers. Some legal experts warn of the
emergence of a national police force. By Steven A. Holmes. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TABLOIDS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The National Enquirer and the
Star have seen their circulations plummet in the last five years as
the median age of their readers has risen from just over 35 to
around 40. A look at some recent headlines and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   TOY-FAIR-REVIEW (New York) _ A look at the 96th American
International Toy Fair, where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle
their wares to 20,000 buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't
hit stores yet. Some are still prototypes and failed in
demonstrations; others succeeded in demonstrations and will still
fail in stores. A look at some of the toys exhibited. By Jenny Lyn
Bader.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon does not like to say
it, but almost-daily skirmishes between U.S. pilots and Iraqi
forces have quickly turned into a low-level war of attrition that
appears to have no end in sight. Not since the Persian Gulf War in
1991 _ and, before that, Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such
routine combat in such a sustained way over such a prolonged
period. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at the political
consequences of the recent economic crisis in East Asia and Brazil;
they are as varied as the countries themselves. Even as the world
economy seems to be stabilizing after 20 months of chaos, the
political tensions engendered by those events are only worsening.
From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who once talked,
Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a globally
integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of the
pool. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-IMMOLATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ A grisly shadow from the
earliest days of the Vietnam War crept across the media landscape
last week as Kurdish protesters in Europe set themselves on fire or
threatened to. The events evoked memories of 1963, when Buddhist
monks immolated themselves to protest the Saigon regime. A look at
the historical and psychological aspects of self-immolation. By Joe
Sharkey.

 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICA IN BLACK AND WHITE: ONE NATION, INDIVISIBLE &LR;  By Stephan
Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$18. Two social scientists argue in language that alternates
between combative and generous that it was World War II and not
civil rights laws and government intervention that led to better
prospects for black America. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer
Nicholas Lemann was not fully persuaded but praised the
``eloquence, toughness and conviction'' of their proposals to
improve race relations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT TRAIN &LR;  By Martin Amis. Vintage International, $11. The
tough-talking detective Mike Hoolihan is a ``big blond old broad''
assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of the daughter of her
commanding officer, a father figure to both women who saved
Hoolihan from her alcoholism. Last year the reviewer Patrick
McGrath called this ``a police procedural that elegantly defers to
the conventions of the genre while at the same time sinking its
probes deep into the question of human motivation.'' He added that
``this brilliant, painful short novel is ... so profoundly
inflected with grief that it achieves in the end a sort of
melancholy grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS: THE BATTLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE
MARKETPLACE THAT IS REMAKING THE MODERN WORLD &LR;  By Daniel Yergin and
Joseph Stanislaw. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15. This ambitious
study charts an extraordinary revolution in progress: the shift in
the balance of power from big government to market forces, and the
effects of that change on global politics, economics and culture.
The result is ``a colorful and even suspenseful story of how the
world has been transformed over the last half century,'' Jeffrey E.
Garten wrote in the Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING AMERICA'S MARKET: U.S. FOREIGN TRADE POLICY SINCE 1776 &LR; 
By Alfred E. Eckes Jr. University of North Carolina, $19.95. A
former trade official in the Bush and Reagan administrations traces
the history of U.S. trade policy to help readers sort through the
arguments of both free-traders and protectionists. In 1995 Michael
Lind called this ``a dispassionate, informed and accessible
account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LOVER'S ALMANAC &LR;  By Maureen Howard. Penguin, $12.95. Modeled
on the ``Old Farmer's Almanac,'' this novel strives to demystify
the millennium by following a couple of Generation X'ers and an
extended cast of lively minor characters into the year 2000. It's a
strange brew, but it's also ``rich propaganda'' and ``the product
of obsessive craft,'' Lorna Sage wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE WITH A STAR &LR;  By Jiri Weil. Northwestern University,
$15.95. The little-known but influential Czech author, who died in
1959, tells the tale of a lonely former bank clerk struggling to
survive in an unnamed city against the tyranny of an unnamed enemy:
It happens that the man is Jewish, the city is Prague and his
tormentors are the Nazis, but the story gains power through its
universality. In 1989 the reviewer Anne Tyler admired this
``stripped, stark, uninflected novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Weil's books,
 &UR; MENDELSSOHN IS ON THE ROOF &LR;  ($15.95), in which a Nazi officer
orders the removal of a statue of the Jewish composer from the roof
of Prague's concert hall, with disastrous results. ``This brilliant
novel ... is dominated by a powerful authorial presence,'' Larry
Wolff wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAMING OF HITLER: PASSIONS &AMP; PROVOCATIONS &LR;  By Daphne Merkin.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. These strikingly personal essays and
musings take on such hot-button topics as adultery, the thrill of
shoplifting and the author's fondness for sexual spanking. ``Her
tone is a curious blend of girlishness and old-fashioned literary
starchiness,'' Kate Jennings wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DESSA ROSE &LR;  By Sherley Anne Williams. Quill/Morrow, $12. This
novel reshapes two incidents from the antebellum South _ one
involving a pregnant black woman sentenced to death for leading a
slave uprising, the other a lone white woman who gives sanctuary to
fugitive slaves on her farm _ so that the women meet and form an
unlikely bond. The result is an ``emotionally affecting and totally
unforgettable'' book, David Bradley wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUBILEE &LR;  By Margaret Walker. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.
This is the story of Vyry, the strong-willed child of a white
plantation owner and his black mistress, who comes of age during
the Civil War years. ```Jubilee' chronicles the triumph of a free
spirit over many kinds of bondages,'' Wilma Dykeman wrote in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MARCH TO MADNESS: THE VIEW FROM THE FLOOR IN THE ATLANTIC
COAST CONFERENCE &LR;  By John Feinstein. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.
This account of the 1996-97 college basketball season unfolds
through the eyes of the nine coaches in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. ``Using his near-unlimited access, Feinstein is able to
describe the highs and lows each coach experiences,'' David Davis
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT BEAT: A SHADOW HISTORY OF ROCK &AMP; ROLL &LR;  By Mikal Gilmore.
Anchor/Doubleday, $15.95. A journalist explores the dark side of
rock 'n' roll _ the danger, excess and nihilism that infuse the
work of musicians as varied as Elvis Presley and Kurt Cobain. Last
year the reviewer Michael E. Ross admired these ``witty, accessible
and moving essays.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Cohen was a New York City transit worker. Lena
Cymbrowitz, James Hayes and Howard Mills were professional
fund-raisers. Tom Duane was a stockbroker. Daniel Hevesi was a
financial analyst. And all six are freshman members of the New York
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a ``res ipso loquitur'' at them and you're likely to get
blank stares. Not a lawyer in the bunch. But all six were elected
to seats that had been held by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures have always had their farmers, teachers,
engineers and entrepreneurs, but from the early days of the
Republic, no group has been as over-represented as lawyers. But for
the last three decades, even as the profession has grown in
numbers, its grip on state capitols has steadily slipped, a trend
that continued in the turnover brought by the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In states with the big cities that have high concentrations of
lawyers, the drop has been especially pronounced. In 1969, 61
percent of New York's state legislators were lawyers; today, 34
percent are. In California, the figure has fallen to 22 percent
from 48 percent 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when the National Conference of State Legislatures
first surveyed legislators around the country about their
professions, 22 percent called themselves lawyers. (The survey
understated the true number, because each lawmaker could give only
one response, and many said ``legislator,'' rather than naming
prior careers.) When the survey was repeated in 1995, 15 percent
said they were lawyers. No one profession rose to fill the gap;
there was a general increase across many fields.
</P>
<P>
   So where have all the lawyers gone? Not surprisingly, the
answers have to do with money. Over the last generation, the money
to be made practicing law has soared, particularly in major cities
where lawyers had strong holds on legislative seats, and where the
starting salary at some firms was $90,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, only one state, California, paid its
legislators more than $60,000 a year. (Because of pay raises that
took effect in January, California's legislators now earn $99,000
each, while New York's average almost $90,000 in salary and
stipends.) Last year, legislators in 39 states were paid less than
$30,000, according to the conference of legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers still dominate Congress, where the annual salary is
$133,600 and the expense allowances are generous. According to
Congressional Quarterly, 43 percent of the seats in Congress are
held by lawyers, but even that figure is well below the 58 percent
held in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, being a legislator has become a full-time job,
or at least a part-time one that makes it hard to manage another
career. In the late 1960s, the average state legislature was in
session three months of the year, but in the late 1990s, the
average has grown to five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of time required of them back home has grown even
faster, with all the constituent service and campaigning,'' said
Karl Kurtz, director of state services at the conference of
legislatures, which is based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, it was common for legislators to have thriving
law practices. It was even good for business, older legislators
say, adding to the resume a title that impressed judges, attracted
clients and promised a little more clout with government agencies.
But these days, far fewer lawmakers try to balance two careers.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, was first elected to
New York state's Assembly in 1976, he intended to keep working in
his three-person law practice. ``My partners quickly became
disenchanted with how little time I had for the work, and we
dissolved that partnership,'' said Silver, now the Assembly
speaker. ``I don't know of any young legislator who even tried to
maintain a law practice after being elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor dissuading lawyers from entering public life was
the post-Watergate wave of financial disclosure laws, which forced
lawyer-lawmakers in many states to reveal more than they might want
to about their practices and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   When he was Assembly speaker in California, Willie Brown, a
Democrat who is now the mayor of San Francisco, had an active law
practice, and was frequently accused of conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of the lawyers who have been elected to legislatures, many never
practiced law but spent their careers as legislative staff members
or government bureaucrats, or worked in business or the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in lawyers is even more dramatic than it appears,
because a lot of these legislators who have law degrees and are
technically lawyers were never really lawyers,'' said A.G. Block,
editor of California Journal, a monthly magazine on state
government and politics. ``When I went to law school in the '60s,
most of the people in law school went on to practice law. Now, it's
more an educational tool to learn a critical way of thinking,
particularly for people who want to go into government.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pull toward public office has diminished for lawyers,
it has grown for others, in part because the federal government has
given more authority to the states. Legislatures are now important
to nearly every profession or interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislatures have become much more important to teachers,
insurance agents, small-businessmen, doctors, you name it,'' said
Kurtz. ``So it has become a more attractive target for people in
all of those professions.''

   The freshman class in Albany is filled with people for whom
state law and politics were never far from their lives. ``My work
was almost like being in politics, anyway,'' said Ms. Cymbrowitz, a
new assemblywoman from Brooklyn who raised money and did marketing
for hospitals and social service agencies. ``My clients and I had
to be so politicized and so adept at dealing with government to
survive. That wasn't true a generation ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the former transit worker who is a new assemblyman from
Queens, was active in the politically powerful transit unions and
was elected to his local community board. Duane, the former
stockbroker and a state senator from Manhattan, was active in the
gay-rights movement and served on the New York City Council. Hayes,
an assemblyman from the Buffalo area, and Mills, an assemblyman
from the Catskills, were elected members of their town councils
while working as fund-raisers for colleges, and Mills was once an
aide to a congressman. Hevesi, a state senator from Queens who is
the son of New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, has worked on
political campaigns and worked as a budget analyst in the Queens
borough president's office.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that there are fewer lawyers making law? Analysts
say they cannot point to any area of policy that has been notably
altered by the trend, although some argue that the recent spread of
state laws restricting lawsuits and damage awards might not have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, it was more important that the people making
law be people who knew the law. Thirty years ago, legislators often
wrote their own bills. But the growth of legislative staffs over
that time means that in nearly every state, any legislator who has
never cracked a law book can call on professional legal advice to
draft bills.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement, even among the lawyers, that greater
diversity in a legislature is a healthy thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a much wider range of interests and concerns
represented these days than there used to be, so it's less
insular,'' said Block. ``I mean, if you're drafting farm law,
shouldn't you have a few farmers?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Cymbrowitz asked, wouldn't a legislature with fewer
lawyers be a little less combative?
</P>
<P>
   Res ipso loquitur. The thing speaks for itself.

   A grisly shadow from the earliest days of the Vietnam War crept
across the media landscape last week during the outbreak of rioting
among Kurds infuriated by Turkey's capture of the top Kurdish rebel
leader. Protesters in Germany, England and Denmark set themselves
on fire. In Paris, London and Marseilles, Kurdish protesters
occupied embassies and threatened to immolate themselves before
finally surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I'm thinking 1963, those pictures of Buddhist monks
burning themselves to death in Vietnam on the front pages,'' said
Professor Anthony Joes, director of the International Relations
Department at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Those haunting images appeared in June 1963 and continued for
months: Surrounded by prayerful supporters, monks engulfed
themselves in flames to protest the South Vietnamese regime of Ngo
Dinh Diem, the U.S.-backed leader whose powerful sister-in-law,
Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, ridiculed the self-immolations as ``a
barbecue'' and taunted, ``Let them burn!''
</P>
<P>
   That November, Diem was killed in a coup supported by the United
States. Though other horrifying pictures would soon dominate the
news, the burning monks remain among the indelible images of the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few forms of political statement more impressive
than deliberately setting yourself on fire,'' said William Harman,
a professor of religious studies at DePauw University in
Greencastle, Ind., who has written extensively on historical
religious attitudes toward martyrdom and public suicide. He sees
such acts as a technique for manipulating a community into
commitment to causes that transcend material concerns like
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of those 1963 Vietnam images, self-immolation is
commonly associated with Buddhism. But Harman said the practice
springs from no single cultural tradition and shares ancient
philosophical origins with religious sacrifices and martyrdom,
including the crucifixion of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Joes noted that the Kurdish militants were mostly Muslims, whose
religion forbids suicide for personal reasons but condones ``heroic
martyrdom'' _ including acts like terrorist suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Harman said self-immolation is increasing in parts of India and
Burma. In Vietnam, at least five Buddhists have burned themselves
to death in the past two years protesting religious persecution. In
Bangalore, India, the site of the Miss World pageant in 1996,
police rounded up scores of feminists who were planning to stage a
mass self-immolation before TV cameras broadcasting the event
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And in India last April, the Dalai Lama issued a statement that
followers interpreted as suggesting support for hunger strikes and
self-immolation after he visited a hospitalized Tibetan exile who
had set himself on fire to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Joes said last week's rioting, including the self-immolations,
underscored both the desperation and the determination of militants
in the Kurdish Diaspora, who were apparently organized enough to
coordinate well-timed street protests all over the world. In
Vietnam in 1963, Western reporters and photographers were always
given advance notice when Buddhist protesters set themselves on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Immolation as protest is ``a kind of theater _ a religious act
tied into a political act,'' Joes said. ``In 1963, Americans looked
at those pictures and said, `Man, what would it take for me to set
myself on fire? I'd have to be flat-out crazy.' But we sensed those
Buddhist monks weren't crazy. It really had an enormous public
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-immolation is ``obviously a very painful way to die,''
Harman said, ``although some say that you actually suffocate first,
because the fire consumes the oxygen. When someone does it,
essentially they are saying, `I gave my life.' The act itself makes
it very clear what the lines are between the committed and the
uncommitted.''

   The freshman class in Albany is filled with people for whom
state law and politics were never far from their lives. ``My work
was almost like being in politics, anyway,'' said Ms. Cymbrowitz, a
new assemblywoman from Brooklyn who raised money and did marketing
for hospitals and social service agencies. ``My clients and I had
to be so politicized and so adept at dealing with government to
survive. That wasn't true a generation ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the former transit worker who is a new assemblyman from
Queens, was active in the politically powerful transit unions and
was elected to his local community board. Duane, the former
stockbroker and a state senator from Manhattan, was active in the
gay-rights movement and served on the New York City Council. Hayes,
an assemblyman from the Buffalo area, and Mills, an assemblyman
from the Catskills, were elected members of their town councils
while working as fund-raisers for colleges, and Mills was once an
aide to a congressman. Hevesi, a state senator from Queens who is
the son of New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, has worked on
political campaigns and worked as a budget analyst in the Queens
borough president's office.

<P>
   Does it matter that there are fewer lawyers making law? Analysts
say they cannot point to any area of policy that has been notably
altered by the trend, although some argue that the recent spread of
state laws restricting lawsuits and damage awards might not have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, it was more important that the people making
law be people who knew the law. Thirty years ago, legislators often
wrote their own bills. But the growth of legislative staffs over
that time means that in nearly every state, any legislator who has
never cracked a law book can call on professional legal advice to
draft bills.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement, even among the lawyers, that greater
diversity in a legislature is a healthy thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a much wider range of interests and concerns
represented these days than there used to be, so it's less
insular,'' said Block. ``I mean, if you're drafting farm law,
shouldn't you have a few farmers?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Cymbrowitz asked, wouldn't a legislature with fewer
lawyers be a little less combative?
</P>
<P>
   Res ipso loquitur. The thing speaks for itself.

   NEW YORK _ The story is that when David Wells first came here
from Baltimore, he wanted to wear Babe Ruth's No. 3. They had to
explain to him that the number was retired; he settled for wearing
one of Ruth's old caps.
</P>
<P>
   If Roger Clemens asks for No. 3, they ought to at least think
about it. One aspect of the Clemens-for-Wells deal that hasn't been
discussed is that it gives two of the game's greatest entities a
crack at something neither has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the best starting pitcher in baseball over the last 15
seasons and one of the 8 or 10 best of all time, gets a chance,
possibly his last, for the World Series ring that will validate his
career. The Yanks get the best pitcher of his era, in his prime or
close to it.
</P>
<P>
   That last statement seems incredible, but think about it. Who is
the greatest pitcher in Yankee history? Most fans would say Whitey
Ford, and that's a pretty good guess. Ford was 236-101 in 16
seasons with a 2.75 earned run average, and he's in the Hall of
Fame. Everyone acknowledges that Ford was a great big-game
performer, and along with Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra he remains a
symbol of the Yankees' era of dominance in the 1950s and early
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever called Ford the best pitcher of his time. This
season, when Clemens wins his fourth game, he'll have passed Ford's
career win total.
</P>
<P>
   Waite Hoyt, perhaps? The star of the Yankee staff in the 1920s
was a fine pitcher for 8 or 9 seasons and lasted in the Bigs for
21, posting a 237-182 record. Clemens is 233-124 going into spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   How many other great pitchers have the Yankees had? Red Ruffing
and Allie Reynolds were pretty good. Ron Guidry was almost great.
But isn't it one of baseball's puzzles that, in a game that is
supposedly mostly pitching, the winningest team in history has
never at any time had a pitcher who could be called the game's
best?
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has posted a 2.95 career earned run average in an era
when, unlike Ford's, runs are cheap. He has led the league in ERA
six times; only Lefty Grove, generally regarded as the greatest
starting pitcher ever, has led more (nine). That's the pitcher's
equivalent of winning the batting title six times, which no Yankee
has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has won five Cy Young awards; for a pitcher this is like
winning five Most Valuable Player awards, which only Ruth would
have achieved (if there had been an MVP award early in his career).
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to the departed Boomer, the pairing of
Clemens and the Yankees is a natural. The only regret should be
that it took 80 years to happen.

   A grisly shadow from the earliest days of the Vietnam War crept
across the media landscape last week during the outbreak of rioting
among Kurds infuriated by Turkey's capture of the top Kurdish rebel
leader. Protesters in Germany, England and Denmark set themselves
on fire. In Paris, London and Marseilles, Kurdish protesters
occupied embassies and threatened to immolate themselves before
finally surrendering.
</P>

A FEDERAL CASE: PILING IT ON TO THE G-MEN

   WASHINGTON _ There was a time when G-men wore fedoras and hunted
down bank robbers, kidnappers and spies. Now, in addition to all
that, federal law-enforcement agents are being asked to track down
carjackers, wife beaters, drunk drivers and low-level drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The change in responsibilities has prompted some legal experts
to warn of the emergence of a national police force. It has also
raised a more prosaic issue.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the federal agents really got serious?
</P>
<P>
   Last week a special task force of the American Bar Association,
headed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, issued a strongly
worded warning about the trend in Congress to federalize crimes
that are traditionally handled by state and local authorities.
Calling the trend ``misguided, unnecessary and even harmful,'' the
panel said, ``It reflects a phenomenon capable of altering and
undermining the careful decentralization of criminal law authority
that has worked well for all our constitutional history.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been so eager to be seen as tough on crime that it
has enacted a host of laws in recent years making crimes like
carjacking and drive-by shootings federal offenses. In fact, more
than 40 percent of all federal criminal statutes enacted since the
Civil War were placed on the books after 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the chest-thumping surrounding the passage of new
federal criminal laws, the panel said, the federal government does
little to protect Americans from crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of feel-good legislation,'' said Meese, who, had a
tough-on-crime reputation when he was attorney general during the
second half of the Reagan administration. ``It's passed because
it's politically popular or because a particular crime gets a lot
of media attention. But what we found was that the new laws aren't
utilized very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Of nearly 60,000 criminal cases filed in federal courts in the
1997 fiscal year, 164 were carjackings. There were no drive-by
shooting or domestic violence cases, crimes that got much media
attention when they were included in a major crime bill passed in
1994. Even in crimes like drug trafficking and possession _ an area
where the federal government has been quite active _ only 1.5
percent of the more than 1 million drug arrests in the country in
1997 were prosecuted by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased federalization is rarely, if ever, likely to have
any appreciable effect on the categories of violent crime that most
concern Americans,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The legal scholars who made up the panel suggested that if
federal courts become overwhelmed with these criminal cases, they
may be prevented from handling antitrust, civil rights and other
civil matters that state courts cannot hear.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all they warn about what they see as a trend toward a
national police force, an issue that so concerned the framers of
the Constitution that they forbade the use of the military to
enforce domestic laws.

   NEW YORK _ Remember Giga Pets? Not long ago, the little
hand-held computers that children fed, watered and nurtured by
pressing buttons were all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine how a toy company could top that
craze, but get ready for Giga Monsters, designed for ages 5 and up.
Here the object is to make the virtual pets die.
</P>
<P>
   The persnickety monsters keep coming back to life as the
diligent child tries to hasten their destruction. They live in tiny
coffins, or ``uniquely stylized cabinets,'' in the words of the
toy's creator, Tiger Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost enough to make one nostalgic for the days when toys
died because they ran out of batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Giga Monster was but one of many startling items on display
last week at the 96th American International Toy Fair in New York,
where 1,700 exhibitors gathered to peddle their wares to 20,000
buyers. Most of the toys and games haven't hit stores yet. Some are
still prototypes and failed in demonstrations; others succeeded in
demonstrations and will still fail in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the game of Conscience _ ``The fun way to learn right from
wrong'' _ players travel through seven zones: violence, drugs,
crime, character, charity, education and sex. (Sex is optional, and
parents can remove or add this zone at will.) Winners earn gold
stars. Losers collect black marks and wind up in the principal's
office, detention center, jail or the morgue. Players get on the
wrong path if they ignore their homework, for example, or
``associate with druggies.'' The board game has been designed by
GoRu Products for ages 8 and up, but comes with a simplified
version that 5- to 7-year-olds can enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Checkers, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Children are certainly capable of dealing with morality,
character or crime _ after all, they encounter such issues in fairy
tales and in the schoolyard. And, of course, classic games have
always tackled the big themes: Chess explores war, Monopoly takes
on greed and in many games players meet their metaphorical deaths.
But the latest toys tend to be more literal, making announcements
like, ``Your toy just died.''
</P>
<P>
   The new heavy-handed gadgets, plus Jerry Springer board games
and Rock-'n-Roll Elmo, are part of a $20 billion-a-year industry.
Even Bill Gates has gotten in on it. Anyone who thinks Microsoft or
the Teletubbies are intent on world domination will be alarmed to
hear that they have forged an alliance. Microsoft Teletubbies
ActiMates are dolls that a conspiracy theorist could love.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes the purple Teletubby is secretly gay
obviously did not attend this year's toy fair. Secrecy and subtlety
were not at a premium: Toys for 1999 tell about themselves in
painstaking detail, and they won't shut up. They will tell you if
they are dead or alive or sad. The Kissy-Kissy Baby, courtesy of
Irwin Toy Ltd., will pucker if you kiss her mouth, will say ``Kiss
my boo-boo better'' if you kiss her hand and ``I love you, Mommy''
if you kiss her cheek. Her responses are ``moisture-activated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lipstick gets a word in. Funrise Toy is offering electric
lipstick equipped with a sound module that says things like ``You
go girl!''and ``Looking Good!'' The lipstick presumably provides
the encouragement that young girls may not otherwise be getting.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the sound chip, toys can broadcast all kinds
of messages out loud. Girls' white shoes, for example, could once
connote innocence, or summer, or membership in the wedding party.
But now tots with marital ambitions can slip on a pair of Funrise's
Sound Shoes without any ambiguity. The shoes play ``Here Comes the
Bride'' as the girl walks.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stride against blonde stereotypes, Mattel's Chatty
Cathy now comes in new hair and eye colors. The doll, who
incessantly says things like ``Please carry me,'' can now be a
brunette, too.
</P>
<P>
   Technology also allows toys to relate to one another. According
to Plato, Aristophanes suggested that human beings were once
two-headed creatures, then were split in half and condemned to
spend the rest of their lives seeking to re-attach to their
original mates. Dubbels, a toy by Rumpus, uses the latest
recognition technology chips to prove Aristophanes right. Somewhere
out there, the perfect mate awaits each L-shaped bean-bag creature.
They just need to be fit together.
</P>
<P>
   If two incompatible bean-bags join, the toy will complain,
``You're cute, but you're not my Dubbel.'' The crestfallen child
will then probably demand that another $5.99 be invested in the
Dubbel's search for romance. The payoff comes when it finds its
bean-bag fantasy mate and announces, ``Baby I've been waiting for
you my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   With recognition technology this advanced, subliminal messages
are unnecessary.

BURSTS OF POST-COLD-WAR NATIONALISM ARE WIDELY MISINTERPRETED

   Kurds explode in fury across Europe. President Clinton
contemplates sending marines into Kosovo or bombing Serbia.
Scorched earth and bereaved families testify to ethnic passions
gone haywire in Rwanda, Burundi, Bosnia, Chechnya. With or without
violence, nation-states proliferate at a dizzying rate, most of
them out of the ashes of collapsed communist states. In 10 years,
membership in the United Nations swells from 156 to 185, with
former Soviet republics, East European spinoffs and Lilliputian
specks like San Marino, Andorra, Marshal Islands or Micronesia
taking their places alongside nuclear powers and ancient
monarchies. Even in staid and settled Western states like Britain
or Canada, ethnic minorities _ Scottish, Welsh, Francophone _
pursue dreams of a United Nations seat of their very own.
</P>
<P>
   To a world shaking off the accumulated debris of fascism and
communism, there is something startling, ironic and troubling in
discovering that nationalism _ a force alternatively glorified over
the century as a building block of a just world order or reviled as
the wellspring of genocidal hatreds _ is militantly bucking the
trend toward globalism and transnationalism and emerging with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   A common wisdom has emerged that the lifting of authoritarian
and Cold War strictures has released ancient ethnic ambitions and
hatreds, potentially leading to a world far more complex and
dangerous than the familiar bipolar East and West.
</P>
<P>
   But is it so? Could it be that this supposedly new nationalism
is neither so new, so surprising, nor so uniformly dangerous? Many
students of world affairs who have taken a closer look at the
nationalisms and conflicts, like those of the Kosovars and the
Kurds, have found that most of the causes and histories long
predate the collapse of communism. What is new, they argue, is not
nationalism and ethnicity as such but the world's perception of
these in a complex new universe, and the political uses of them in
a world of porous borders and interconnected economies.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of globalism, they find, has paradoxically made
statehood more necessary for small nations hoping to compete for
resources, investment and aid. And if the news media are drawn to
ethnic brush fires, there is the less dramatic fact that many
regions where ethnic violence was thought probable, like Ukraine or
Kazakhstan, have handled their transitions, so far, in peace. And
without a superpower conflict to manipulate for their ends, some
national movements like the Palestine Liberation Organization have
even concluded that peace is a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a large effort to track incidents of ethnic
conflict, to grasp whether there has been a sudden surge of ethnic
conflict,'' said Rajan Menon, professor of international relations
at Lehigh University. ``Well, the answer turns out to be no. In the
old bipolar world there was a great deal of ethnic conflict, but
the Cold War was so superimposed on the American psyche that
everything else was pushed to the margins. It's something of an
optical illusion: the Cold War ends, and `ethnic' now becomes the
vector of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would deny that the bloodshed in Rwanda, Bosnia or
Chechnya has been terrible, or that ethnic conflicts have been fed
in some way by the collapse of the communist system. What the
experts note, rather, is that the hatreds behind these conflicts _
or the nationalism behind the emergent states _ are hardly new.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Africa has been riddled with such conflicts since the
colonial powers saddled the continent with arbitrary borders. The
Balkans and Caucasus have been problems for over a century. And in
the former communist world, many of the republics and provinces
that have now become U.N. members, from Slovenia to Ukraine to
Uzbekistan, are less manifestations of any new nationalism than
legacies of Soviet nationality policies designed to divide and
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin deliberately divided his empire into Soviet Socialist
Republics, and when they ceased to be a union, Soviet or socialist,
what remained were the republics. Russia, the purported ruler of
the empire, was among the first to break out of it, leaving the
rest little choice but to follow.
</P>
<P>
   What has prompted the proliferation of states and liberation
movements, the experts find, is less a flowering of nationalism
than the very forces that were expected to make nationalism
obsolete. In a world increasingly united by air travel, the
Internet, multinational business and international organizations,
ethnic minorities have come to see no reason why they should not
participate directly. If the Olympics Games during the Cold War,
for example, were an ersatz competition between two ideologies and
superpowers, there is little reason any more why every nation,
large and Lilliputian, should not field its own athletes and gather
its own laurels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend hours and hours wondering how to understand this
phenomenon,'' said Roman Szporluk, director of Harvard University's
Ukrainian Research Center. ``My understanding of this modern
nationalism is as a rebellion against those political entities that
obstructed participation in the life of the world. When I think of
the `secession' of Estonia, or Latvia, or Ukraine, or Georgia, or
Russia itself, I feel that those people did not break away from
some universalism represented by Moscow but felt that the Soviet
system denied them the ability to participate in the affairs of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what appears to be regionalism is really a way of
recognizing the greater interconnectedness of the larger world.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Woodward, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
finds a strong economic component in the new nationalism, as small
nationalities, stripped of ideological patrons, conclude that
independence is critical in the struggle for international
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationalism is just an excuse, a part of the political dynamic
as conflicts develop between the central government and regional
governments over who controls what resources and what money is
being drained out of the region,'' she said. ``Globalization leads
to fragmentation, as the state becomes more important as a way to
catch fewer resources, to get access to international loans, trade
agreements.''

<P>
   If globalism and the demise of a bipolar world have been the
major factors behind the multiplication of nation-states, the
eruption of violence is more difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree, however, that simply lifting the communist lid
off ancient hatreds does not explain why people who have lived
peacefully side by side for generations suddenly go for each
other's throats. In fact, researchers note that incidents of ethnic
violence have declined since a peak in the immediate aftermath of
the collapse of communism, in 1991, when 35 of 37 conflicts in the
world were deemed ethnic in origin.
</P>
<P>
   Where violence has broken out, moreover, it has often come not
as a direct and spontaneous revival of ethnic hatreds, but from
some specific breakdown in order that quickly developed its own
momentum. In some instances, the catalyst was the holding of
democratic elections in states that did not have the democratic
institutions or national consensus to support them. Conflicts in
Burundi, Yugoslavia, Armenia and Azerbaijan all followed elections
that brought to power leaders who, in the absence of established
levers of authority, seized on xenophobia as a means of
consolidating power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institutions of democracy often were simply not there,''
said Professor Jack Snyder, chairman of the political-science
department at Columbia University. ``There were no courts, no
police, no press to make democracy run, so what else is there?
Often the other thing is ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Yugoslavia's president, who stirred ethnic fears
among the Serbs of Kosovo as early as 1988, Snyder added:
``Slobodan Milosevic was not a nationalist in the slightest bit
until he saw Yugoslavia breaking up and needed a popular issue. So
what he seized on was a national issue, provided by Kosovo. It was
the same in Burundi. It's what happened in the French Revolution,
in Germany before World War I.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the experts argue that there is no such thing as
inevitable conflict. For every outbreak of violence, there are less
publicized instances of places where violence was initially deemed
inevitable but never broke out. Papers were full of doomsday talk
about Ukraine several years ago, or of impending anti-Russian
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kazakhstan. Both lands have so far managed
to keep difficult transitions peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to fight against the notion that the only way out
of conflict is the mono-ethnic state, that ethnic diversity is
simply incompatible with a civic state,'' said Menon. ``But once
ethnic conflicts begin, I'm afraid you can't solve them. You simply
try to manage them. Once fathers are killed, or sisters are raped,
you have created an uncontrollable dynamic.''

Often the other thing is ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Yugoslavia's president, who stirred ethnic fears
among the Serbs of Kosovo as early as 1988, Snyder added:
``Slobodan Milosevic was not a nationalist in the slightest bit
until he saw Yugoslavia breaking up and needed a popular issue. So
what he seized on was a national issue, provided by Kosovo. It was
the same in Burundi. It's what happened in the French Revolution,
in Germany before World War I.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the experts argue that there is no such thing as
inevitable conflict. For every outbreak of violence, there are less
publicized instances of places where violence was initially deemed
inevitable but never broke out. Papers were full of doomsday talk
about Ukraine several years ago, or of impending anti-Russian
``ethnic cleansing'' in Kazakhstan. Both lands have so far managed
to keep difficult transitions peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to fight against the notion that the only way out
of conflict is the mono-ethnic state, that ethnic diversity is
simply incompatible with a civic state,'' said Menon. ``But once
ethnic conflicts begin, I'm afraid you can't solve them. You simply
try to manage them. Once fathers are killed, or sisters are raped,
you have created an uncontrollable dynamic.''

PUBLIC ASSENT BEHIND CRIMES OF THE WAR ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI

<P>
   To the extent that language provides cues for behavior, the
orders that American governors, mayors, police chiefs and block
association presidents have been giving cops on the beat in big
cities over the past few years are unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   As James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at
Northeastern University, notes, these officers have been told that
they form the front line in a ``war'' on crime and a ``war'' on
drugs, that they have been enlisted in special ``operations'' and
drafted for bold new ``offensives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use all these paramilitary terms,'' Fox said, ``and we have
promoted somewhat of a siege mentality among police: The enemy is
out there, and there are more of them than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox paused, sighed and added, ``When you have this sort of
mentality, excessive brutality and improper actions are more likely
to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's comments root out what is indisputably a dirty little
secret embedded in the public angst over police brutality: many
Americans have come not only to tolerate a degree of it from their
police officers but also, in ways subtle and unsubtle, to encourage
it.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Americans are untroubled by such glaring
examples of excessive force as the beating of Rodney King by police
officers in Los Angeles; the torture of Abner Louima by police
officers in a Brooklyn station house or, most recently, the killing
of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, in a fusillade of
police fire this month in the Bronx. In each case, race became an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody would agree that if these flagrant episodes
were the unintended outgrowths of aggressive policing _ and it is
by no means certain that they were _ then the price for such a
modus operandi is exorbitant in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But too frequently omitted from discussions of police brutality
that attend these cases is the fact that many Americans have
tacitly blessed a more vigorous, invasive, belligerent brand of
policing. And the line between law enforcement that is aptly
forceful and law enforcement that is unduly brutal or abusive can
be thin indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's in the eye of the beholder,'' acknowledged
former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton. ``That's
part of the dilemma that police find themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to the nation's police departments.
It also confronts the politicians who help supervise them and the
taxpayers who fund them. Underlying it is the age-old tension
between public safety and civil liberties. The question now is, can
the ``zero tolerance'' crime policies that have come into vogue
over the last decade be executed and achieved without the trampling
of innocent people's rights?
</P>
<P>
   The ``zero tolerance'' policy, which has been given a showcase
in New York City, holds that no crime _ not the breaking of a
window, not the jumping of a turnstile _ is too insignificant to
capture the swift, decisive attention of the police. Prosecute more
petty offenders and offenses today, goes the reasoning, and you
will have fewer hard-core criminals and crimes tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But as the police were being schooled in this new religion,
Bratton said, they were also being taught a new zealousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In wartime, which we were engaged in for a few years in this
city, it required certain strategies,'' Bratton said. Among those
strategies, he said, was to be less timid in the investigation of
crimes and the use of force, so long as the force was justified by
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of instructions, however, call for judgments that
are bound to be imperfect. Take, for example, the statistics
concerning the activities of the department's street crimes unit.
In 1997 and 1998, officers with the unit frisked more than 45,000
people thought to be carrying guns, but they arrested fewer than
10,000. The rest _ the vast majority _ were mistakenly detained.
</P>
<P>
   Is that acceptable? The answer depends not only on the
sensibilities of the person answering the question but also, in
many cases, the race. Black leaders and civil libertarians said
that when the police put more emphasis on preventive strategies,
they invariably lean on broad profiles in stopping and
interrogating possible criminals, and those profiles are racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you rely on hunches, you rely on prejudices, and the
people most likely to be stopped are black or Hispanic,'' said Ira
Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
``When you start throwing around phrases like zero tolerance, you
get these kinds of excesses. And if the cops can stop you at will,
where's the public safety in that?''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's predecessor, David Dinkins,
said there was a certain blindness among white people who respond
to the reduction in crime simply by cheering the ends without
scrutinizing the means.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they'll say,'' Dinkins observed, ``until one day,
this white middle-class family has a son who comes home from
Harvard or Princeton or whatever university, and he comes home with
his black classmate. And they, dressed as young people will dress,
get into some altercation with cops'' _ and become victims of
police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to force, there is not a police department in the
country that expressly commands its officers to use it
indiscriminately. Giuliani told police academy graduates last week
that ``in a very special sense, you are civil-rights workers''
whose job of public protection entails an ``equal emphasis on
treating everyone with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But the broader goals that officers are asked to pursue, the
fire instilled in them and the messages that the culture outside of
police departments broadcast can easily coax them toward
unjustified violence.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes in televised police dramas like ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Law
and Order,'' and ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' regularly slam
suspects against concrete walls, twists their arms behind their
backs, even bloody their noses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there has not been a popular protest of the possible
danger of such examples to match the outcry over, say, the chastely
rendered longings of a lesbian who owns a bookstore in the
situation comedy ``Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that if Americans want to glorify violence,
ratchet up the mandates of police officers and cut crime rates to
ever lower levels, they must own up to the trade-offs they are
bound to be making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more aggressive the police get, the safer the streets can
be,'' Fox said, ``but there's a price in terms of individual
freedoms, civil liberties, civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of freedom is tolerance, not zero tolerance,''
Richard Emery, a civil-rights lawyer, wrote in an Op-Ed article in
The New York Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of
New York City, a watchdog group, said he did not want to believe
that the equation was that tidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no inherent conflict between good crime control and
respect for people's rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added with a note of pessimism, ``it's very hard to
apply in practice.''

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Alarmed, heartsick and still baffled over
President Clinton's acquittal by the Senate, some of his most
ardent detractors have come to an extraordinary conclusion, one
that may carry grim implications for the conservative movement.
They blame not themselves for mishandling the whole sorry episode
but a public whose moral standards have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is audacious, perhaps even arrogant: Americans
just don't get it. Why can't they see we were right?
</P>
<P>
   In the most striking example, Paul Weyrich, an unflinching moral
crusader for three decades, embarked last week on a rampage against
society rather than against Clinton. The man who suggested to the
Rev. Jerry Falwell that he name his organization the Moral Majority
now contends that the name is an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Weyrich
wrote in a letter to hundreds of thousands of supporters of his
organization, the Free Congress Foundation. ``I do not believe that
a majority of Americans actually shares our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking his fury a step further, Weyrich said that while he was
``not suggesting that we all become Amish or move to Idaho,'' he
believes that ``we have to look at what we can do to separate
ourselves from this hostile culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked: ``What steps can we take to make sure that we and our
children are not infected? We need some sort of quarantine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Weyrich to say _ he's not an elected official
accountable to voters. But for those who do run for office, blaming
the public can be risky, particularly in an age when politicians _
no matter how much they grovel at the feet of voters _ find that
public to be increasingly aloof. For all his private
contemptuousness and fury at liberals, President Richard M. Nixon
was careful not to publicly denounce the prevailing public will.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter was not as prudent. He isolated himself
from the electorate in 1979 when he said ``a moral and spiritual
crisis'' was gripping the nation. ``Too many of us,'' he said,
``now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption.''
Republicans traded for years on what was dubbed ``the malaise
speech,'' citing it as Exhibit One of a Democratic Party that was
out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shame people into changing the way they look at the
world,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican strategist in California.
``You have to lead by example. And if the people won't follow your
example, it's really not as much their problem as it is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Weyrich is the most panicked, he is not alone.
Other conservatives are eager to fault the public rather than
themselves for misreading the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ordinary Americans reacting to Clinton's conduct
``are complicit in his corruption,'' William Bennett, the former
education secretary who has since built his career on talking and
writing about morality, said: ``I will not defend the public.
Absolutely not. If people want to pander to the public and say
they're right, they can. But they're not right on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he rejected the ``canard that conservatives are
putting out that we didn't make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, in formally announcing his
long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week,
could not resist a dig at the public: ``The president's acquittal
is a sad commentary on the prevailing values in America today.'' In
an interview, Smith sneered at polls showing _ week after week,
month after month _ little public appetite for impeachment. ``My
wife likes to say they must be polling people coming out of Hooters
on Saturday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Craig Shirley, a longtime conservative public relations
consultant, said: ``A certain portion of the American public is
cowed by popular culture. They do not want to be thought of as not
being modern or sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scorn for the will of the people may be an obvious
manifestation of conservatives' frustration. Again and again, they
replay the tape: A president whom they already believed to be
immoral has an affair with an intern in the Oval Office, lies about
it _ and remains as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are so demoralized and bitter because many
conservatives convinced themselves that sooner or later the
nation's pent-up outrage would surface. The Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine, was positively gleeful after Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr sent his impeachment referral to Congress
last September. Jumping off the cover was an illustration of a
beaming Starr at bat, with the headline, ``Starr's Home Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives said, `Wait, there's another woman.
There's another affidavit. It will all turn around,''' Bennett
recalled. ``But at each point they found out more about Clinton his
approvals went up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ventured back to this state last week _ where seven
years ago he pronounced himself the ``Comeback Kid'' _ his
detractors still could not contain their rage. In a front-page
editorial in The Union Leader of Manchester, publisher Nackey Loeb
advised the president to ``stop by Washington just long enough to
pick up his toothbrush, turn in his resignation and head back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives were not as defeatist as Weyrich, who went so
far as to write off the Republican Party's ability to connect with
society. In his letter, Weyrich complained that ``we have probably
lost the culture war'' and said the cultural collapse was ``so
great that it simply overwhelms politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich said in an interview that he was not particularly
concerned that conservatives might alienate voters, because he
viewed his causes as larger than partisan politics. ``I've never
been one who is very active in the party to begin with,'' he said.
``It hasn't been my forte. I will be a good citizen and participate
appropriately. But I've never been consumed with the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Weyrich does not have to worry about his own electoral
fate. But perhaps the bashers of Joe Citizen who are still
committed Republicans can take solace in the example of at least
one successful politician who found that loathing voters is not
political suicide: Sen. Stephen Young, D-Ohio, who served from 1959
to 1971. In vituperative letters, he traded indignities with
constituents and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote one constituent, ``Buster, your insults show that
you are the east end of a horse going west.'' He called another
constituent ``lower than a snake's tail in a wagon rut.'' He
exploded at still another, calling him a ``low-down skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was re-elected in 1964, the beneficiary of the landslide
for President Lyndon B. Johnson.

example, it's really not as much their problem as it is yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Weyrich is the most panicked, he is not alone.
Other conservatives are eager to fault the public rather than
themselves for misreading the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that ordinary Americans reacting to Clinton's conduct
``are complicit in his corruption,'' William Bennett, the former
education secretary who has since built his career on talking and
writing about morality, said: ``I will not defend the public.
Absolutely not. If people want to pander to the public and say
they're right, they can. But they're not right on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he rejected the ``canard that conservatives are
putting out that we didn't make our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, in formally announcing his
long-shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination last week,
could not resist a dig at the public: ``The president's acquittal
is a sad commentary on the prevailing values in America today.'' In
an interview, Smith sneered at polls showing _ week after week,
month after month _ little public appetite for impeachment. ``My
wife likes to say they must be polling people coming out of Hooters
on Saturday night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Craig Shirley, a longtime conservative public relations
consultant, said: ``A certain portion of the American public is
cowed by popular culture. They do not want to be thought of as not
being modern or sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such scorn for the will of the people may be an obvious
manifestation of conservatives' frustration. Again and again, they
replay the tape: A president whom they already believed to be
immoral has an affair with an intern in the Oval Office, lies about
it _ and remains as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are so demoralized and bitter because many
conservatives convinced themselves that sooner or later the
nation's pent-up outrage would surface. The Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine, was positively gleeful after Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr sent his impeachment referral to Congress
last September. Jumping off the cover was an illustration of a
beaming Starr at bat, with the headline, ``Starr's Home Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of conservatives said, `Wait, there's another woman.
There's another affidavit. It will all turn around,''' Bennett
recalled. ``But at each point they found out more about Clinton his
approvals went up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton ventured back to this state last week _ where seven
years ago he pronounced himself the ``Comeback Kid'' _ his
detractors still could not contain their rage. In a front-page
editorial in The Union Leader of Manchester, publisher Nackey Loeb
advised the president to ``stop by Washington just long enough to
pick up his toothbrush, turn in his resignation and head back to
Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives were not as defeatist as Weyrich, who went so
far as to write off the Republican Party's ability to connect with
society. In his letter, Weyrich complained that ``we have probably
lost the culture war'' and said the cultural collapse was ``so
great that it simply overwhelms politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich said in an interview that he was not particularly
concerned that conservatives might alienate voters, because he
viewed his causes as larger than partisan politics. ``I've never
been one who is very active in the party to begin with,'' he said.
``It hasn't been my forte. I will be a good citizen and participate
appropriately. But I've never been consumed with the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Weyrich does not have to worry about his own electoral
fate. But perhaps the bashers of Joe Citizen who are still
committed Republicans can take solace in the example of at least
one successful politician who found that loathing voters is not
political suicide: Sen. Stephen Young, D-Ohio, who served from 1959
to 1971. In vituperative letters, he traded indignities with
constituents and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Young wrote one constituent, ``Buster, your insults show that
you are the east end of a horse going west.'' He called another
constituent ``lower than a snake's tail in a wagon rut.'' He
exploded at still another, calling him a ``low-down skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was re-elected in 1964, the beneficiary of the landslide
for President Lyndon B. Johnson.

MANNA IN THE FORM OF JOBS COMES TO THE RESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BAD RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION, Wis. _ Heartbreakingly beautiful,
the Chippewa territory here runs wild along the sandy shore of Lake
Superior, where soaring forests of quaking aspen and sugar maple
had long obscured the bleakness of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For a century, Chippewas here grew up with a choice: move far
from home to find work, or stay and settle for government welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Young people in Bad River typically left for Chicago or
Milwaukee or Minneapolis, settling in edgy neighborhoods and
learning to navigate in places where the Ojibwe language was a
foreign tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But now many tribal members are coming home, not just for
funerals and weddings but for jobs. Legalized tribal gambling has
spawned a windfall of new employment in casinos, hotels and
restaurants. And the profits from the casinos are often invested in
schools, stores and clinics, enlivening tribal economies that once
seemed as lifeless as stone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mille Lacs tribe in Minnesota has used gambling profits to
build a hospital and a high school, and bought a bank that had once
refused to grant it a loan. The Apache at Fort McDowell in Arizona
have invested in service stations and convenience stores. The
Chippewa band here has used its profits from the Bad River Casino
and Lodge for new roads, programs for the elderly and the purchase
of tracts within the reservation long ago sold, or lost, to whites,
territory that Indians call ``alienated land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '90s, we've gone from everyone being on welfare to the
point that we've now got jobs for everyone here,'' said Bob
Poqorney, a marketing director at Bad River, which opened a casino
seven years ago. ``We've seen a sharp decline in the number of
people leaving. And we're seeing a lot of people coming back from
the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Precise numbers of homecomings in Indian Country are hard to
come by, partly because the trend is so new. But there is no doubt
that most reservations with casinos are now flush with jobs, a
stark change from the days of selling beaded artwork to the few
motorists traveling along the rural highways. More than 125,000
people are now working at Indian casinos, hotels and restaurants
nationwide, and another 160,000 are working in jobs indirectly tied
to Indian gambling, according to the National Indian Gaming
Association. More than 90 percent of those jobs at Bad River are
held by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Most reservations with gambling still have high rates of poverty
and unemployment. The image of Indians made rich by casino wealth
is wildly overdrawn; the notion is amplified by a few atypical but
highly publicized little tribes with big operations near
metropolitan regions like the Mashantucket Pequots' Foxwoods Resort
Casino in Ledyard, Conn., and the Shakopees' Mystic Lake Casino
outside Minneapolis and St. Paul. Unlike the Shakopee tribe, whose
300 members each received $400,000 in 1994, Indians on most
reservations with gambling get little or no money in per capita
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But jobs that pay $20,000 or more, once a dream in Indian
Country, have become relatively common. These are decent wages in a
place like Bad River, where a nice house costs about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs, together with the cultural ties, have beckoned to
people like John Moore, a native who left Bad River 30 years ago,
and took some hard knocks living in Milwaukee, before returning to
the reservation last fall to take a job as a security guard. ``This
isn't the same place where I grew up,'' said Moore, a rugged man in
his 50s, who wears some scars from the hard streets of Milwaukee.
``The idea of going back to the Rez for jobs _ it would have seemed
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now plenty of people at Bad River have come home for jobs, and
for their heritage. In the 12 years that Mike Wiggins lived in
Milwaukee, making good wages as a cement finisher, he yearned for
the life at Bad River.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was in the city, but my heart was at the reservation,''
said Wiggins, 49, who returned five years ago to take a job at the
casino as a floor worker and rose to become vice-chairman of the
tribe, grateful to have the chance to raise two of his children in
the family's homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the freedom to wander, to hunt and fish anytime
I wanted,'' he said. ``And I wanted my children to know that kind
of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Giago, a Lakota writer who lives in South Dakota, has called
the homecoming trend ``the biggest story in Indian Country.'' He
said it represented a triumph over the days when the U.S.
government tried mightily to move Indians away from reservations,
especially during the 1950s, in hopes that they would assimilate in
urban culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It failed miserably,'' said Giago, a former newspaper
publisher who recently started a publishing company for books on
Indian life. ``People went to the cities and missed their homeland,
missed their families. Many of these people ended up in the
gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the growth of jobs created by gambling, Giago noted that
about 30 colleges are now flourishing on reservations, with
faculties that have evolved from almost all white to mostly Indian.
The staffs at health centers on the reservation, he said, are now
much more likely to be staffed by Indian doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   One troubling trend on reservations, Giago noted, was the
increase in crime, much of it inflicted by whites. But tribal
leaders also see a growth in gangs among young Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Giago attributed some of the criminal activity to the people
returning from cities. ``They brought some of the problems of urban
streets back to the reservation,'' he said, noting that
reservations, usually located in rural regions with few police
officers, can be easing pickings for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But to someone like Moore, who grew accustomed to the toughness
of Milwaukee neighborhoods, life at Bad River seems tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk home in the middle of the night,'' he said with a
shrug, ``and I don't worry a bit.'' &QL;

SUPERMARKET SHOCKER: TABLOIDS BECOME OLD GRAY LADIES! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forecasters see a lot of unsettling trends in the aging of the
American population, from rising medical costs to falling arches.
But they may have missed one: the geezer-ization of the supermarket
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, the tabs read like versions of Modern
Maturity edited by Rupert Murdoch hopped up on Fibercon _ what with
their persistent dwelling on Liz Taylor and sundry celebrity
candidates for artificial life support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though there are more older people nowadays, the tabs
aren't thriving. Blame the increasingly sensationalized mainstream
media for stealing their act, and readers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer and the Star, for example, have seen their
circulations tumble in the last five years as the median age of
their readers has risen from just over 35 to around 40. Last week
the two tabs were bought by an investment firm led by Robert
Altman, a former Treasury big shot, which plans to rejuvenate their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a gray future in store, we've probably not seen the
last of headlines and quotations like those below, gleaned from
just the past two weeks' offerings at checkout counters.

SUPERMARKET SHOCKER: TABLOIDS BECOME OLD GRAY LADIES!

   Forecasters see a lot of unsettling trends in the aging of the
American population, from rising medical costs to falling arches.
But they may have missed one: the geezer-ization of the supermarket
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever, the tabs read like versions of Modern
Maturity edited by Rupert Murdoch hopped up on Fibercon _ what with
their persistent dwelling on Liz Taylor and sundry celebrity
candidates for artificial life support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though there are more older people nowadays, the tabs
aren't thriving. Blame the increasingly sensationalized mainstream
media for stealing their act, and readers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer and the Star, for example, have seen their
circulations tumble in the last five years as the median age of
their readers has risen from just over 35 to around 40. Last week
the two tabs were bought by an investment firm led by Robert
Altman, a former Treasury big shot, which plans to rejuvenate their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a gray future in store, we've probably not seen the
last of headlines and quotations like those below, gleaned from
just the past two weeks' offerings at checkout counters.

<P>
   Not so long ago, Air Force pilots sent to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein complained that their
mission had become routine: Flying monotonous loops in the ``no
flight'' zone over southern Iraq, waiting for hostilities that
never came.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the untidy aftermath of December's four-night battering of
Iraq, U.S. and British pilots enforcing the southern no-flight zone
and the smaller zone in northern Iraq now find themselves dodging
Iraq's newly aggressive air defenses and responding with punishing
strikes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon does not like to say it, but these skirmishes _
coming, on average, every other day _ have quickly turned into a
low-level war. It is a war of attrition and appears to have no end
in sight, since Clinton administration officials say it will
continue as long as Saddam's forces keep challenging the U.S. and
British patrols over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 _ and, before that,
Vietnam _ have U.S. forces engaged in such routine combat in such a
sustained way over such a prolonged period. Perhaps the closest
parallel today is Israel's continuing war against Islamic factions
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The recently concluded impeachment trial of President Clinton
and other distractions may have deprived the fighting of much
attention, but U.S. and British jets have now struck some 70
military targets that the Pentagon said posed a threat. Operating
under new rules of engagement, the pilots have broadened their
attacks to include air defenses and other targets, not just those
that directly confront them.
</P>
<P>
   This new war embraces many of the hallmarks of U.S. military
strategy today, including a reliance on technological superiority
to overwhelm the enemy and the avoidance of any risk to American
lives. But it lacks the guiding principle once known as the Powell
Doctrine, after Gen. Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who held that the United States should never
commit U.S. forces to a military campaign until it had a clear idea
of the way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration long ago stretched the meaning of the
Powell Doctrine to intervene in places like Bosnia, but now it
seems to have given it up altogether. Last week, with the United
States pledging to send 4,000 U.S. soldiers and marines to the
Serbian province of Kosovo if a peace agreement could be reached,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did not even pretend to set a
homecoming deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the post-Cold War world,'' said Eliot Cohen, a
professor at Johns Hopkins who directed the Air Force's definitive
study of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. ``This is the kind of
imperial policing that the American military is increasingly going
to be called upon to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the intensive barrage against Iraq last
December was to punish Saddam for his refusal to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspection and to knock down his ability to
menace his neighbors. The goal now is to chip away at the fringes
of his military might while stopping short of another all-out
assault, even though the administration now openly calls for
Saddam's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon Officials have defended this new limited strategy.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in an interview that the
strikes were steadily eating away at Saddam's air defenses. Iraq's
threats last week against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey for
providing bases or the U.S. and British forces simply underscored
Saddam's frustration, Cohen said. The key, he added, is to keep
pressure on Saddam long enough to let diplomatic efforts to
undercut him play out. How long will that take? He could not say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is required,'' Cohen said. ``This policy is
working.'' Still, the conflict has raised concerns among some U.S.
military commanders and lawmakers. ``I wish I knew where all of
this played out,'' a senior uniformed official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former Navy pilot who spent seven
years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has repeatedly criticized
the administration's approach, saying it puts pilots at risk
without truly punishing Saddam. ``We continue to be in a reactive
mode,'' He said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes this new war of attrition frustrating to
critics. Even though the skirmishes have been overwhelmingly
one-sided, with U.S. and British jets able to strike virtually at
will, the strategy is to hold the line, not to unleash enough force
to defeat Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something much less than more,'' said William Quandt,
professor of government and foreign affairs at the University of
Virginia. ``It's a kind of symbolic show of force on our side to
make a political statement, which is: There are some things Saddam
cannot do without paying a price.'' Quandt called this an
``on-the-cheap strategy.'' But it is not without costs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said enforcement of the no-flight zone eight years
after the end of the Persian Gulf war was taking a toll on
resources and morale. He noted that many Air Force pilots are not
re-enlisting, at least in part because of the strain of repeated
tours in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the risk of a nasty surprise. The one thing that
could change everything is the downing of a U.S. pilot. The
prospect of an American or British prisoner of war being paraded
through Baghdad to gain some kind of crude diplomatic leverage
appears to be Saddam's only goal in opening his air defenses to
repeated counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a military sense, the attrition clearly favors the United
States and Britain,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
``The question is, Will Iraq get lucky? No matter how good the
American military is, mistakes happen.''

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yevgeny Primakov, the former KGB spy who is trying
to tighten his hold as Russia's prime minister, has gotten a pretty
fast education about the ugly choices the global economy presents
to leaders of some of the world's great and once-great powers.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks a team of economists from the International
Monetary Fund shows up in Moscow to determine if Primakov has put
together what they politely term a ``realistic'' budget. By that
they mean a budget that contains a plan to actually begin
collecting taxes, bring the costs of pensions and subsidies under
control, manage interest rates and pay back debts owed to the West.
Their recent message is simple: If the numbers don't add up, the
long-halted aid won't resume. And don't count on welcoming back the
burned investors who fled Russia last August.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the agony, Primakov is getting an equally clear _ and
entirely contradictory _ message from the oligarchs whose support
he needs, from ordinary Russians who want relief from soaring
prices, from the itchy military that wants to get paid and from the
Communists who point out that these indignities were unheard of
before Russia began paying lip service to the idea of a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's struggle between the forces of global economic
integration and domestic economic disintegration, between going the
IMF way or going its own way, is an extreme case, but it is hardly
unique. Even as the world economy seems to be stabilizing after 20
months of chaos, the political tensions engendered by those events
are only worsening. From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who
once talked, Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a
globally integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger put it bluntly three
weeks ago at the annual meeting of the gods of a globalized economy
in Davos, Switzerland: ``It is not politically tolerable to
prescribe long periods of austerity. It has not worked in any
country, and in Indonesia it has produced a political
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not on the same wavelength as
Kissinger. It continues to prescribe austerity and fiscal
rectitude, even while talking about the need for ``social safety
nets'' in places like Russia and Brazil. But listen carefully, and
you can hear the White House recalibrating. Last week President
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, was talking
about a new challenge: Dealing with the ``very real fear of a swing
back away from democracy and market economics'' overseas because of
the pressures of austerity.
</P>
<P>
   A four-part series in The New York Times last week described the
economic carnage that created this backlash _ from the enormous
increase in the flow of international capital around the world to
the unpredictable consequences when that cash rushed out of nations
that had become addicted to it but were unable to regulate their
financial systems. Add to that a dash of crony capitalism, the
effects of falling prices for everything from pigs to gasoline, and
the sheer panic that sets in when investors conclude that last
month's ``emerging market'' is this month's basket case, and you
have the ingredients for a global mess.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, though, are people beginning to explore the political
consequences of that collapse, which are as varied as the countries
where economic contagion spread. Brazil's governors responded to
the country's crisis by threatening to default on their debts
rather than give up populist programs; Japan's lawmakers are
pressing the Bank of Japan to vastly increase the amount of yen in
circulation, an inflation-creating strategy Japan hasn't tried
since 1939. (It didn't work out so well then.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, all are discovering one immutable fact:
For all the talk about the wonders of joining the global market, it
greatly reduces a nation's political choices.
</P>
<P>
   When times are good it is easy to satisfy investors, who want
low risk and high returns, while keeping the masses happy. That was
the story of Asia: As money poured in and jobs were created, the
free markets seemed not just a godsend, but an ideology. But the
moment they stopped delivering prosperity, interests diverged. The
IMF, backed by the United States, saw salvation in fiscal
discipline, high interest rates to draw back investors and a
continuing commitment to open markets. The investors demanded
government guarantees that their investments would be protected _
or they would take their cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The investors won the first round. But now Indonesian rickshaw
drivers and Chinese steel makers are demanding that their
governments take care of them first. Suddenly the market forces
that were seen as the path to national salvation have become the
enemy of national sovereignty; who wants to let some bond traders
in New York, much less the IMF, dictate how much can be spent on
unemployment insurance?

   ``Few people would die with the words `free markets' on their
lips,'' notes Daniel Yergin, who has chronicled the rise of the
markets in the 1980s and '90s and the consequent reduction of state
power. And so all of a sudden, from Davos to Shanghai, the talk is
about re-imposing control on the markets to protect the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't so easy to do, not in a world grown dependent on
foreign capital to build the office buildings and the factories.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle between what investors demand and what politicians
think they need to do to satisfy their constituencies is visible
every day, in different guises. French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Washington last week and before stepping inside the
White House went to the headquarters of the IMF, where he declared
that it was time to reimpose control over the exchange rates of the
three major currencies: the dollar, the yen and the new euro.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a free marketeer, made it clear
that he views Chirac's idea as a form of madness. In the name of
keeping currencies aligned, he said, a country whose economy was
slowing _ say, the United States _ might have to raise interest
rates, worsening the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of the struggle between state control and markets
is playing out in China, where the Communist Party's legitimacy
these days rests almost entirely on its ability to deliver economic
growth. When greater economic liberalization served that purpose,
the leadership in Beijing talked about market socialism. But now
growth is slowing _ the government insists the economy expanded 7.8
percent last year, but the figure appears to be a figment of
statistical imagination _ and there are no new jobs for those laid
off from decrepit, uncompetitive state-owned industries. With small
riots breaking out, the government is suddenly more worried about
stability than economic reform. A senior Clinton administration
official talks of China's new ``command economy,'' in which banks
are instructed to keep lending money to failing state-owned
enterprises, a formula for disaster. And foreign investment in
China, once the hottest play on the globe, is slowing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Russia, whose downward spiral, Berger says, is a
greater threat to U.S. security than a strong Soviet Union was. But
the solution Washington is adopting seems a series of Band-Aids:
Clinton's latest budget includes money to pay Russian nuclear
scientists in hopes that they won't seek employment with Saddam
Hussein, and it provides humanitarian food aid around the edges.
But the old strategy _ pretending that Russia is rapidly turning
into a market economy, and providing billions in loans through the
IMF to get it there _ is an approach Washington now views as
bankrupt. So do Russians like Vladimir Ryzhkov, a member of
Parliament who told an audience at Davos that Russia is now so weak
it ``is incapable of implementing serious reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the global crisis insist there is a third way _
that austerity need not mean abandoning the poor or the unemployed.
Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the IMF, says the portrayal
of his organization as heartless economists devoid of a social
conscience is ``arrant nonsense.'' But he also points out that the
IMF does not have the resources to rebuild a Russia or an
Indonesia; only the private markets have that kind of cash. And if
the leaders of the emerging markets want to attract that money
again, they are going to have to listen to what the investors want
as attentively as they listen to the protesters in the streets.

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yevgeny Primakov, the former KGB spy who is trying
to tighten his hold as Russia's prime minister, has gotten a pretty
fast education about the ugly choices the global economy presents
to leaders of some of the world's great and once-great powers.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks a team of economists from the International
Monetary Fund shows up in Moscow to determine if Primakov has put
together what they politely term a ``realistic'' budget. By that
they mean a budget that contains a plan to actually begin
collecting taxes, bring the costs of pensions and subsidies under
control, manage interest rates and pay back debts owed to the West.
Their recent message is simple: If the numbers don't add up, the
long-halted aid won't resume. And don't count on welcoming back the
burned investors who fled Russia last August.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the agony, Primakov is getting an equally clear _ and
entirely contradictory _ message from the oligarchs whose support
he needs, from ordinary Russians who want relief from soaring
prices, from the itchy military that wants to get paid and from the
Communists who point out that these indignities were unheard of
before Russia began paying lip service to the idea of a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's struggle between the forces of global economic
integration and domestic economic disintegration, between going the
IMF way or going its own way, is an extreme case, but it is hardly
unique. Even as the world economy seems to be stabilizing after 20
months of chaos, the political tensions engendered by those events
are only worsening. From Brasilia to Beijing to Tokyo, leaders who
once talked, Clinton-like, about the benefits of plunging into a
globally integrated economy are now talking about how to get out of
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger put it bluntly three
weeks ago at the annual meeting of the gods of a globalized economy
in Davos, Switzerland: ``It is not politically tolerable to
prescribe long periods of austerity. It has not worked in any
country, and in Indonesia it has produced a political
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not on the same wavelength as
Kissinger. It continues to prescribe austerity and fiscal
rectitude, even while talking about the need for ``social safety
nets'' in places like Russia and Brazil. But listen carefully, and
you can hear the White House recalibrating. Last week President
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, was talking
about a new challenge: Dealing with the ``very real fear of a swing
back away from democracy and market economics'' overseas because of
the pressures of austerity.
</P>
<P>
   A four-part series in The New York Times last week described the
economic carnage that created this backlash _ from the enormous
increase in the flow of international capital around the world to
the unpredictable consequences when that cash rushed out of nations
that had become addicted to it but were unable to regulate their
financial systems. Add to that a dash of crony capitalism, the
effects of falling prices for everything from pigs to gasoline, and
the sheer panic that sets in when investors conclude that last
month's ``emerging market'' is this month's basket case, and you
have the ingredients for a global mess.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, though, are people beginning to explore the political
consequences of that collapse, which are as varied as the countries
where economic contagion spread. Brazil's governors responded to
the country's crisis by threatening to default on their debts
rather than give up populist programs; Japan's lawmakers are
pressing the Bank of Japan to vastly increase the amount of yen in
circulation, an inflation-creating strategy Japan hasn't tried
since 1939. (It didn't work out so well then.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, all are discovering one immutable fact:
For all the talk about the wonders of joining the global market, it
greatly reduces a nation's political choices.
</P>
<P>
   When times are good it is easy to satisfy investors, who want
low risk and high returns, while keeping the masses happy. That was
the story of Asia: As money poured in and jobs were created, the
free markets seemed not just a godsend, but an ideology. But the
moment they stopped delivering prosperity, interests diverged. The
IMF, backed by the United States, saw salvation in fiscal
discipline, high interest rates to draw back investors and a
continuing commitment to open markets. The investors demanded
government guarantees that their investments would be protected _
or they would take their cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The investors won the first round. But now Indonesian rickshaw
drivers and Chinese steel makers are demanding that their
governments take care of them first. Suddenly the market forces
that were seen as the path to national salvation have become the
enemy of national sovereignty; who wants to let some bond traders
in New York, much less the IMF, dictate how much can be spent on
unemployment insurance?

   Flying on the Super Cheap &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granted, April in Paris is hard to beat, but one thing that
beats it is being able to spend April in Paris thanks to an airline
ticket costing less than the regular fare between Seattle and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of bargain fares this winter from an industry that, in
the words of one airline official, ``has more seats available than
fannies to put in them,'' has placed many European cities within
reach for the next two months _ plenty of time for Americans to
enjoy spring elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday of this week, United, American, Delta, British
Airways and other carriers are offering an array of low-cost
roundtrip tickets, including New York or Boston to London for $228,
or Los Angeles and San Francisco to London for $358. Air France's
$270 roundtrip fare between Chicago and Paris can be purchased as
late as this Friday, as can its $300 roundtrip to Madrid or $380
roundtrip to Rome or Milan. The fares are larded with restrictions,
and not all airlines have identical discounts or travel dates.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true there'll always be Paris, airline officials say,
you must remember this: it may be a long time before there'll be
Paris this cheap again. The discount fares do not include
Casablanca.

   Turning Midlife Crisis Into Bliss &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a nation of rapidly aging baby boomers, it was very good
news: Never mind those heartburn commercials and wrinkle cream ads.
Middle age is not so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dr. Orville Gilbert Brim, director of the
MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife
Development, which just released the first wave of results from a
10-year study of nearly 8,000 Americans, ``midlife is the best
place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from supporting the Madison Avenue stereotype of middle age
as a time of questioning and emotional upheaval, the MacArthur
study found that most people experience the years between 35 and 65
_ particularly the decades between 40 and 60 _ as a period of
psychic equanimity, good health and productive activity. They feel,
for the most part, a high degree of satisfaction with their
marriages and with their relationships with children _ and a
greater sense of control in many areas of life. Most say they feel
better about their lives than they did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while the term ``midlife crisis'' is so familiar that 95
percent of Americans can define it, only 23 percent of participants
in the study reported having a midlife crisis, and of those, just a
third described the crisis as a time of personal turmoil brought
about by the realization that they were aging.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the MacArthur study is the MIDUS survey, an
in-depth telephone and mail survey of 3,000 adults from 25 to 74
years old, designed to tap a variety of life domains. About 5,000
other subjects participated in 11 related studies, whose results
will be released in future reports, Brim said.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the most comprehensive to date of middle-aged
adults. But while its message is upbeat, the findings suggest many
Americans may have trouble believing it: Fully 87 percent of those
surveyed told the researchers they would like to be younger than
they are.

   Two weeks before the visit to Beijing of Secretary of State

was imprisoned after writing about internal politics in Hong Kong
publications. Diplomats read the release of Gao Yu, 55, whose case
had been publicized abroad, as a gesture to soften U.S. rights
concerns as the two countries plan a visit to Washington by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji in April. But the gesture was not overwhelming:
Ms. Gao had served all but nine months of a six-year term.

   Scientists reached a milestone in their attempts to uncover the
face of one of the most deadly viruses ever known _ an influenza
virus that swept the world in 1918, killing perhaps as many as 40
million people. Using shards from lung tissue preserved since 1918,
they deciphered the entire sequence of an essential viral gene.
Unfortunately, this gene did not explain the virus' lethality. The
scientists are moving on to the virus' seven remaining genes.

   After years of sporadic charges about corruption within the U.S.
Customs Service, a Treasury Department report concluded that the
agency's front-line role in the war against illegal narcotics had
left it vulnerable to drug traffickers willing to pay enormous
bribes to low-paid officers willing to look the other way. The
report found that the agency's internal affairs system was too
ineffective to determine the scope of the problem, but said that

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Before chickens were bacteria-laden
 &HT;    For release Feb. 24, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year-old article I finally caught up with the other day
reported that nearly two-thirds of all chickens bought at retail
stores carry the germ campylobacter, described in the dispatch as
``the most widespread cause of food poisoning in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The same article quoted others as saying the warning, from
Consumers Union, was alarmist, and it strongly implied that the
persons most endangered by campylobacter were those who ate raw
chicken _ which, presumably, most of us do not.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a conversation with old friends about how we were
served chicken when we were kids. Each Friday night, I would eat at
Grandma's house, she an old-country woman who believed every part
of the chicken was a delicacy and who, after koshering it in a bath
of rock salt, cooked her chicken so long that no bacteria could
hope to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the chicken parts Grandma Ida forced onto our plates no
longer can reach the table via our retail stores; they're now being
used to improve our balance-of-trade situation.
</P>
<P>
   I can recall having a misstated ``appetizer'' concoction of the
chicken's yellow feet, a bony ring from its neck and the part that
went over the fence last being placed on my plate either in honor
of my youth or for punishment for my school grades; I forget which.
</P>
<P>
   Now chicken feet are a prime export to Asia, particularly Japan.
Necks, gizzards and dark meat also head off to Asia, although I
confess to liking dark meat.
</P>
<P>
   When I would balk at eating chicken feet on those uncomfortable
Friday nights, Grandma Ida would admonish me with the words heard
so often by Jewish-American children of the World War II years:
``If you don't eat it, Hitler will.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried, without success, to impress upon this woman that the
war would be shortened considerably if Hitler did eat those chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another item Grandma Ida served during the Friday night dinner
also could have had an effect on the length of the war. She called
it ``kremsl.'' This she made of ground matzoh, eggs, some spices
and, I am certain, heavy water that later was to be used in the
development of the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the shape of a half-inch-thick pancake, at least. And
each must have weighed better than a pound.
</P>
<P>
   This was served with the main course, an overboiled chicken leg
and thigh that slipped off the bone the moment I tried to raise it
from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   I would whisper to my grandmother that the best use of a kremsl
was to drop it from Allied planes over Germany, the kremsl having
some of the same properties of a 500-pound bomb. A couple of good
kremsl raids, I insisted, would bring Hitler to his knees. Or, I
also suggested, instead of bombing his cities with kremsl, make him
eat it. He'd be on his knees quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my misgivings about portions of the meal, the Friday
night dinners were a major part of my growing up and were not yet
known to be contaminated with something called campylobacter.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems to be a rule of the table to analyze the
food for its properties rather than its taste or appearance. Words
such as salmonella, listeria and campylobacter creep into our
market shopping or dinner table planning.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain how frequently these bacteria affect humans but
I know that Grandma Ida lived a long time _ well into her 80s _
while never being cognizant of them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what finally caused her to die was a compilation of
these myriad bacteria, but if you ever saw my Grandma Ida chewing
away on a yellow chicken foot, you'd never get the impression she
was killing herself.
</P>
<P>
   To her, that and boiled fish heads were great delicacies. Ah,
those Monday night boiled fish heads!
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: On tax cuts, public sees through GOP again
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are reworking themselves from the
impeachment party to the tax cutting party, pushing for a 10
percent federal income tax cut, but although tax cutting is a cozy
comfort zone for Republican politicians, it is not clear that tax
cuts play much better with the public than impeachment did.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, everyone gripes about taxes. Always have, always will. Few
would turn down a cut.
</P>
<P>
   But survey after survey finds tax cuts low on voters' wish
lists, and the last market test wasn't promising. Bob Dole bid a 15
percent tax cut if folks would just elect him president. He is
currently hustling against erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as in impeachment, the public seems to have a
sounder grip on reality than GOP agenda writers.
</P>
<P>
   For all our bellyaching, the fact remains, as it has for
decades, that Americans are among the least taxed of industrial
peoples. The latest figures from the authoritative Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development put the United States in the
bottom five among the 29 leading economies in taxes as a percentage
of Gross Domestic Product. Only the Japanese (just barely),
Koreans, Turks and Mexicans pay less.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the taxes paid by typical American families have
remained essentially constant for years.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of whipping up support, the keenest would-be
tax-cutters usually resort, and are again, to phony numbers. This
season's holy-cow figure has Americans paying an average of 40
percent of their income in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's sort of true _ but utterly misleading.
</P>
<P>
   To gimmick up the figure, the scare-mongers first round up from
the conservative Tax Foundation's figure of 36.7 percent. That's
some pretty steep rounding. Then they fail to mention that the
average includes capital gains and estate taxes -- overwhelmingly
paid by the well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The only big tax ``increase'' of late has come from investors
harvesting profits in a boom stock market, and estate taxes don't
even kick in until the inheritance hits $625,000. Lumping those
taxes into the average wildly inflates what typical families pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Foundation and other 40-percenters have federal taxes
alone taking 26.1 percent of average two-earner households. The
independent Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on
Taxation put the figure for typical families between 16 and 19
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And most voters can do enough math in their heads to see who
wins big from a 10 percent cut. Not them. More than 60 percent of
the boon would go to the top 10 percent of incomes. Many households
would be lucky to pocket $2 a week. Whee?
</P>
<P>
   A tax cut in a growing economy could ignite inflation _
provoking higher interest rates that in effect would take back the
cut and give it to bankers. Better to use budget surpluses to make
modest investments in the future, through improved schools, for
instance, and to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   That would make the public life we all share a little better,
rather than funding still-sweller lives for folks already living
well.

 Includes a color slide of Billy Crystal with Robert De Niro in a
scene from ``Analyze This.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's the Oscars that you'll never see, with Billy Crystal
returning as the 1999 host and, as in past years, insinuated into
the top films through the magic of digital technology.
 &HT;    ``I know what I would have done with `Saving Private Ryan,'''
the comedian says, chuckling. ``As Tom Hanks was coming ashore, I
probably would have been a Nazi shooting at him and screaming, `He
wins every year! Well, not this year, buddy!'''
 &HT;    Crystal enjoys the laugh. At 50, trim with a still-boyish face,
he's relaxing in a sweater and jeans at Manhattan's Essex House
hotel and indulging his favorite pastime _ riffing spontaneously
on, for example, ``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    ``I might have been Shakespeare's therapist,'' he says. ``Will,
let's explore your feelings about relationships, because things
aren't working. Whoops, Will, your 50 minutes are up.''
 &HT;    Actually, that last one sounds vaguely plausible. In his latest
film _ ``Analyze This,'' opening March 5 _ Crystal plays a
psychiatrist who finds himself treating a troubled mob boss (Robert
De Niro).
 &HT;    The timing of the film's release, in fact, is why Crystal turned
down an invitation to handle this year's Oscar-hosting duties.
 &HT;    ``I work so hard to make the Oscars look easy, but it is a lot
of work,'' he says. ``Basically, I wanted to have a more relaxed
spring.
 &HT;    ``The worst part of not hosting is that I ended last year's show
by saying, `See you next year,''' he adds. ``The moment I said it,
I was like, `What have I done?'''
 &HT;    De Niro _ who's had an Oscar night or two himself _ may seem an
unlikely co-star for the irreverent comedian, but Crystal insists
that the two actually worked well together.
 &HT;    They were introduced years ago by Robin Williams, a longtime
friend of Crystal who worked with De Niro in the film
``Awakenings'' (1990).
 &HT;    ``One night I went to dinner with Robin, who said, `Hey, Billy,
do you mind if Bobby De Niro joins us?' I was like, `Yeah, I do
mind,''' he says sarcastically. ``Of course I want to eat dinner
with Robert De Niro!''
 &HT;    Over the salad course, Crystal says, he learned that De Niro was
a fan of his ``City Slickers'' films.
 &HT;    Fast forward to 1997, when ``Analyze This'' went into
preproduction. Crystal, as co-producer, wanted to offer the
mob-boss part to De Niro, despite his lackluster record in
comedies.
 &HT;    ``I call Bob and say, `Hello, how are you?''' he recalls. ``I
hear on the other end of the receiver, `Hello. You got a role? Well
... maybe ... um ... I don't know ... OK ... uh ... huh.'
 &HT;    ``You can't shut him up once he starts going,'' Crystal jokes.
 &HT;    On the New York set, the comedian learned to interpret De Niro's
cryptic mumbles.
 &HT;    ``We would have conversations where Bob would say, `We gotta fix
... you know ... I know you know ... you know what I mean?'''
Crystal says, laughing.
 &HT;    ``I knew exactly what he meant.''
 &HT;    De Niro is legendary for his intensity, both on and off the
screen, but Crystal says he didn't find the Oscar-winner difficult
to work with.
 &HT;    ``He plays intimidating characters,'' he says, ``but when you're
with Bob, he's a very open, friendly guy, and even shy in some
ways. He's also collaborative.''
 &HT;    In fact, Crystal says, De Niro _ most of whose films have been
heavy-duty dramas _ took to comedy quickly. In one scene, for
example, his character was supposed to confess to a sexual
dysfunction.
 &HT;    ``He has to tell me that his character can't get excited,''
Crystal recalls. ``I say, `In bed?' And Bob ad-libbed, `No, I can't
get excited about the big game against Michigan State.' He loved
that joke.
 &HT;    ``Afterward,'' he adds, ``De Niro turned to me and said, `Billy,
I should do a Neil Simon play. I love this comedy stuff.'''
 &HT;    If ``Analyze This'' is the hit which many predict, it will be a
welcome novelty to Crystal, whose career has been in the doldrums
in recent years.
 &HT;    After starting as a stand-up comic, the native of Long Beach,
N.Y., moved on to a ground-breaking role on ``Soap'' (1977-1981) as
the first gay character on a mainstream television series, a stint
on ``Saturday Night Live'' (1984-1985) and then hit movies
including ``When Harry Met Sally'' (1989) and ``City Slickers''
(1991).
 &HT;    Things have been less rosy lately, however. A 1994 sequel to
``City Slickers'' failed at the box office, as did other recent
vehicles including ``Mr. Saturday Night'' (1992), ``Forget Paris''
(1995) and ``My Giant'' (1998).
 &HT;    Crystal makes no bones about his recent dry spell.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I would be lying if I didn't say I had fleeting
thoughts of `What if they don't want to see me?''' he admits. ``In
many ways, when a movie fails, it's a rejection.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that I've been able to work,'' the comedian
says. ``On the other hard, you do get scared. I kept saying, `Wow,
that was a good movie. Why didn't they go?' And then you understand
that you need to look at everyone's careers. People have ups and
downs.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``The only solution is to do good work,'' he concludes. ``You
can't run scared. You can, however, wake up in the middle of the
night going, `What's happening?'''
 &HT;    Crystal was comforted by Janice, his wife of 28 years. Even now,
his eyes brighten when he mentions her name.
 &HT;    ``We met at summer camp, when we were counselors,'' he recalls.
``I remember all the details. It was the summer of 1966, and on our
first date _ on July 30 _ I took her to a Mets game. The problem
was, I didn't exactly have a driver's license. But I had a date who
said, `Sure I want to go,' So I drove. We started laughing that day
and have never stopped.''
 &HT;    Recently, Janice surprised her husband with an elaborate
50th-birthday party at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. The 400
guests included their daughters, 25-year-old Jennifer and
21-year-old Lindsey, while the gifts included a New York Yankees
championship ring from team owner George Steinbrenner and a
surprise visit from boxing champion Muhammad Ali.
 &HT;    ``Ali and I are old and dear friends,'' Crystal says. ``I did my
first TV appearance at an awards show for him. He liked me so much
that afterward he said, `You are my little brother.' Since then he
has shown up anytime I've called him.''
 &HT;    Crystal almost tears up when describing how, on the night of the
birthday party, Ali was tired and ill.
 &HT;    ``He was still there for me.''
 &HT;    Crystal himself can have the same kind of impact. At a recent
appearance on Rosie O'Donnell's talk show, Crystal says, a member
of the production staff slipped him a note.
 &HT;    ``He wrote that he was a gay teen when I did Jodie on `Soap,'
and the role meant something to him.'''
 &HT;    Crystal pauses.
 &HT;    ``That makes me feel so good,'' he says softly.
 &HT;    Not every form of recognition is so welcome, of course.
 &HT;    ``A few months ago, I was in a Las Vegas men's room,'' Crystal
says. ``All that was sticking out of the stall was my shoes. All of
a sudden, this guy on the outside shouts, `Billy Crystal?'
 &HT;    ``I look up and down. My pants are around my shoes, and this guy
is yelling my name and insisting he's my biggest fan. He even
shoved some paper under the stall and said, `Billy, could you sign
this?'''
 &HT;    Nonplused, Crystal obliged.
 &HT;    ``The guy looked at my shoes again and yelled, `By the way,
Billy, you look mah-velous.'''
 &HT;    ``Not right now I don't,''' Crystal replied.

 Includes a color slide of Sarah Michelle Gellar in a scene from
``Cruel Intentions.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Buffy the Vampire Slayer may need her mouth washed out with soap
after this.
 &HT;    Sarah Michelle Gellar, television's erstwhile Buffy, curses like
a sailor in Roger Kumble's ``Cruel Intentions,'' and she says she
relished every scandalous, R-rated second of it.
 &HT;    ``When I sat down to meet with Roger Kumble, he asked, `So can
Buffy say these things?''' the speed-talking actress says
excitedly. ``My response was, `F--k, yeah!'''
 &HT;    Audiences used to Gellar kicking undead butt on ``Buffy'' are in
for quite a shock when ``Cruel Intentions,'' the latest reworking
of the classic French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' opens
nationwide on March 5.
 &HT;    Kumble updates the sordid tale, sets it on Manhattan's ritzy
Upper East Side and introduces spoiled seductress Kathryn (Gellar),
who challenges her gigolo stepbrother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) to
try to deflower the ultravirginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon). If
he wins, he gets Kathryn as well.
 &HT;    Gellar assumes the role played by Glenn Close in ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' (1987) and by Annette Bening in the little-seen
``Valmont'' (1988). Speaking by telephone from a Los Angeles hotel,
where she's promoting ``Cruel Intentions,'' Gellar claims that she
felt no pressure tackling a part so well executed by others. After
all, she had followed in the admittedly somewhat-less-imposing
footsteps of Kristy Swanson, who played Buffy in the 1992 film on
which the series is based.
 &HT;    ``I think that I'll be able to avoid most of the comparisons,
because `Cruel Intentions' is so different from `Dangerous
Liaisons,''' she says. ``I was actually more worried about
comparisons to the `Buffy' movie when I started the television
show.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, my `Cruel Intentions' character is different from
Glenn Close's in `Dangerous Liaisons,''' she adds. ``Our film is
not set in the 18th century, and we've got modern-day teen-agers in
New York City.
 &HT;    ``It was probably much harder for Annette Bening, because people
were really making comparisons between `Valmont' and `Dangerous
Liaisons.'''
 &HT;    Crafting ``Cruel Intentions'' for a younger audience practically
guarantees that ``Liaisons'' purists will attack the film as an
exercise in dumbing down a classic saga in order to make a quick
buck. However, Gellar urges naysayers to give the film a chance.
 &HT;    ``We're taking great material and reworking it, retelling the
story,'' she says forcefully. ``The wonderful thing about the
story, about the novel, is that it's like Shakespeare _ no matter
how many times you tell the story, it's fresh and there's something
new to tell. It's genius.
 &HT;    ``Our version'' _ Gellar slips into an evil cackle _ ``tells you
lots of things the previous versions didn't.
 &HT;    ``When you update material, it has to change,'' she adds. ``What
was a sin in the old days is not really a sin anymore. So we've put
in a few modern sins.''
 &HT;    ``Cruel Intentions'' follows Gellar's cutesy-sweet performance
in the romantic comedy ``Simply Irresistible.'' The actress played
the owner/chef of a failing Manhattan restaurant who became a
world-class cook and met her dream guy (Sean Patrick Flanery) after
an encounter with an supernatural crab salesman.
 &HT;    The film, released in early February, proved to be both
complicated and resistible, at least by audiences.
 &HT;    It was a rare career misstep for Gellar, however. ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' continues to thrive. Now in its third season on
the WB, the series ranks as one of television's most popular shows
among the viewers most desired by advertisers, 18-to-34-year-old
males and females.
 &HT;    Gellar plays Buffy, a young woman struggling to lead an ordinary
life, complete with friends, lovers and school, without neglecting
her responsibilities as The Chosen One, the Slayer who must kick,
crush, gut and burn a ceaseless parade of villains and fiends,
among them Angel (David Boreanaz), her
boyfriend-turned-demon-turned-good-guy-again.
 &HT;    ``I think the show is just now hitting its stride,'' Gellar
says. ``I think the biggest risk we took was when Buffy had sex
with Angel and he went bad ...
 &HT;    ``Angel's going bad was really the ultimate metaphor,'' she
says. ``It was the ultimate example of having sex with someone and
the guy doesn't call the next day.''
 &HT;    Boreanaz is about to leave the series to star in a spinoff,
``Angel,'' due to air next fall in the WB's post-``Buffy'' slot.
Gellar isn't worried about possible overkill, however, any more
than she frets about the current glut of supernatural shows _
``Charmed,'' for example _ stealing ``Buffy's'' thunder or eroding
its ratings.
 &HT;    ``If people are demanding more of this genre, then there's room
for more,'' Gellar says. ``There's only one `Buffy,' and no matter
how much is out there, there will still only be one `Buffy.'''
 &HT;    This 21-year-old clearly does not lack for confidence. But then,
she's already a veteran of nearly two decades of performing, having
made her first Burger King commercial as a tot. She later attended
New York's High School for the Performing Arts, and first tasted
fame with her role as Susan Lucci's daughter on the soap opera,
``All My Children.''
 &HT;    Gellar and Lucci reportedly never hit it off, and the
often-been-nominated-but-never-won Lucci was said to be less than
thrilled when Gellar won a 1994 Emmy Award for her work on
``Children.'' In any event, the younger woman left the show shortly
thereafter.
 &HT;    Gellar's other credits include a couple of stage plays and the
films ``Funny Farm'' (1988), ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
(1997) and ``Scream 2'' (1997). The latter two films, combined with
her renown as Buffy, could easily pigeonhole her as a horror star,
but Gellar is determined to keep mixing it up, switching gears from
tough on ``Buffy'' to tender in ``Simply Irresistible'' to catty in
``Cruel Intentions.''
 &HT;    She also hopes that her fans will not confuse her with her
characters _ any of them.
 &HT;    ``People have to remember that I'm an actress and that none of
the characters is Sarah,'' she says. ``They're characters that I
play.
 &HT;    ``I don't ever have to remind myself of that,'' she adds. ``I
have a very, very clear understanding of who I am, and I'm none of
these people. I am Sarah.''
 &HT;    She protects that identity by drawing a sharp line between her
public and private lives, trying to keep perspective despite the
spotlight's glare.
 &HT;    ``There's a part of all this that makes it very hard to keep my
feet on the ground,'' she says. ``It's all a little surreal. But I
work hard to have a life, a private life separate from what I do.
That's how I keep my sanity.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Ga. governor does battle with DOT
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes still winces over the slogan his
opponent, Guy Millner, used in the last election: ``Roy Barnes _
too liberal for Georgia.'' But it is precisely because there's
nothing liberal about Barnes' record or style that he's been able
to sell a progressive transportation initiative to a Legislature
that moves like molasses.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he says, he would have told any politician he was
nuts to try it. But the Legislature is poised to approve Barnes'
bill, maybe this week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has mastered a key political lesson _ it's how you
say it that counts. When he tells suburban politicians _ who think
local control is woven into the American flag _ their economic
future demands putting regional interests first, they believe him.
When he tells legislators from Vidalia and Valdosta that fixing the
metro problem is the only way to guarantee Georgia gets the federal
money to complete their rural highways, they believe him, too.
</P>
<P>
   At a Georgia Conservancy growth strategies seminar last week,
Barnes included one of the ``country boy from Cobb County'' stories
that help him win over all who are suspicious of a transportation
superagency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a county that's as protectionist as any I know,''
he said. ``We once had some politicians who suggested we put
piranhas in the Chattahoochee and stand at the bridge to keep
anything from Atlanta from getting in. Let me tell you something _
they're there.'' There's always a major point after Barnes says,
``Let me tell you something.''
</P>
<P>
   And his point was that you can't tell today where Cobb County
ends and Atlanta begins. That we're all in this together when it
comes to saving the region from the traffic and pollution that are
tarnishing Atlanta's economic shine.
</P>
<P>
   I love hearing the governor speak, maybe because I'm a native
with deep roots in south Georgia. But underneath all of that
Southern storytelling and preacherlike fervor is an intellect I
admire too. It enables Barnes to get tedious legal details right,
plot strategies that corner potential opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders love Barnes on transportation, but many aren't
crazy about him on health care. He's determined to make HMOs liable
for medical decisions they make, and businesses worry lawsuits
could increase costs. Chambers of Commerce have joined with
insurance lobbyists in opposing patients' rights in the past. But
not this year_ at least, not visibly. They need Barnes' good will
too badly on growth issues.
</P>
<P>
   The battle I'm waiting for on transportation, though, will come
when Barnes' new regional authority tells the state Department of
Transportation its plans don't include enough money for alternative
modes of transportation. The DOT, which operates under its own
board and controls most of its own budget, has allocated only 2.2
percent of its annual $540 million in federal dollars for
alternatives over the past five years. That's despite the fact that
nearly two-thirds of those dollars could have been used for such.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is showing just how good he is at changing the political
dynamics of local decision-making. But I'm waiting for him to say
``Let me tell you something'' _ about decision-making at DOT.

 &HT;    Y2K COMMENTARY: U.S. mood is closer to glee than gloom
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The arrival of 2000 will have special meaning for Christians,
marking the end of their faith's second millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar that we use today was designed in the sixth
century, under orders of Pope John I, to honor Jesus Christ. It
declared that Christ was born in year 1.
</P>
<P>
   On the calendar Christians agree, but not on how to view the
impending arrival of a third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 approaches, some evangelical Protestants are saying the
new year could trigger the ``end times.'' These Christians say the
New Testament's Book of Revelation foretells a battle of
Armageddon. And they believe 2000 could mark the launch of this
epic fight between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is taking the opposite approach. Pope John
Paul II has declared 2000 to be the Great Jubilee Year. ``The
journey of believers toward the third millennium is in no way
weighed down by the weariness which the burden of 2,000 years of
history could bring,'' the pope said in declaring the jubilee year.
``Rather, Christians feel invigorated. May the joy of forgiveness
be stronger and greater than any resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he says Christians have an obligation to celebrate on
New Year's Eve. ``Let no one in this jubilee year ... behave like
the elder brother in the Gospel parable who refuses to enter the
house to celebrate'' (Luke 15:25-30), Pope John Paul II said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Protestant evangelicals and the Catholic pope are both
Christians, why do they see New Year's Day 2000 so differently?
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 seems to be a far more loaded date for
Protestants than for Catholics,'' said Joanne Maguire, an assistant
professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina
at Charlotte. ``Catholics tend to believe the Second Coming could
come at any moment of any day,'' so they don't focus much attention
on a particular date, such as Jan. 1, 2000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more Catholics are seeing visions of the Mary.
``Protestants have had a culture of apocalypse ... while Catholics
have a long-standing tradition of seeing visions,'' said Victor
Balaban, a psychologist at Emory University who studies religious
beliefs and millennial events. As Protestants and Catholics respond
to their ``millennium anxieties,'' each takes comfort from whatever
feels familiar within their own traditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Marian Library-International Marian Research Institute at
the University of Dayton in Ohio reports that in recent years, more
than 200 new apparitions of Mary have been reported around the
world, with more than a dozen in the United States in the 1990s.
And now the visions are increasing as we approach 2000. In Georgia,
for example, tens of thousands of people have gathered throughout
this decade in Conyers to hear Nancy Fowler reveal her messages
from Mary.
</P>
<P>
   So will 1999 be filled with yet more predictions of Armaggedon
and sightings of the blessed mother? Perhaps. But maybe not as many
as religious scholars once expected, according to Mark Silk,
director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at
Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are really pretty good'' for most Americans these days,
Silk said. ``I don't see people in a state of high distress.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation at peace, the economy in good shape and crime
decreasing, people may be less wary of the new millennium than they
would have been in harsher times. Regardless of religion, we're
more inclined to follow the pope's advice and ``enter the house to
celebrate.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: I can relate to the ``Mouth of the South''
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ Former CNN chief, and one-time outdoor
advertiser, Ted Turner, seems to spend an awful lot of time trying
to pry his foot out of his mouth. On Tuesday, in an address to the
National Family Planning and Reproductive Association in
Washington, he tells a Polish joke in reference to the pope.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he issues an apology to the Catholic League, an
anti-defamation group that didn't think he was very funny. And that
was last week. Wonder what he's up to this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Turner and his wife, Jane Fonda, promised $1 billion
to the
</P>
<P>
   United Nations for programs encouraging population control.
Sounded good to me, but a few of my more conservative friends had a
different idea. ``Commie Pinkopropaganda!'' they howled. ``He
married ``Hanoi Jane'' and now he's playing Charlie McCarthy to her
Edgar Bergen.'' I tell them I doubt that and remind them Turner was
roiling the waters of polite society long before he ever met
Henry's daughter. Think America's Cup, and Turner's acceptance
speech, just before
</P>
<P>
   his tipsy tumble from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I read of another outbreak of Turner's foot-in-mouth
disease, I can't help chuckling. It's not always pretty, and often
rude, but somehow I can identify with Mrs. Turner's bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   One of my earliest recollections is of my mother explaining to a
group of ladies gathered in her parlor what a lovely child I had
been before I learned to talk. ``Don't blurt!'' she'd warn as she
pulled me aside, pinching my elbow for good measure. And when it
became obvious that I wasn't catching on, she'd rat on me to my
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry, I have to tell you what your daughter did today,'' was
the way the conversation would usually begin. I don't remember
being particularly upset over these dinnertime harangues, but
looking back on it, I suspect my father often wished he could have
skipped the evening's show and tell.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Mother would insist my father do something about his
daughter which invariably prompted him to remind me that some folks
might be unreceptive to my verbal eruptions. ``Weigh your words,''
he'd sagely advise. ``Think before you speak.'' I would promise to
try harder but
</P>
<P>
   somehow, I always blew it - like the time I warned our kindly
neighbor, Mrs. Sullivan
</P>
<P>
   who wore a fiery red wig, that her hair was on crooked.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, my behavior would rock my mother's social
equivalent of the Richter scale so badly she'd have a ``sinking
spell'' and take to her bed for hours, sometimes days, refusing all
nourishment (except chocolate-covered cherries) and hibernate until
she'd regained her strength. If I dared intrude, I'd be met with
the words every kid dreads: ``I just hope that when you
</P>
<P>
   grow up and have children they behave the way you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother lived to see her wish come true. One afternoon,
thirty-some years later, we were sitting in a downtown Atlanta tea
room with my two-year-old
</P>
<P>
   son between us. As we ladled and silently sipped our cold
cucumber soup, the
</P>
<P>
   child played quietly on the tray of his high chair, a Matchbox
bulldozer in one
</P>
<P>
   hand and a crumbling cracker in the other. Mother had no sooner
commented on his exemplary behavior, noting how different it was
from the only child she had raised, than he let out a shriek and
pointed to the lady at the next table. ``Momma! Look at that hat!''
</P>
<P>
   Mortified, I grabbed for the offending finger and tried to
shoosh little big mouth. My mother leaned back in amusement. ``It's
impolite to point,'' I whispered firmly. He caught on and holstered
the deviant digit. But I had forgotten to mention the yelling part.
``But, Momma!'' he bellowed again, this time using his elbow as a
pointer, ``isn't that a funny hat?'' My mother did everything but
slap her thighs in unladylike amusement at my discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not in the same league with the fearless Ted Turner.
Now he's lobbying for a recall of the Sixth Commandment (adultery).
Can't wait to see how he gets out of this one.

ALAN JACKSON: MILES GONE AND MORE TO GO

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of country singer Alan Jackson 
 By JENNIFER GERLOCK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been a long road from Newnan, Ga., for the man in the white
hat, country superstar Alan Jackson.
 &HT;    When he left Newnan, he took with him only a guitar and his
high-school sweetheart. Today, Jackson can claim more than 25
million albums sold, a 30,000-square-foot mansion by a lake in
Franklin, Tenn., and a wall of awards that hardly another
entertainer could match.
 &HT;    The man who owns that mansion shows no signs of having ``gone
Hollywood,'' however. The soft-spoken, regular-guy image which
catapulted him to stardom is still very much in evidence.
 &HT;    Jackson is best known for his breakthrough hits ``Here in the
Real World,'' ``Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,'' ``Don't Rock the
Jukebox'' and ``Chattahoochee,'' all from his first album, ``Here
in the Real World'' (1989). Nine years, seven albums, more than 24
No. 1 songs and 63 awards later, Jackson is still in his prime.
 &HT;    His current album, ``High Mileage,'' debuted at No. 1 on
Billboard's country charts in September 1998. Within a month of the
disk's release, it had sold more than a million copies and earned
him his 28th top-five record, not to mention his highest-debuting
single ever, the soulful ``I'll Go On Loving You.''
 &HT;    The title ``High Mileage'' appealed to him because it seemed to
resonate with his life, the singer says.
 &HT;    ``I just felt like it was a good title for where I am in my
career, in my life,'' Jackson says. ``I compare it to a car. It's
not that old but it's been driven a lot, so it's got high mileage
on it. A lot of times old cars like that run better than the one
that has been just sitting around. It's rusty, but that doesn't
mean it's bad. Like me _ I've been through a lot in my life.''
 &HT;    He was planning the record and writing five of its songs during
a time of particular crisis in his life, the 40-year-old Jackson
recalls. He and Denise, his wife of 18 years and, yes, his former
high-school sweetheart, had split up, leading the singer to
re-evaluate his priorities.
 &HT;    The result of that soul-searching was a step back along the
path: After a five-month separation, the Jacksons reconciled late
last year. On Dec. 15, 19 years to the day after they were first
married, they renewed their vows.
 &HT;    ``I think I just reached a point where I learned that the career
wouldn't make me happy and the toys didn't make me happy,'' he
says. ``You've got to have a relationship _ the main relationship
in your life, with your partner, your wife or whatever _ and it has
to be right. We had grown apart, and had for a long time. We
learned a lot about ourselves ... and we're better than ever now.''
 &HT;    Jackson believes that his personal trials have not only made him
a stronger individual, but also lent a greater substance to his
work.
 &HT;    ``I like this album better than any album I've made overall,''
he says. ``I think there is a lot of heart and soul in this. Some
of the songs that I was a writer on came at a time when there was a
lot going on in my life, and there is a lot of emotion there. I
think it comes through in some of the music. I hope people hear
that.''
 &HT;    The notes for the album include thanks from Jackson to many of
his musical heroes, singers and/or songwriters such as Hank
Williams, George Jones, Tammy Wynette and Merle Haggard, for their
influence on his career and music.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to thank some people who didn't directly have
anything to do with this album, but in a lot of ways these are the
people who made me want to do this for a living,'' the singer says.
``I am still fans of theirs. That's why I wanted to, because I
don't know that I have ever had a chance to thank them personally
for what they contributed to my ending up in the music business.''
 &HT;    Even after almost a decade of stardom, however, Jackson is
uncomfortable with the idea that there may be younger singers and
songwriters who are drawing similar inspiration from his own work.
 &HT;    ``I don't know that I'll ever impact people the way George Jones
or Hank Williams has,'' he says. ``If anything, I hope I'm keeping
a little bit of traditional country music alive for the next
generation, so they'll know what it is.''
 &HT;    Jackson is taking the country-music tradition he grew up with
out on the road this year. He has modeled his current tour, ``Alan
Jackson's High Mileage Road Show,'' after the Grand Ole Opry road
shows of the 1950s, where a multiartist bill would tour, anchored
by a big-name artist.
 &HT;    ``I thought that this would be a good idea, seeing as it's so
hard to get a leg up in the business,'' Jackson says. ``I remember
those days. The first artists who gave me a hand were Randy Travis
and Alabama. I believe in carrying on the traditions and supporting
some of the great new talent in country music.''
 &HT;    Touring with Jackson in the road show are country newcomers Chad
Brock, Clint Daniels, Sara Evans, Andy Griggs and Danni Leigh.
Further following the Grand Ole Opry model, each of the artists
will have the opportunity to perform three or four selections of
his or her own material.
 &HT;    This approach creates a diverse musical experience for the
audience, which is exactly Jackson's aim.
 &HT;    ``You know, sometimes when you get so caught up in the business,
you forget how the fans listen to the music,'' the singer says. ``I
know I'm that way. I get more and more critical of songs, and even
get to where I can't listen to them just like a fan would.
 &HT;    ``You forget that the people out there listening aren't that
serious about it,'' Jackson continues. ``It's not their life, so
most of the time it's just background music for them. They're not
analyzing every line, every steel-guitar part or something.
 &HT;    ``A lot of times you tend to get too mechanical with it. I have
to really work to try not to get so into my own world and forget
what everything else is really like.''

 Includes a color slide of Kimberly Elise with Oprah Winfrey in a
scene from ``Beloved.'' 
 By JON KRAMPNER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At the Hollywood Hills Coffee Shop, a Los Angeles site famous as
a stomping ground for young film stars, Kimberly Elise is having
Sunday brunch when she spots someone.
 &HT;    ``Is that Jennifer Love Hewitt?'' she asks, indicating a young
woman with sunglasses on her head near the cash register.
 &HT;    It's hard to tell if the young woman in question is the star of
``Party of Five'' and the ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
teen-slasher films. And even if she is, she may be asking someone,
``Is that Kimberly Elise?''
 &HT;    The 31-year-old Elise _ full name: Kimberly Elise Trammel Oldham
_ is an up-and-coming star in her own right. She recently played
Oprah Winfrey's daughter in ``Beloved'' (1998), in a performance
which had been widely touted for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar,
though she ultimately wasn't nominated.
 &HT;    The young actress had previously caught critics' eyes in ``Set
It Off'' (1996) as an inner-city cleaning lady who joins a gang of
bank robbers. She's also been seen in ``The Ditchdigger's
Daughters'' on cable television.
 &HT;    Thoughtful and unaffected by her newfound celebrity, Elise has
large brown eyes and laughs easily and often. She is dressed all in
black _ ``it's slimming,'' she says, although she doesn't appear to
need much help _ and is relaxed and poised even when, as on this
occasion, she is breast-feeding her month-old daughter at a corner
table of the coffee shop.
 &HT;    This poise and lack of pretense is impressive in someone who's
been getting the kind of press notices Elise has. Many reviewers
judged that her performance outshone that of Winfrey and of Thandie
Newton as the title character.
 &HT;    ``Her quiet but forceful performance is the film's great
revelation,'' a Newsweek review said. ``Elise is astonishing as
Denver: Her transformation from outcast to independent woman gives
the movie its defining arc.''
 &HT;    Although Elise has had a life vastly different from that of
Denver, the child of a poverty-stricken former slave whose
long-dead sister unexpectedly reappears, she still identifies with
her, particularly her eventual decision to leave the security of
the yard where she's grown up.
 &HT;    ``I relate to my character in that there was a difficult
adolescence,'' the actress says. ``My life wasn't as profound as
hers, but I had a difficult adolescence.''
 &HT;    Elise says she was quiet and solitary as a teen, growing up in
the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata. She had big plans for the
future, and was eager to get there.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't until I got out of the bubble of Wayzata and home
and Minnesota that I was able to blossom,'' she says. ``When I was
able to leave the yard, so to speak.''
 &HT;    Elise is one of four children of a business executive and a
third-grade teacher. Although her acting talent was apparent early,
she remembers having trouble getting parts in class plays because,
as one of only a few black children in her school, she looked so
different from everyone else.
 &HT;    Today the actress finds her race to be less of an obstacle, even
in frequently racially troubled Los Angeles, where she now lives
with her husband, photographer Maurice Oldham, and their daughters
Ajableu and Jaelarose. It's sexism that rouses her ire.
 &HT;    ``Maybe it's an industry thing, but you really have to fight for
your respect as a woman in this town,'' she says. ``And as a black
actress, there's the hurdle of having to fight for people to see
beyond your color.''
 &HT;    As committed as she's always been to acting, Elise has never
taken an acting class. At the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis she was a speech major, though she did help to pay for
college by appearing in a commercial for Wendy's.
 &HT;    ``I have this fear of public speaking, which is weird, but I
do,'' she says. ``I just clam up. So I decided to face it head on.
I could always act, hide behind a character, but to be Kimberly in
front of groups of people was very scary to me. So it was a lot of
speech classes.''
 &HT;    She avoided acting classes, Elise says, because she wanted to
retain a naturalness to her style.
 &HT;    ``They work great for some people,'' she says. ``But I always
wanted my work to be free-spirited, organic and natural and to not
rely on a process or system.''
 &HT;    Instead, she's pursued a lifetime of independent study. Even at
college, she spent hours carefully watching the people around her,
observing their gestures and making mental notes.
 &HT;    ``But it's not like I was looking for bizarre or strange
people,'' she says. ``It's the everyday people.''
 &HT;    For example, take the seemingly mundane activity of standing in
line.
 &HT;    ``There's an `acting' waiting in line and there's a sincere
waiting in line,'' she says. ``How do you honestly wait in line?
You don't look at your watch, tap your foot and this and that. When
you're really waiting in line, you don't do all those things.''
 &HT;    She's continued her studies in Los Angeles, where she frequently
rides the bus _ rare for car-owning Angelenos, especially
celebrities _ and goes to the park, the library or simply out for a
walk.
 &HT;    ``I was dreading the release of `Beloved,' because it would sort
of blow my cover, and to a degree, it has,'' she says, laughing.
``It's been sort of frustrating, because life is my school. I just
live and observe. People change when they know you and recognize
you _ I'm not as anonymous.''
 &HT;    When she first came to Los Angeles, Elise certainly had that
anonymity. She was not even there as an actress _ her student-made
short film, ``The Joy of Mama's Recall,'' earned her a director's
fellowship to the American Film Institute, where she made another
film, ``The Race.''
 &HT;    Since breaking through as an actress Elise has done no
directing, but she says it is helpful to have that arrow in her
quiver.
 &HT;    ``I'll never move away from being an actor,'' she says. ``But
when the right opportunity comes, I'll direct. I think it's a
necessity, actually, as a black actress, to be as much of a creator
as you can be and not wait on people to create for you.''
 &HT;    Shortly after leaving AFI Elise began to land acting roles in
Hollywood, but she doesn't see herself as an overnight success.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't seem quick to me,'' she says. ``It seems quick to
other people, but I've known it as my destiny since I was very
young, and it's been years of learning, a long process.''
 &HT;    The actress doesn't have her next part lined up yet, but is
quick to say that she won't be taking any time off because of the
birth of her daughter.
 &HT;    ``Not deliberately,'' she says, smiling. ``I'll work when I find
what I want to do. If I found something this week, I'd start
working this week. And if I don't find anything for six months,
it's six months. The baby is real portable, and as long as she's
close to me, she's happy.''
 &HT;    It helps that her husband has a flexible schedule, and can come
along with Elise and their girls to whatever movie set she visits.
It's a particularly satisfying resolution to the classic
family-vs.-career conflict.
 &HT;    ``Family comes first, and that makes every decision easier,''
the actress says. ``My husband and children come with me. We all
pack up and go wherever we're going, and have a ball living out of
a hotel for three months.''

THE ANALYTICAL WORLD OF BILLY CRYSTAL

 Includes a color slide of Billy Crystal with Robert De Niro in a
scene from ``Analyze This.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's the Oscars that you'll never see, with Billy Crystal
returning as the 1999 host and, as in past years, insinuated into
the top films through the magic of digital technology.
 &HT;    ``I know what I would have done with `Saving Private Ryan,'''
the comedian says, chuckling. ``As Tom Hanks was coming ashore, I
probably would have been a Nazi shooting at him and screaming, `He
wins every year! Well, not this year, buddy!'''
 &HT;    Crystal enjoys the laugh. At 50, trim with a still-boyish face,
he's relaxing in a sweater and jeans at Manhattan's Essex House
hotel and indulging his favorite pastime _ riffing spontaneously
on, for example, ``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    ``I might have been Shakespeare's therapist,'' he says. ``Will,
let's explore your feelings about relationships, because things
aren't working. Whoops, Will, your 50 minutes are up.''
 &HT;    Actually, that last one sounds vaguely plausible. In his latest
film _ ``Analyze This,'' opening March 5 _ Crystal plays a
psychiatrist who finds himself treating a troubled mob boss (Robert
De Niro).
 &HT;    The timing of the film's release, in fact, is why Crystal turned
down an invitation to handle this year's Oscar-hosting duties.
 &HT;    ``I work so hard to make the Oscars look easy, but it is a lot
of work,'' he says. ``Basically, I wanted to have a more relaxed
spring.
 &HT;    ``The worst part of not hosting is that I ended last year's show
by saying, `See you next year,''' he adds. ``The moment I said it,
I was like, `What have I done?'''
 &HT;    De Niro _ who's had an Oscar night or two himself _ may seem an
unlikely co-star for the irreverent comedian, but Crystal insists
that the two actually worked well together.
 &HT;    They were introduced years ago by Robin Williams, a longtime
friend of Crystal who worked with De Niro in the film
``Awakenings'' (1990).
 &HT;    ``One night I went to dinner with Robin, who said, `Hey, Billy,
do you mind if Bobby De Niro joins us?' I was like, `Yeah, I do
mind,''' he says sarcastically. ``Of course I want to eat dinner
with Robert De Niro!''
 &HT;    Over the salad course, Crystal says, he learned that De Niro was
a fan of his ``City Slickers'' films.
 &HT;    Fast forward to 1997, when ``Analyze This'' went into
preproduction. Crystal, as co-producer, wanted to offer the
mob-boss part to De Niro, despite his lackluster record in
comedies.
 &HT;    ``I call Bob and say, `Hello, how are you?''' he recalls. ``I
hear on the other end of the receiver, `Hello. You got a role? Well
... maybe ... um ... I don't know ... OK ... uh ... huh.'
 &HT;    ``You can't shut him up once he starts going,'' Crystal jokes.
 &HT;    On the New York set, the comedian learned to interpret De Niro's
cryptic mumbles.
 &HT;    ``We would have conversations where Bob would say, `We gotta fix
... you know ... I know you know ... you know what I mean?'''
Crystal says, laughing.
 &HT;    ``I knew exactly what he meant.''
 &HT;    De Niro is legendary for his intensity, both on and off the
screen, but Crystal says he didn't find the Oscar-winner difficult
to work with.
 &HT;    ``He plays intimidating characters,'' he says, ``but when you're
with Bob, he's a very open, friendly guy, and even shy in some
ways. He's also collaborative.''
 &HT;    In fact, Crystal says, De Niro _ most of whose films have been
heavy-duty dramas _ took to comedy quickly. In one scene, for
example, his character was supposed to confess to a sexual
dysfunction.
 &HT;    ``He has to tell me that his character can't get excited,''
Crystal recalls. ``I say, `In bed?' And Bob ad-libbed, `No, I can't
get excited about the big game against Michigan State.' He loved
that joke.
 &HT;    ``Afterward,'' he adds, ``De Niro turned to me and said, `Billy,
I should do a Neil Simon play. I love this comedy stuff.'''
 &HT;    If ``Analyze This'' is the hit which many predict, it will be a
welcome novelty to Crystal, whose career has been in the doldrums
in recent years.
 &HT;    After starting as a stand-up comic, the native of Long Beach,
N.Y., moved on to a ground-breaking role on ``Soap'' (1977-1981) as
the first gay character on a mainstream television series, a stint
on ``Saturday Night Live'' (1984-1985) and then hit movies
including ``When Harry Met Sally'' (1989) and ``City Slickers''
(1991).
 &HT;    Things have been less rosy lately, however. A 1994 sequel to
``City Slickers'' failed at the box office, as did other recent
vehicles including ``Mr. Saturday Night'' (1992), ``Forget Paris''
(1995) and ``My Giant'' (1998).
 &HT;    Crystal makes no bones about his recent dry spell.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I would be lying if I didn't say I had fleeting
thoughts of `What if they don't want to see me?''' he admits. ``In
many ways, when a movie fails, it's a rejection.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that I've been able to work,'' the comedian
says. ``On the other hard, you do get scared. I kept saying, `Wow,
that was a good movie. Why didn't they go?' And then you understand
that you need to look at everyone's careers. People have ups and
downs.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``The only solution is to do good work,'' he concludes. ``You
can't run scared. You can, however, wake up in the middle of the
night going, `What's happening?'''
 &HT;    Crystal was comforted by Janice, his wife of 28 years. Even now,
his eyes brighten when he mentions her name.
 &HT;    ``We met at summer camp, when we were counselors,'' he recalls.
``I remember all the details. It was the summer of 1966, and on our
first date _ on July 30 _ I took her to a Mets game. The problem
was, I didn't exactly have a driver's license. But I had a date who
said, `Sure I want to go,' So I drove. We started laughing that day
and have never stopped.''
 &HT;    Recently, Janice surprised her husband with an elaborate
50th-birthday party at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. The 400
guests included their daughters, 25-year-old Jennifer and
21-year-old Lindsey, while the gifts included a New York Yankees
championship ring from team owner George Steinbrenner and a
surprise visit from boxing champion Muhammad Ali.
 &HT;    ``Ali and I are old and dear friends,'' Crystal says. ``I did my
first TV appearance at an awards show for him. He liked me so much
that afterward he said, `You are my little brother.' Since then he
has shown up anytime I've called him.''
 &HT;    Crystal almost tears up when describing how, on the night of the
birthday party, Ali was tired and ill.
 &HT;    ``He was still there for me.''
 &HT;    Crystal himself can have the same kind of impact. At a recent
appearance on Rosie O'Donnell's talk show, Crystal says, a member
of the production staff slipped him a note.
 &HT;    ``He wrote that he was a gay teen when I did Jodie on `Soap,'
and the role meant something to him.'''
 &HT;    Crystal pauses.
 &HT;    ``That makes me feel so good,'' he says softly.
 &HT;    Not every form of recognition is so welcome, of course.
 &HT;    ``A few months ago, I was in a Las Vegas men's room,'' Crystal
says. ``All that was sticking out of the stall was my shoes. All of
a sudden, this guy on the outside shouts, `Billy Crystal?'
 &HT;    ``I look up and down. My pants are around my shoes, and this guy
is yelling my name and insisting he's my biggest fan. He even
shoved some paper under the stall and said, `Billy, could you sign
this?'''
 &HT;    Nonplused, Crystal obliged.
 &HT;    ``The guy looked at my shoes again and yelled, `By the way,
Billy, you look mah-velous.'''
 &HT;    ``Not right now I don't,''' Crystal replied.

`INTENTIONAL' GROUNDING: SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR MOVES BEYOND
`BUFFY'

 Includes a color slide of Sarah Michelle Gellar in a scene from
``Cruel Intentions.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Buffy the Vampire Slayer may need her mouth washed out with soap
after this.
 &HT;    Sarah Michelle Gellar, television's erstwhile Buffy, curses like
a sailor in Roger Kumble's ``Cruel Intentions,'' and she says she
relished every scandalous, R-rated second of it.
 &HT;    ``When I sat down to meet with Roger Kumble, he asked, `So can
Buffy say these things?''' the speed-talking actress says
excitedly. ``My response was, `F--k, yeah!'''
 &HT;    Audiences used to Gellar kicking undead butt on ``Buffy'' are in
for quite a shock when ``Cruel Intentions,'' the latest reworking
of the classic French novel ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' opens
nationwide on March 5.
 &HT;    Kumble updates the sordid tale, sets it on Manhattan's ritzy
Upper East Side and introduces spoiled seductress Kathryn (Gellar),
who challenges her gigolo stepbrother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) to
try to deflower the ultravirginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon). If
he wins, he gets Kathryn as well.
 &HT;    Gellar assumes the role played by Glenn Close in ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' (1987) and by Annette Bening in the little-seen
``Valmont'' (1988). Speaking by telephone from a Los Angeles hotel,
where she's promoting ``Cruel Intentions,'' Gellar claims that she
felt no pressure tackling a part so well executed by others. After
all, she had followed in the admittedly somewhat-less-imposing
footsteps of Kristy Swanson, who played Buffy in the 1992 film on
which the series is based.
 &HT;    ``I think that I'll be able to avoid most of the comparisons,
because `Cruel Intentions' is so different from `Dangerous
Liaisons,''' she says. ``I was actually more worried about
comparisons to the `Buffy' movie when I started the television
show.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, my `Cruel Intentions' character is different from
Glenn Close's in `Dangerous Liaisons,''' she adds. ``Our film is
not set in the 18th century, and we've got modern-day teen-agers in
New York City.
 &HT;    ``It was probably much harder for Annette Bening, because people
were really making comparisons between `Valmont' and `Dangerous
Liaisons.'''
 &HT;    Crafting ``Cruel Intentions'' for a younger audience practically
guarantees that ``Liaisons'' purists will attack the film as an
exercise in dumbing down a classic saga in order to make a quick
buck. However, Gellar urges naysayers to give the film a chance.
 &HT;    ``We're taking great material and reworking it, retelling the
story,'' she says forcefully. ``The wonderful thing about the
story, about the novel, is that it's like Shakespeare _ no matter
how many times you tell the story, it's fresh and there's something
new to tell. It's genius.
 &HT;    ``Our version'' _ Gellar slips into an evil cackle _ ``tells you
lots of things the previous versions didn't.
 &HT;    ``When you update material, it has to change,'' she adds. ``What
was a sin in the old days is not really a sin anymore. So we've put
in a few modern sins.''
 &HT;    ``Cruel Intentions'' follows Gellar's cutesy-sweet performance
in the romantic comedy ``Simply Irresistible.'' The actress played
the owner/chef of a failing Manhattan restaurant who became a
world-class cook and met her dream guy (Sean Patrick Flanery) after
an encounter with an supernatural crab salesman.
 &HT;    The film, released in early February, proved to be both
complicated and resistible, at least by audiences.
 &HT;    It was a rare career misstep for Gellar, however. ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' continues to thrive. Now in its third season on
the WB, the series ranks as one of television's most popular shows
among the viewers most desired by advertisers, 18-to-34-year-old
males and females.
 &HT;    Gellar plays Buffy, a young woman struggling to lead an ordinary
life, complete with friends, lovers and school, without neglecting
her responsibilities as The Chosen One, the Slayer who must kick,
crush, gut and burn a ceaseless parade of villains and fiends,
among them Angel (David Boreanaz), her
boyfriend-turned-demon-turned-good-guy-again.
 &HT;    ``I think the show is just now hitting its stride,'' Gellar
says. ``I think the biggest risk we took was when Buffy had sex
with Angel and he went bad ...
 &HT;    ``Angel's going bad was really the ultimate metaphor,'' she
says. ``It was the ultimate example of having sex with someone and
the guy doesn't call the next day.''
 &HT;    Boreanaz is about to leave the series to star in a spinoff,
``Angel,'' due to air next fall in the WB's post-``Buffy'' slot.
Gellar isn't worried about possible overkill, however, any more
than she frets about the current glut of supernatural shows _
``Charmed,'' for example _ stealing ``Buffy's'' thunder or eroding
its ratings.
 &HT;    ``If people are demanding more of this genre, then there's room
for more,'' Gellar says. ``There's only one `Buffy,' and no matter
how much is out there, there will still only be one `Buffy.'''
 &HT;    This 21-year-old clearly does not lack for confidence. But then,
she's already a veteran of nearly two decades of performing, having
made her first Burger King commercial as a tot. She later attended
New York's High School for the Performing Arts, and first tasted
fame with her role as Susan Lucci's daughter on the soap opera,
``All My Children.''
 &HT;    Gellar and Lucci reportedly never hit it off, and the
often-been-nominated-but-never-won Lucci was said to be less than
thrilled when Gellar won a 1994 Emmy Award for her work on
``Children.'' In any event, the younger woman left the show shortly
thereafter.
 &HT;    Gellar's other credits include a couple of stage plays and the
films ``Funny Farm'' (1988), ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
(1997) and ``Scream 2'' (1997). The latter two films, combined with
her renown as Buffy, could easily pigeonhole her as a horror star,
but Gellar is determined to keep mixing it up, switching gears from
tough on ``Buffy'' to tender in ``Simply Irresistible'' to catty in
``Cruel Intentions.''
 &HT;    She also hopes that her fans will not confuse her with her
characters _ any of them.
 &HT;    ``People have to remember that I'm an actress and that none of
the characters is Sarah,'' she says. ``They're characters that I
play.
 &HT;    ``I don't ever have to remind myself of that,'' she adds. ``I
have a very, very clear understanding of who I am, and I'm none of
these people. I am Sarah.''
 &HT;    She protects that identity by drawing a sharp line between her
public and private lives, trying to keep perspective despite the
spotlight's glare.
 &HT;    ``There's a part of all this that makes it very hard to keep my
feet on the ground,'' she says. ``It's all a little surreal. But I
work hard to have a life, a private life separate from what I do.
That's how I keep my sanity.''

 Includes a color slide of country singer Alan Jackson 
 By JENNIFER GERLOCK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been a long road from Newnan, Ga., for the man in the white
hat, country superstar Alan Jackson.
 &HT;    When he left Newnan, he took with him only a guitar and his
high-school sweetheart. Today, Jackson can claim more than 25
million albums sold, a 30,000-square-foot mansion by a lake in
Franklin, Tenn., and a wall of awards that hardly another
entertainer could match.
 &HT;    The man who owns that mansion shows no signs of having ``gone
Hollywood,'' however. The soft-spoken, regular-guy image which
catapulted him to stardom is still very much in evidence.
 &HT;    Jackson is best known for his breakthrough hits ``Here in the
Real World,'' ``Chasin' That Neon Rainbow,'' ``Don't Rock the
Jukebox'' and ``Chattahoochee,'' all from his first album, ``Here
in the Real World'' (1989). Nine years, seven albums, more than 24
No. 1 songs and 63 awards later, Jackson is still in his prime.
 &HT;    His current album, ``High Mileage,'' debuted at No. 1 on
Billboard's country charts in September 1998. Within a month of the
disk's release, it had sold more than a million copies and earned
him his 28th top-five record, not to mention his highest-debuting
single ever, the soulful ``I'll Go On Loving You.''
 &HT;    The title ``High Mileage'' appealed to him because it seemed to
resonate with his life, the singer says.
 &HT;    ``I just felt like it was a good title for where I am in my
career, in my life,'' Jackson says. ``I compare it to a car. It's
not that old but it's been driven a lot, so it's got high mileage
on it. A lot of times old cars like that run better than the one
that has been just sitting around. It's rusty, but that doesn't
mean it's bad. Like me _ I've been through a lot in my life.''
 &HT;    He was planning the record and writing five of its songs during
a time of particular crisis in his life, the 40-year-old Jackson
recalls. He and Denise, his wife of 18 years and, yes, his former
high-school sweetheart, had split up, leading the singer to
re-evaluate his priorities.
 &HT;    The result of that soul-searching was a step back along the
path: After a five-month separation, the Jacksons reconciled late
last year. On Dec. 15, 19 years to the day after they were first
married, they renewed their vows.
 &HT;    ``I think I just reached a point where I learned that the career
wouldn't make me happy and the toys didn't make me happy,'' he
says. ``You've got to have a relationship _ the main relationship
in your life, with your partner, your wife or whatever _ and it has
to be right. We had grown apart, and had for a long time. We
learned a lot about ourselves ... and we're better than ever now.''
 &HT;    Jackson believes that his personal trials have not only made him
a stronger individual, but also lent a greater substance to his
work.
 &HT;    ``I like this album better than any album I've made overall,''
he says. ``I think there is a lot of heart and soul in this. Some
of the songs that I was a writer on came at a time when there was a
lot going on in my life, and there is a lot of emotion there. I
think it comes through in some of the music. I hope people hear
that.''
 &HT;    The notes for the album include thanks from Jackson to many of
his musical heroes, singers and/or songwriters such as Hank
Williams, George Jones, Tammy Wynette and Merle Haggard, for their
influence on his career and music.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to thank some people who didn't directly have
anything to do with this album, but in a lot of ways these are the
people who made me want to do this for a living,'' the singer says.
``I am still fans of theirs. That's why I wanted to, because I
don't know that I have ever had a chance to thank them personally
for what they contributed to my ending up in the music business.''
 &HT;    Even after almost a decade of stardom, however, Jackson is
uncomfortable with the idea that there may be younger singers and
songwriters who are drawing similar inspiration from his own work.
 &HT;    ``I don't know that I'll ever impact people the way George Jones
or Hank Williams has,'' he says. ``If anything, I hope I'm keeping
a little bit of traditional country music alive for the next
generation, so they'll know what it is.''
 &HT;    Jackson is taking the country-music tradition he grew up with
out on the road this year. He has modeled his current tour, ``Alan
Jackson's High Mileage Road Show,'' after the Grand Ole Opry road
shows of the 1950s, where a multiartist bill would tour, anchored
by a big-name artist.
 &HT;    ``I thought that this would be a good idea, seeing as it's so
hard to get a leg up in the business,'' Jackson says. ``I remember
those days. The first artists who gave me a hand were Randy Travis
and Alabama. I believe in carrying on the traditions and supporting
some of the great new talent in country music.''
 &HT;    Touring with Jackson in the road show are country newcomers Chad
Brock, Clint Daniels, Sara Evans, Andy Griggs and Danni Leigh.
Further following the Grand Ole Opry model, each of the artists
will have the opportunity to perform three or four selections of
his or her own material.
 &HT;    This approach creates a diverse musical experience for the
audience, which is exactly Jackson's aim.
 &HT;    ``You know, sometimes when you get so caught up in the business,
you forget how the fans listen to the music,'' the singer says. ``I
know I'm that way. I get more and more critical of songs, and even
get to where I can't listen to them just like a fan would.
 &HT;    ``You forget that the people out there listening aren't that
serious about it,'' Jackson continues. ``It's not their life, so
most of the time it's just background music for them. They're not
analyzing every line, every steel-guitar part or something.
 &HT;    ``A lot of times you tend to get too mechanical with it. I have
to really work to try not to get so into my own world and forget
what everything else is really like.''

 &HT;    Justice grinds slowly ahead in Jasper trial
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The Jasper County courtroom resembles a modest
Methodist church sanctuary, with stained-glass windows behind the
bench, an arched ceiling, and gold-tinted globe lights hanging
down, feathered by thin strands of cobwebs hanging out of reach of
whoever is in charge of keeping things clean.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of former judges line the walls. Wooden blinds mute
the sunlight of this springlike day. There are 20 benches in the
courtroom, with padded seat cushions that add to the churchlike
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day of testimony in the murder trial of James
King, there surprisingly is plenty of room inside the courtroom. A
metal detector is set up just inside the courthouse. DPS troopers
and sheriff's deputies patrol the lawn, and private security
officers sit inside the courtroom. Still, a friend and I walk
inside after passing inspection and find a seat with no difficulty
as eight ceiling fans whir lazily above the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   King is the first of three men to go on trial in the horrific
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a murder that is being cast as
racially motivated. After months of national publicity and nearly
two weeks of jury selection, testimony finally began last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the courthouse is lined with television station
trucks from the large Texas cities and CNN. A few dozen cameras are
set up on the lawn, and camera operators lounge outside, smoking
cigarettes and waiting for the day's testimony to end so they can
get a quick standup. A still photographer is rigging a camera to a
stair rail in order to shoot a dramatic shot of King from the
ground up as he leaves the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no circus here in what's being dubbed as the East
Texas Trial of the Century. Hardly anybody is milling around the
square. We found a parking place just off the square. Cops
outnumber hangers-on outside. Inside, the media seem to outnumber
other spectators, evidenced by notebooks and pens at the ready, as
well as a uniformly bad wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   I counted four sketch artists hard at work, two in front of us.
I watch, fascinated, as a courtroom scene comes to life with
charcoal during the two hours we watch the trial. First the
backdrop is sketched, the windows and globe lights, the simple
bench from which Judge Joe Bob Golden presides with no robe and
little pomp. He doesn't bother to make anyone stand when he returns
from recess, just gets things going again. During a break, he
ambles to the back of the courtroom and visits with a couple of
folks.
</P>
<P>
   As I watch, the artist draws a witness, then the judge, and a
few members of the jury. Soon, a courtroom scene develops on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, John William King, is dressed like a yuppie, in a
dark-green plaid shirt and khakis, the long sleeves hiding the
absurd collection of tattoos that have marked him in earlier
photographs. He looks impossibly young and clean-cut to be accused
of such evil, to already be a convicted felon who's served prison
time.
</P>
<P>
   His father is seated in a wheelchair next to the first row
behind the defense table, his nostrils hooked to an oxygen bottle.
After the first afternoon break, he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   To the right of the defense table is a large color map, perhaps
10 feet in length. It shows the 3.08-mile route of James Byrd's
final moments, from the initial scuffle to where his headless torso
was found.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the prosecution's table sit members of the Byrd family. A
few come around and admire the work of the sketch artists during
the break.
</P>
<P>
   The jury seems attentive, though the testimony this afternoon is
almost breathtakingly dull: An FBI forensic examiner and an expert
in tire treads and footprints testify that tracks at the murder
scene match those of the truck believed used in Byrd's dragging
death, and sandals taken from King's apartment. Compared to
previous days' testimony, today's drags on, simply continuing to
build the prosecution's case with little drama, just dry scientific
conclusions from the physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The tires in question are lined up against the rail behind the
defense table.
</P>
<P>
   The sandals came from Pay-Less.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray is methodical, not flashy or
histrionic. Neither is the defense team for King. In the two hours
I watched, not a single objection was raised. It will be
interesting to see exactly what the defense will be in this case.
</P>
<P>
   As we leave, we run into Sheriff Billy Rowles and Walter
Diggles, executive director for the Deep East Texas Council of
Governments. They're widely credited for herculean efforts in
keeping this racially charged incident from destroying their town.
They both look weary as they talk about dealing with the New Black
Panther Party, which showed up earlier in the week looking for a
little TV time. In the past months, the KKK has also weighed in,
unwelcome, of course. Rowles chats a while, spits some tobacco
juice into a trash can and heads back outside after a few moments.
Like most Jasper residents, they're ready for this ordeal to end,
for justice to be done, and for life to get back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Life seems pretty normal in Jasper, actually. I notice as we
pull out of town that a motel parking lot is full, with most of the
spaces taken up by pickups pulling large bass boats. There's
probably a fishing tournament going on this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the Jasper County courthouse, justice slowly
grinds ahead.

 Includes a color slide of Kimberly Elise with Oprah Winfrey in a
scene from ``Beloved.'' 
 By JON KRAMPNER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    At the Hollywood Hills Coffee Shop, a Los Angeles site famous as
a stomping ground for young film stars, Kimberly Elise is having
Sunday brunch when she spots someone.
 &HT;    ``Is that Jennifer Love Hewitt?'' she asks, indicating a young
woman with sunglasses on her head near the cash register.
 &HT;    It's hard to tell if the young woman in question is the star of
``Party of Five'' and the ``I Know What You Did Last Summer''
teen-slasher films. And even if she is, she may be asking someone,
``Is that Kimberly Elise?''
 &HT;    The 31-year-old Elise _ full name: Kimberly Elise Trammel Oldham
_ is an up-and-coming star in her own right. She recently played
Oprah Winfrey's daughter in ``Beloved'' (1998), in a performance
which had been widely touted for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar,
though she ultimately wasn't nominated.
 &HT;    The young actress had previously caught critics' eyes in ``Set
It Off'' (1996) as an inner-city cleaning lady who joins a gang of
bank robbers. She's also been seen in ``The Ditchdigger's
Daughters'' on cable television.
 &HT;    Thoughtful and unaffected by her newfound celebrity, Elise has
large brown eyes and laughs easily and often. She is dressed all in
black _ ``it's slimming,'' she says, although she doesn't appear to
need much help _ and is relaxed and poised even when, as on this
occasion, she is breast-feeding her month-old daughter at a corner
table of the coffee shop.
 &HT;    This poise and lack of pretense is impressive in someone who's
been getting the kind of press notices Elise has. Many reviewers
judged that her performance outshone that of Winfrey and of Thandie
Newton as the title character.
 &HT;    ``Her quiet but forceful performance is the film's great
revelation,'' a Newsweek review said. ``Elise is astonishing as
Denver: Her transformation from outcast to independent woman gives
the movie its defining arc.''
 &HT;    Although Elise has had a life vastly different from that of
Denver, the child of a poverty-stricken former slave whose
long-dead sister unexpectedly reappears, she still identifies with
her, particularly her eventual decision to leave the security of
the yard where she's grown up.
 &HT;    ``I relate to my character in that there was a difficult
adolescence,'' the actress says. ``My life wasn't as profound as
hers, but I had a difficult adolescence.''
 &HT;    Elise says she was quiet and solitary as a teen, growing up in
the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata. She had big plans for the
future, and was eager to get there.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't until I got out of the bubble of Wayzata and home
and Minnesota that I was able to blossom,'' she says. ``When I was
able to leave the yard, so to speak.''
 &HT;    Elise is one of four children of a business executive and a
third-grade teacher. Although her acting talent was apparent early,
she remembers having trouble getting parts in class plays because,
as one of only a few black children in her school, she looked so
different from everyone else.
 &HT;    Today the actress finds her race to be less of an obstacle, even
in frequently racially troubled Los Angeles, where she now lives
with her husband, photographer Maurice Oldham, and their daughters
Ajableu and Jaelarose. It's sexism that rouses her ire.
 &HT;    ``Maybe it's an industry thing, but you really have to fight for
your respect as a woman in this town,'' she says. ``And as a black
actress, there's the hurdle of having to fight for people to see
beyond your color.''
 &HT;    As committed as she's always been to acting, Elise has never
taken an acting class. At the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis she was a speech major, though she did help to pay for
college by appearing in a commercial for Wendy's.
 &HT;    ``I have this fear of public speaking, which is weird, but I
do,'' she says. ``I just clam up. So I decided to face it head on.
I could always act, hide behind a character, but to be Kimberly in
front of groups of people was very scary to me. So it was a lot of
speech classes.''
 &HT;    She avoided acting classes, Elise says, because she wanted to
retain a naturalness to her style.
 &HT;    ``They work great for some people,'' she says. ``But I always
wanted my work to be free-spirited, organic and natural and to not
rely on a process or system.''
 &HT;    Instead, she's pursued a lifetime of independent study. Even at
college, she spent hours carefully watching the people around her,
observing their gestures and making mental notes.
 &HT;    ``But it's not like I was looking for bizarre or strange
people,'' she says. ``It's the everyday people.''
 &HT;    For example, take the seemingly mundane activity of standing in
line.
 &HT;    ``There's an `acting' waiting in line and there's a sincere
waiting in line,'' she says. ``How do you honestly wait in line?
You don't look at your watch, tap your foot and this and that. When
you're really waiting in line, you don't do all those things.''
 &HT;    She's continued her studies in Los Angeles, where she frequently
rides the bus _ rare for car-owning Angelenos, especially
celebrities _ and goes to the park, the library or simply out for a
walk.
 &HT;    ``I was dreading the release of `Beloved,' because it would sort
of blow my cover, and to a degree, it has,'' she says, laughing.
``It's been sort of frustrating, because life is my school. I just
live and observe. People change when they know you and recognize
you _ I'm not as anonymous.''
 &HT;    When she first came to Los Angeles, Elise certainly had that
anonymity. She was not even there as an actress _ her student-made
short film, ``The Joy of Mama's Recall,'' earned her a director's
fellowship to the American Film Institute, where she made another
film, ``The Race.''
 &HT;    Since breaking through as an actress Elise has done no
directing, but she says it is helpful to have that arrow in her
quiver.
 &HT;    ``I'll never move away from being an actor,'' she says. ``But
when the right opportunity comes, I'll direct. I think it's a
necessity, actually, as a black actress, to be as much of a creator
as you can be and not wait on people to create for you.''
 &HT;    Shortly after leaving AFI Elise began to land acting roles in
Hollywood, but she doesn't see herself as an overnight success.
 &HT;    ``It doesn't seem quick to me,'' she says. ``It seems quick to
other people, but I've known it as my destiny since I was very
young, and it's been years of learning, a long process.''
 &HT;    The actress doesn't have her next part lined up yet, but is
quick to say that she won't be taking any time off because of the
birth of her daughter.
 &HT;    ``Not deliberately,'' she says, smiling. ``I'll work when I find
what I want to do. If I found something this week, I'd start
working this week. And if I don't find anything for six months,
it's six months. The baby is real portable, and as long as she's
close to me, she's happy.''
 &HT;    It helps that her husband has a flexible schedule, and can come
along with Elise and their girls to whatever movie set she visits.
It's a particularly satisfying resolution to the classic
family-vs.-career conflict.
 &HT;    ``Family comes first, and that makes every decision easier,''
the actress says. ``My husband and children come with me. We all
pack up and go wherever we're going, and have a ball living out of
a hotel for three months.''

 &HT;    AOL behavior rules tough to pin down
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online, the nation's largest online service, has had its
virtual wrist slapped time and time again for censoring its highly
popular message boards and chat rooms. A letter-writing campaign is
now under way from members who want to be able to send their own
newsletters to AOL subscribers but are finding themselves violating
the company's legendary ``terms of service.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is convenient to blame AOL for everything from the hole
in the ozone to the end of free speech on the Net, it's important
to remember that with roughly 20 million users, somebody is bound
to be offended by the comments of someone else. As Michael
Bloomberg, founder and CEO of Bloomberg News, said recently, ``You
could stand on a street corner handing out thousand-dollar bills
and you're bound to find somebody who's going to complain.''
</P>
<P>
   So, AOL finds itself caught between two very unappealing
options: vigorous enforcement of its community rules and
guidelines, or total anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   I know this better than most AOL members. Once, I was in the
prickly position of trying to enforce those regulations as a chat
room co-host.
</P>
<P>
   The prime directive for me and the wise, witty co-hosts I was
paired off with each week was simple: Enforce AOL's policies with
vigilance but without stomping on the rights of members to talk
about whatever they wanted to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few months, hosting was easy. I sat in front of my
home PC once, maybe twice a week, greeting members as they came
into the room, announcing what the current topic was and gently
reminding people that typing with all capital letters was impolite,
hard to read and looked like shouting _ all of which are true,
according to accepted rules of Netiquitte.
</P>
<P>
   Things went along like this until ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky''
became big news last January. Then my co-hosts and I and seemed to
be surrounded by vocal representatives from both the far right and
the far left.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that followed, I heard more tasteless jokes about
Monica Lewinsky than I care to remember or recount.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people were fond of typing ``Impeach Clinton'' over and
over again in big letters.
</P>
<P>
   An equal amount of people were found of typing ``Impeach Starr''
in equally large letters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the women who identified themselves simply as
``wives and mothers'' who suggested we stop talking about the
scandal altogether out of respect for Hillary and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a group who kept pleading with me to do something
to stop the online sloganeering so the people who really did want
to talk politics could talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point that being an AOL chat host went from being
an amusing diversion to a weekly crisis of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Where does an AOL member's right to say whatever they like
interfere with the rest of the online community? At what point do
you take steps to warn or punish someone who goes beyond anything
resembling intelligent conversation or good taste?
</P>
<P>
   I thought I knew where the line was one night last spring when
yet another wise guy decided to share the same tired jokes the chat
room regulars and I had heard night after night for months. Just as
I was about to take the first step toward warning the joke teller
to re-read the terms of service, my chat co-host sent me an instant
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha,'' she wrote, ``That's one of the better ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But isn't he violating the TOS?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe,'' she conceded. ``But how can you not with a
topic like this?''
</P>
<P>
   If it had been up to me, I would have issued an ``OSW,'' or
on-screen warning, to the joke teller, because in my opinion he had
violated AOL's rule prohibiting ``abusive and disruptive
language.'' However, my co-host saw it as a harmless joke related
to the steamy subject matter. We chose not to take official action
against the joke teller, but some members in the room took action
of their own. They told him to knock it off. And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   True, some people do need to be formally warned. Some are truly
vulgar, hateful or doing things that are clearly illegal. However,
most just need to know what rules the community has set for itself,
whether it's a chat about ``Dawson's Creek'' or international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that's community: People setting their own
standards of acceptable behavior, without waiting for the long arm
of AOL to do if for them.
</P>

 &HT;    Snakes behind the television set
 &HT;    WITH ART on Cox Server
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The front of the average home entertainment
system is elegant black and silver surfaces with lighted indicators
and buttons. The front view says ``high-tech efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   But pull that sucker away from the wall and the intimidating
tangle of wires behind the system says ``Death Valley rattlesnake
pit.''
</P>
<P>
   You have no reason to despair, however. If you grab the wires
one at a time and trace where they begin and end, you'll find their
purposes are fairly obvious.
</P>
<P>
   So take a deep, calming breath to prepare yourself. You're about
to master the connections that bring cable television into your
home.
</P>
<P>
   If you can understand what you're doing and you have the proper
equipment, you should be able to do what most cable customers have
given up on: taping one program while watching another.
</P>
<P>
   But that's advanced stuff. Let's start with the basics.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE 101
</P>
<P>
   Think of your cable service and your television set as a food
delivery system. The cable system brings program signals, which are
basically recipes, into your home. The television set uses the
program signals to assemble programs in the way an automated
kitchen might use recipes to assemble meals.
</P>
<P>
   The cable signal that enters your home has dozens of program
signals bundled together like recipes in a box. You need a tuner to
select one program signal from the many available signals, and to
send that signal to the television to be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   This is where people tend to get confused. Your television has a
tuner. Your cable service box has a tuner. Your videocassette
recorder has a tuner. But most people use only one tuner at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Most people only use the tuner on their cable service box. The
cable service wire comes into the house carrying its dozens of
program signals and that wire is connected directly to the cable
service box.
</P>
<P>
   The tuner in the cable service box selects one program signal
and sends it on to the television and to the videocassette recorder
if you have one.
</P>
<P>
   But in this set-up, only one program signal reaches the
television and the VCR. The tuners in the television and the VCR
don't have a chance to select from the dozens of program signals
the original cable wire brought into the house.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting the most out of your cable service is giving
more than one of your tuners a chance to pick a program signal to
record or view.
</P>
<P>
   WITHOUT A CABLE BOX
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Hayden, technical supervisor for TCI Cablevision, said
almost all TCI customers use a cable service box. In TCI's case,
the box is called a digital consumer terminal, or DCT for short.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want a cable service box, you can take the cable
service wire as it enters the house and plug it directly into the
input connection on a cable-ready television. The cable wire is a
coaxial cable, and it fits onto the television's coaxial cable
input port. The port will be marked something like ``input from
cable or antenna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable-ready'' means the tuner built into the television is
capable of choosing from among the dozens of program signals
available on the cable wire.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden pointed out, however, that even cable-ready televisions
aren't able to tune into premium channels. The cable company
encodes the premium channel signals in such a way that only their
cable service box can decipher them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not all cable-ready tuners are created equal, Hayden said.
Some older cable ready sets are capable of tuning into programs
transmitted at a frequency of up to about 350 megahertz. If your
cable service transmits signals on frequencies beyond your
television tuner's capabilities, you won't be able to watch all the
channels included in the basic service without a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to add a VCR to a set-up without a cable box. And it's
easy with this set-up to watch one program while taping another.
</P>
<P>
   Take the main cable wire where it enters the house and screw it
into the input port on your VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Near the input port you'll find a second port marked something
like ``out to TV.'' Run a length of coaxial cable from the output
port on the VCR to the input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   To watch a program on television in this set-up, you turn the
VCR off and use the tuner on the television to select your program.
</P>
<P>
   When you're watching a recorded program you don't need the tuner
on your television. To play a tape, you push the play button and
the VCR ``reads'' a recorded program signal from a videotape. The
signal on the tape is the same kind of program signal that is found
bundled with other signals on the wire connecting your home to a
cable company.
</P>
<P>
   As you play a tape, there will only be one program signal on the
wire coming from the VCR, so you simply turn the television tuner
to channel 3. Channel 3 is the setting you use to receive a single
signal from another device such as a VCR or a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   Every videocassette recorder has a TV/VCR switch of some kind.
When you are using the VCR to send a signal to the television, this
switch should be set to VCR.
</P>
<P>
   When you want the television tuner to select a signal from the
cable wire, the TV/VCR switch should be set to TV. That lets the
original cable signal containing its dozens of program signals to
reach the television's tuner.
</P>
<P>
   To record a program and watch the same program, you'll use the
tuner on your VCR to select one signal from the program signals
available on the cable wire. Set the TV/VCR switch to VCR so the
VCR sends the signal it has selected on to the television. Tune the
television to channel 3.
</P>
<P>
   To record one program and watch another, you have to use both
your tuners.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the tuner on the VCR to the channel you wish to record.
Turning the VCR tuner to channel 7, for example, tells the
recording system this is the signal you want to record. Push the
record button at the time the program you are recording is to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Now set the TV/VCR switch to TV. If the switch is on VCR, the
VCR will send the channel 7 program signal along the wire to the
television, and that's not what you want.
</P>
<P>
   With the TV/VCR switch on TV, all the signals available on the
cable wire reach the television, and you can use the television
tuner to pick the show you want to watch.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT LINE SET-UPS
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback to having cable service without a cable
service box is that you don't have access to all the cable extras
like premium channels, pay-per-view programs, music services and so
on. So most cable customers use a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   And most cable service box users hook their components together
in a straight line _ the cable wire from outside the house goes to
the input jack on the cable service box, a line goes from the
output port on the cable service box to the input jack on the
television.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a videocasette recorder it is placed between the
cable service box and the television. In other words, the line
leading from the cable service box goes to the input port on the
VCR, and another wire goes from the output port on the VCR to the
input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement is easy to use, but it's not flexible. It uses
only one tuner, the one in the cable service box. It doesn't allow
you to watch one program while taping another.
</P>
<P>
   In a straight line set-up the television and videocassette
recorder are always tuned to channel 3.
</P>
<P>
   To record a program, you use the tuner in the cable service box
to pick a program. You set the VCR to channel 3 and push the record
button when the program you want to record starts.
</P>
<P>
   To play a recording, simply push play. The TV/VCR switch will
automatically set itself to VCR if it isn't already set that way.
</P>
<P>
   The VCR sends its signal to the output port, and it travels
along the cable wire connecting the VCR to the television's input
port. Your television, set to channel 3, receives the signal and
uses it to assemble the program that is recorded on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   This system is generally goof-proof, but you have to remember to
leave both your VCR and television set on channel 3. That may mean
you have to reset them after a power outage so they're on the right
channel.
</P>
<P>
   SPLITTING THE SIGNAL
</P>
<P>
   You can have all the frills and premium programs associated with
having a cable service box and the flexibility of using your
television tuner by splitting the cable signal entering your house
into two streams.
</P>
<P>
   All you'll need are a two-way signal spitter, a few short
lengths of coaxial cable wire and an A/B switch. All these items
are available at electronic stores and most discount stores, and
you can get everything you need for about $30. Your cable company
may even have the stuff in stock and can install them for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying your own equipment, avoid the cheapest
equipment on the rack. Gold-plated connections and shielded cables
deliver the best picture quality with the fewest problems.
</P>
<P>
   Start by connecting the main cable wire coming into your house
to the input port of a two-way signal splitter. You may see
amplified splitters in electronic stores, but you want an
unamplified splitter for this job. It's a simple device with one
input port on one side and two output ports on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Run a line from one output port on the splitter to the input
port on the cable box. Run a line from the cable box output port to
the input port on your VCR. Run a line from the VCR output port to
the input port marked A on the A/B switch. We'll explain the A/B
switch in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Now go back to the two-way signal splitter. Screw a coaxial
cable cable onto the empty output port on the splitter. Connect the
other end of that line to the B input port on the A/B switch.
</P>
<P>
   Connect the last coaxial cable connector to the port on the A/B
switch that is marked ``out to TV.'' Naturally the other end of
that line is screwed onto the input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   An A/B switch, like the two-way splitter, is a simple device. It
has two input ports, one marked A and one marked B. It has one
output port linking it to the television.
</P>
<P>
   It also has switches or buttons marked A and B. Push the A
button and the signal passing through the cable service box and
then through the VCR reaches the television.
</P>
<P>
   In the A position, this set-up functions exactly like the
straight-line set-up described earlier: the signal from the cable
company goes into the cable box, and the cable box is used to
select a program. That program is sent along to the VCR and to the
television.
</P>
<P>
   Push the B button, however, and the television is getting the
original signal from the cable company with its dozens of programs
included.
</P>
<P>
   In the B position, you can use the tuner in the television to
select the program you'd like to see. Remember, though, that the
tuner on your cable-ready television will not be able to decipher
encoded premium channels.
</P>
<P>
   While you're using your television to select a program from the
B signal stream, you can use the tuner in the cable service box to
tune in a channel on the A signal stream. Since the VCR gets its
signal from the cable service box, you can record the program on
the A signal stream while watching something on the B signal stream
on the television.
</P>
<P>
   Most people using a two-way splitter put their VCR on the same
stream as the cable service box so they'll be able to record
premium channels and pay-per-view events.
</P>
<P>
   When you're finished recording, you can push the A button on the
A/B switch and turn your television back to channel 3. Now you're
ready to watch the recording you have just made or watch the
premium channels that only your cable service box can tune in.
</P>
<P>
   If you find all this too confusing, your cable company should be
willing and able to go over your options with you.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said TCI is starting to distribute a new type of cable
service box that has a built-in system that will allow customers to
watch one program and record another. He said customers interested
in the new box, called the DCT 2000, should call to inquire about
replacing their current boxes free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   While you're talking to your cable company about video hook-ups,
you should also ask about using RCA-style plugs in your home
theater set-up.
</P>
<P>
   The red, white and yellow coded plugs can link your cable box
directly to your stereo system and possibly improve your system's
sound performance.

 &HT;    Device sends TV sound to headphones
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A New York company is marketing a set of
headphones that promise not only high performance but marital bliss
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unisar Inc. of New York City, the makers of the TV Listener
Infrared Cordless TV Headset System, have trademarked the slogan
``The Marriage Saver'' because they think the product can settle
disputes within families.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener allows one person to listen to television or
music without disturbing a sleeping partner, for instance. And it
lets a person with hearing problems listen at high volume up while
other people in the room listen at normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener comes in two parts. A transmitter sits on top of
the television and is connected to the set's audio output port. The
system comes with a selection of adapters to connect to differing
output ports, and It has a microphone attachment for sets without
an output port. The transmitter can also be attached to other sound
equipment such as a stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the system is a pair of headphones. The
headset weighs only a few ounces and has volume controls.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter sends a signal to the headset using infrared
light like a remote control. Unisar says the infrared system
delivers better stereo sound quality than radio transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener, which won an innovation award at this year's
International Consumer Electronics Show, is not yet widely
available through retail stores. It sells for $59.99 by phone at
(800) 233-1196, or it can be ordered from the Unisar Web site at
unisar.com
</P>
<P>
   Also available on the Web site are Unisar devices that allow
expectant parents to listen to the sounds made by their unborn
children in the womb.

 &HT;    Fixes may be needed, but your PC won't self-destruct Jan. 1
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seldom do I return to a specific topic within a few weeks of
writing about it. After all, my beat _ technology _ is so broad
that it covers everything from Nintendo games to computers to HDTV
to ham radio. If it has batteries, computes or makes beeping sounds
from time to time, I have probably written about it.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail from a concerned (and intelligent) reader guides me
to return to the Year 2000 problem. Now, this is a subject that has
received enough ink to float a battleship. But there are still
smart people out there _ like the reader who sent me the e-mail _
who are mixed up about the impact of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Last week, I wrote a column that treated
the question of whether to replace an older PC. The reader's e-mail
said he was irritated because I had failed to mention the most
serious reason to replace an old PC. He said these older machines
are doomed to stop working in just a few months because of the Y2K
problem and need to be replaced now.
</P>
<P>
   That just isn't so. And there's no criticism of the reader in
that. The criticism is aimed at myself and at others who write
about computers. We just haven't done a good enough job when
intelligent people who read the newspaper still have that fear.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a PC, even an old one, the Year 2000 problem will
not magically turn the PC into a useless collection of chips,
capacitors and resistors. Unless you spill a Mountain Dew into the
PC, there will be no sizzling sound, no smoke, no strange wheezing
noise on Jan. 1, 2000. The hardware will survive.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible _ maybe even likely _ that an old PC and old
software for it will have some problems. For one thing, most
computer clock hardware, even on fairly recent machines, isn't
completely Y2K-compliant. For another, the BIOS chip (the chip that
keeps track of basic information such as the address and type of
your hard disk, the time and date, etc.) is almost certain to have
problems. And if your software is the same age as the computer,
some spreadsheet and money management programs are likely to have
problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these problems is likely to cripple your computer.
You may have to manually reset the date after Jan. 1, 2000 (and
with very old computers, you may have to buy a program that will
reset the date each time you turn on the computer). You may need to
replace some of the financial and spreadsheet software.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and I can tell you this without worrying that I am wrong,
since I always double- and triple-check my thinking on things like
this with real-world Y2K experts _ your PC will still be able to
process letters, play games, check e-mail, and _ with new software
_ balance your budget.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm saying is that your old computer may be out of date and
need replacing, but Y2K problems shouldn't be the reason. Because
here's the kicker: Even some new Pentium-class machines have clocks
and BIOS chips that won't properly handle the change in dates. The
good news, for owners of new and old machines, is that there are
resources to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things you can do. First, worry about your
software, especially software that uses dates. Check with the
manufacturer's Web site to see if there is an update to fix Y2K
problems. If not, replace the software.
</P>
<P>
   Second, worry about your operating system. Even Windows 95 and
Windows 98 are not totally compliant. Go to the Microsoft Web site
at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/ and find out which
updates you need. These updates are free for the downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Third, don't check to see if your PC clock or BIOS chip is
faulty by setting the date ahead on your computer. You'll read this
advice elsewhere, but don't follow it. You take a chance of making
a mess of the programs you have. Instead, go to this Web site
(http://www.nstl.com/html/nstly2k.html) and download the software
mentioned there. It'll check your clock and BIOS chip without
hurting anything.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even for clocks and BIOS chips that can't be replaced,
there are programs available commercially (Norton, the manufacturer
of the well-known utility programs makes one) that will manually
reset the time and date each time you turn the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   So don't give up. That old computer of yours will probably die
of natural causes before the Y2K problem kills it.

 &HT;    AOL behavior rules tough to pin down
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online, the nation's largest online service, has had its
virtual wrist slapped time and time again for censoring its highly
popular message boards and chat rooms. A letter-writing campaign is
now under way from members who want to be able to send their own
newsletters to AOL subscribers but are finding themselves violating
the company's legendary ``terms of service.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is convenient to blame AOL for everything from the hole
in the ozone to the end of free speech on the Net, it's important
to remember that with roughly 20 million users, somebody is bound
to be offended by the comments of someone else. As Michael
Bloomberg, founder and CEO of Bloomberg News, said recently, ``You
could stand on a street corner handing out thousand-dollar bills
and you're bound to find somebody who's going to complain.''
</P>
<P>
   So, AOL finds itself caught between two very unappealing
options: vigorous enforcement of its community rules and
guidelines, or total anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   I know this better than most AOL members. Once, I was in the
prickly position of trying to enforce those regulations as a chat
room co-host.
</P>
<P>
   The prime directive for me and the wise, witty co-hosts I was
paired off with each week was simple: Enforce AOL's policies with
vigilance but without stomping on the rights of members to talk
about whatever they wanted to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few months, hosting was easy. I sat in front of my
home PC once, maybe twice a week, greeting members as they came
into the room, announcing what the current topic was and gently
reminding people that typing with all capital letters was impolite,
hard to read and looked like shouting _ all of which are true,
according to accepted rules of Netiquitte.
</P>
<P>
   Things went along like this until ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky''
became big news last January. Then my co-hosts and I and seemed to
be surrounded by vocal representatives from both the far right and
the far left.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that followed, I heard more tasteless jokes about
Monica Lewinsky than I care to remember or recount.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people were fond of typing ``Impeach Clinton'' over and
over again in big letters.
</P>
<P>
   An equal amount of people were found of typing ``Impeach Starr''
in equally large letters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the women who identified themselves simply as
``wives and mothers'' who suggested we stop talking about the
scandal altogether out of respect for Hillary and Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a group who kept pleading with me to do something
to stop the online sloganeering so the people who really did want
to talk politics could talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point that being an AOL chat host went from being
an amusing diversion to a weekly crisis of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Where does an AOL member's right to say whatever they like
interfere with the rest of the online community? At what point do
you take steps to warn or punish someone who goes beyond anything
resembling intelligent conversation or good taste?
</P>
<P>
   I thought I knew where the line was one night last spring when
yet another wise guy decided to share the same tired jokes the chat
room regulars and I had heard night after night for months. Just as
I was about to take the first step toward warning the joke teller
to re-read the terms of service, my chat co-host sent me an instant
message:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha,'' she wrote, ``That's one of the better ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But isn't he violating the TOS?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe,'' she conceded. ``But how can you not with a
topic like this?''
</P>
<P>
   If it had been up to me, I would have issued an ``OSW,'' or
on-screen warning, to the joke teller, because in my opinion he had
violated AOL's rule prohibiting ``abusive and disruptive
language.'' However, my co-host saw it as a harmless joke related
to the steamy subject matter. We chose not to take official action
against the joke teller, but some members in the room took action
of their own. They told him to knock it off. And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   True, some people do need to be formally warned. Some are truly
vulgar, hateful or doing things that are clearly illegal. However,
most just need to know what rules the community has set for itself,
whether it's a chat about ``Dawson's Creek'' or international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that's community: People setting their own
standards of acceptable behavior, without waiting for the long arm
of AOL to do if for them.

 &HT;    Snakes behind the television set
 &HT;    WITH ART on Cox Server
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The front of the average home entertainment
system is elegant black and silver surfaces with lighted indicators
and buttons. The front view says ``high-tech efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   But pull that sucker away from the wall and the intimidating
tangle of wires behind the system says ``Death Valley rattlesnake
pit.''
</P>
<P>
   You have no reason to despair, however. If you grab the wires
one at a time and trace where they begin and end, you'll find their
purposes are fairly obvious.
</P>
<P>
   So take a deep, calming breath to prepare yourself. You're about
to master the connections that bring cable television into your
home.
</P>
<P>
   If you can understand what you're doing and you have the proper
equipment, you should be able to do what most cable customers have
given up on: taping one program while watching another.
</P>
<P>
   But that's advanced stuff. Let's start with the basics.
</P>
<P>
   CABLE 101
</P>
<P>
   Think of your cable service and your television set as a food
delivery system. The cable system brings program signals, which are
basically recipes, into your home. The television set uses the
program signals to assemble programs in the way an automated
kitchen might use recipes to assemble meals.
</P>
<P>
   The cable signal that enters your home has dozens of program
signals bundled together like recipes in a box. You need a tuner to
select one program signal from the many available signals, and to
send that signal to the television to be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   This is where people tend to get confused. Your television has a
tuner. Your cable service box has a tuner. Your videocassette
recorder has a tuner. But most people use only one tuner at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Most people only use the tuner on their cable service box. The
cable service wire comes into the house carrying its dozens of
program signals and that wire is connected directly to the cable
service box.
</P>
<P>
   The tuner in the cable service box selects one program signal
and sends it on to the television and to the videocassette recorder
if you have one.
</P>
<P>
   But in this set-up, only one program signal reaches the
television and the VCR. The tuners in the television and the VCR
don't have a chance to select from the dozens of program signals
the original cable wire brought into the house.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting the most out of your cable service is giving
more than one of your tuners a chance to pick a program signal to
record or view.
</P>
<P>
   WITHOUT A CABLE BOX
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Hayden, technical supervisor for TCI Cablevision, said
almost all TCI customers use a cable service box. In TCI's case,
the box is called a digital consumer terminal, or DCT for short.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want a cable service box, you can take the cable
service wire as it enters the house and plug it directly into the
input connection on a cable-ready television. The cable wire is a
coaxial cable, and it fits onto the television's coaxial cable
input port. The port will be marked something like ``input from
cable or antenna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable-ready'' means the tuner built into the television is
capable of choosing from among the dozens of program signals
available on the cable wire.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden pointed out, however, that even cable-ready televisions
aren't able to tune into premium channels. The cable company
encodes the premium channel signals in such a way that only their
cable service box can decipher them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, not all cable-ready tuners are created equal, Hayden said.
Some older cable ready sets are capable of tuning into programs
transmitted at a frequency of up to about 350 megahertz. If your
cable service transmits signals on frequencies beyond your
television tuner's capabilities, you won't be able to watch all the
channels included in the basic service without a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to add a VCR to a set-up without a cable box. And it's
easy with this set-up to watch one program while taping another.
</P>
<P>
   Take the main cable wire where it enters the house and screw it
into the input port on your VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Near the input port you'll find a second port marked something
like ``out to TV.'' Run a length of coaxial cable from the output
port on the VCR to the input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   To watch a program on television in this set-up, you turn the
VCR off and use the tuner on the television to select your program.
</P>
<P>
   When you're watching a recorded program you don't need the tuner
on your television. To play a tape, you push the play button and
the VCR ``reads'' a recorded program signal from a videotape. The
signal on the tape is the same kind of program signal that is found
bundled with other signals on the wire connecting your home to a
cable company.
</P>
<P>
   As you play a tape, there will only be one program signal on the
wire coming from the VCR, so you simply turn the television tuner
to channel 3. Channel 3 is the setting you use to receive a single
signal from another device such as a VCR or a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   Every videocassette recorder has a TV/VCR switch of some kind.
When you are using the VCR to send a signal to the television, this
switch should be set to VCR.
</P>
<P>
   When you want the television tuner to select a signal from the
cable wire, the TV/VCR switch should be set to TV. That lets the
original cable signal containing its dozens of program signals to
reach the television's tuner.
</P>
<P>
   To record a program and watch the same program, you'll use the
tuner on your VCR to select one signal from the program signals
available on the cable wire. Set the TV/VCR switch to VCR so the
VCR sends the signal it has selected on to the television. Tune the
television to channel 3.
</P>
<P>
   To record one program and watch another, you have to use both
your tuners.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the tuner on the VCR to the channel you wish to record.
Turning the VCR tuner to channel 7, for example, tells the
recording system this is the signal you want to record. Push the
record button at the time the program you are recording is to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Now set the TV/VCR switch to TV. If the switch is on VCR, the
VCR will send the channel 7 program signal along the wire to the
television, and that's not what you want.
</P>
<P>
   With the TV/VCR switch on TV, all the signals available on the
cable wire reach the television, and you can use the television
tuner to pick the show you want to watch.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT LINE SET-UPS
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback to having cable service without a cable
service box is that you don't have access to all the cable extras
like premium channels, pay-per-view programs, music services and so
on. So most cable customers use a cable service box.
</P>
<P>
   And most cable service box users hook their components together
in a straight line _ the cable wire from outside the house goes to
the input jack on the cable service box, a line goes from the
output port on the cable service box to the input jack on the
television.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a videocasette recorder it is placed between the
cable service box and the television. In other words, the line
leading from the cable service box goes to the input port on the
VCR, and another wire goes from the output port on the VCR to the
input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement is easy to use, but it's not flexible. It uses
only one tuner, the one in the cable service box. It doesn't allow
you to watch one program while taping another.
</P>
<P>
   In a straight line set-up the television and videocassette
recorder are always tuned to channel 3.
</P>
<P>
   To record a program, you use the tuner in the cable service box
to pick a program. You set the VCR to channel 3 and push the record
button when the program you want to record starts.
</P>
<P>
   To play a recording, simply push play. The TV/VCR switch will
automatically set itself to VCR if it isn't already set that way.
</P>
<P>
   The VCR sends its signal to the output port, and it travels
along the cable wire connecting the VCR to the television's input
port. Your television, set to channel 3, receives the signal and
uses it to assemble the program that is recorded on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   This system is generally goof-proof, but you have to remember to
leave both your VCR and television set on channel 3. That may mean
you have to reset them after a power outage so they're on the right
channel.
</P>
<P>
   SPLITTING THE SIGNAL
</P>
<P>
   You can have all the frills and premium programs associated with
having a cable service box and the flexibility of using your
television tuner by splitting the cable signal entering your house
into two streams.
</P>
<P>
   All you'll need are a two-way signal spitter, a few short
lengths of coaxial cable wire and an A/B switch. All these items
are available at electronic stores and most discount stores, and
you can get everything you need for about $30. Your cable company
may even have the stuff in stock and can install them for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying your own equipment, avoid the cheapest
equipment on the rack. Gold-plated connections and shielded cables
deliver the best picture quality with the fewest problems.
</P>
<P>
   Start by connecting the main cable wire coming into your house
to the input port of a two-way signal splitter. You may see
amplified splitters in electronic stores, but you want an
unamplified splitter for this job. It's a simple device with one
input port on one side and two output ports on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Run a line from one output port on the splitter to the input
port on the cable box. Run a line from the cable box output port to
the input port on your VCR. Run a line from the VCR output port to
the input port marked A on the A/B switch. We'll explain the A/B
switch in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Now go back to the two-way signal splitter. Screw a coaxial
cable cable onto the empty output port on the splitter. Connect the
other end of that line to the B input port on the A/B switch.
</P>
<P>
   Connect the last coaxial cable connector to the port on the A/B
switch that is marked ``out to TV.'' Naturally the other end of
that line is screwed onto the input port on the television.
</P>
<P>
   An A/B switch, like the two-way splitter, is a simple device. It
has two input ports, one marked A and one marked B. It has one
output port linking it to the television.
</P>
<P>
   It also has switches or buttons marked A and B. Push the A
button and the signal passing through the cable service box and
then through the VCR reaches the television.
</P>
<P>
   In the A position, this set-up functions exactly like the
straight-line set-up described earlier: the signal from the cable
company goes into the cable box, and the cable box is used to
select a program. That program is sent along to the VCR and to the
television.
</P>
<P>
   Push the B button, however, and the television is getting the
original signal from the cable company with its dozens of programs
included.
</P>
<P>
   In the B position, you can use the tuner in the television to
select the program you'd like to see. Remember, though, that the
tuner on your cable-ready television will not be able to decipher
encoded premium channels.
</P>
<P>
   While you're using your television to select a program from the
B signal stream, you can use the tuner in the cable service box to
tune in a channel on the A signal stream. Since the VCR gets its
signal from the cable service box, you can record the program on
the A signal stream while watching something on the B signal stream
on the television.
</P>
<P>
   Most people using a two-way splitter put their VCR on the same
stream as the cable service box so they'll be able to record
premium channels and pay-per-view events.
</P>
<P>
   When you're finished recording, you can push the A button on the
A/B switch and turn your television back to channel 3. Now you're
ready to watch the recording you have just made or watch the
premium channels that only your cable service box can tune in.
</P>
<P>
   If you find all this too confusing, your cable company should be
willing and able to go over your options with you.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said TCI is starting to distribute a new type of cable
service box that has a built-in system that will allow customers to
watch one program and record another. He said customers interested
in the new box, called the DCT 2000, should call to inquire about
replacing their current boxes free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   While you're talking to your cable company about video hook-ups,
you should also ask about using RCA-style plugs in your home
theater set-up.
</P>
<P>
   The red, white and yellow coded plugs can link your cable box
directly to your stereo system and possibly improve your system's
sound performance.

 &HT;    Device sends TV sound to headphones
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A New York company is marketing a set of
headphones that promise not only high performance but marital bliss
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Unisar Inc. of New York City, the makers of the TV Listener
Infrared Cordless TV Headset System, have trademarked the slogan
``The Marriage Saver'' because they think the product can settle
disputes within families.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener allows one person to listen to television or
music without disturbing a sleeping partner, for instance. And it
lets a person with hearing problems listen at high volume up while
other people in the room listen at normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener comes in two parts. A transmitter sits on top of
the television and is connected to the set's audio output port. The
system comes with a selection of adapters to connect to differing
output ports, and It has a microphone attachment for sets without
an output port. The transmitter can also be attached to other sound
equipment such as a stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the system is a pair of headphones. The
headset weighs only a few ounces and has volume controls.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter sends a signal to the headset using infrared
light like a remote control. Unisar says the infrared system
delivers better stereo sound quality than radio transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The TV Listener, which won an innovation award at this year's
International Consumer Electronics Show, is not yet widely
available through retail stores. It sells for $59.99 by phone at
(800) 233-1196, or it can be ordered from the Unisar Web site at
unisar.com
</P>
<P>
   Also available on the Web site are Unisar devices that allow
expectant parents to listen to the sounds made by their unborn
children in the womb.

 &HT;    Fixes may be needed, but your PC won't self-destruct Jan. 1
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seldom do I return to a specific topic within a few weeks of
writing about it. After all, my beat _ technology _ is so broad
that it covers everything from Nintendo games to computers to HDTV
to ham radio. If it has batteries, computes or makes beeping sounds
from time to time, I have probably written about it.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail from a concerned (and intelligent) reader guides me
to return to the Year 2000 problem. Now, this is a subject that has
received enough ink to float a battleship. But there are still
smart people out there _ like the reader who sent me the e-mail _
who are mixed up about the impact of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Last week, I wrote a column that treated
the question of whether to replace an older PC. The reader's e-mail
said he was irritated because I had failed to mention the most
serious reason to replace an old PC. He said these older machines
are doomed to stop working in just a few months because of the Y2K
problem and need to be replaced now.
</P>
<P>
   That just isn't so. And there's no criticism of the reader in
that. The criticism is aimed at myself and at others who write
about computers. We just haven't done a good enough job when
intelligent people who read the newspaper still have that fear.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a PC, even an old one, the Year 2000 problem will
not magically turn the PC into a useless collection of chips,
capacitors and resistors. Unless you spill a Mountain Dew into the
PC, there will be no sizzling sound, no smoke, no strange wheezing
noise on Jan. 1, 2000. The hardware will survive.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible _ maybe even likely _ that an old PC and old
software for it will have some problems. For one thing, most
computer clock hardware, even on fairly recent machines, isn't
completely Y2K-compliant. For another, the BIOS chip (the chip that
keeps track of basic information such as the address and type of
your hard disk, the time and date, etc.) is almost certain to have
problems. And if your software is the same age as the computer,
some spreadsheet and money management programs are likely to have
problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these problems is likely to cripple your computer.
You may have to manually reset the date after Jan. 1, 2000 (and
with very old computers, you may have to buy a program that will
reset the date each time you turn on the computer). You may need to
replace some of the financial and spreadsheet software.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and I can tell you this without worrying that I am wrong,
since I always double- and triple-check my thinking on things like
this with real-world Y2K experts _ your PC will still be able to
process letters, play games, check e-mail, and _ with new software
_ balance your budget.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm saying is that your old computer may be out of date and
need replacing, but Y2K problems shouldn't be the reason. Because
here's the kicker: Even some new Pentium-class machines have clocks
and BIOS chips that won't properly handle the change in dates. The
good news, for owners of new and old machines, is that there are
resources to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things you can do. First, worry about your
software, especially software that uses dates. Check with the
manufacturer's Web site to see if there is an update to fix Y2K
problems. If not, replace the software.
</P>
<P>
   Second, worry about your operating system. Even Windows 95 and
Windows 98 are not totally compliant. Go to the Microsoft Web site
at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/ and find out which
updates you need. These updates are free for the downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Third, don't check to see if your PC clock or BIOS chip is
faulty by setting the date ahead on your computer. You'll read this
advice elsewhere, but don't follow it. You take a chance of making
a mess of the programs you have. Instead, go to this Web site
(http://www.nstl.com/html/nstly2k.html) and download the software
mentioned there. It'll check your clock and BIOS chip without
hurting anything.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even for clocks and BIOS chips that can't be replaced,
there are programs available commercially (Norton, the manufacturer
of the well-known utility programs makes one) that will manually
reset the time and date each time you turn the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   So don't give up. That old computer of yours will probably die
of natural causes before the Y2K problem kills it.

   GEEWAX-Y2K-COLUMN _ On many things Christians agree, but not on
how to view the impending arrival of a third millennium. (Geewax,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes still winces over the
slogan his opponent, Guy Milner, used in the last election: ``Roy
Barnes _ too liberal for Georgia.'' But it is precisely because
there's nothing liberal about Barnes' record or style that he's
been able to sell a progressive transportation initiative to a
Legislature that moves like molasses. (Ezzard, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN - JASPER, Texas _ There's no circus here in
what's being dubbed as the East Texas Trial of the Century. Hardly
anybody is milling around the square. Cops outnumber hangers-on
outside. Inside, the media seem to outnumber other spectators as
they cover the so-called dragging-death trial. (Borders,

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ Former CNN chief, and
one-time outdoor advertiser, Ted Turner seems to spend an awful lot
of time trying to pry his foot out of his mouth. On Tuesday, in an
address to the National Family Planning and Reproductive
Association in Washington, he tells a Polish joke in reference to
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he issues an apology to the Catholic League, an
anti-defamation group that didn't think he was very funny. And that
was last week. Wonder what he's up to this week. (Elizabeth

 &HT;    Tough sentencing laws face Florida legislators
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Education and tax cuts can wait _ Florida
legislators will open the 1999 session next week with their
toughest sentencing legislation since the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And it's backed by an unusual coalition of gun control advocates
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two ideas borrowed from California are expected to pass:
``10-20-Life'' and ``Three Strikes You're Out.'' They provide
mandatory sentences for certain offenses, such as 25 years to life
for injuring someone with a gun in the course of a crime, or life
in prison for committing a third, violent felony.
</P>
<P>
   The only no votes on Three Strikes in the House Corrections
Committee last week came from the two black members, who complained
that the law would disproportionately hurt black men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have the goal of filling all the prison beds that we
have?'' asked Rep. Frederica Wilson, a freshman Democrat from
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Answered sponsor Rep. Victor Crist, R-Temple Terrace, ``It's a
crime when we have beds available to have violent criminals on the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In fine print, legislative staff research warns it is impossible
to prove that mandatory sentences deter crime, and adds that the
cost of keeping more people in prison longer _ modest for the first
few years _ could mushroom later.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is likely to knock 10-20-Life out of a chance to be
the first legislation to pass this session and land on the desk of
Gov. Jeb Bush. There is no doubt Bush will sign _ he made it a
prominent part of his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-20-Life plan requires a minimum sentence of 10 years if a
criminal commits a crime with a gun in his possession, 20 years if
he uses it, and 25 to life if he injures someone with it. Current
law requires a three-year minimum sentence, or eight years for an
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In committee meetings, there has been little opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some members have questions, but nobody wants to be
labeled soft on crime,'' said Senate Democratic leader Buddy Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates agree. ``This 10-20-life is really a tough
punishment and our organization always has been a proponent for
tough punishment,'' Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation for
Handgun Control told The Associated Press. The group is run by
Sarah Brady and her husband, Jim, who was seriously wounded in the
1981 assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate analysts estimate that it will cost $32 million
to $35 million by 2005 if the state prison system has to build new
beds for 10-20-Life, and another $8 million or so for Three
Strikes. Some 4,500 beds are open now. But no one is projecting
costs beyond a half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we need to think about is the long-term health-care
costs of keeping that many people that long,'' Dyer said. ``Is
someone still dangerous at 65? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally law-abiding gun owners might find themselves in for
long prison terms for relatively modest offenses because they had a
holstered gun with them for protection, some have suggested. Others
are concerned that mandatory sentences in general prevent judges
from exercising discretion and taking the circumstances of each
case into account.
</P>
<P>
   Crist cited dramatic reductions in crime in California as
evidence the laws have been effective there. He looked at Fresno,
home of the activist who championed both laws, Mike Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Assaults with firearms were down 38.6 percent in Fresno in the
year since 10-20-Life went into effect on Jan. 1, 1998. Gun murders
were down 43.2 percent, robberies 44.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a longer look makes clear such crimes have been falling for
several years. Gun assaults, for instance, actually dropped more in
the year before the law, 45 percent, than afterward, 38.6 percent.
Fresno police acknowledge other factors, such as the fact they put
more police on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The same logic could be used to say that because Florida's crime
rate is falling, not having 10-20-Life or Three Strikes must be the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is confident this bill will have a positive impact and will
be effective,'' said spokesman Cory Tilley.
</P>
<P>
   Crist said, ``When we get the word out to violent felons that
using a gun will put them in prison for at least a decade and maybe
a lifetime, our declining crime rates will drop even further.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Three-Strike Violent Felony Offender Act,'' which cleared
its second committee Wednesday in the Florida House, would force
judges to give stiff sentences to criminals committing their third
violent felony within five years of either committing their second
or getting out of prison from committing their second. Drug dealers
would also face minimum mandatory prison sentences again.
</P>
<P>
   Three Strikes is on a bit slower track, but 10-20-Life is the
first substantive legislation scheduled to reach the House floor
March 4, after a few revisions and housekeeping matters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a similar story in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to move early,'' said a spokeswoman for Senate
President Toni Jennings.
</P>

   COXNET-PTECH 0219 -- Back in the Dark Ages before home

are one of those people who have to count pennies, and who have to
make decisions between buying a new computer and going to New
Orleans on vacation, or paying the mortgage, then don't feel blue

NEW PAVING FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 28)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A specter is stalking world politics, as Karl Marx might have
manifested it _ the specter of the  &UR; third way &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``The  &UR; third way &LR;  is part of the politics of the center and
center left,'' said Tony Blair, the British prime minister, last
month. ``In Britain, it means New Labor.'' He defined his  &UR; third
way &LR;  as a place where ``economic dynamism and social justice can
live together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``European governments spend and tax heavily,'' noted Laura
D'Andrea Tyson, former chairman of the Clinton Council of Economic
Advisers, ``but the architects of the new Europe see them as a
human  &UR; third way &LR;  between old-style socialism and the supposed
divisive social consequences of the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her former boss saw the way more benignly. In Bill Clinton's
1992 campaign, he said, ``I thought we ought to have a  &UR; third
way &LR; ,'' and in his 1998 State of the Union declared, ``We have
found a  &UR; third way &LR; .'' Last month, he told the Economic Club of
Detroit: ``We are working with business to use technology, research
and market incentives to meet national goals. Some have called this
political philosophy `the  &UR; third way &LR; .'''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``some'' can also be found in Moscow. ``Former Deputy
Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov accused Moscow
Mayor and born-again centrist Yuri Luzhkov of `economic
illiteracy,''' wrote Harry Kopp of the Jamestown Foundation's
Monitor. ``Luzhkov, who recently returned from Tony Blair's
Britain, said Russia must choose `a  &UR; third way &LR;  between total
socialism and vulgar liberalism.'''
</P>
<P>
   Where there's a way, there's a will; in this case, Will
Marshall, head of Washington's Progressive Policy Institute, who
says that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton ``think a  &UR; third way &LR;  approach to
governing is his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, left and right take their pops at it. Liberals see
self-contradictions in such a ``slippery center.'' ``The  &UR; Third
Way &LR;  assumes a basic political symmetry,'' wrote Jonathan Chait in
The New Republic, ``an unreconstructed left, a radical right and a
 &UR; Third Way &LR;  nestled in between.'' But this is self-defeating:
``When the  &UR; Third Way &LR;  takes power, it alters that equation ((and))
no longer sits between the two poles of the political spectrum; it
 &UR; is &LR;  the left pole. The calculus has changed, and, in order to
retain the center, the  &UR; Third Way &LR;  must shift right again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Lamar Alexander, of the Campaign for a New
American Century (its onset is getting ever more likely), slams the
way from the right. ``The  &UR; third way &LR;  is no way,'' he claims.
``Supposedly, this is an alternative to free-market capitalism, on
the one hand, and socialism on the other. When you peel the layers
off this particular onion, however, what you get is `social
democracy' _ the ever-expanding, cradle-to-grave welfare-state
programs that hobble most European countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did the latest moniker for the middle of the road come
from? You can find the phrase in theology (between the second and
fourth ways of St. Thomas Aquinas) and among the ways of
phenomenology.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, the historian H.A.L. Fisher traced it to the French
emperor Napoleon III, who steered between internal revolution and
foreign war to choose a  &UR; third way &LR;  of liberalism. In the United
States, early centrists working toward a third party between
Federalists and Republicans were called Quiddists, from the Latin
 &UR; tertium quid &LR; , or ``third thing.''
</P>
<P>
   HOTSPUR!
</P>
<P>
   ``He must find a way out among moderate Republicans and
Democrats,'' the New York Times editorialist wrote of the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, ``even if Republican  &UR; hotspurs &LR; 
object.''
</P>
<P>
   Every dictionary worth its spurs notes that the word  &UR; hotspur &LR; 
was the sobriquet of Sir Henry Percy, son of the earl of
Northumberland, killed in 1403 in the rebellion against Henry IV.
(A  &UR; sobriquet &LR;  is a descriptive appellation, like Gov. Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura, which geezers will fondly recall followed, by two
generations, Marie ``the Body'' McDonald.)
</P>
<P>
   The earliest citation of  &UR; hotspur &LR;  was in a chronicle a
half-century later: ``Herry Percy the yonger, whom the Scottis
clepid Herry Hatspore.'' Shakespeare then used the word in his
``Henry IV'': ``A haire-brained Hotspurre, gouern'd by a Spleene.''
</P>
<P>
   Tangent time: those citations show us (1) that  &UR; Henry &LR;  led to
 &UR; Harry &LR;  by way of  &UR; Herry &LR; , or Herry was the progenitor of both, and
(2) that the Shakespearean spelling of  &UR; haire-brained &LR;  is a source
of the confusion about that word's meaning. It has nothing to do
with hair found on the scalp on top of the skull that encases the
brain. Rather, it is a  &UR; hare &LR; , or rabbit, which was thought to have
an especially small or weak brain. End of tangent.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the metaphoric basis of  &UR; hotspur &LR; ? Why not
 &UR; coldspur &LR;  or  &UR; hotsaddle &LR;  (as in the discomforting title of the Mel
Brooks movie ``Blazing Saddles'')? When an equestrian rides
impetuously or cruelly, spurring his horse constantly, the spurs
are seen to become hot from the friction _ if not literally, at
least figuratively. That's what harebrained Henry (not
haire-brained Herry) did, and why they clepid, or yclept, or named
him that. And that is also why profoundly literate editorialists
still use  &UR; hotspur &LR;  to mean ``a rash, impetuous, hard-driving
person.''

 &HT;    The buzz is about a movie far, far away
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next ``Star Wars'' movie will be released Memorial Day, and
the Web is already buzzing with rumors about the film. Read about
the latest rumors and where you can find them in the February issue
of Yahoo! Internet Life. There's gossip about who will play the
lead roles, about the story line and about other movies to come in
the ``Star War'' series.
</P>
<P>
   You got a hot new game for Christmas, but how the heck do you
master it? Pick up some tips on some popular new PC games in the
February issue of PC Gamer. You'll find advice on such games as
``Half-Life,'' ``Grim Fandango,'' ``Tomb Raider III,'' ``Blood
II,'' ``Railroad Tycoon II,'' ``Caesar III,'' ``Delta Force'' and
``Shogo.'' Concerning ``Railroad Tycoon II,'' for example, PC Gamer
shows you how to improve your stations by adding hotels, saloons
and roundhouses.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM: One of the world's greatest game developers, the
creator of such classics as ``Civilization'' and ``Railroad
Tycoon,'' has released his latest strategy game, ``Alpha Centuri.''
This game is very much like ``Civilization,'' except it is set in
space. The object of ``Alpha Centuri'' is to build a new
civilization on an alien planet. You discover new technologies,
build bases and conquer enemies. The game is available only for
Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   It has gone from deer to elephants _ and 3-D elephants, at that.
It, of course, is the computer game ``Deer Hunter.'' Now the latest
version, published by WizardWorks, is called ``African Safari
Trophy Hunter.'' The hunted include zebras, elephants and kudus.
The game is available only for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Online: The Web has quickly become an electronic library. You'll

 &HT;    PC advice for dazed parents
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who think the generation gap is marked in distance
with PCs, with the young on one side of the chasm and older folks
on the other, take a look at a book from Intel that hopes to bridge
that gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC Dads Guide to Becoming a Computer-Smart Parent,'' which
retails for $12.95, hopes to ``come to the rescue of parents
befuddled by computers.'' The authors, Mark Ivey and Ralph Bond,
are Oregonians, parents and senior managers at Intel. Ivey started
his career writing for newspapers in the late 1970s. Bond was
originally a part-time art history teacher. The pair geared the
book for technology lightweights, focusing on topics like how to
use a computer to help your child learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   Topics include Digital Parenting _ Five Easy Tips; Ten Things
You Can Do With Your Kids on a PC; Booting Up Baby; Eight Ways to
Make a Kid PC Kid-Friendly; Boys, Guns or Roses: What to do About
Game Addiction and Violent Software; Raising a Computer-Smart
Daughter; and Cybersafety.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check the PC Dads Web site,
http://www.intel.com
</P>
<P>
   /intel/educate/pcdads/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking the language
</P>
<P>
   If you have an upcoming trip to the land of the Zulu and you
want to brush up on the native tongue, there's a Web site to help.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.101language.com is a site for foreign language
programs. The products are not cheap. The Spanish-language program
runs $299. But like most e-commerce sites, the selection is
impressive. Language product topics range from Arabic to Zulu. The
site sells more than 100 products for languages including Swahili
and Igbo, plus books on international customs, foreign slang and
accents.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free help line lets prospective customers find out which
program is better-suited for their needs. 101language.com also
offers a five-part, no-interest payment plan. The company is based
in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Extra-strength search engine
</P>
<P>
   If the free search engines available on the Web aren't helping
you cut through the clutter, a California company has released a
$45 search engine that might.
</P>
<P>
   ImaginOn released WebZinger 6.0 this month. The Java-based
application works on Windows-based PCs. A version for the Macintosh
and Sun Solaris platforms is expected to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   The software program is available for purchase at two Web sites,
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .unboxed.com or http://
</P>
<P>
   webzinger.com.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind WebZinger is that database processing and
playback technology turns information: The result is a search
engine that searches, locates, evaluates, downloads, formats and
plays back search results in the form of a multimedia slide show
while you use other desktop applications. Elapsed time is about 30
minutes. At any time during the 30-minute presentation of search
results, the user can click on a Web site, get more information,
then click back and resume the presentation. If 30 minutes is too
long, there's a feature that creates a one-minute search results
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   A review in the Jan. 27 issue of PC World gave the product high
marks for the speed, efficiency and relevancy of its searches. A
free trial version is available for download at
http://www.imaginon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Estate planning program
</P>
<P>
   E-Z Legal, the company that mass-marketed do-it-yourself
lawyering, is offering a software version of its estate planning
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida company's Legacy program lets you arrange for the
distribution of your worldly possessions without getting a
$300-an-hour lawyer involved. The Windows-based CD-ROM comes with
instructions, information and the forms to write your own will,
living trust, durable power of attorney for health care and living
will. The product will be available this month for a suggested
retail of $29.95.

 &HT;    Virus worms its way into heart of Eudora
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As physicians are wont to tell us when we drag ourselves to the
infirmary suffering from something they can't diagnose, there's a
nasty bug going around.
</P>
<P>
   It got into my computer's sinus cavities numerous times in the
past week or two, and eventually caused me considerable grief.
</P>
<P>
   This particular infection arrives via the Internet in a program
called Happy99.exe. If you spend much time in cyberspace, you've
almost certainly heard about it even if you haven't contracted it.
It generally gets into your computer by way of an attachment to an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It is not technically a virus, but a worm. Most of us don't care
whether it's a virus or a worm or a garter snake; to non-technical
weenies it's basically a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically at least, it can't hurt you unless you execute it.
If you do execute it, it quietly insinuates itself amongst your
Internet programs and attaches itself to every message you send.
You don't know it's doing this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99 is not, apparently, destructive, but it has certainly
created a ruckus on some mailing lists to which I belong. Folks
kept passing it back and forth. Joe had no sooner got his system
free of the thing than Phil sent it to him. Joe got enraged with
Phil, who of course didn't know he had the thing in the first
place, let alone had passed it on. Joe didn't know he had gotten it
from Phil until he received an outraged message from Howard.
</P>
<P>
   My mail program, Eudora Pro, downloads attachments into a
specified directory automatically. It got to where I went to that
directory immediately after closing Eudora and looked for ol'
Happy. Sometimes I found two or three iterations of it. I simply
deleted them and went on my way. After a while, though, things got
more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   One evening Eudora was downloading a boatload of mail and I was
watching the process, slack-jawed and half asleep. I had barely
noticed it was downloading Happy when half my monitor went to black
and the rest to a gaudy pinstriped pattern and the entire machine
seized up like a rusty engine.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed, I rebooted, started up Windows Explorer and went to my
download directory to find Happy and delete it. The instant the
program scrolled into view, the machine seized up again. Rebooting
again, I tried the Quickfind feature. No sooner did it find
Happy99.exe than the machine froze.
</P>
<P>
   I've never heard of such a thing. After the next reboot, I
turned Norton Antivirus loose on it. When it found Happy99, it
singled the thing out as a virus, but could not repair it. It was
able to delete the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The agony was not over, however. It seems Eudora, having been
abruptly thwarted in its download, decided it hadn't downloaded
anything. It started from the top again, and when it got to that
infernal file, it seized up the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tech support at my ISP, MindSpring, could look into my mailbox,
but they couldn't tell which message had Happy attached to it.
Rather than dump the entire box full of mail, the tech rep steered
me to http://www.mailstart.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you provide this site your mail address and password, it will
go to your mailbox and present you with a list of your mail. It
doesn't download any of it, however, until told to do so. Thus I
was able to poke around and get whatever mail looked like it might
be of interest, and then dump the whole lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you slog around on the Internet and indulge in e-mail, you
might want to make a note of www
</P>
<P>
   .mailstart.com. In the meantime, I'm going to see about updating
Eudora.

 &HT;    PC advice for dazed parents
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who think the generation gap is marked in distance
with PCs, with the young on one side of the chasm and older folks
on the other, take a look at a book from Intel that hopes to bridge
that gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC Dads Guide to Becoming a Computer-Smart Parent,'' which
retails for $12.95, hopes to ``come to the rescue of parents
befuddled by computers.'' The authors, Mark Ivey and Ralph Bond,
are Oregonians, parents and senior managers at Intel. Ivey started
his career writing for newspapers in the late 1970s. Bond was
originally a part-time art history teacher. The pair geared the
book for technology lightweights, focusing on topics like how to
use a computer to help your child learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   Topics include Digital Parenting _ Five Easy Tips; Ten Things
You Can Do With Your Kids on a PC; Booting Up Baby; Eight Ways to
Make a Kid PC Kid-Friendly; Boys, Guns or Roses: What to do About
Game Addiction and Violent Software; Raising a Computer-Smart
Daughter; and Cybersafety.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, check the PC Dads Web site,
http://www.intel.com
</P>

   /intel/educate/pcdads/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking the language
</P>
<P>
   If you have an upcoming trip to the land of the Zulu and you
want to brush up on the native tongue, there's a Web site to help.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.101language.com is a site for foreign language
programs. The products are not cheap. The Spanish-language program
runs $299. But like most e-commerce sites, the selection is
impressive. Language product topics range from Arabic to Zulu. The
site sells more than 100 products for languages including Swahili
and Igbo, plus books on international customs, foreign slang and
accents.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free help line lets prospective customers find out which
program is better-suited for their needs. 101language.com also
offers a five-part, no-interest payment plan. The company is based
in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Extra-strength search engine
</P>
<P>
   If the free search engines available on the Web aren't helping
you cut through the clutter, a California company has released a
$45 search engine that might.
</P>
<P>
   ImaginOn released WebZinger 6.0 this month. The Java-based
application works on Windows-based PCs. A version for the Macintosh
and Sun Solaris platforms is expected to be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   The software program is available for purchase at two Web sites,
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .unboxed.com or http://
</P>
<P>
   webzinger.com.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind WebZinger is that database processing and
playback technology turns information: The result is a search
engine that searches, locates, evaluates, downloads, formats and
plays back search results in the form of a multimedia slide show
while you use other desktop applications. Elapsed time is about 30
minutes. At any time during the 30-minute presentation of search
results, the user can click on a Web site, get more information,
then click back anms and attaches itself to every message you send.
You don't know it's doing this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Happy99 is not, apparently, destructive, but it has certainly
created a ruckus on some mailing lists to which I belong. Folks
kept passing it back and forth. Joe had no sooner got his system
free of the thing than Phil sent it to him. Joe got enraged with
Phil, who of course didn't know he had the thing in the first
place, let alone had passed it on. Joe didn't know he had gotten it
from Phil until he received an outraged message from Howard.
</P>
<P>
   My mail program, Eudora Pro, downloads attachments into a
specified directory automatically. It got to where I went to that
directory immediately after closing Eudora and looked for ol'
Happy. Sometimes I found two or three iterations of it. I simply
deleted them and went on my way. After a while, though, things got
more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   One evening Eudora was downloading a boatload of mail and I was
watching the process, slack-jawed and half asleep. I had barely
noticed it was downloading Happy when half my monitor went to black
and the rest to a gaudy pinstriped pattern and the entire machine
seized up like a rusty engine.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed, I rebooted, started up Windows Explorer and went to my
download directory to find Happy and delete it. The instant the
program scrolled into view, the machine seized up again. Rebooting
again, I tried the Quickfind feature. No sooner did it find
Happy99.exe than the machine froze.
</P>
<P>
   I've never heard of such a thing. After the next reboot, I
turned Norton Antivirus loose on it. When it found Happy99, it
singled the thing out as a virus, but could not repair it. It was
able to delete the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The agony was not over, however. It seems Eudora, having been
abruptly thwarted in its download, decided it hadn't downloaded
anything. It started from the top again, and when it got to that
infernal file, it seized up the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tech support at my ISP, MindSpring, could look into my mailbox,
but they couldn't tell which message had Happy attached to it.
Rather than dump the entire box full of mail, the tech rep steered
me to http://www.mailstart.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you provide this site your mail address and password, it will
go to your mailbox and present you with a list of your mail. It
doesn't download any of it, however, until told to do so. Thus I
was able to poke around and get whatever mail looked like it might
be of interest, and then dump the whole lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   If you slog around on the Internet and indulge in e-mail, you
might want to make a note of www
</P>
<P>
   .mailstart.com. In the meantime, I'm going to see about updating
Eudora.

 &HT;    For silly info, try these sites
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wide Web is actually a useful place these days. If you
need demographic information from Des Moines, the average rainfall
for Medford, Ore., or a list of the books written by Winston
Churchill, you can find it with a few clicks of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you wanted useful, you would have purchased a vacuum
cleaner, not a computer and an all-you-can-eat subscription to an
Internet provider. The secret vice of most Internet users isn't the
X-rated Web sites or the online gambling casinos. What most Web
users crave is stupid, silly, useless information. If you are
looking for ways to fritter away your workday or sites that will
provide you with an excuse to avoid any sort of a normal family
life, you've come to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site that seeks the Tackiest Place in
America. You'll find this high-minded site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .thepoint.net/(tilde)usul/text
</P>
<P>
   /tacky.html. Once there, you can read reviews of some nominees,
including the United Equipment Co. office in Turlock, Calif. It has
a building shaped like a bulldozer, something you are unlikely to
see outside Turlock. Or perhaps you'll favor the sculpture of a
black widow spider, created in Nevada using a trashed VW bug and
cheesy yellow letters. Once you've met the contenders, maybe you'll
have a nominee of your own to make.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll move on to Lark and Mark's Virtual Jell-O, a
cyber-celebration of the quivering dessert. You'll find this site
at http://www.efn.org
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)larkw/jello.htm. A lot of serious time-wasters are here,
everything from a section of Jell-O poetry to a place where you can
vote on your favorite flavor (lime is the runaway choice, but you
have a chance to get in your vote for strawberry), plus a tacky
food department where you can learn to make several desserts
unlikely to find their way onto the pages of Gourmet magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you're looking for wild and exotic fun. You want something
that is interactive and challenges your creativity. In that case,
the obvious choice is the Build-a-Monster page at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.rahul.net/renoir
</P>
<P>
   /monster/monster.html. You'll be able to use your mouse and _ if
done right _ create something truly ugly and worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps you find that too intellectually challenging. What
you want is something really simple. Well, follow me to a page
buried way deep over at GeoCities (http://www.geocities
</P>
<P>
   .com/CollegePark/Field/1688
</P>
<P>
   /feedback.htm). Now, someone finally wants your opinion on
important issues such as your favorite color and other equally
weighty topics. Just select your answers from the menu and go along
your way knowing you took the time to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now we will amble over to http://www.amused.com
</P>
<P>
   /homepage.html, where you will find a page named in the spirit
of today's column: The Centre for the Easily Amused. Mostly this is
a page of links to other pages, including a Web camera where you'll
literally be able to watch paint peel (given you have a few days of
steady watching time to spend).
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of this page is the Drive-By. Select
that feature and you'll be transported automatically on a tour of
all the Web site's links. You select the amount of time you'd like
to spend at each page, then sit back for hands-free browsing. For
the lazy and bored, this is premium stuff. Enjoy.

 &HT;    New three-screen format makes MacInTax program easier to figure
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know it must be tax time when Intuit releases its latest
version of MacInTax.
</P>
<P>
   This year's update is a keeper. Intuit has made great strides in
improving MacInTax's ease of use. The program is both easier to
navigate and configure.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also more intuitive, anticipating questions
you'll be asked by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime users of MacInTax will notice a new look. The main
screen is divided into three panels. This look is a little
overwhelming at first, but once learned, functions well.
</P>
<P>
   The top panel is MacInTax's traditional one. It is here the
program questions you about your finances and tax status. The
answers are plugged into the appropriate tax forms, which are
viewable in a second panel below the first one.
</P>
<P>
   The forms are filled out in real time as you answer MacInTax's
questions. For example, type in the information from your W-2 form
in the top question panel, and the answers are automatically filled
into the right boxes in the IRS forms.
</P>
<P>
   The third panel runs along the left side of the screen and is
the way you navigate through the program. It works much the same
way as a similar panel in Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The third panel lists a series of bookmarks. Highlight and click
on one of them, and you'll jump to the corresponding place in both
the official forms and the interview panel.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it has been difficult to go backtrack in the
interview process. No longer. Intuit has finally made it easy to
change your answers, delete forms or add new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature is the amount of your refund, or lack
thereof, posted in the upper right corner of the interview panel.
The figure changes as you enter tax data, so you can see in real
time how you're faring.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, MacInTax will automatically review your return.
With this version, though, Intuit has improved the program's
ability to detect deductions you have missed.
</P>
<P>
   MacInTax, available in most computer stores, can also be found
online and in various Mac mail-order catalogs. It retails for about
$50 for the deluxe version, which includes a library of video clip
interviews with tax experts.

BOOK GROUPS ON USENET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the doomsayers? They talked, as the Internet was
spawning, of the end of the printed word: No more pencils, no more
books, we'll be online in our cyber-nooks. The last drop of ink
would be used to print the last page of the Donkey Kong manual.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not in this millennium. Not only are books one of the
hottest items of commerce in the Net, talking about books and
trading books is a hot topic in discussion groups. Just look at
some of the Usenet groups open to the world: alt.books,
alt.marketplace.books, alt.publish.books, misc.books,
rec.arts.books, alt.fiction, and rec.arts.books.hist-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   There are author fan clubs and groups where readers post reviews
of books. There are flea market groups for traders. One could
exhaust one's joy of reading by just reading about reading.
</P>
<P>
   And for readers, the groups are a joy. The first investors in
private computers for Net exploring were very literate people. They
established the etiquette (write anything ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS
and someone will tell you to stop shouting) and laid down a
foundation of wit and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   In the book groups, this wit is most apparent. Observe this
dialogue when someone posted a query in rec.arts.books recently:
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently was reminded of a book I read a fair while ago. I
remember what it was about but not who wrote it or what its title
was. Is there anything that anyone could suggest? Thanks for any
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't know the title or author or what the book was about? Ripe
for the challenge, a contributor posted: ``Might it have been
either The Ambassadors by Henry James or Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan?
If you wish, I can come up with some other titles ....''
</P>
<P>
   From another, undaunted: ``I think it must have been The Gods
Themselves by Isaac Asimov. I mean, it's perfect: when one person
forgets about a book it pops into someone else's head, ping! And
I've thought about this book several times since a fair while ago.
Numerous instances; why, people must be forgetting this book left
and right. Proof positive that my theory is spot on.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``It was either The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford,
Maigret et Son Mort by Georges Simenon, or the Iliad. What was it
about?''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``Judging by the incredibly precise information that you
have provided, the book you are referring to is Mme.Solange's Rien
de Tout, ou la Consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``No. It has to be If on a Winter's Night Three Farmers,
because I can never remember the title or author of that one
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the original supplicant posted, ``Thanks for all the
sarcastic answers. I was looking for something along the lines of
maybe a newsgroup dedicated to that sort of thing. It was a science
fiction novel about a world in which assassins were created which
had two bodies ....''
</P>
<P>
   ``The newsgroup to try is rec.arts.sf.written.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquirer went to search. Meanwhile rec.arts.books started a
thread on telephone solicitors who weren't even selling books.
Mike, one of the group regulars, had taken a late call from a
peddler who gave him chills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman, Jennifer, is someone she says who called Martha a
year ago as a telemarketer,'' Mike posted. ``Martha called her a
prostitute at that moment for engaging in telephone solicitation,
and she was calling Martha (a year later, and after we have just
moved) to inform Martha that she, Jennifer, had Martha's new
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy! Not all the drama is in books, is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling them prostitutes isn't going to make them or you feel
any better,'' another regular offered. ``I say 'I'm not interested,
thanks very much' and hang up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person chummily added, ``That, of course, is best. I
prefer to tell them `I'm sorry, you must have a wrong number. I
don't have a telephone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that would shorten the dinner interruptions, even if one
never gets the 40 percent off long distance to odd-numbered friends
or a credit card that rebates pecan fudge.
</P>
<P>
   But who is the vixen Jennifer, brandishing that razor-sharp
phone dialler, and how goes her vendetta? For the continuing saga,
tune in rec.arts.books, on an Internet service provider near you...

THE UNSINKABLE ELIZABETH TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Liz Taylor before her 1997 birthday party
and a black-and-white print of the actress in ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's one of the most famous women in the world, and on Feb. 27
she'll turn 67. She's lived virtually her whole life in the
spotlight, in a dog-eat-dog world where cynics abound.
 &HT;    Yet, her current boyfriend says, ``I'm amazed that for a person
who has been out there since she was 9 years old, she's so trusting
and naive _ in the best sense of the word.''
 &HT;    Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger is talking about his friend
Elizabeth Taylor, and he insists that _ despite her much-chronicled
trials and tribulations, her many husbands and consorts, her
numerous health crises, the acres of newsprint devoted to her
so-called scandals _ ``She has not become a hardened person.''
 &HT;    The couple have become close friends, dodging the paparazzi to
slip away for a quiet lunch each week.
 &HT;    Their relationship began, Steiger says, when he met her to
discuss a film script and was stunned to discover that, except for
AIDS fundraisers, she hadn't been out to lunch in two years.
 &HT;    Despite the gossip columns, however, the actor insists that he
and the much-wed Taylor are not contemplating marriage.
 &HT;    ``Some of the papers have played it up as heavy romance,'' he
says. ``I have a great deal of respect for her and her courage.
We've both had a lot of pain _ we are sympatico.''
 &HT;    So much so in fact that, in her late 60s, Taylor is going back
to work to star opposite Steiger in a modestly budgeted movie
entitled ``Somewhere,'' which Steiger will direct.
 &HT;    The actor calls it, ``a little picture about Dorothy later in
life, wanting to go back to Oz at the age of 60.''
 &HT;    At 67, Taylor is bouncing back from her most recent back
problems and minor sinus surgery. At last count she has had more
than 30 major surgeries.
 &HT;    ``Elizabeth uses hospitals the way other people use resorts,''
her second husband, Michael Wilding, once said _ and that was when
she was still in her 20s.
 &HT;    Today Taylor is looking well again. She stays actively involved
with her AIDS charity work, and continues her efforts to promote
her signature White Diamonds and Passion perfumes.
 &HT;    Her seesaw life continues to captivate the world. One week she's
fat, the next week she's thin. One week she's glamorous in diamonds
and designer duds, the next she's in an ambulance being rushed to a
hospital. One minute she's giving an impassioned speech about AIDS,
the next she's flashing her $4 million diamond ring as if she'd
never had a serious thought in her life.
 &HT;    Taylor has made her whole life a study in how not to mature.
When she hit 60 she invited her assorted pals to live it up with
her _ at Disneyland. At 65 she was thrown a huge, celebrity-studded
birthday bash which became a television special to benefit AIDS.
 &HT;    And still she's the center of the tabloid universe. Whether it's
her relationship with Steiger or her public display of concern
after her former husband, 47-year-old Larry Fortensky, fell down
the stairs at his home and sustained a brain injury.
 &HT;    But privately she mostly stays home in her $5 million Bel Air
mansion, meeting with producers and filmmakers who want to entice
her back to the big and small screen. And she enjoys visits from
her extended family, grandkids and all.
 &HT;    She has little left to prove, having already lived enough for
six lifetimes. She's won Oscars for ``Butterfield 8'' (1960) and
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' (1966) and made dozens of other
movies, some of them great, some not so great. She's made
headlines, some good and some embarrassing. She's dumped husbands
and lovers and given us a vicarious ride with her yachts, her
jewels, her kids and her animals.
 &HT;    And with all that, it's been hard for us to accept that the
gorgeous little 9-year-old who showed up on screen in ``National
Velvet'' (1944) is on the Medicare rolls.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Warner
Fortensky is no longer a box-office star. Yet she's a huge draw
when she makes personal appearances to peddle her perfumes or to
raise money to help lick the disease that killed her longtime
friend Rock Hudson.
 &HT;    The last film she starred in was the television movie ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'' (1989). The last time she worked on the big screen,
it was a mere cameo role in ``The Flintstones'' (1994).
 &HT;    Yet the world is apparently endlessly fascinated by this woman,
even if her main claim to fame these days is that she's more famous
for being famous than any other woman in the world.
 &HT;    She keeps bouncing back, more than earning her title of
Hollywood's Queen of Survival: There's not much she can't handle,
not even that curse of great beauties everywhere, aging.
 &HT;    ``I feel the same inside,'' she says. ``But, you know, that's
because I don't look in the mirror much. It depends on how I feel
in the morning on any given day. But I don't look back _ only
forward.''
 &HT;    She says she tries to think positively.
 &HT;    ``I don't live with regret in my life,'' Taylor says. ``I really
don't say, `Oh God, I wish I hadn't been under contract.' I don't
live to regret any of it. It's too late, anyway. I didn't realize
I'd go along for so long _ I'm like a bad penny, hard to get rid
of.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I don't watch my old movies,'' she adds. ``No way. I never
look at them, and if one comes on TV I switch off quickly. It makes
me very self-conscious.''
 &HT;    Perhaps in her late 60s, forgoing the grand passions that always
seemed to get her in so much trouble, she seems to be settling for
companionship. At least that's what Steiger thinks.
 &HT;    ``We're like a couple of old gunfighters _ Wild Bill Hickok and
Wyatt Earp,'' the actor says. ``We've both been through a lot of
crap. I believe talented people should help and protect each other.
Whenever we see each other we have a nice time, because we've both
been there _ and back.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Just say no _ or yes
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I may be slow on the uptake, but did I hear Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright correctly? She said, I think, that the United
States would not bomb the Serbs if both sides turned down a peace
agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The way I get it, we would like to bomb someone. For peace. OK
so far? If someone says yes, whoever says no gets bombed. If both
sides say no, nobody gets bombed. If both sides say yes, they can
go back to breaking agreements.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a Serb or a Kosovonian, I would figure the best thing
to do was to say yes, claiming I was all for peace, then let the
recalcitrant side get bombed. In a pinch, I might say no real quick
and hope the other side said no simultaneously. Then, just having
been unbombed by America, I would resume slaughtering civilians.
For peace.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is the cruelest art.

SATELLITE VIEWERS FACE LOSS OF SOME PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The truth may be out there, but ``The X-Files''
and other Fox shows won't be for long for some owners of satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   And ``JAG'' will be shot down, ``Diagnosis: Murder'' killed off
and other CBS shows blocked as the result of a court order with
nationwide ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are caught in the cross fire of a war between
satellite program providers and over-the-air broadcasters. The only
thing the two sides can agree on is that the viewers are caught in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are counting down the days to one of the biggest consumer
outcries we have seen in years,'' said Harry Thibedeau of the
National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, which represents
satellite companies.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Miami ruled late last year that consumers
with satellite dishes cannot receive distant network feeds from CBS
or Fox if they are in areas where they can get local affiliate
broadcasting either by cable or an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and ABC are not affected, but could be down the road if they
decide to take action.
</P>
<P>
   In order to legally receive such a distant feed a dish owner
must get approval from local affiliates in the form of a waiver.
Granting a waiver is based solely on the quality of reception in a
given home.
</P>
<P>
   How good a reception? Satellite providers said it should be
perfect, while broadcasters and the law say it should be close
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Satellite Home Viewers Act, which granted the right to
waivers in the first place, is set to expire at the end of this
year without congressional reauthorization and is being debated. A
House subcommittee on satellite television reform is scheduled to
meet this week.
</P>
<P>
   (Another vital issue to television viewers may or may not be
waged on Capitol Hill. On March 31, federal price controls on cable
television rates are set to expire. The controls, part of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, did not stop rate increases.)
</P>
<P>
   The satellite issue is a tricky, divisive topic. Satellite
providers say many consumers will be left with no service. These
viewers live in rural areas where cable is not available and ground
contours like hills and valleys limit if not block
over-the-air-transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (broadcasters) want to protect _ let's call it what it is
_ a local monopoly on network programming,'' Thibedeau said. ``Is
it wrong? No. But does it make good public policy? It comes down to
an issue of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairness is right, the broadcasters argue. They say that for
years the satellite companies were selling customers a product they
had no right to sell, arguing the affiliates are the only ones who
should able to do so unless consent is given.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite folks had a systematic business strategy of
signing up as many illegal customers as they possibly could,'' said
Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcasters. ``Once they were caught, they unleashed all these
consumers who were duped into buying this service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, `Let's break the law and after we get caught, let's
get the law changed.'''
</P>
<P>
   To the local affiliates, CBS is not any CBS, and Fox not just
any Fox. The local stations are arguing they pay for exclusivity
for local network rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they are watching Denver,'' said Doreen Wade,
general manager of CBS-affiliate WRGB in Albany. ``I want them to
watch WRGB.''
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates and their representatives said the very fate of
free, local television could be riding on the issue. If people can
pluck other markets down from satellite, fewer will watch local
feeds and local news, which will affect advertising and
community-based information, which will affect survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it is, these distant signals affect our
business,'' said Chris Sehring, general manager of WXXA, the Fox
station in Albany. ``Pretty soon the economics take their toll on
the local affiliate.''
</P>
<P>
   The shut-offs will come in two phases. Subscribers to services
after March 11, 1997, will be shut off on Sunday. Those who
received Fox and CBS before that are grandfathered until April 30.
More than 300,000 subscribers could be affected nationwide,
Thibedeau said.
</P>
<P>
   There could be common ground on the horizon, called
``local-to-local'' satellite broadcasting, where local signals are
beamed to a satellite and right back down to just that community.
The technology is coming. But it won't be here by Sunday.

AMID RUSSIA'S GRAY, A RAY OF OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID-FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The aroma of buttery blini filled the air. A band of
strapping lads in traditional garb displayed their prowess at
Russian-style wrestling. Gaily dressed maidens belted out merry
folk melodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eh, winter go away, take away our sadness,'' they sang as they
set fire to a hay-stuffed scarecrow, a symbol of winter's imminent
end.
</P>
<P>
   Czar Yuri beheld the scene before him, and it was good.
</P>
<P>
   This was ``Forgiveness Sunday,'' the last day of Maslenitsa, or
``Butter Week,'' a traditional Russian holiday to mark winter's
passing that dates back to pagan times. Like a Slavic Mardi Gras,
modern Maslenitsa allows Orthodox Christians to stock up on
calories before Lent, which starts here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This was also a chance for Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the omnipresent,
but usually unapproachable, scion of Moscow, to hang out with some
foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad idea. Luzhkov's transformation of
post-Communist Moscow into Russia's island of prosperity has given
him a fair chance to become the country's next president. But the
Western press, this paper included, frequently chides Luzhkov for
Moscow's shortcomings: apparent crony capitalism, rights violations
against minorities, a sense that the ``Moscow Miracle'' is actually
a Potemkin village that could soon crumble like the rest of the
Russian economy did last August.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Forgiveness Sunday, and for now, all was forgiven.
This was a chance to see Luzhkov's human side.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Yuri Mikhailovich, can you fight like that?'' one sleuth
inquired as the two watched the brawling youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've boxed a few rounds in my day,'' Luzhkov remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Well on the roly-poly side of burly, the mayor is a robust 61.
He demonstrated his skill as a horseman while the rest of us
munched on blini. He swims in ice water each winter. He is a
teetotaler, which meant that fruit juice replaced the vodka
Russians usually swill to wash down all those blini.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a country badly in need of dietary moderation, Russia could
do worse than Luzhkov's team. His foreign affairs adviser, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, is a fitness nut whose physique recalls another Yaz
in his prime. Luzhkov's spokesman, Sergei Tsoi, has slimmed down
noticeably, perhaps spurred on by his wife Anita, who lost 80
pounds so she could be a pop singer.
</P>
<P>
   For a country whose leaders tend to be distant, Luzhkov has a
certain populist touch. He took obvious pleasure in leading
Maslenitsa songs and dances, and refereeing a tug-of-war between
the reporters and the strapping lads. He heartily joined in the
eat-bliny-with-no-hands contest, then scrubbed a stain off a
reporter's coat with salt (``Russian dry-cleaning,'' Luzhkov
deadpanned.)
</P>
<P>
   For a country seeking direction after seven years of
post-Communist blight, Luzhkov offers a prescription of Russian
pride. His nationalism has a chauvinistic dark side that worries
Moscow's former Soviet dominions, especially when Luzhkov claims
parts of Ukraine for Russia or accuses Latvia of ``genocide''
against Russian-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian voters may be attracted by Luzhkov's upbeat style.
Other leading presidential candidates _ Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, former paratrooper Alexander Lebed, economist Grigory
Yavlinsky _ always seem to be grumbling about how bad things are.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patch of blue sky peeped out of Moscow's near-perpetual gray.
Those tireless lads _ God bless 'em _ were now playing
king-of-the-hill.
</P>
<P>
   One more dance, one more sleigh ride, and then it was back to
the motorcade and off to another event for Luzhkov. For the
reporters, back to work. Maybe some would later write scathing
profiles of Luzhkov's favorite company, AFK Sistema, a shadowy
oligarchy that reputedly controls city finances.
</P>
<P>
   But not on this day. For this was Forgiveness Sunday.

an audible slap.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get from point to point out here is by air. Or
foot. Or boat. Or, during most of the year, something with runners
on it.
</P>
<P>
   And it might be difficult for residents of the lower 48 to
appreciate the vastness of these distances. Overlay this same map
on the contiguous United States, and Ketchikan is at Jacksonville,
Fla., Point Barrow is just a few miles south of Fargo, N.D., and
the Aleutian chain runs into the Pacific Ocean, 170 miles west of
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic and meteorologic realities quickly conspire
against any tourist who wants to examine the native cultures of any
of Alaska's five main indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Bring the groups to the tourist.
</P>
<P>
   The consummation of this plan is the Alaska Native Heritage
Center, which will open in Anchorage _ the state's largest city _
on May 1. Eaton, born into the Aleut/Alutiiq culture 54 years ago
on Kodiak Island, will serve as its president, and he could barely
contain his enthusiasm for the project on a recent visit to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be a static museum. Rather, representatives of each
native group will gather in village environments to build kayaks,
make moccasins, prepare food, sing, dance _ all for the purpose of
familiarizing outsiders with their worlds. Imagine a rough hybrid
of Williamsburg, Va., and Hawaii's Polynesian Cultural Center, but
established several latitude lines to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Alaska the last frontier,'' Eaton said, ``and, in that
regard, you can extend that assumption and say the indigenous
people there are on the frontier also. So if the visitor were
actually to go into the village, it would be like entering a
village in the frontier back at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska is unique in the American Indian experience because
there was no Indian removal here. These people are still residing
in our original villages, so the context of the culture is unique
to America. What we're endeavoring to do with the center is bring
you closer to that original baseline culture and share some of the
real beauty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, a nonprofit educational enterprise with
representatives of all five native regions on its board, will be
housed on a 26-acre site on the northeastern edge of the city.
Tourists will first enter the Welcome House, a 26,000-square-foot
structure containing interpretative displays, a theater and an area
for dance performances and storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this building will be a small lake, surrounded by
re-creations of villages. A walking path, which will be
wheelchair-accessible, will connect them.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to survey working environments for all
five major cultures: Athabascan from central Alaska; Yup'ik/Cup'ik
from the west; Inupiaq/St. Lawrence Island Yupik from the north;
Aleut/Alutiiq from the Aleutian Island chain in the southwest; and
the Eyak, Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian peoples from the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to present ourselves as a live, living, functional
culture,'' said Eaton, an Anchorage banker who has been active in
native affairs throughout his career. He cited several examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A woman making moccasins won't be behind glass. You're going
to walk in and have a conversation with her. She'll tell you about
the deer hide, where she gets it today, where she got it yesterday,
where her mother got it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You might see how different cultures treat salmon. In
August, we will be splitting fish and drying fish, and different
cultures have different ways of doing it. We might even ask you to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You might see some elders teaching some youth on
kayak-building. You don't just get to see it made, you get to see
the sharing and how it comes down traditionally between the
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton added: ``We want you to know that we still make these
things. This is not a dead culture in which you're going to handle
artifacts from many years ago. And the goal of the center is to
celebrate and to perpetuate and to share the traditions. We want
you to see us the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For some visitors, some of those details might be shocking, even
troubling, but that will be part of the educational process, too.
Native Alaskans hunt whales, seals and sea otters for food and
other products. It's an integral part of a cycle of sustenance that
has been in place for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who admitted that the seal and sea otter harvests, for
example, are conducted ``out of sight,'' was asked if some
urbanites would be horrified by the practice. ``Totally,'' he said,
``and that's a real dilemma. And that's real important for the
center to educate (outsiders). There is no shortage of seals, and
we don't go around clubbing the babies the way the Canadians do.
And we don't just harvest them for the hides. And it's not in any
danger at all. But because of perception, it makes it very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Native Heritage Center will seek to convey these
messages, among many others. These native people, according to
center officials, are under tremendous pressure from policies made
thousands of miles away in Washington, D.C. When a duck-hunting
season is defined, and bag limits are set, what specific impact
does that have on an Inupiaq village along the Colville River in
northern Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   This might provide a prime opportunity to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to go to the Amazon rain forest to find
indigenous people who are threatened in their environment,'' Eaton
said. ``It's right here in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is being launched in part as a response to surveys
conducted by Alaska tourism officials. Visitors, it was learned,
have a profound curiosity about native life in this largely
untracked wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Morris, of the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau,
said, ``When visitors come to Alaska, they're looking for scenery,
wildlife and native culture. You can usually guarantee the first
two, but people just don't have the time or energy or wherewithal
to get out to the different villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Another anticipated benefit of the center will be to provide an
environment in which the native groups themselves can interact and
share experiences. Those vast distances and forbidding conditions
have prevented them from having significant contact, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary function is tourism. The entrance fee will be
$20 for adults and $15 for children under 12, and center officials
have wisely worked with cruise lines to set up shore excursions for
passengers. One agreement is already in place with Princess, and
final details of another are being worked out with Holland America.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how outsiders get there, the center's leaders are
seeking to make the experience a profound one.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ From an office set in a woodland sanctuary,
former governor Hugh Gregg relentlessly protects New Hampshire's
first-primary status, using books, newsletters and phone calls to
take on anyone who would change the Granite State's powerful role
in picking presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gregg steps outside his home in this increasingly
crowded border town, he faces a landscape overcome by change. He
often does not recognize anyone, and when he looks at the political
shape of the state, he barely recognizes that, either. Last week
Gregg, a Republican, received the most surprising news of all: that
the GOP-controlled House had kept alive a proposal for a 4 percent
income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new millennium,'' Gregg, 81, said, shaking his head.
``In the last millennium, a broad-based tax was considered death.''
</P>
<P>
   While enactment of the tax is by no means certain, the House's
action underscored political, economic and cultural change in New
Hampshire, forcing presidential candidates to reconsider their
campaign focus for the primary that, if past years are a guide,
would be held one year from Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, with a Democratic woman as governor, a Democratic
state Senate and one of the nation's lowest poverty rates, is a
different place today than it was 10 and especially 20 years ago.
Migrants outnumber natives and, in many ways, are reshaping the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Independents, for the first time, are on the verge of
outnumbering Republicans. For a state that was mired in recession
in the early 1990s, New Hampshire may be at its economic high-water
mark, with a 2.9 percent unemployment rate and the nation's highest
percentage of high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   By national standards, New Hampshire has a tiny minority
population and a wide income disparity. But after years of being
criticized for being so atypical, yet wielding so much power in the
presidential candidate selection process, New Hampshire has become
more urbanized and more like the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates have been quick to notice many of these
changes and have re-engineered their campaigns accordingly. When
Vice President Al Gore campaigned here earlier this month, he gave
a lengthy speech about the importance of ``livability'' and the
dangers of suburban sprawl and shopping malls, a speech he could
have delivered in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aide Chris Lehane said the vice president recognizes that
many potential supporters ``are folks who got stuck on Route 128''
outside Boston ``and are now concerned that will happen in New
Hampshire. They feel, `God help us if that happens here.' There is
a huge wave.''
</P>
<P>
   To lifelong residents such as Gregg, the wave can be daunting.
``New Hampshire used to be a state where you knew everybody, a
small homogeneous place,'' Gregg said. ``Now the new immigrants in
the southern tier, they don't give a hoot about the north country,
they spend time flying around the world on this `cyberstuff' and
they have an entirely different philosophy, and they don't
participate in state affairs as much.''
</P>
<P>
   But to newcomers such as Kurt Mueffelmann, that ``cyberstuff''
is the state's future.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Mueffelmann, a Boston businessman, bought
a software company in Manchester, thinking he might move the
110-employee RealWorld Corp. to Massachusetts. ``New Hampshire
seemed like a sleepy town to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But within weeks, Mueffelman became so enamored of the state and
its lower costs that he took the opposite tack, moving his family
to the Granite State. At his company, located in a renovated mill
by the Merrimack River, salaries are 30 to 50 percent lower than in
Massachusetts, and rent is cheaper by half, he said. New
Hampshire's lovely lakes, the spell of the seasons and the nearby
White Mountains are an incalculable bonus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the days when the economy could be summed up in three
words _ forestry, shoes and textiles _ are but a memory. Now, of
every 1,000 residents in the state, 84 are high-tech workers, the
highest percentage in the nation, according to the American
Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mueffelmann, who rarely thought about presidential politics
until just before an election, has surprised himself by becoming
caught up in the state's first-primary politics, paying attention
to the words of former Vice President Dan Quayle, watching a
television biography of Senator John McCain of Arizona and
attending a dinner featuring Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a feeling, of `Wow, I can really go out and make an
impact,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mueffelmann is one of thousands of people, many from
Massachusetts, who have transformed the state. Planning officials
estimate that 60 percent of the residents are not natives, up from
50 percent in 1980. But as people arrive, problems follow,
including traffic, crime and overcrowding. That, in turn, has
unsettled the state's political dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this change more evident than in Nashua. The bustling
city made headlines in 1997 when Money magazine named it America's
best place to live. But local officials, while proud of the
dizzying success, tell cautionary tales about the city's doubling
in size to 83,000 since 1960. The owner of an average $150,000 home
pays $4,200 per year in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But even such high property taxes have not been enough to pay
for the education of the city's growing school-age population. The
city's public high school needs a renovation and expansion that
could cost $70 million. Even with state contributions, that could
add another $400 in taxes to every homeowner's tax bill, according
to David Fredette, president of the board of aldermen.

CLINTON AND SIMPSON CASES HIGHLIGHT DEEP DIVISIONS IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that President Clinton's impeachment trial is
quickly fading from daily consciousness, we can begin to see its
place in history. And, oddly enough, that place is right beside _
and inescapably linked to _ that other trial that dominated our
attention in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The trials of Bill Clinton and O. J. Simpson could not, at first
blush, appear more different: a president accused of high crimes
and misdemeanors for covering up an affair with a former intern vs.
a former football star charged with brutally murdering his former
wife and an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   But the extraordinary way these two high-profile events unfolded
and resonated in America's voyeurististic culture leave them with
much in common.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and O. J. Simpson were both found not gulity
of criminal acts that a majority of Americans believe they
committed. Both trials fed the public's appetite for 24-hour cable
news, and stoked its fascination with celebrities as defendants.
And both trials illuminated the nation's racial divide _ with
blacks backing the defendant in disproportionate number, although
for different reasons in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these two trials highlighted deep ideolgical divisions
present in the nation on the eve of a new millennium. They also
underscored the notion of public trials as sporting events, with
winners and losers, especially when race is a subtext.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a president who began his second term promising to
heal society's breaches, the analogies must seem ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that second term began with his State of the Union
address competing on the split-screen with the verdict in the
Simpson civil trial. `The parallels are there, and one leads right
into the next,'' said Gary Weaver, a specialist in American
culture, political amusement, and human behavior at American
University. ``Both O. J. and Clinton have been demonized _ not only
demonized, but dehumanized.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, just hours after Friday's Senate vote to
acquit Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice charges,
presidential spokesman Joseph Lockhart was forced to confront the
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the acquitted president would golf with the
acquitted former football player, considering the two men's
fondness for the sport, he said, ``Mmmmm, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a faint acknowledgment of the dilemma, Lockhart said,
``It's something that's hard, when the public believes that you
have done something that you don't believe you have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeals of both men polarized the nation, and sparked heated
exchanges not only about their guilt or innocence, but about the
appropriate punishment for their alleged crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The analogies also held away from the trial. Time magazine took
the unusual step of darkening Simpson's face, The New York Times
magazine made Clinton's face fuzzy. During the cable networks'
nonstop impeachment trial coverage, the lawyers we had come to know
in the Simpson case popped on the screen as the legal pundits in
the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor and author of a
book on the Washington media titled ``The Feeding Frenzy,'' said
that aside from the view of most blacks and whites that Clinton
should not be removed from office, the racial dimension of both
trials was strong.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of whites in public opinion polls said Simpson was
guilty and should go to prison, while a majority of blacks
disagreed. Blacks overwhelmingly approved of Clinton during his
trial, while his numbers were much shakier among whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both had an unshakeable base in the black community that
got them through the toughest time,'' Sabato said of Simpson and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks backed Clinton because, in short, of who his opponents
were. ``As a cultural figure, Clinton represents those things that
this movement of radical conservatism has wanted to overthrow,''
said Ronald Walters, a political scientist at the University of
Maryland, who is writing a book on what he loosely calls ``white
nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Simpson trial ``did not manufacture polarization
around race or racism, but provided us with an opportunity to see
it as a very fractured movement in American history,'' Walters said
the Clinton trial exposed the political fissures in the largely
party line vote to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them are symbolic forces,'' Walters said. ``O. J. was
very much symbolic of the racial problem in America, in a
relatively narrow sense. Clinton is representative of the larger
cultural crisis that we face surrounding liberalism and
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Simpson, the problems for Clinton may not be over, despite
his acquittal by the Senate, said Berry, the civil rights
commission chairwoman. She noted that independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr must decide whether to indict the president, which could
come either before or after he leaves office, just as Simpson was
found liable in a civil trial after his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   And like Simpson, Berry said, Clinton may have to overcome the
burden of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents can ususally do anything they feel like doing once
they leave office,'' she said. But, in Clinton's case, some might
say, ```Well, he doesn't have the moral authority to do X, Y, and
X.'''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Those who feel he should have been convicted and
kicked out of office will forever feel he's tainted by this
process, like damaged goods. And damaged goods don't market as well
as undamaged goods.'' Anyone who doubts that can ask Simpson.

POLITICAL SCIENCE AS A FUN THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ His short-range view evokes the zoo. His
long-range understanding of American government is rich, deep, and
tinged with a teasing attitude toward his own profession. Nelson W.
Polsby can make fun of political science because he works so hard
at it.
</P>
<P>
   He perceives, and documents, larger trends in American politics
that poll-driven pontificators miss. About post-impeachment
politics, ``the word you hear is `disarray,' '' which makes the
director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University
of California wonder: ``What's `array' for an American political
party?''
</P>
<P>
   When H. L. Mencken was asked why politics fascinated him, he
replied, ``Why do people go to zoos?'' a question echoing in
Polsby's conversation about today's role reversal in American
politics. ``Here's the culture shock that you and I are
suffering,'' he says. ``We have become accustomed to plodding,
purposeful Republicans and crazy, weird, self-destructive
Democrats. However, the virus seems to have leapt from the
chimpanzees to the baboons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Newt Gingrich ``revolution'' is still stuck in reverse
because of ``a pattern of continuity. First, getting Jim Wright,
then making another scandal, the House bank, out of nothing, then
closing down the government and trying to impeach the president.
It's all negative strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists often argue that parties should be
``responsible,'' that is, coherent and confrontational. Polsby
remembers when the cozy bipartisanship that once ruled Congress
vanished in a post-impeachment uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Polsby delivered several lectures at Oxford in the last academic
season, explaining how dozens of eager new Democrats rode
post-Watergate fever in 1974, arriving with disdain for Republicans
and a demand for more power in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the pressures of the Democratic caucus bore down on
committee chairmen, many of them felt the need to spend far more
time and energy seeing to the preferences of more junior Democrats,
and less on being solicitous of Republicans, no matter how senior,
knowledgeable, and willing to work. Party responsibility, beloved
of so many political scientists, reared its ugly head. It became
seriously no fun for Republicans to come to work, to find
Democratic thumbs in their eye day in and day out, and nobody
interested in their substantive ideas,'' Polsby told the Oxford
dons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports started coming out of Washington about a new spirit of
ugliness on Capitol Hill, about unprecedented levels of partisan
rancor, and so on. If you adhere to the belief that precedents only
last as long as the memory of the oldest journalist in town not
afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, this was, more or less, true.''
</P>
<P>
   Polsby recalled an earlier era in his lecture, comparing
Gingrich to the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin: ``The
atmosphere in Washington in those days, in the early 1950s, was
plenty acrid, and a fair amount of it was caused by fallout from
the willingness of respectable Republicans to go along with an
adventurer in their midst who might just throw a bomb that would
jar loose the Democratic hold on the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Polsby's lecture is footnoted with the best of political
science, that is, stuff sitting unexplored in the US Statistical
Abstract: how air-conditioning helped change the South from mostly
rural in the 1930s to less rural than the rest of the nation today
(1.3 percent rural to 1.7 elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   His first Oxford lecture in 1997 foresaw the fall of Gingrich,
``trying fitfully to make his way closer to the ideological
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Newt didn't get there. In the post-Gingrich era, will
Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   ``When are the Republicans going to find it worth their while to
come back to a get-along, go-along strategy?,'' Polsby asks. ``That
will require some bribery by the Democrats, who I suppose will not
be inclined to do it. We may be stuck in this mode a while
longer.''

`BE COOL' FALLS SHORT OF LEONARD'S OTHER MYSTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you turn out three dozen books over a writing career that
criss-crosses between Westerns and mysteries, some are going to be
brilliant, some just so-so, some no good at all. ``Be Cool,''
Elmore Leonard's latest, is just so-so.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, author of ``Hombre,'' ``Get Shorty'' and half a dozen
other books that were made into films, has been served well by
Hollywood, with stars like Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Charles
Bronson and John Travolta taking their turns at the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be Cool'' (Delacorte Press. New York. $24.95. 292 pages), a
spinoff of ``Get Shorty'' that changes the venue from the movie to
the record business, has all the earmarks of another Hollywood
project. But it'll take some major rewriting to make it to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard brings back Chili Palmer from ``Get Shorty'' and starts
things off with a gangland shooting at a Beverly Boulevard sidewalk
cafe in the first chapter. The first half of the book goes quickly
because Leonard hasn't lost his touch for everyday conversation _
he has a great ear for the sound of American prattle _ and no one's
better at describing what the eye sees as a scene unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Be Cool'' reads more like a piece of patio writing than a
serious attempt to break into the Hollywood ranks. Characters that
start out funny or tender end up serious and self-centered while
whole scenes seem to scream, ``Short attention span!''
</P>
<P>
   Chili Palmer, witness to a sloppy sidewalk shooting, sees the
killing as the opening for a new film (coming on top of ``Get Leo''
and its sad sequel, ``Get Lost''). He figures he'll center the new
picture on the story of Linda Moon, a true singing talent wasting
away in a Spice Girls sound-alike group. ``Be Cool'' follows
Palmer's attempts to crack into the recording business, which he
knows nothing about, while keeping the movie idea alive.
</P>
<P>
   The usual Leonard suspects are there _ truly stupid crooks,
truly smart women and a gangland subculture that is both gruesome
and funny. There's a black pimp fond of cowboy boots, his gay
Samoan-black bodyguard, a motormouth promo hack _ a part Palmer
already sees as being played by Steve Buscemi _ and more beautiful
women, young and middle-aged, than 292 pages can hold.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a connect-the-dots feel to the whole business. The
killings come equally spaced, reminders to the reader that ``Be
Cool'' is supposed to be a gangland-suspense novel. The love
stories are the kind that appeal to graying men who see themselves
as attractive to women half their age, and the recording industry
angle is a curiosity, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on Stephen Davis of Aerosmith and his book ``Walk This
Way,'' as well as friends from the recording industry, Leonard
barely scratches the surface of the business, not having near as
much fun with it as he could have.
</P>
<P>
   But even when he's sleepwalking through a novel, Leonard can
still pull it off. The scene between pimp-cowboy Raji and Italian
hit man Joe Loop in Canter's deli is good stuff, and so is Palmer's
ongoing banter with Derek, lead singer for Roadkill. Too often,
though, Leonard loses touch with his characters and, in the case of
Palmer, that's deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard wants Palmer to come off as a tough guy, but the deeper
you get into the book the more he sounds like a jerk. And the more
Palmer pretends to be tough, the worse ``Be Cool'' gets.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Palmer double-crosses Moon, tarting up one of her
songs with studio backwash without letting her know, there's no
reason left to like him. There's not much reason to like Moon, for
that matter, or any of the other people who have made it this far.
</P>
<P>
   In the end ``Be Cool'' comes out worse than ``Hombre,'' better
than ``Maximum Bob,'' worse than ``Get Shorty,'' better than ``Mr.
Majestyk.'' Just so-so.

WILL OSCAR CHOOSE LOVE OR WAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of us the Oscar race for best picture was over last
July. Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' was the heavy
favorite then, and remains the heavy favorite now. And should be.
It's a tremendous feat of filmmaking, quite apart from its
instantly legendary opening Normandy Beach D-day landing scene.
It's a film that challenges itself to stir deep feelings, and does.
One has only to compare it to another best picture nominee,
Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line,'' to realize to what extent
the GIs in ``Private Ryan'' grab us and to what extent the GIs in
``Thin Red Line'' mostly seem part of the tremendous cinematography
to which all else is subordinated in Malick's films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the perfect Oscar winner. It's a big
film about a big event executed in a big way. It's the kind of film
that Hollywood uses to present itself to the world as a class act.
Not even Hollywood's reluctance to bestow upon Spielberg the kind
of honor commensurate withhis unparalleled financial success should
stand in his way this year. He and ``Saving Private Ryan'' should
get the best director and best picture statues simply because they
deserve them. If there's to be an upset, however, I wouldn't want
it to be anything but ``Shakespeare in Love.'' It's less about the
love of Shakespeare the young writer for the unattainable woman who
was to become his Juliet than about the giddy love of everyone
connected with it, and, by extension, all of us, for theater
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nonstop delight that simply never touches ground. I can't
think of a happier ending for it than the news that Judi Dench has
acquired the movie's historically accurate Rose Theatre. It won't
be used for firewood, but for staging plays and training actors to
inhabit the kind of space for which Shakespeare wrote. Not for
nothing is Dench a dame with a capital D. She also will, I think,
figure in one of the other races in which ``Shakespeare in Love''
will prevail. So let me race ahead of the neat categorizing that
usually accompanies these Oscar speculations and start by saying
that I can't see the original screenplay going anywhere but to Marc
Norman and Tom Stoppard for their brilliant script for
``Shakespeare in Love.'' The only sad aspect of this race is that
Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser's wonderfully audacious script for
``Bulworth,'' which I also loved, will go home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're scrambling the usual order of categories, and
putting writing this high up _ and why not in a year of
Shakespeare? _ I happily scramble out on a limb and declare for
Scott Smith's ``A Simple Plan'' for best adapted screenplay. Smith
wrote the novel, too, which accounts in large part for the way this
beautifully crafted film is able to preserve the integrity of its
characters. Scott Frank's script for ``Out of Sight'' is
sophisticated and dense while always seeming playful, no small
feat. But the surprising depths of feeling in ``A Simple Plan''
start with Smith's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to best supporting actor. There isn't a
performance here that's less than excellent. If the Oscar were
given for sheer acting power alone, Robert Duvall would get it
hands down for his perfectly modulated old shrewdie in ``A Civil
Action.'' If this is one of those years where career achievement is
the decider, I would have no trouble watching James Coburn take it
home. His performance as a brutal old alcoholic abuser of a father
in ``Affliction'' is so primal it's scary. But the best supporting
actor category just as often is the place where Hollywood likes to
show it's receptive to new blood and new faces. Billy Bob Thornton
isn't that young or that new, but the academy has never given him
an acting award, and the fact that his slob who turns out to have
more soul than anyone else in ``A Simple Plan'' will tip the
balance in his favor, since his is the most vivid and sympathetic
character of the five contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason I lean toward Billy Bob Thornton is that Tom
Hanks will beat the odds and take home his third Oscar for his
heartbreakingly decent American Everyman in ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' It's a role so perfectly aligned with Hanks's own persona
that I predict he'll get the nod, despite what might be the
reluctance of many academy voters to seem lazy by picking him
again. If I were a voter (I'm not), I'd give it to Nick Nolte for
the role of his career as a cop struggling to grow past his
upbringing and the patterns of male violence in his family in
``Affliction.'' But everyone has seen ``Saving Private Ryan,'' and
I'm not sure everyone has seen or will see the much smaller,
bleaker, more uncompromising ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as I was disapoointed to see Jim Carrey passed over, I
was pleased to see the gifted Edward Norton recognized for his
neo-Nazi who sees the light in ``American History X.'' Norton will
get an Oscar, but not this year, when his nomination will be his
reward. Similarly, Ian McKellen is brilliant as British horror
movie director James Whale in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but the banal
psychodrama that composes _ and compromises _ too much of the film
will work against him. The rapturously received Roberto Begnini,
the Italian Charlie Chaplin, seems destined to content himself with
the best foreign film Oscar for his high-impact ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' While he enjoyed the rare distinction of seeing his
film nominated for best picture as well as best foreign picture, he
doesn't have a chance in the former category. I wish the slot had
recognized ``The Truman Show,'' one of the best jobs Hollywood has
ever done of making controlled wholesomeness seem creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the actress categories brings us back to
``Shakespeare in Love.'' I think Cate Blanchett is going to emerge
as one of the foremost actresses of the next century. Certainly
she's enormously impressive as ``Elizabeth.'' But I don't think
this will be her year. Emily Watson already is one of the most
impressive members of the younger generation, but ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' in which she's so compelling, is, like ``Elizabeth,'' a
film without mass distribution. While Meryl Streep was flawless as
a gallant mom dying of cancer in ``One True Thing,'' her film came
and went. Fine as Fernanda Montenegro is in ``Central Station,''
the limited circulation of her foreign-language film from Brazil
will cost it. My choice here is the obvious one, Gwyneth Paltrow's
radiant embodiment of ardent romantic yearning, as much in love
with theater as with Shakespeare in the universally and deservedly
beloved ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   I think the ``Shakepeare in Love'' wave will bring Dench the
best supporting actress Oscar. She doesn't have much screen time,
but she projects enormous zest as old Queen Bess, playing goddess
and enjoying every minute of it, contributing more than her share
of the high spirits that are sweeping ``Shakespeare in Love'' into
crossover popularity. There's something to be said for Kathy Bates
(``Primary Colors''), Brenda Blethyn (``Little Voice''), Lynn
Redgrave (``Gods and Monsters'') and Blanchett's Australian
compatriot, Rachel Griffiths (``Hilary and Jackie''). Joan Allen,
who would get my vote if she had been nominated, as she should have
been for her '50s mom afraid of change yet excited by it in
``Pleasantville,'' also deserves acclaim. But ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ and its women _ are, I think,
going to be the big winners this year. But that's me.

NEW HAT IN DERBY RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tired of trainer Bob Baffert winning the Kentucky Derby? Had
enough of D. Wayne Lukas? Want something new in the Derby picture?
Then try this: The Godolphin Stable, owned by Sheik Maktoum al
Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, is going to take a big run at the May
1 Derby, and the wealthy outfit is going to do it in a way never
before attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin nominated eight horses to America's greatest race _
Aljabr, Always Believe, Breathtaking View, Chermes, Comeonmom,
Festive Bid, Prado's Landing, and Worldly Manner. Worldly Manner,
who used to be trained by Baffert and won the Del Mar Futurity
before Godolphin purchased him privately, is considered an
outstanding prospect. Comeonmom, who won the Remsen at Aqueduct
before being bought, also is promising.
</P>
<P>
   Making the situation even more intriguing, Godolphin racing
manager Simon Crisford intends to take a novel approach and will
not race any of the Godolphin nominees in the traditional Derby
preps held in the United States. Instead, they will run against
each other in at least two trial races at Nad al Sheba Race Course
in Dubai. Crisford will decide which of the sheik's horses will be
entered in the Derby based on those contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the Kentucky Derby project very seriously,''
said Crisford. ``Obviously, this is one of the best races in the
world and it is a race in which we want to take part, and, more
than that, we want to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has conditioned the last two Derby winners, Silver Charm
and Real Quiet, and is a nose short of having won three in a row,
as Grindstone just nipped his Cavonnier in the 1996 Run for the
Roses. Grindstone was, of course, trained by Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's 125th Derby, Baffert has five of the top
contenders. Exploit is the 8-1 choice in the advance betting
sponsored by Churchill Downs. General Challenge is 12-1, and Prime
Timber 20-1. Baffert also has the two most prominent fillies,
Silverbulletday, at 10-1, and Excellent Meeting at 15-1, although
he has insisted he will not run fillies in the Derby if his colts
are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   With Worldly Manner at 15-1 and Comeonmom at 30-1 in the
Churchill line, Godolphin has a long way to go to catch up with
Baffert. But, hey, it's different.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canaveral grounded
</P>
<P>
   Team Lukas suffered a blow when Cape Canaveral, owned by
Overbrook Farms, suffered a stress fracture to his right front shin
and was declared out of the Derby. The son of Mr. Prospector had
won both of his starts impressively, most recently the San Miguel
Stakes at Santa Anita Jan. 9, but there was some question as to
whether the horse, which has high early speed, could handle a
distance of ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doubtful that he'll need surgery, but the Derby is out,''
said Ric Waldman, general manager of Overbrook, adding that Cape
Canaveral would need several months to recover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ventured . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cape Canaveral was 15-1 in the Churchill odds. Churchill quickly
withdrew his name, and only $388 in advance bets were lost. A
winter book wager is a loser if the horse does not start . . . The
Dubai World Cup Committee invited 10 horses based in the United
States to the $5 million race March 28. On the list are defending
champion Silver Charm; Malek, who finished fourth last year; Puerto
Madero; Real Quiet; Event of the Year; Victory Gallop; Sir Bear;
Dr. Fong; Lazy Lode; and the filly Banshee Breeze. Of the 10, only
Event of the Year, Lazy Lode, and Banshee Breeze have been declared
out of the race . . . Countess Diana, the 2-year-old filly champion
of 1997, has returned to training at Hialeah. Countess Diana, who
had been plagued by ulcers and a weak cannon bone, has not raced
since finishing off the board in the Gazelle Handicap at Belmont
Sept. 12. ``She looks good and has gained back a lot of weight,''
said owner Rick Caster, who turned her over to trainer Mary Jo
Lohmeier. ``If she is anything less than 100 percent, she will not
race.'' . . . This turf writer voted for every Eclipse Award winner
announced Tuesday night and has nothing more to say on the subject,
other than: Congratulations to the winners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schedule set
</P>
<P>
   Rockingham Park, which opens a 100-program meeting June 6, has
announced a stakes schedule of 12 races. The key events are the
$200,000 New Hampshire Sweesptakes, a Grade III event at a 1 1/8
miles on the turf June 19; the $75,000 Rock Breeders' Cup, at a
mile and one-16th on the grass for fillies and mares July 4; and
the $75,000 Spicy Living Sweepstakes, also for fillies and mares on
the grass, but at 1 1/8 miles Aug. 1. The other nine contests carry
a purse of $25,000 . . . Soldier Boy, a popular horse on the New
England circuit who won the Massachusetts Handicap in 1981, passed
away recently from colic at the age of 26. Soldier Boy, who was
bred in Kentucky, became a fixture in Massachusetts breeding after
his racing career ended and his progeny have earned more than $1
million. He was a versatile sort and set a grass course record at
Suffolk, going 7 1/2 furlongs in 1:33 3/5 in '81. Trained by Dom
Imprescia, Soldier Boy was off at 23-1 when he pulled the MassCap
shocker, becoming the first Boston-area horse to win the event in
20 years.

   ``The growth is more of a negative on the city versus the
positive,'' Fredette said. ``With all the new homes and the
companies that have moved into the city, we have a lot more crime,
a lot more traffic and our roads aren't built to take the
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Fredette said, is that the newcomers have arrived
partly because of New Hampshire's reputation as a low-tax state but
are upset when they encounter a lack of services. ``They want
everything they had in the last place, but they don't want to
pay,'' Fredette said. Fredette, a Republican and third-generation
native, said he would probably have been aghast at the idea of a
state income tax five years ago, but now he thinks it may be the
fairest way to solve the state's problems.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is paying the price for what has long been a
source of pride and a drawing card: the lack of a general sales or
income tax. In 1997, the state Supreme Court ruled that the
reliance on property taxes for education is unfair, noting that
many students in poorer towns are not receiving as good an
education as those in richer towns. As a result, the Legislature is
struggling to come up with a tax system that will distribute the
levies more equitably and ensure a better education system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping alive the 4 percent income tax proposal,
the House approved a 25-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax
and considered plans for a statewide property tax. Governor Jeanne
Shaheen said in an interview that she is keeping ``my options
open'' on an income tax, as she anticipates meeting the court
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clearest indications of New Hampshire's changing
makeup can be seen in the voter registration rolls. Just five years
ago, Republicans held a decisive edge, with 252,199 voters,
compared to 210,865 Democrats and 198,627 Independents. But by last
November, Independents had nearly become the majority. The 1998
registration included 272,115 Republicans, 271,715 Independents and
203,567 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire allows Independents to vote in either the
Democratic or Republican primary if they temporarily switch to a
party identification.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why presidential prospects such as Senator
John McCain, the Arizona Republican, believe they can do well in
New Hampshire. McCain, like his New Hampshire chaperone, former US
Senator Warren Rudman, is an independent-minded maverick who
believes the state's reputation for rock-ribbed conservativism is
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and others could also be affected by the changes in media
power within the state. Two decades ago, the Union-Leader of
Manchester and its publisher, William Loeb, influenced many aspects
of state policy. Today, while the newspaper still has influence,
politicians can win without it, Rudman said. The center of media
power has shifted to Channel 9, which operates out of a graceful
new building in downtown Manchester notable for its architectural
bow to the city's historic red brick mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very different state than it was in the '70s,'' Rudman
said. ``People who campaigned there back then wouldn't recognize it
today. The state has become more like America. It has become more
affluent, more educated and less stable in terms of its
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's ethnic makeup has, however, changed little. Fewer
than 8,000 of New Hampshire's 1.1 million people are black, and
there are only 12,000 Asians. New Hampshire ``contines to change,
but so far not enough,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
campaigned for president here in 1984 and 1988 and visited the
state this month amid speculation that he might run again.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson chastised lawmakers for allowing New Hampshire to be the
only state without a day honoring Martin Luther King. But in
another sign of shifting winds, the Legislature, pushed by Shaheen,
appears on the verge of joining the rest of the country in
approving the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's defenders note that other states with much
larger minority populations offset the demographics of the Granite
State. For example, an early and possibly decisive primary will be
held in California, which has the nation's largest Hispanic and
Asian populations, and the third largest number of blacks.
California is scheduled to hold its primary on March 7. New
Hampshire may hold its primary on Feb. 22, 2000, but the date would
be moved up if other states try to hold their primaries earlier
than that. New Hampshire law requires that its primary be held a
week ahead of any other.
</P>
<P>
   With New Hampshire's economy in such good shape, the 2000
campaign is likely to be different from the last two campaigns
here, when many candidates focused on issues such as job loss and
free trade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan won the
primary, perhaps reinforcing the state's image as a bastion of the
right. But Buchanan won with only 27 percent of the vote. Two more
moderate candidates, Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander, picked up a
combined 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, many Republican prospects are once again
casting themselves as the most conservative candidate in New
Hampshire. These prospects, including Quayle, publisher Steve
Forbes and former Reagan aide Gary Bauer, expect that the most
conservative Republicans in the state will be the most active and
most likely to vote. But if all it took to win the New Hampshire
primary were the most conservative credentials, then the state's
own Senator Bob Smith would be riding high in the polls. Smith, who
barely won reelection in 1996, is considered a long shot. Texas
Governor George W. Bush, meanwhile, is touting his ``compassionate
conservatism,'' which may appeal to Independents.
</P>
<P>
   As for Elizabeth Dole, she could benefit from the electorate's
willingness to back women for high office.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is whether the current fight over taxes
will have an effect on the presidential primary. Some argue that if
a broad-based tax is approved, it might spark some kind of voter
uprising that will benefit an anti-tax candidate. But others say
the battle has sensitized the citizenry to question any claim by a
presidential prospect that taxes can easily be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who helped engineer Gary Hart's 1984 primary victory,
warned against drawing any early conclusions. She noted that when
Alexander and Forbes tried to step into the state controversy over
taxes, ``they engendered some emnity for trying to tell us what to
do.'' Despite all the changes here, she said, the people of New
Hampshire haven't given up their treasured independence.

NEW SOUTH GOP LIKELY TO CHOOSE GINGRICH SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. _ In the first post-impeachment election,
voters in this suburban Xanadu of fashionable retail chains and
fast-food franchises north of Atlanta will elect a successor to
Newt Gingrich Tuesday. It is, by any measure, an inhospitable
starting point for the Democrats' drive to reconquer the House.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Isakson, a well-known Republican with 17 years in the
Georgia Legislature and two statewide campaigns behind him, is a
heavy favorite to win Gingrich's seat and maintain the GOP's hold
on a modernized version of the South.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-month campaign, Isakson said, ``Impeachment has
not come up in any forum I've attended. The only people who ask me
about it are the media.'' Instead, he said, he is questioned about
transportation issues, Social Security, taxes, and education, and
his reputation as a successful businessman and fiscal conservative
seems to fit the district's interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th Congressional District, which bites into four heavily
populated counties, is the antithesis of Tara, the mythical Georgia
plantation in ``Gone with the Wind.'' In the 25 years since Jimmy
Carter was governor, the area has grown from a rural hinterland
into a sprawling network of subdivisions and strip malls peopled
with newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stereotypical, affluent American district, a
mainstream conservative district,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican
pollster who moved from Iowa to make his own home here. Choosing
one suburb as an example, Ayres said: ``Five years ago half the
current voters in Alpharetta did not live in Georgia. They came
here for work from the Northeast, the Midwest, from other parts of
the South.''
</P>
<P>
   And they helped transform the old ``Solid South'' that once sent
only Democrats, albeit conservative Democrats, to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 book, ``Dixie Rising,'' Peter Applebome called Cobb
County, the epicenter of the district, ``Exhibit A'' of the
``South's death by bleaching'' into the ``Anywhere U.S.A. corporate
iconography of Bennigan's and Blockbuster Videos and Taco Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state that is nearly 30 percent minority, the district
population is 90 percent white. Only 10 other congressional
districts in the country have a higher concentration of college
graduates. Of the 435 districts, Georgia's 6th ranks 23d nationally
in median family income. It votes 2-to-1 Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich moved to the 6th in 1992 to escape a redistricting
scheme to defeat him by the Democratic Legislature. He found the
area receptive. In a Republican primary that year, an opponent
accused Gingrich of ``carpetbagging.'' But the expression is not so
insulting here, and Gingrich went on to become speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the blame for Republican losses last November, Gingrich
quit. But Democrats will have to look elsewhere to pick up the six
seats they need to control the House, and their chances seem no
better in a second upcoming election. A district in Louisiana with
similar demographics will vote in May to replace Bob Livingston,
another Republican leader who fell victim to the politics of
personal exposure this winter and resigned after admitting to
having been unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia's special, nonpartisan election, Isakson dominates a
field of seven candidates. If no one wins a majority Tuesday, a
runoff between the top two candidates will be held March 16.
</P>
<P>
   The only Democrat in the race is Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, who
made a weak challenge to Gingrich three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson's chief foe is Christina Jeffrey, a political science
professor at Kennesaw State University. She gained notoriety four
years ago when Gingrich named her House historian, then rescinded
the appointment after she was linked to anti-Semitic statements.
Her multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Gingrich and several
members of Congress is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Jeffrey is the favorite of the Christian
conservative movement and has drawn praise for her views from
publications like the Weekly Standard, though the magazine's
editors expect Isakson to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson's greatest concern, says said Bill Byrne, a Republican
and chairman of the Cobb County Commission, which administers local
government, is a low turnout. ``In a Republican primary, the
conservative wing dominates. . . . Johnny always had difficult
times in Republican primaries because of that. If he doesn't win
outright Tuesday, he'll lose the runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson has been endorsed by Gingrich. If elected, Isakson said
his voting record will be similar to Gingrich's, though his style
will not be as confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my conservative credentials,'' he said in an
interview, ``and I'm not going to be drawn into a war'' with the
far right. ``It's important to put a human face on issues important
to a fiscal conservative. If we can reduce welfare by putting
people to work, that's compassion. The best insurance against
unbridled entitlement programs is education.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with pride of his consensus-building experiences in a
Georgia Legislature filled with Democrats, but scoffs at Jeffrey's
charge that he is tax-raising, closet liberal, and said: ``I'm not
going to get down to the depths of her level.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, 55, built a fortune in commercial real estate. He is
the grandson of a Swedish stonemason, rather than a descendant of
the Scots-Irish yeoman farmers indigenous to the area. His home, he
said, is ``Cobb County,'' rather than any incorporated town. He
moved from Atlanta 30 years ago. ``If you look at my neighbors,
only two out of 100 are from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he personified the 6th District, Isakson said, ``I
think I do.''

`STRESSMOBILE' LEAVES HIM UPTIGHT IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ Here is your basic uptight Yankee behind the
wheel of a cherry red sportscar, cruising down Santa Monica
Boulevard at sunset, just as the beautiful people start coming out
to see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   And all I can think about is the number 19. That's how many
miles before my battery-powered EV1 runs out of juice, according to
the big, glowing gauge on the dashboard. If I run out, it's not
like I can get a can of gas; a tow truck would have to haul me to a
charging station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should call this the stressmobile,'' says my passenger.
</P>
<P>
   But when we reach the crowded Century City Mall with juice to
spare, I begin to relax. There, like a red carpet rolled out before
me, is an ``electric vehicle only'' parking space near the door,
equipped with a battery charger to dispense free electricity while
I have dinner. This, I can get used to.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, driving an electric vehicle is a bit of an art.
You don't have 300 miles to the next re-fuelling (the EV1 gets 50
miles to the charge, the Honda EV Plus closer to 100), nor a
service station every few miles, so you plan trips from charging
break to charging break. A smart electric vehicle driver knows the
good restaurants near public charging stations.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice, I drove more than 250 miles each in the two main
electric vehicles available to California consumers, the EV1 and
Honda's EV Plus, and never ran out of charge. What's more, I
stopped worrying and found the charm of electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn salesmen call it ``the EV1 smile,'' that look of
pleasure drivers get when the acceleration knocks them back on the
seat. With only a single gear, the electric drive system picks up
speed very smoothly, allowing the EV1 to leave other sports cars
behind in a turbo-hum not unlike the Batmobile.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a station wagon guy, but there's a likeable swagger to the
EV1's low-slung profile, reflective windows and Star Trekky
interior. I felt a swell of pride when a guy in the next car rolled
down his window and yelled, ``Where'd you get that car?''
</P>
<P>
   The EV Plus, by contrast, is a pokier, more family-friendly
vehicle, a two-door sedan that feels like a mini-van because the
seats are so far up off the road. Even though I drove the car in
Massachusetts _ where there are almost no public charging stations
_ I fretted less about running out of charge because of the more
powerful nickel-metal hydride battery.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most striking thing about the EV Plus is how
ordinary it seems. Aside from quirks such as silent ignition, no
exhaust, and plug-in-at-home charging, the EV Plus drives much like
a gas-powered car.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to think of these as real alternatives to
today's cars as long as the driving range is so limited, the prices
so high, and the charging system so embryonic. Joe, the guy at EV
Rental who rented me the EV1, had it about right when he told me,
``You are a pioneer.''

ALASKAN CULTURES COME TOGETHER IN NEW ANCHORAGE CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Resent to restore dropped name in lede)  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Perry Eaton peers intently at the map of Alaska
he has spread out before him. ``There are no roads ... here,'' he
says, applying his entire palm to the western portion of the state
with an audible slap.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to get from point to point out here is by air. Or
foot. Or boat. Or, during most of the year, something with runners
on it.
</P>
<P>
   And it might be difficult for residents of the lower 48 to
appreciate the vastness of these distances. Overlay this same map
on the contiguous United States, and Ketchikan is at Jacksonville,
Fla., Point Barrow is just a few miles south of Fargo, N.D., and
the Aleutian chain runs into the Pacific Ocean, 170 miles west of
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic and meteorologic realities quickly conspire
against any tourist who wants to examine the native cultures of any
of Alaska's five main indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Bring the groups to the tourist.
</P>
<P>
   The consummation of this plan is the Alaska Native Heritage
Center, which will open in Anchorage _ the state's largest city _
on May 1. Eaton, born into the Aleut/Alutiiq culture 54 years ago
on Kodiak Island, will serve as its president, and he could barely
contain his enthusiasm for the project on a recent visit to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be a static museum. Rather, representatives of each
native group will gather in village environments to build kayaks,
make moccasins, prepare food, sing, dance _ all for the purpose of
familiarizing outsiders with their worlds. Imagine a rough hybrid
of Williamsburg, Va., and Hawaii's Polynesian Cultural Center, but
established several latitude lines to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call Alaska the last frontier,'' Eaton said, ``and, in that
regard, you can extend that assumption and say the indigenous
people there are on the frontier also. So if the visitor were
actually to go into the village, it would be like entering a
village in the frontier back at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska is unique in the American Indian experience because
there was no Indian removal here. These people are still residing
in our original villages, so the context of the culture is unique
to America. What we're endeavoring to do with the center is bring
you closer to that original baseline culture and share some of the
real beauty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, a nonprofit educational enterprise with
representatives of all five native regions on its board, will be
housed on a 26-acre site on the northeastern edge of the city.
Tourists will first enter the Welcome House, a 26,000-square-foot
structure containing interpretative displays, a theater and an area
for dance performances and storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this building will be a small lake, surrounded by
re-creations of villages. A walking path, which will be
wheelchair-accessible, will connect them.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to survey working environments for all
five major cultures: Athabascan from central Alaska; Yup'ik/Cup'ik
from the west; Inupiaq/St. Lawrence Island Yupik from the north;
Aleut/Alutiiq from the Aleutian Island chain in the southwest; and
the Eyak, Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian peoples from the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to present ourselves as a live, living, functional
culture,'' said Eaton, an Anchorage banker who has been active in
native affairs throughout his career. He cited several examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A woman making moccasins won't be behind glass. You're going
to walk in and have a conversation with her. She'll tell you about
the deer hide, where she gets it today, where she got it yesterday,
where her mother got it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You might see how different cultures treat salmon. In
August, we will be splitting fish and drying fish, and different
cultures have different ways of doing it. We might even ask you to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``You might see some elders teaching some youth on
kayak-building. You don't just get to see it made, you get to see
the sharing and how it comes down traditionally between the
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton added: ``We want you to know that we still make these
things. This is not a dead culture in which you're going to handle
artifacts from many years ago. And the goal of the center is to
celebrate and to perpetuate and to share the traditions. We want
you to see us the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For some visitors, some of those details might be shocking, even
troubling, but that will be part of the educational process, too.
Native Alaskans hunt whales, seals and sea otters for food and
other products. It's an integral part of a cycle of sustenance that
has been in place for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who admitted that the seal and sea otter harvests, for
example, are conducted ``out of sight,'' was asked if some
urbanites would be horrified by the practice. ``Totally,'' he said,
``and that's a real dilemma. And that's real important for the
center to educate (outsiders). There is no shortage of seals, and
we don't go around clubbing the babies the way the Canadians do.
And we don't just harvest them for the hides. And it's not in any
danger at all. But because of perception, it makes it very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Native Heritage Center will seek to convey these
messages, among many others. These native people, according to
center officials, are under tremendous pressure from policies made
thousands of miles away in Washington, D.C. When a duck-hunting
season is defined, and bag limits are set, what specific impact
does that have on an Inupiaq village along the Colville River in
northern Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   This might provide a prime opportunity to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to go to the Amazon rain forest to find
indigenous people who are threatened in their environment,'' Eaton
said. ``It's right here in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is being launched in part as a response to surveys
conducted by Alaska tourism officials. Visitors, it was learned,
have a profound curiosity about native life in this largely
untracked wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Morris, of the Anchorage Convention and Visitors Bureau,
said, ``When visitors come to Alaska, they're looking for scenery,
wildlife and native culture. You can usually guarantee the first
two, but people just don't have the time or energy or wherewithal
to get out to the different villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Another anticipated benefit of the center will be to provide an
environment in which the native groups themselves can interact and
share experiences. Those vast distances and forbidding conditions
have prevented them from having significant contact, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary function is tourism. The entrance fee will be
$20 for adults and $15 for children under 12, and center officials
have wisely worked with cruise lines to set up shore excursions for
passengers. One agreement is already in place with Princess, and
final details of another are being worked out with Holland America.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how outsiders get there, the center's leaders are
seeking to make the experience a profound one.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actress Jasmine Bleeth drives a slick electric car
in the TV show ``Nash Bridges.'' The cinematographer for the
program ``Star Trek Voyager'' loves his electric so much he made
radio ads touting the technology. The film editor for the series
``Ellen'' drove his electric car halfway across the country just to
show it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood were the battleground in the crusade to switch
California automobiles from smog-causing gasoline to emission-free
battery power, the war might be over. The biggest challenge to the
internal combustion engine's supremacy in decades, watched closely
across the country, has lots of celebrity endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is convincing everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Saturn dealers began selling the first mass
production electric cars here, they have made almost no impact on
ordinary Californians. Fewer than 2,000 are on the roads, a far cry
from the 20,000 vehicles regulators once hoped to see sold in 1998
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the obstacles to building an electric vehicle that
is both affordable and high-performing become clear, officials have
twice retreated from regulations that would have mandated the sale
of more than 250,000 electric vehicles by 2003. Now, the
requirement has been cut to just over 40,000, and the state
increasingly emphasizes other types of ``clean'' cars.
</P>
<P>
   Most wounding have been the brickbats from the media, which has
been widely skeptical of vehicles that cost more than comparable
gas-burning cars and must recharge for an hour or more after less
than 100 miles of driving. Electric vehicle advocates, already
battling powerful oil and auto interests, had counted on a friendly
press to get the word out that electric cars are a fun and clean
way to meet most driving needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a vicious attack, and I don't really understand
the agenda,'' said Kris Trexler, the Emmy Award-winning film editor
for the series ``Ellen'' and a big fan of the EV1 electric car sold
by Saturn. ``The public is totally naive,'' he says, in part
because the media hasn't educated them.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away in Massachusetts, state officials can
only watch and hope. Former governor William Weld was one of the
nation's top boosters of electric cars, going to court to defend a
mandate identical to California's. But a quirk in federal law
forced Massachusetts to drop its requirement until 2003, and that
made California the nation's testing ground.
</P>
<P>
   But, far from giving up, government agencies, utilities,
environmentalists and some corporations here are pressing ahead to
lay the foundation for an electric future. More than 300 public
charging stations have been set up at parking lots, agencies such
as the US Postal Service are buying electrics, and the first
electric car rental agency just opened in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an uphill fight all the way,'' said electric car
pioneer Clare Bell as she assembled a Xebra, a new electric
sportscar already getting TV exposure on ``Nash Bridges.'' ``We
were really looked at as fringe loonies not so long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bell and other fans, the long range outlook for electric
vehicles is good, as oil supplies dwindle and their ``clean fun''
message gets out, but the fight won't be won quickly. They point
out that other technological breakthroughs, from the personal
computer to the advent of the automobile itself, took decades to
win wide public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why else would we be willing to throw $1 billion away with no
chance of getting it back? We want to be the Xerox of the electric
vehicle industry,'' said Robert Randall, Saturn and GM's chief of
electric vehicle sales in southern California, referring to the
company that pioneered and for many years dominated the photocopier
business.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of less environmentally pure but more practical
alternatives are challenging electrics to be the car of the future
_ from vehicles running on natural gas, to cars that are
part-electric/part-gas, to cleaner versions of the gas-powered cars
that own the roads now.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, electric vehicle developers face the risk that,
unless costs come down and driving range increases, their products
could end up less like Xerox and more like the eight-track tape
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the automobile represents freedom, battery
vehicles just cannot be successful at the present level of
technology,'' says Eric Noble, an industry analyst at AutoPacific
Inc. in Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the EV1 represents the return of electric cars to
the American landscape. Early in the century, before the low cost
Model T revolutionized transportation, electrics were a popular
alternative to loud, smelly, breakdown-prone gas-powered cars. But
batteries simply didn't have the power of gasoline, and, by 1915,
less than 2 percent of US autos were electric.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five years later, however, American cities were reaping
the smoggy harvest of millions of internal combustion engines. Los
Angeles, surrounded by hills that trap air pollution, became the
nation's smog capital, suffering more than 150 unhealthy air days
each year.

 LOS ANGELES: ... each year.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In response, the California Air Resources Board ordered major
automakers to begin by 1998 to sell ``zero emissions vehicles,'' a
category that only electric cars could satisfy. Electrics are so
clean they don't even need a tailpipe, though generating the
electricity that goes into the batteries usually pollutes.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers fought the requirement, but General Motors, which had
dabbled in electric cars since the 1960s, quickly emerged as the
industry leader. While others retooled existing models in an
attempt to meet the law, GM designed a brand new car, the
futuristic, two-seat EV1. With its aerodynamic shape and powerful
acceleration, the EV1 drew crowds wherever it went, and GM decided
to test market the cars in Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vehicle represents a wonderfully well-integrated new mode
of transportation,'' said Michael Gage, president of the
alternative car development consortium Calstart, in 1996. ``It's
what a compact disc is to a long-play record.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. From the beginning, the EV1 had a limited market,
because it had only two seats, a $34,000 sticker price, and a
real-life range of only 50 miles before recharging.
</P>
<P>
   However, Saturn strategists hoped there were enough affluent,
environmentally conscious technology buffs in trend-setting
California to make the vehicle a success. The likely customer,
Saturn calculated, was male, well educated, earning $150,000 a
year, and owning several cars already.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who spent $1,000 for a VCR or bought cell
phones the size of a suitcase,'' said salesman Randall. ``They are
willing to take a chance to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a lease rate of roughly $520 a month, Saturn has found so
far only 600 customers, a drop in the bucket compared to the
million new cars sold in California each year, and less than many
people connected with the program had hoped. But those who do buy
are among the most loyal customers in automotive history.
</P>
<P>
   Trexler loves his EV1's near-silent power and makes a game of
leaving sports cars in the dust at stop lights. To underscore the
durability of the EV1, he set off on a highly publicized
3,000-mile-trip from California to Michigan, lining up scores of
recharging stops and posting his trip journal on the web.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think it's more amazing than I did,'' recalls
Trexler. ``I just had a good, fun vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers have been no less enthusiastic, copying Trexler's
feat, defending the cars publicly and forming an active EV1 club.
In addition, celebrity EV1 drivers such as actors Ted Danson, Danny
DeVito and Ed Begley Jr. gave the vehicle cachet.
</P>
<P>
   But other major carmakers have made little attempt to reach
consumers, preferring to concentrate on businesses and governments
that use fleets of vehicles over short distances. When the state
dropped the requirement that 2 percent of 1998 new vehicles run on
batteries, carmakers scaled back even more.
</P>
<P>
   Only Honda has joined GM in pitching to consumers, selling a
more family-friendly sedan called EV Plus. However, the company
made just 300 of them and does little promotion. At Honda of
Hollywood, salesmen said only one customer has ever asked about the
EV Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, carmakers have sold or leased between 1,000 and
2,000 electrics in California, which the Los Angeles Times called
``dismal public acceptance of battery-powered vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   But electric car advocates say it is too soon to write them off.
They admit the original electric vehicle sales quotas were too
ambitious, but they say the regulations set off a wave of
innovation that the public has scarcely seen.
</P>
<P>
   At Calstart's alternative vehicle research and development
facility in Alameda, for instance, a Norwegian company called PIVCO
just completed tests of a plastic-bodied two-seat car that would
sell for $18,000 or less. Though critics say the small, low speed
vehicle won't sell here, Ford just bought a controlling interest in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city of Alameda is supporting research on a
zinc-air battery system that propelled a postal van more than 1,000
miles before the drivers quit. ``Frankly, I think they were just
getting tired of driving 35 miles per hour in a big circle,'' said
Jim Baak of the city's Bureau of Electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with many improvements is cost. General Motors will
soon offer EV1s equipped with new nickel-metal hydride batteries
that double its current 50 miles per charge range, but the sticker
price is $9,000 higher, too. And that's a bargain since the battery
packs cost $35,000 apiece to make.
</P>
<P>
   Some engineers suspect there won't be a battery that is both
powerful and affordable enough before 2010. Donald R. Sadoway,
materials science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, told Design News magazine that researchers are caught
``in the scientific equivalent of quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a breakthrough, environmentalists and public
officials increasingly promote ``hybrid'' vehicles that have both a
gas engine and an electric motor, giving them greater driving range
but less emissions than conventional vehicles. Toyota is already
selling such a hybrid, the Prius, in Japan, and the company plans
to offer it here next year.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the way for hybrids' introduction, the California Air
Resources Board voted last November to allow carmakers to meet most
of their 10 percent ``zero emissions'' sales quota in 2003 with a
patchwork of low-polluting vehicles such as the Prius, rather than
insisting on pure electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But electric advocates say hybrids should be seen as only a
bridge to cleaner electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   With hybrids, ``you still have oil and exhaust and heat being
produced,'' said Edmund Fitzgerald, fleet manager for Costco
stores, which strongly supports electric vehicles. ``I don't want
it cleaner. I want it clean.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, electric vehicle supporters continue the unglamorous
work of installing charging stations, confident that their day will
come, though perhaps later than they once hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to predict the development of technology,'' said
Roland Hwang of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ``If we're off
by 5 years, that isn't such a bad thing.''

FOR FREQUENT FLIERS, IRS PAYMENT OPTION ADDS INSULT TO INJURY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When Doug Randlett heard about a new IRS program allowing people
to pay their federal taxes this year with a credit card, he got all
excited about a windfall of frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he thought, earning frequent-flier miles by paying with
his credit card would take the sting out of his hefty tax bill this
year, which totaled $25,000 because of a major sell-off of assets
in preparation for his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger ouch was yet to come. When the Milton, Mass. man
called American Express to get the details of the program, he
learned that putting $25,000 of Internal Revenue Service tax debt
on his card would come with a $656 ``convenience fee'' imposed by
the credit card issuer and a third-party processor of the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   That more than wiped out any advantage of paying by plastic: For
the 25,000 frequent-flier miles he would earn toward a free
domestic round-trip ticket, he could buy such a ticket for much
less than $656.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a stupid arrangement,'' said Randlett, a newly
retired food distributor. ``There's no advantae to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with only a few exceptions, there seems no reason for
people to consider this IRS pilot program, which is run primarily
by US Audiotex and accepts American Express, MasterCard, and
Discover. (Visa declined to take part this year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lousy deal,'' said Gerri Detweiler, education
adviser for Debt Counselors of America in Rockville, Md., and
author of the Ultimate Credit Handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a convenience credit-card user (you pay off your
balance each month) or a revolving card user (you routinely carry a
balance and pay interest on the borrowed amount), we find most
people are better off writing a check to Uncle Sam or, if you don't
have the cash, borrowing from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts state taxes, however, are a different story. If
you file your state return by phone, you can charge your tax
balance on Visa or Mastercard with no extra fees.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS payment program, however, comes with the sizable
``convenience'' fee of anywhere from 1.5 percent to 3 percent of
the total tax bill. This is because federal law prohibits the
government from coughing up the usual fees merchants pay when
accepting a credit card. So these fees get passed on to the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the average tax balance last year was about
$2,700. If you called US Audiotex to charge that balance, you would
gain 2,700 miles on your frequent-flier program or _ assuming
frequent-flier miles are generally worth about 2 cents a mile _ a
$54 value. But your convenience fee would be $68.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're willing to pay this extra money for the
frequent-flier miles, make sure your particular card gives miles
for tax payments. While American Express and Discover seem to treat
tax payments like any other charge, a MasterCard spokesman
indicated to us that some of its affiliated frequent-flier programs
may consider tax payments differently.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have the cash to pay your IRS tax bill in April,
you're generally better off borrowing from the federal government
than charging it on your credit card. Currently, the average
interest rate on a credit card is roughly 18 percent. Compare that
to the IRS installment plan that comes with a 7 percent interest
rate, which is a bargain even if you factor in the $43 one-time
installment fee and the .25 percent failure-to-pay additional
charge imposed each month on the outstanding tax balance.
</P>
<P>
   One economically distressed group may benefit from the charge-it
plan: Those who are rejected for the IRS installment plan.
</P>
<P>
   One other angle: According to credit card analysts, once a
person declares bankruptcy, taxes owed to the IRS are debts that
follow that person for a lifetime. But credit card bills, which are
unsecured debts, could be wiped away under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   For those at the other end of the economic spectrum, such as a
taxpayer who owes the IRS close to $100,000, you may find the
avalanche of frequent-flier miles will earn you a first-class or
business-class international ticket. And the value of that ticket
may far exceed the convenience fee.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you need just a few thousand extra miles to earn a free
ticket, you may not mind paying the extra convenience fee to get
that free trip.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the financial rewards of the IRS credit-card program are
not great, there may be psychological benefits. If you think of the
IRS as a heartless bully, you may prefer to owe money to a
commercial bank than the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit card analysts say most people should just pay with
an old-fashioned check. ``For most consumers, it's not worth the
trouble,'' said Robert McKinley, president of CardWeb Inc., which
tracks the credit card industry.

<P>
   Fuming over bank fees
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell Gale was fuming last week when he received a letter from
BankBoston informing him that he would be slapped with a $15 fee if
he uses the overdraft protection offered by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The new fee takes effect in April. Currently, depositors who
have overdraft protection can write a check for more money than
they have in their checking account and the bank will cover it. The
bank charges interest on the loaned amount, but the interest is
usually far less than the $22 penalty for a bounced check.
</P>
<P>
   Now BankBoston says it will charge a $15 annual fee if overdraft
protection is used. Tisha Capello, the bank's director of consumer
product management, said 60 percent of the bank's customers use the
overdraft protection at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Capello said the new fee was necessary because overdraft
protection generated a lot of work for the bank but little income.
She said the average outstanding overdraft was $300. She asserted
the fee is comparable to what other banks charge and is imposed
only if the service is used.
</P>
<P>
   But Gale was still fuming. He said the bank may not be making
much money on overdraft protection now, but the new fee will ensure
it does in the future. He said he believes the proliferation of
banking fees is a byproduct of past banking mergers that have
reduced competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magazine expiration dates
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed reasonable that when you sign up for a year's
subscription of a weekly magazine, you would expect 52 issues to be
mailed to your door.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Toney Hopkins expected when she signed up for Time
magazine. In fact, she paid for two years and expected to get 104
issues lasting until February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After a column we wrote about the need to check expiration dates
on mailing labels, she found her expiration dates on that two-year
subscription kept shifting to earlier dates. It started accurately
as February 2000, but then last spring the expiration date on the
mailing label said January 2000 and as of last December, it was
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What gives?
</P>
<P>
   When we called Time magazine, Ken Godshall, vice president of
circulation for the company, said special issues released each
year, which can be put out based on news events, count toward the
52 issues in a year. They can even release a special double-issue,
which will count as two issues.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a customer's expiration date can shift earlier and
earlier depending on the number of special issues the company
chooses to release in a given year. In the last 12 months, for
example, he said Time had three double-issues, mostly as part of
its Time 100 series that featured prominent Americans in this
century. Customers would have found their expiration date adjusted
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the company ``attempts to communicate this to
subscribers,'' he acknowledged that some may not realize the length
of their subscription may be adjusted. He said that if subscribers
complain, the magazine will attempt to satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to consider adding an issue or two just to keep
their business,'' he said.
</P>

GIRLS GET BARBIE, BOYS GET SKILLS, THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, the creation of computer games was heralded as a
fresh chance to break out of the gender-tracking mold and create
entertainment designed for boys and girls, equally.
</P>
<P>
   But all one need do is look at the top selling girl games today
to know that the opportunity is passing us by.
</P>
<P>
   The market is dominated by a plastic doll that has been around
for 40 years. In fact, the top six selling computer games for girls
in 1998 were all Barbie games. PC Data, a market research firm,
says that among the top sellers are Barbie Nail Designer and Barbie
Magic Hairstyler. And then there is the computer game juggernaut,
Barbie's Fashion Designer, which sold an astounding 500,000 copies
in the first two months it was released. The object of the game? To
design clothes that can be printed out and used on a Barbie doll.
</P>
<P>
   So, one might argue, at least girls are using computers _ a
pastime that many still think of as a boy's domain _ and becoming
acquainted with the software, right? But those who study the issue
say that the most of computer games being marketed for girls tend
to instill stereotyped gender messages and develop different skills
than boys' games do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, manufacturers have even slowed down the action on some
of the games designed for girls, making them less challenging than
the standard-issue games.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Miranker, a children's software specialist and co-curator
of the Children's Gallery in the Boston Computer Museum, says that,
for the most part, the computer games marketed to girls are ``not
exemplars of what is exciting in the world of computing, although
they might be exciting in the world of marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Sanders, director of the Center for Gender Equity at the
Washington Research Institute in Seattle, takes it a step further.
``It makes you absolutely gag,'' she says. ``Computer games like
Barbie reinforce the dimension of girls that has nothing to do with
their role in the world and everything to do with their personal
private sphere of appearance. This is not healthy in 1999 for girls
to be focusing so exclusively on themselves as opposed to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   For boys _ who use computers in the classroom and in
after-school programs much more frequently than girls _ games are
frequently a virtual world where the enemy is vanquished, where
space is explored and aliens are battled, where blood and violence
spreads across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Whether violent games are appropriate amusements for young boys
is a matter of some debate _ some would say as debatable as an
afternoon spent with Barbie _ but what concerns many is the
different experiences that youngsters take from the games and carry
through life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is that to the extent that computer games are a
stand-in, or a precursor, for a skill that can later affect our
economic life, it matters if they are sex-segregated,'' says
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   So if sex-segregated computer games are a problem, who is to
blame? Barbie and Barbie-type computer games dominate the market
because that is what manufacturers know will sell. In the
competitive world of computer game marketing, one can hardly expect
them to think or act otherwise. After all, games that do not sell
quickly lose their shelf space to more popular titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry finds one thing, sports or action, and does it
over and over and over,'' says Henry Jenkins, a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology professor and co-editor of the new book
``From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games.'' ``The
energy for change comes from smaller start-ups.'' Jenmkins says.
``What is exciting about the girl games movement is that a lot of
start-ups are trying different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they survive, then their impact will force change and could
well lead to a more androgynous games,'' Jenkins says. ``If they
are bought up too quickly, then it is quite possible we will have
Barbie and Doom and nothing in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The news last week on the survival front was not good. Purple
Moon _ a California-based company that has been touted as a model
in the world of computer game producers marketing games exclusively
for 8- to 12-year-old girls _ announced Thursday that it was
shutting down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using an established character, Purple Moon had
gained acclaim for how it researched the ways girls play, and then
developed new multicultural characters for games heavy on
decision-making as well as narrative and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The company created the Rockett Movado series of games. In the
game called Rockett's New School, for example, the player
experiences a first day in eighth grade and has to make a series of
decisions that affect Rockett's emotions on her first day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly original compared to most of the other
girl-oriented product out there,'' says Miranker. ``It was
tremendously courageous thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But such acclaim was, apparently, not enough to keep the company
up and running. In a terse press release it announced that it had
``ceased operations and laid off all its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While computer games are still a relatively new medium, they
bring with them all the baggage of the toy industry. And there are
few things in our culture are more biased than toys and games.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of female action figures in computer games _ as in
regular action figure play _ is an ongoing concern for some parents
and educators, given that the boys playing the games today will be
the colleagues on the job of tomorrow. The lack of strong female
characters, the kind that boys will eventually come to know in the
office or workplace, does not serve boys or girls well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, says Jenkins, ``The issue of violence in video games
for boys may be overblown. . . . There may be a real argument that
women need to play with power to prepare for the professional world
where they are competing with men, guys who were raised on blowing
up planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys, certainly, should be able to play games that offer more
than the chance to satisfy a trigger-happy urge. ``They should have
games that have deep interactivity and hard fun,'' says Justine
Cassell, an MIT professor and co-editor, with Jenkins, of ``From
Barbie to Mortal Kombat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason girl games came on the market was that studies
showed that spatial skills and hand-eye coordinations improved by
playing computer games, and any computer game meant a boy's game.''
So games targeted at girls were created, says Cassell, and ``for
the most part, girls' games teach about social relationships and
boys' games teach about power and mastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell says there is a contingent of women who thrive on
playing computer games that are normally considered boys' games.
These so-called Game Grrls stress female empowerment throught
competing with men and ``fragging'' them.
</P>
<P>
   And there is at least one female action figure in the virtual
world, Lara Croft. The hero of Tomb Raider games, Croft is a female
Indiana Jones, an archeologist who can shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a strong action protagonist for girls with a larger-
than-life embodiment of female competence. She can handle a gun,
she can take back the night,'' says Jenkins. ``On the other hand,
she is designed by men to reflect an erotic fantasy and they don't
yet trust the girl market to support the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and Cassell assert that male dominance in ``high power
computer jobs is not accidental. Computer and video games provide
an easy lead-in to computer literacy, and so those children who
aren't playing them at young ages may end up disadvantaged in later
years.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, getting girls to use computers, to feel
comfortable around them, is worthwhile. And if Barbie is the
conduit, they say, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, while boys' games remain firmly anchored in a
virtual world, Barbie's Designer Fashion game creates something _
dolls' clothes _ that is then used in the real world. ``I think
that opens up the prospect of thinking about computers a little
differently,'' says Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   But should there even be girl games, if so many of them create a
learning ghetto? Cassell would like to rephrase the question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the question is `do there have to be games for
girls,' the answer is `yes,' she says. ``Do they have to be girl
games? No.''

SEARCH IS ON FOR LIGHT SIGNALS FROM SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In searching for extra-terrestrial life, should we be sending
light into space and looking for those same transmissions coming
back, instead of listening for radio or electric signals?
</P>
<P>
   H.K., Chelsea, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. As a matter of fact, scientists started looking for bursts of
laser light from out there just last October. And they're looking
for signals from far away from a spot pretty close by, at the
61-inch optical telescope in Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Physicist Paul Horowitz is the principal investigator. For years
he's run a search for extra terrestrial intelligence, one of
several such SETI projects, listening for radio signals from outer
space. The thinking is that any intelligent life that wants
everybody to know they are out there would use radio waves to make
themselves known, because they spread across the universe in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   But American physicist Charles Townes, who shared the 1964 Nobel
Prize in Physics for discoveries that led to the laser, has
persuaded SETI scientists to use light as well, by showing them how
bright it can be. A laser at the US Department of Energy's Lawrence
Livermore Lab at Los Alamos can put out a nanosecond (one billionth
of a second) burst that outshines our sun by 3,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   If we have something like that, Townes reasons, civilizations on
planets that are billions of years older than ours, which would
presumably be more advanced, would have even more powerful light
sources. Since light energy isn't absorbed by interstellar gas and
dust the way radio waves are, Townes and the SETI folks reason that
advanced civilizations might use light instead of radio waves to
advertise their existence. And those civilizations might be
advanced enough to know which planets in other galaxies have
conditions that are right to support life, and could precisely aim
their narrow beams of light at whomever they want to contact.
</P>
<P>
   So Horowitz built a device to look for E.T.'s lasers. Since
October, it has detected three dozen events whose electrical
signatures are the same as a flash of light.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence? Astronomer
Robert Stefanik, who runs the observatory doing the work, says,
``We don't know of any natural phenomenon that creates pulses like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz is skeptical, saying ``they're probably just artifacts
of the detector, radioactive decay particles or something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   They have trained the telescope back at the same spots but did
not see a second signal, which might indicate a pattern and
intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence continues. And now
we're not just listening. We're looking, too.

WHO REALLY LOST RUSSIA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On slow afternoons, American foreign policy mandarins are fond
of playing their favorite parlor game: Who lost Russia?
</P>
<P>
   The question is rhetorical; someone in Washington obviously did.
But just who should be drawn and quartered for the breathtaking
mess that is Russia today? George Bush? Warren Christopher? Strobe
Talbott?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia lost Russia,'' says Vladimir Ryzhkov, the impossibly
young deputy speaker of the Duma, Russia's lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   No American can utter those words without sounding self-serving.
But this crisp, bespectacled 32-year-old can. To be sure, the
Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund should
be chastised for not following the paper trail of their money into
Swiss bank accounts of the Russian oligarchs. The appalling levels
of corruption in Moscow today speak to the naivete and insouciant
lending practices of the West.
</P>
<P>
   But, stresses Ryzhkov, such failures pale compared to the
culpability of Russia itself in its own mismanagement. Russia
brought about its own financial and moral bankruptcy. This point
appears obvious but increasingly is lost amid the ugly Russian
rhetoric building against the West.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are loath to shoulder much blame for the current
mess, so they target as culprits foreign lenders, Jews, anyone else
they can think of. Beneath their legendary stoicism lies a sense of
victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, a reformer in eclipse who has served three times
in the Russian government since the fall of communism, says flatly
that the West would be out of its mind under current circumstances
to give Moscow another cent until the next presidential election, a
long 17 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Better, says Boris Nemtsov, another reformer in winter, would be
the restructure by the international community of Russia's $150
billion foreign debt. Above all, avoid bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, of course, is bankrupt now. It can't pay half of the
$17.5 billion in interest to foreign lenders due this year. The
rest of the world prefers to maintain the fiction that the Kremlin
is still solvent because the alternative is too scary. Score one
for the Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians blithely suggest that the West dismiss the $100
billion in foreign debt incurred during the Cold War. This is an
arresting concept: Win the war and then pay for it again. On the
other hand, they ask, isn't it time for an act of enlightened,
albeit expensive, self interest to thwart the fascist threats
lurking in Russia today? Perhaps, but good luck with Jesse Helms on
that one.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the options at this point are horrendous. Russia is
in far worse shape than most of us in the West realize. Nemtsov,
the most optimistic among reformers, sees mere stagnation. Others
like Ryzhkov and Fyodorov see precipitous, systemic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not matter who becomes president in the year 2000,''
says Ryzhkov. ``The victor, gripping the scepter in his wearied
hand, will face an irreconcilable choice: carry out that which an
alien parliament adopts or wage a war of attrition with it.'' Even
Nemtsov concedes, ``I don't think the year 2000 will lead to
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryzhkov argues that Russia must change its form of government to
save itself. It must adopt a European model where the dominant
parties within the Duma form the government. Russia's government
currently is created at the whim of its president _ in this case
Boris Yeltsin, at once moribund and erratic _ without any regard to
its legitimacy in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little enthusiasm there to enact such reforms while
the communist-led opposition can block government programs with
impunity. There is no accountability in the Duma, notable because
one must show identification to leave the building as well as enter
it.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers are trying to create a party to stand in the
parliamentary elections later this year _ a tall task for a
discredited group. Even if they reach the 5-percent vote minimum
required to sit in the Duma, their ability to influence the
legislative agenda will probably be small.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially stronger bloc could emerge from Russia's vast
regions, where local strongmen for the first time are talking among
themselves about exploiting their combined political weight in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three months, a new powerful movement may appear,''
says Mintimer Shaimiyev, the president of Tartarstan. ``This may be
a movement of powerful Russian regions which are also supporters of
market reforms. It will be composed of leaders who do not wish to
be deputies or president of Russia. However, they will be people
who have not discredited themselves over the past years.''
</P>
<P>
   But will these local dictators, however benevolent, really
embrace market reform at their own expense?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the communists show no signs of disappearing. While
they provide no coherent alternative to Yeltsin, their ranks should
grow if the situation continues to deteriorate. ``They are like
fleas,'' scoffs Nemtsov. ``They increase with poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yvgeny Primakov is now the clear favorite in next
year's presidential race. While he has done little to solve the
crisis, experts give him high marks simply for maintaining what
little stability exists in the current chaos. His new budget may be
based on a laughable annual inflation rate of 30 percent _ a third
of what many anticipate. But at least Russia has a budget today.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Lushkov, the other front-runner, is an
effective autocrat in his limited turf, as was former Chicago boss
Richard Daley, to whom he is often compared. But Luzhkov's ability
to dance on the world stage remains unknown. And former army
general Alexander Lebed, another early pick, appears flummoxed by
his new challenges as governor of a vast Siberian region and has
faded from serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Does Primakov have a master plan to rescue the country if
elected? No one knows. If he does, experts agree, he would be
foolish to show his hand now. And the man is no fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what his image is in the West,'' says Ryzhkov about the
former KGB spymaster. ``But you may look back on Primakov with
nostalgia.''

HIS AMNESIA IS THE SHOCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, you were ``horrified'' to discover that the
Massachusetts child protection agency doesn't protect children.
</P>
<P>
   This week, you are ``appalled'' to discover that the
Massachusetts board responsible for physician discipline has never
met a doctor it didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, Governor Cellucci? Next week, will you be
``shocked'' to discover that the Massachusetts welfare department
is hostile to the poor?
</P>
<P>
   I thought you were the fellow elected last November on the
strength of his experience as William Weld's ``co-governor?'' No
emasculated lieutenant, you. You and Weld assured voters that you
co-captained this ship of state for eight years, filling its sails
with hot air about reducing the role of government, deregulating
business, and privatizing services to those most in need.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it just a little disingenuous now to express surprise at
where you've steered us?
</P>
<P>
   You were in charge during myriad reviews of the long
dysfunctional state Department of Social Services. Didn't you read
those blue-ribbon reports of understaffing, inadequate resources,
and politically-driven management?
</P>
<P>
   You were also in charge during multiple investigations of the
state Board of Registration in Medicine. Didn't you read those
blue-ribbon reports of understaffing, inadequate resources, and
politically-driven management?
</P>
<P>
   Did you forget the audit that found a backlog of almost 1,000
complaints against physicians? Did you forget the report that
concluded the panel failed to protect the public from incompetent,
negligent or exploitive doctors?
</P>
<P>
   You tell us you are irate to learn that the board took no action
against Dr. Marcos Ramos of Boston, who was indicted this week for
the rape of one patient and the sexual molestation of three others.
Ten other women have come forward in the last few days also to
accuse Ramos of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this is news to your physician-dominated medical
board _ its members all gubernatorial appointees. Over the years,
it received 15 complaints about Ramos. It dismissed 13 of them and
took no action on the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Were you this irate in 1996 when the medical board announced it
was de-emphasizing its investigation of sexual misconduct
complaints to concentrate on cases of substandard care? If memory
serves, you were silent on that policy shift. Do you expect us now
to exempt you from responsibility for it?
</P>
<P>
   Were you this irate when the board engineered a change in its
conflict of interest provision to allow relatives of doctors to be
appointed to the only two consumer slots on the seven-member board?
</P>
<P>
   The physician bias of the Massachusetts medical board is a
longstanding national disgrace. For the last decade, it has
consistently ranked near the bottom of surveys by both the
Federation of State Medical Boards and the Public Health Citizen
Research Group for its record of serious disciplinary action. The
latter group ranked the state 45th in 1997. (Since Massachusetts
ranked 48th in 1993, I await your press release noting that all
progress is incremental.)
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has more doctors per capita than any other state,
as well as many of the nation's premier hospitals, medical schools,
and research centers. That equals economic and political clout for
doctors and impotence for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That power imbalance did not begin with Weld and Cellucci, of
course. It began almost as soon as the Legislature established the
Board of Registration and Discipline in Medicine in 1975. The word
discipline was deleted from the board's title in 1979 after Dr.
Louis Alfano, then president of the Massachusetts Medical Society,
called the use of it an ``affront.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period in the mid-1980s, the board did its job.
Under the direction of Barbara Neuman, it took serious action
against 117 doctors. (Last year, it took similar actions in only 38
cases.) Doctors reacted with fury, calling the board a ``star
chamber'' and a ``scalp-hunter.'' Governor Dukakis buckled. Neuman
was fired. By 1990 the number of disciplinary actions had dropped
to 40.
</P>
<P>
   Under Weld-Cellucci, the medical board _ like DSS _ operates in
the shadows until a scandal drags its ineptitude into the
spotlight. It is crisis management and the governor is right: We
should be horrified and appalled.

`EIGHT MILLIMETER' OFFERS A BIT OF DEJA VU FOR DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his new film, ``Eight Millimeter,'' director
Joel Schumacher takes Nicolas Cage on a journey into the abyss, an
exploration of the dark subculture of pornography, kinky sex,
addictions and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one person who would seem to be a fitting guide for
Cage, it's the filmmaker himself, who knows a thing or two about
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher's father died when he was 4. At 9, he started
drinking. He had sex at 11, and was on drugs and out of the family
house in Brooklyn the summer he turned 16. Schumacher knows about
survival, even if it took him more than 40 years to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Lounging in an over-stuffed chair in the Presidential Suite of
the Century Plaza Hotel, decked out in a casual-chic black sport
coat over a T-shirt, Schumacher's tough road is easy to read in the
lines surrounding eyes that peek out from his long, gray-black
hair. But any new lines are more likely to have been etched by his
constant laugh. He'll be 60 this year, he's turned out blockbusters
like ``Batman Forever'' and ``A Time to Kill,'' and he's excited
about his latest release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversations around this film tend to be a lot more
interesting,'' he says with deliberate understatement about a work
that involves Cage's character's attempts to learn if a ``snuff
film'' _ a filmed murder _ is real. The path to discovery is
littered with hustlers and junkies, and Schumacher carried both
labels for parts of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hustled in the sense that I always had to find a way to eat,
a way to afford my habit,'' Schumacher admits. ``Did I ever sell my
body for money? Yeah, but in slightly different ways. I was never
out there standing on the street corner, flagging cars. But I would
pick people up and have sex with them if they would buy me a meal
or give me some money. Being a drug addict for years you do a lot
of things you might not be too proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to AA, they tell you that all addicts are liars,
cheats, thieves and whores, and that if you can't accept that, you
won't make it. I was just like, `Yep, that's me all right.' It's
true, you put your addiction before your kids or your lover or your
wife or your God,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One cold winter day in January 1970, Schumacher went out to
Central Park and dug a deep hole and buried all of his needles
along with the rest of his works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dug way down so no other sorry soul would find my stuff and
use them,'' he says. ``But my problem was, I thought, `Well, OK,
I'm over that now. What's wrong with a few drinks and some
recreational drugs now and then?' Only it wasn't `now and then.' I
beat that one habit, but it took me a very long time to get
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other moments during the filming of ``8MM'' that
blurred the line between fiction and reality. Schumacher used a lot
of sex-industry actors and actresses to simulate the pornographic
action necessary to push the plot. But for one scene that required
sadomasochism, things got a bit too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two dominatrixes came in and they brought their own
slave,'' Schumacher recalls. ``He had paid them something like $250
to carry all their suitcases and be humiliated. Well, they stripped
him down to a little black G-string, tied him up, put a ball gag in
his mouth, wrapped Saran Wrap around his head with just a tiny
opening to breathe through and just proceeded to beat the living
tar out of him. It was the only point in the movie where it was not
a movie anymore _ we were watching somebody's pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher credits screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, who also
wrote ``Seven'' in 1995, with creating an original work that helped
lure an excellent cast. He also said he had no problem with the
premise of using a snuff film to anchor a plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``As opposed to what, cannibalism in `Silence of the Lambs?'''
he laughs. ``This movie works on a lot of levels, it's a thriller,
a private-eye story, one man's journey to a dark place. But it
takes a turn that's very unusual. Most scripts are retreads or
recycled schlock. I'd never seen something like this before.''

TOUGH LAWS NEEDED TO TAKE POLITICS OUT OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the impeachment trial that never should have been is
over, scholars should ponder how Andrew Johnson and William
Jefferson Clinton _ and the Congresses that impeached them _ should
be characterized in history and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it seemed that every mention of Johnson was
followed by the phrase ``the only President to be impeached.'' Now
Clinton is often referred to as ``only the second President to be
impeached.'' Both men wear their descriptions much like Hester
Prynne was forced by the Puritans to wear the scarlet ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   The labels unfairly punish Johnson and Clinton, whose
impeachments had more to do with the twisted motives of a partisan
Congress than their own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's time for historians, and the journalists whose
stories will become part of our history, to put this issue in
proper perspective. Perhaps it's time to reconsider who should wear
these labels.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``impeachment'' should no longer be given the respect
or weight that our well-intentioned founding fathers _ who would no
doubt shudder to discover how both Congresses reduced the
impeachment process to a partisan political weapon _ once gave it.
</P>
<P>
   While both Johnson's and Clinton's staunchest critics believed
they should be impeached and removed from office, a wiser mind in
the Johnson impeachent, and wiser senators in the Clinton case, saw
the damage done by trying to remove a president on charges that did
not come close to the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' envisioned
by the authors of the impeachment language.
</P>
<P>
   As history has proved, Johnson never should have been impeached,
and the motives for his removal were purely political. And Clinton
should never have been impeached, never mind removed, for his
adulterous sexual conduct with Monica Lewinsky, as reckless and
dishonoring as it was to the office.
</P>
<P>
   At most, Clinton should have been censured, as the Democrats
proposed. But Republicans saw an opportunity, through impeachment,
to remove their nemesis from office. Of course, the stories of what
happened to the pursuers of both the fictious Moby Dick and the
fallible Bill Clinton are very similar in their results.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Republicans' failure to remove Clinton, it is
unlikely another impeachment attempt against a president will come
in the foreseeable future. The pain and misery that the impeachment
process put Congress and the American people through will stay with
this nation for years. But it should not be assumed that
impeachment will never be used again.
</P>
<P>
   As bipartisan as the Nixon impeachment hearings were, and as
serious and legitimate as the charges were against him, that did
not make the process any less painful for members of Congress or
the voters on either side of the political aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, with the nation now more aware of the downside of the
impeachment process because of what Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton
have gone through _ as well as what the respective Congresses have
endured _ Congress may be more inclined to find a way to make the
impeachment process less readily available.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the legal or legislative threshold for
impeachment should be so high as to ensure that any charge levied
against a president involves an issue or circumstance that truly
endangers this nation if he or she were to continue in office.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, House Republicans, by diminishing the original
purpose of the impeachment process, also diminished the presidency,
even more than Clinton's own conduct. By lowering the impeachment
bar when they went after Clinton, the House Republicans lowered the
great caution that comes with using such a powerful process.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Congress _ right after it gets rid of the
independent counsel statute _ should write laws making it harder to
impeach a president simply because one party outnumbers another. If
the impeachment process cannot be written out of the Constitution,
it should at least be made very difficult for any Congress to use
again without solid bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson and Clinton, the taint of impeachment should be
not on them, but on the irresponsible members of Congress who did
more harm to this country than either president. There should be a
consequence to Congress's reckless, partisan ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's time that the taint of the impeachment label was shifted
from Johnson and Clinton to the members of Congress who turned this
once noble idea into a shameful disgrace.

SOUNDTRACKS LEAD THE GRAMMY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for Grammy trends is an annual, brow-furrowing
exercise. This year, most pundits will take the easy way out by
pronouncing 1999 the ``Year of the Woman.'' After all, two of the
Top 3 awards _ for best record and best album _ are dominated by
female nominees Lauryn Hill, Celine Dion, Madonna, Brandy, Monica,
Sheryl Crow, and Shania Twain. Never have the men trailed so badly,
with the lone male entry for record of the year being the Goo Goo
Dolls for ``Iris.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet women have been leaping the barricades for the past several
years. That's nothing new. Instead, the most startling trend at
this year's Grammys is the unprecedented impact of soundtracks. The
Goo Goo Dolls figure into that, too, since ``Iris'' is from the
``City of Angels'' soundtrack, which also spawned the Alanis
Morissette hit ``Uninvited.'' And that song just happens to be up
for female rock vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Titanic'' soundtrack, which posted 26 million in global
sales, leads the way with five nominations for Dion's `My Heart
Will Go On,'' a song that was so pervasive that you might turn off
the radio if you heard it again today. But the numbers don't lie.
``Titanic'' was not only No. 1 on Billboard's year-end Top 200
sales chart, but was one of 22 soundtracks to make that list during
a year that saw soundtrack sales rise by 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other soundtracks reaping their share of Grammy nominations
include ``Armaggedon'' (which single-handedly revived Aerosmith's
career with the No. 1 pop hit ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing''),
``Hope Floats,'' ``Bulworth,'' ``Soul Food,'' ``Dr. Dolittle,'' and
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point last summer, three of the Top 5 albums were
soundtracks: ``Armaggedon,'' ``City of Angels,'' and ``Dr.
Dolittle.'' So it makes sense that Wednesday's Grammy telecast from
Los Angeles (on WBZ-TV, Channel 4, at 8 p.m.) will include a
special salute to music in movies that features Aerosmith
performing its hit. That will be followed by film composers James
Horner (``Titanic'') and John Williams (``Star Wars'') taking turns
with music of their own. Clip packages of memorable motion pictures
scenes will be shown behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connection between soundtracks and films has never been
more vibrant,'' said Michael Greene, president of the National
Academy of Arts and Sciences (the voting bloc for the Grammys)
during a phone interview this week. ``Not only have there been more
soundtracks issued, but you have to back up and remember some of
the reasons why _ not least of which is that many of the film
companies are also the owners of the music companies. So they've
found a good way to cross-promotionalize the music and films to
everybody's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sign of what's going on retail-wise,'' adds Greene. ``A
lot more soundtracks are released and when the public gets
interested in a film, they buy the soundtrack. And it doesn't hurt
if there's a hit or two lingering around in that soundtrack,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hits can mean Grammy glory. Aerosmith, for instance, is up
for best performance by a duo or group for ``I Don't Want to Miss a
Thing.'' It's a song they didn't write (Diane Warren holds that
honor) and took only two days to record. Getting a Grammy
nomination is a nice payback for such a small investment of time.
</P>
<P>
   Soundtracks help promote veteran bands and expose new acts,
while also giving consumers a compilation they can't get anywhere
else. But it's not all a silver lining, according to Butch Vig of
the band Garbage, which is up for album of the year for ``Version
2.0'' and had an earlier hit, ``Number One Crush,'' on the 1996
``Romeo and Juliet'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soundtracks can be dangerous for an artist,'' Vig said. ``It's
easy to get one song out, and it's an easy marketing tool. But it's
harder to have a career these days because of the quick fix and the
one-hit wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Grammys are also notable for a few landmarks:
</P>
<P>
   --Hill, the hip-hopper with the soulful voice, is the first
woman to ever land 10 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   --Twain is the first country singer to be nominated for the Top
3 awards _ record, song, and album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Kirk Franklin is the first gospel artist to get a nomination
for song of the year. It's for ``Lean on Me,'' which he'll perform
Wednesday with U2's Bono and Mary J. Blige. (Other performers on
the show include Twain, Hill, Madonna, Will Smith, Crow, Vince
Gill, Luciano Pavarotti, Dion and Andrea Bocelli in a duet, and
Wynton Marsalis in a Duke Ellington tribute.)
</P>
<P>
   --This is the first year for several new awards, two for dance
music, and one each for Latin, crossover classical, and traditional
R&AMP;B. All worthy additions.

THE GROSS 
The Hits, the Flops: The Summer That Ate Hollywood 
By Peter Bart 
St. Martin's Press, 311 pp., $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know what they did last summer at the movies. The question is
_ how did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Gross,'' author Peter Bart delivers a behind-the-scenes
look at the surprise hits and flops, the ego battles between stars
and producers, the marketing strategies that succeeded and failed,
and the zany insanity of last summer's movie season.
</P>
<P>
   Bart, editor in chief of Variety and a former studio executive
at Paramount and MGM/UA, is in a unique position both to gain
access to the players and confidently assess their remarks. Many of
the studio heads talk to him because they think he's one of them,
while stars and directors take his calls because of his unique
position as the editor of Hollywood's bible.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone interested in the inner workings of the movie
business, ``The Gross'' details many of the intriguing events
surrounding the making and release of films such as ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' ``Deep Impact,'' ``The Mask of Zorro,''
``Armageddon,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,''
``Bulworth,'' ``There's Something About Mary,'' and ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions raised and answered by Bart:
</P>
<P>
   Why did ``Godzilla,'' the most heavily hyped movie of the
sunmmer, fail? How did the intense rivalry between Robert Redford
and Warren Beatty influence the release of their pictures, ``The
Horse Whisperer'' and ``Bulworth''? How did long-shot contender
``Deep Impact'' bury the the big summer favorite ``Armageddon'' at
the box office?
</P>
<P>
   One part of the movie equation that doesn't escape Bart's sharp
eye is the entertainment media. The press prognosticators _ trying
to guess which films will be hits _ are often seen as adjuncts to a
film's advertising budgets. In fact, one of the reasons
``Godzilla'' failed so badly is that expectations, created by
summer preview articles, were so high. Time critic Richard Corliss
predicted that ``Godzilla'' would be the top film of the summer and
that the only issue was ``which film would come in second.''
</P>
<P>
   Since almost all of the movies are now on home video, the book
makes for an indispensable companion for those viewers captivated
by the many routes a movie can take on its way to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with ``The Gross'' is that it's not
footnoted and there are a bundle of unattributed quotes. Bart's
reputation is solid enough that there's no reason to question the
authenticity of the remarks, but it does diminish the overall
impact when anonymous executives get to take potshots without fear
of retribution. Bart focuses on so many films that there are times,
particularly in the case of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the casting
of Tom Hanks, when you wish he spent more time on those details and
less on the relatively insignificant ``Small Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that Bart, the Variety editor, is an
essential part of the problem as outlined by Bart, the author of
``The Gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart accuses the media of playing along with the studios by
publishing the gross receipts for a film's opening weekend. This
sort of publicity, provided by the studios and theaters, plays
right into the hands of the marketing machinery. As soon as the
first weekend grosses were published in the general media, studios
began shooting for the quick hit weekend score to generate
business. Subsequently, they started producing movies aimed for an
explosive opening, thus upping the ante for big-budget potential
blockbusters and diminishing the chances for smaller, more
sophisticated art films to break in through word-of-mouth. Yet it's
his publication that popularized the publication of weekend
grosses.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of these minor criticisms, ``The Gross'' is an
intelligent and informed tale of a business based more on gambling
than foresight.

HIGH-FLYING RHETORIC ON CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hyperbole Hotline has been inundated in recent days with
calls from Red Sox fans bewildered by what they've been hearing and
reading about Roger Clemens moving to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Confused callers have been tying up our lines day and night,
begging for help. As we've seen so many times in the past, there is
nothing like a Red Sox-related crisis to drive local commentators
to use figures of speech, hyperbole included.
</P>
<P>
   As a public service, here are a few Clemens questions typical of
those the Hyperbole Hotline has been catching on the fly, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read on the editorial page of Saturday's Boston Globe that
Clemens put the kibosh on spring by signing with the Yankees: ``Red
Sox pitchers and catchers report for spring training today, one of
the first signs of spring for New Englanders, but to many fans it
feels like the crocuses have frozen permanently in the ground.
Roger Clemens, the pitcher who got away, has compounded Boston's
loss by signing with the arch-foe . . .'' Is this hyperbole? Does
this mean that because Tom Tupa signed with the Jets there'll be no
autumn?
</P>
<P>
   A. The crocus reference is not hyperbole but a metaphor
representing the Eternal Winter that has descended upon the hearts
and minds of Sox fans because Clemens has seen fit to join the
Yankees. Even the normally sober denizens of the Globe's editorial
page can become unhinged when the Yankees stick it to the Sox. As
for your Tupa inquiry _ please, it's not in the same league.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I keep hearing people refer to the Clemens deal as a
``tragedy.'' Is this hyperbole?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. It's a simple statement of fact. Clemens in Yankee
pinstripes is a tragedy for Red Sox fans. They have brought
themselves low by their inability to deal with adversity, i.e., the
fact that the Yankees have a long and glorious history of
humiliating the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read in the sports pages that Clemens signing with the
Yankees is ``a nightmare scenario.'' Hyperbole?
</P>
<P>
   A. Hyperbole, as we at the Hyperbole Hotline never tire of
explaining, is an exaggeration or extravagant statement used for
emphasis or effect. Sometimes hyperbole, like beauty, is in the eye
of the beholder. Clemens's move to the Yankees may literally give
some Sox fans nightmares. For most, though, applying the phrase
``nightmare scenario'' to the Clemens situation would be an
exaggeration. It's merely the latest chapter in the continuing Red
Sox ``nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In all the media weeping and gnashing of teeth over the
Clemens deal, I was surprised to read in one sports column that
he's over the hill, that he won't do a thing for the Yankees, and
that the Red Sox' chances have never looked better. Is this
hyperbole or what?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not hyperbole but delusion, typical of the mania that
normally grips Sox fans this time of year. Boston fans have long
suffered from a kind of mass manic depression. Early in the season,
they exhibit classic symptoms: elation, grandiosity, inflated
expectations. Usually, the depression phase kicks in at midseason.
But this year the shock of the Clemens deal has brought it on
prematurely, although apparently not in the sports columnist in
question.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I heard one commentator say that Clemens signing with New
York is worse than Harry Frazee selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees.
This is hyperbole, surely.
</P>
<P>
   A. Indeed it is. Boston fans are so crazed with hatred and
resentment of the Yankees they tend to overlook the fact that
Clemens spent the last two seasons playing for Toronto. Thanks, by
the way, for giving the Hyperbole Hotline the opportunity to use
the name Harry Frazee, crazy name, crazy guy, to borrow a phrase
from one of our favorite publications.

   NEW RELEASES: ``Ronin'' _ If it's action you want, it's action
you get in this carefully crafted suspenser with the dependable
Robert De Niro leading the way. The chase scenes are the best since
``Bullitt,'' and they're even better in the DVD format where the
image density and sound quality add to the adrenaline rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pecker'' _ The devilish John Waters is up to his old tricks in
this story about a kid who becomes a famous celebrity photographer.
Frankly, Waters has cleaned up his act, losing some of the filth
that made him so interesting to some. But this is a pretty funny
movie about the celebrity culture that Waters wallows in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Bowl XXXII'' _ Not XXXIII, but DVD. The Broncos-Packers
1998 Super Bowl in the DVD format is remarkable for pigheads who
can't get enough pigskin. It allows the viewer to see plays from
dozens of angles. You can become your own TV sports director for
$29.95 from Polygram.

WHITE MEN CAN RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always been a hard-knock life for white boys who love black
noise.
</P>
<P>
   As a generation before heard the Beatles and Stones and picked
up guitars of their own, two decades of white kids have been raised
on the rhythm, the rhyme of rap. Listening to Run-DMC, Public
Enemy, and, more recently, the late Tupac Shakur and DMX, they
traded their guitar-hero dreams for two turntables and a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like Rodney Dangerfield, they get no respect.
</P>
<P>
   They've been called ``wiggers,'' a pejorative both cunning and
cruel. They've been publicly sullied as wack-wannabes by the
Offspring in the yowling punk-slap ``Pretty Fly (For a White
Guy).'' Typical lyric:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friends say he's trying too hard
</P>
<P>
   And he's not quite hip
</P>
<P>
   But in his own mind
</P>
<P>
   He's the, he's the dopest trip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Beastie Boys, who Spin magazine once lovingly called
``the boychiks with the most flava,'' have been around since the
1980s, and have enjoyed multiplatinum success, the most recent
being ``Hello Nasty.'' But when you get right down to it, they're
all dope samples and no skills whatsoever. 3rd Bass, with MC Serch
and Pete Nice, were the first white rappers with enough mike
prowess and street cred to catch the ear of urban radio in 1989
with ``The Cactus Album,'' but they quickly disbanded, although
there have been recent rumors of a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Everlast headed House of Pain, all shamrocks
and Sinn Fein tattoos, and spat out the fine malt lyrics of ``Jump
Around,'' before he had a heart attack, got acoustic, and started
strumming the white-boy blues on his current hit, ``What It's
Like.''
</P>
<P>
   But really, young white men in hip-hop have been defined _ and
defiled _ by knuckleheads like Vanilla Ice and Marky Mark, who sold
mad records, far more than most black rappers at the time, and made
just about every other white boy in a b-boy stance with a rhyme on
his lips instantly suspect. Like jazz, rap is an indigenous
African-American art form, and soon white rappers found themselves
victimized by the kind of ``Crow Jim'' mentality that dogged some
white jazz musicians in the 1960s _ if it's white, it ain't all
right. What Vanilla and Marky never received and never deserved is
what is essential to be taken seriously as a rapper _ props from
African-American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as rap music and hip-hop culture slide into their third
decade, there's a new posse of white rappers out to show-and-prove
that hip-hop is about skills, not skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Due to drop Tuesday is ``Slim Shady,'' the debut offering from
Eminem, whose video for the single ``My Name Is'' has been in a
Buzz Clip baby for the past few weeks on MTV. With its hilarious
spoofing of President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, and Marilyn Manson,
it's also in heavy rotation on the station's urban music showcase,
``MTV Jams.'' Now, to be blunt, the blond-haired, baby-faced rapper
looks more like a member of teen dreck hitmakers 'N Sync than the
protege busting rhymes for Dr. Dre, a founding member of N.W.A. and
the man who discovered Snoop Dogg and Warren G. Eminem. Eminem,
born Marshall Mathers and raised in a predominantly black Detroit
neighborhood, had been an underground freestylin' rage before Dre
caught the hype and and produced his debut.
</P>
<P>
   Let's ignore for a moment the same-old, same-old of Eminem
diatribes against women and gays _ hey, white folks have always
been as adept at hateful rhetoric as black folks. But more
important, and worth noting before the inevitable controversy
swamps everything else, is his embrace by the rap community, and
the big-ups he has received from such luminaries as Missy
``Misdemeanor'' Elliot and the monthly hip-hop bible, The Source.
He's being judged for his considerable abilities, not his race, and
he's proof that it's time to finally close the chasm between black
and white rappers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if anyone has a problem with that, they can take it up with
no less an authority than Chuck D, of the seminal rap group Public
Enemy, who recently told Rolling Stone, ``It's really irrelevant
what a person looks like and where they're from. . . . Saying `Just
because I'm black, I'm more hip-hop than you' _ that's got nothing
to do with skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, play that funky music, white boys.

CALCULATING IRA WITHDRAWALS; DETERMINING COST BASIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I will turn 70 1/2 on March 6 of this year. To avoid any IRS
penalty, when must I start making minimum withdrawals from my
traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts _ before April 1, 1999 or April
1, 2000? At the end of last year, the IRA balance was $44,052, and
the 401(k) balance was $257,019. Based on this information, what
will be the minimum amount of my withdrawals? Can you suggest a
safe investment for the withdrawals? Are there any mutual funds or
tax-exempt investments that would earn more than bank savings
accounts or certificates of deposit?
</P>
<P>
   B.M., Framingham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't need to make a withdrawal before April 1, 2000 _
but you might decide it's wiser to make the first before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rule specifies that the first withdrawal must come by April
1 of the year following the year in which you reach age 70 1/2. But
it also specifies that this is the withdrawal for the tax year in
which you reached that age milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you waited until April 1, 2000, to take the first
withdrawal, you would face two mandatory withdrawals falling in the
same tax year _ the one for 1999, when you reached 70 1/2, and
another for tax-year 2000. Therefore, chances are that you would
have a lower overall tax bill if the first withdrawal were taken
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the withdrawals depends not only on your age, but
also on the age of your beneficiary. In these calculations, your
age is determined as your age at your birthday for the year in
question.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose you and your beneficiary are both the same age.
You would look in the IRS charts under age 71, and get a joint life
and last survivor life expectancy of 19.8 years. You use that
figure as a divisor, so you would have to withdraw $2,225 from the
IRA and $12,981 from the 401(k) account.
</P>
<P>
   If your beneficiary is younger, the amount of the required
withdrawal would be lower; the figure would be higher if the
beneficiary is older than you are.
</P>
<P>
   As for a potential investment vehicle for the proceeds of these
withdrawals, why not consider Fidelity Spartan Massachusetts
Municipal Income fund, which provides a yield that is free of both
federal and state taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual funds, which rates this fund above average,
lists the current yield as 4.8 percent _ lower than some CD rates,
but much higher on an after-tax basis. Such a fund is not, of
course, as safe as CDs and other insured bank accounts _ the value
of your shares will rise and fall inversely to interest rate
changes.
</P>
<P>
   But over the long haul it should supply you with an attractive
tax-free income stream. The minimum initial investment in this fund
is $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. People write in stating that they have $500,000 here or
$700,000 there, or they will become multimillionaires by the time
they retire. Lucky them. But one subject I have never seen broached
is the question of how the poor little Schmo who has a modest IRA
should withdraw money from it. I know of two alternatives _ the
recalculated method and the time-certain method. The time-certain
method involves a fixed amount withdrawn each year based on life
expectancy, which continues to be paid to the estate each year
after death, without the remaining money being taxed. The
recalculated method is just that, with the withdrawal amount
recalculated each year based on the remaining life expectancy. But
I also understand that with the recalculation method, the IRA
account becomes subject to immediate lump-sum taxation either if
one spouse or both die. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   J.L., Oceanside, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With the time-certain method of calculating IRA withdrawals,
you begin with an initial determination of life expectancy and then
simply reduce that number by one as each year passes. It's not a
flat-rate withdrawal amount, as your explanation suggests.
</P>
<P>
   One result: If you or your beneficiary outlive the initial
projection of life expectancy, the account will be depleted while
the owner or beneficiary is still alive. With the recalculation
method, the divisor is reduced by less than one as each year
passes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you and your beneficiary are both age 71, the
tables project a life expectancy of 19.8 years; five years later,
when you are both 76, the figure has fallen only to 15.7. With the
recalculation method, the owner of the IRA is never required to
completely empty it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's let J.K. Lasser's ``Your Income Tax'' explain what happens
when an IRA owner or beneficiary dies: After the death of a
recalculating owner or recalculating spousal beneficiary, that
person's life expectancy is reduced to zero starting in the year
after the year of death.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if your spouse is your designated beneficiary and he or
she dies first, you must use your single life expectancy to figure
your minimum required distributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you die, your secondary beneficiary will have to
receive the entire account by the end of the year following the
year of your death. If you use the time-certain method, the
sequence of withdrawals that you began may be continued by your
beneficiary, following the same sequence that would have applied
had you lived.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, it's not the case that these withdrawals are tax free;
the benefit is simply that the new owner can spread the
withdrawals, and therefore the attendant tax liability, out over a
longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I purchased 200 shares of Citizens Utilities B stock on June
6, 1995 for $2,408. All dividends were paid in stock (and were
nontaxable until sold). On Sept. 15, 1998 I sold my entire position
for $1,648.82. How do I determine the correct cost basis for this
transaction?
</P>
<P>
   M.D., San Clemente, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your cost basis is $2,408, and you realized a $759.18 capital
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the dates upon which you received the additional
shares as stock dividends, you can treat the entire transaction as
a long-term capital loss, since the holding period of a tax-free
stock dividend or stock received in a split starts from the time
you acquired the original stock, according to J.K. Lasser's ``Your
Income Tax.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would you advise for a 79-year-old widow with only
$300,000 to invest? I know absolutely nothing about the stock
market. The money is now in five CDs, with $200,000 worth maturing
this year and the other $100,000 in 2003. With the drop in interest
rates, it will be a daunting task to reinvest. I get $657 a month
from Social Security and the rest of my income comes from the CDs.
A brokerage firm suggests a wrap account, starting at $100,000, but
charging 1.5 percent to 2 percent to manage. In a previous column,
you thought well of AARP's GNMA and U.S. Treasury fund. Is this a
possibility for me?
</P>
<P>
   B.R., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure, it's a good fund, and designed for people in your
situation.
</P>
<P>
   But I wouldn't put all of my eggs in that basket. I would put
half of the money from maturing CDs in this fund, reinvesting the
other half in new CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the AARP fund currently has a yield of about 6.5 percent,
chances are that even with the lower yield on the new CDs that
you'd be buying, you would end up with about the same income stream
as you now enjoy. There would be additional risk _ the fund invests
in federally guaranteed bonds, but their current market value rises
and falls as interest rates change.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a conservative and well-managed fund, and over the
long haul you should enjoy a good income stream and see little
change in your principal value.
</P>
<P>
   But you should read the prospectus carefully and understand that
such funds can provide a bumpy short-term ride, and if you're
uncomfortable with the effect of choppy bond markets on your
principal, you shouldn't buy the fund.

THE CRIME OF SHEILA MCGOUGH 
By Janet Malcolm. Knopf. 164 pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Janet Malcolm's splendid curiosity, enlivened by her own
self-scrutiny, makes her a formidable reporter. (I, for one, would
never let her in the door.) Amassing the quotidian details of her
subjects' lives _ their patterns of speech, what they hang on their
walls and serve in their kitchens _ she interprets the data to
flush out the inscrutable character within. In her two books on
psychoanalysis, poor Dr. Green (a pseudonym) and Jeffrey Masson
(alas, the real McCoy) bore the brunt of her intelligence; in ``The
Journalist and the Murderer,'' she managed to make her own
profession seem as suspect as the crimes it sought to cover. Even
her study of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, ``The Silent Woman,''
which carved a sure-footed path through that literary minefield,
had a particularly courteous but deadly way of delivering its cast.
It was the lasagna that served up the fatal blow. When biographer
Jacqueline Rose had Malcolm to dinner, she left out a crucial white
sauce from her main dish and then worried about it all through the
meal. You couldn't help rethinking your opinion a little of this
scholarly authority: Now Rose seemed scattered and a bit
ineffectual; if she'd forgotten the sauce, who knew what she'd
omitted from her book on Plath?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crime of Sheila McGough,'' a tuna casserole is the
lethal weapon _ one of several crystalline moments that explain
Sheila McGough in a way no court transcript could ever accomplish.
A central theme in Malcolm's work is the way in which narratives
compete to form a dominant version of the truth, which is partly
what drew her to the legal and he-said/she-said swampland of this
woman's case. A Virginia attorney who was found guilty in 1990 of
14 felony counts for assisting her client with his fraudulent
schemes, McGough was disbarred and went to jail for three years.
When Malcolm met her, she was 54 and just out of prison; the
mastermind con artist behind her conviction, Bob Bailes, had died
the year before, so that McGough felt free to speak out about her
trial. She was wearing pearls and a navy blue suit _ Barbara
Stanwyck could have played her in the movie _ and seemed as
guileless as she was oblivious to her own mind-glazing recitations
of fact. So began a collusion with Malcolm that produced this
story, which underscores McGough's probable innocence but also
elucidates her fall.
</P>
<P>
   Intent upon protecting Bailes from prosecution for his infinite
scams (among them, selling nonexistent real estate and insurance
companies), McGough made a couple of near-idiotic moves as Bailes's
lawyer that put her directly in the line of fire. (She allowed him
to use her trust account for a $75,000 deposit from his dupe
investors with no questions asked.) The prosecutors who went after
her were unwilling or unable to see her as anything other than
Bailes's passionate accomplice; McGough, who refused to implicate
Bailes by testifying in her own defense, made matters worse with
what Malcolm calls her ``legal fundamentalism'' _ ``she was like a
trailer truck jackknifed across a highway.'' From the moment she
appears in this narrative, McGough comes across as a zealot with a
hatpin: a good-hearted, naive woman who put her faith in a
pathologically charming crook. Ingenuousness alone might have saved
her. But she is also maddeningly literal _ Malcolm, trapped on the
phone with her for hours, wrote little notes to herself: ``Help,
help! I'm trapped talking to Sheila.'' She seems to have had a
similar effect on every player in the legal system, from the team
for the prosecution to her own attorneys. ``Have you ever eaten
with Sheila?'' her appeal lawyer asked Malcolm. ``She sent back the
coffee three times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crime of Sheila McGough'' is a labyrinthine, occasionally
funny and finally sad story, not least because Malcolm understands
the courtroom of emotional interaction, where truth is relative and
the worst (and most puzzling) motivations are unconscious. Her
Bailes is a swindler with a golden tongue who could turn Scripture
out of a Xerox machine; even one of his several federal
prosecutors, whom he called ``the meanest woman in Charlotte,''
remembers him fondly. Bailes's detractors and sidekicks each have a
story to tell that explains utterly how such a mess _ McGough's
near-certain miscarriage of justice _ could have come out of such a
bigger mess (the legal and psychic quagmire she helped create).
With its endless loops and deceits posing as recriminations, the
story seems custom-made for Malcolm's breed of intelligence, which
relishes the enigmas of the human drama and seems undeterred by its
crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the real force of this somewhat slight,
ordinary-con-game story: that Malcolm turned it into a fascinating
narrative, peopled by half-saints and blackguards who all believe
their own game. The first sentence of the book reminded me of M. F.
K. Fisher's great line about an oyster leading a thrilling life:
``The transcripts of trials at law,'' writes Malcolm, ``_ even of
routine prosecutions and tiresome civil disputes _ are exciting to
read.'' Now, nothing could be further from the truth: Most legal
transcripts are duller than K Mart on a Saturday night. But not to
Malcolm, who is insatiably meddlesome, frightfully smart, and can
make a three-card-monte hustle seem like a medieval mystery play.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, of course, there is Sheila McGough and that tuna
casserole, which her octogenarian mother served one night when
Malcolm stayed for dinner. The protagonist of this tale is a
fiercely determined woman who went to jail to protect her
rapscallion client, but who has lived most of her life with her
parents in a quiet Virginia suburb. The casserole was
``incomparable,'' Malcolm tells us, ``and I fell easily into my
role of the nice friend Sheila had brought home from school to meet
her mom and dad.'' No portrait of innocence was ever more damning,
revealing, and compassionate at once.

STUDY RENEWS DEBATE ON PSYCHOSIS-INDUCING RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study showing that the anesthetic ketamine kills brain cells
in developing rats has added to a debate over using it in pregnant
women and children, and it has injected a surprising new element
into a controversy over psychiatric research involving the
chemical.
</P>
<P>
   One national organization of anesthesiologists discussed the
implications of the finding this weekend at a scientific meeting in
Las Vegas, although no action was taken, and a second group plans
to take up the issue in May in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of psychiatric studies using ketamine seized on the rat
brain research, published in the journal Science. They have
attacked as unethical several federally-funded studies that
involved giving ketamine and other drugs to mentally ill patients
to induce symptoms of psychosis. The studies were a focus of a
Globe series in November, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While the authors of the rat study and anesthesiologists say
it's too soon to draw conclusions about effects in humans based on
the animal data, they say the results call for further
investigation. Ketamine is no longer widely used for anesthesia in
pregnant women or children, but under certain circumstances it
still offers benefits that outweigh any risks, say
anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   But the study's authors say it's not too soon to issue a warning
to pregnant women based on the study's findings: Don't abuse
ketamine _ used on the streets for its hallucinogenic properties
under the name ``Special K'' _ or any other drugs, including
alcohol, laughing gas or the street drug PCP, that appear to act on
the same so-called NMDA receptor in the developing brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message that should be conveyed to the public is that
abusing these drugs during pregnancy is very unwise _ in fact,
irresponsible,'' said Dr. John W. Olney, professor of psychiatry
and neuropathology at Washington University School of Medicine in
St. Louis, and one of the authors of the study in the Jan. 1 issue
of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which involved newborn and fetal rats, found that up
to 30 percent of developing neurons in parts of the rat brain
committed ``cell suicide'' _ apoptosis _ when exposed to ketamine,
PCP (also known as angel dust), MK-801 and another drug that blocks
the cells' NMDA receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Such cell death was observed about 24 hours after a single high
dose of one of the drugs was given to block NMDA receptors for at
least eight hours. The blocking action apparently prevents certain
brain chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, from fitting into
the NMDA receptors at a critical point in brain development,
leading to cell death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many millions, probably billions, of nerve cells have that
receptor . . . in the context of a brain that has trillions of
nerve cells,'' said Olney in an interview. ``The number of neurons
that can be deleted from the brain by this mechanism is somewhere
in the range of probably 10 million or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies of NMDA receptors in Olney's lab and elsewhere
have led to the hypothesis that the receptors are somehow involved
in schizophrenia. That helped prompt a recent line of psychiatric
research using ketamine to induce psychotic symptoms in people with
schizophrenia and in healthy volunteers, in an attempt to
understand the biology of psychosis and perhaps one day come up
with better treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One leading critic of this research said the new rat study
raises even more questions about administering ketamine to induce
psychotic symptoms in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really confirms further the Boston Globe series, that the
use of these toxic substances without medical benefit to these
patients was inappropriate,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of
Maryland bioethicist who co-founded, along with Vera Hassner
Sharav, a New York-based advocacy group called Citizens for
Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research.
</P>
<P>
   But Olney said he did not believe his latest study has a bearing
on the psychiatric research, since it looked at developing rat
brains, not adult rat brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for it to be relevant, these studies would have to be
performed on pregnant women. I don't know that they are being
performed on pregnant women. I certainly don't think they are,''
said Olney. ``If they chose to admit some subjects to their study
who are six-month-old infants, then there might be some relevance.
But I don't believe anybody is doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Olney's co-authors, Dr. Chrysanthy Ikonomidou of Humboldt
University in Berlin, said the study suggests that cell death
prompted by ketamine in the developing brain could be linked to
schizophrenia later in life. A number of human studies have found
an association between abnormalities in cells with NMDA receptors
and schizophrenia in adults, without establishing why the
abnormalities occurred, she said. Animal research is now being done
to look at cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier animal study out of Olney's lab did look at ketamine
and adult rat brains, and it found that high doses of the chemical
created temporary vacuoles, or cavities within cells.
</P>
<P>
   While Olney said the formation of vacuoles ``is a form of
toxicity,'' the cavities closed up on their own, suggesting that
there's probably nothing to worry about in adult humans exposed to
smaller doses, as in some of the psychiatric research.
</P>
<P>
   For Shamoo, however, the important question is not whether
animal studies have proven that ketamine causes permanent brain
damage, but whether giving ketamine to people with mental illness
to study psychosis is ethical at all, when there is no medical
benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't use people as a means to an end,'' Shamoo said. He
also doesn't buy the argument that because the animal research has
documented only temporary vacuoles in adult rat brains, it is safe
for the psychiatric research can go on.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National Institute of
Mental Health, has suspended clinical involving ketamine at the
institute's own facilities on the grounds that they lack scientific
merit, and the federal agency is reviewing its funding of similar
outside research.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman declined in an interview earlier this month to discuss
whether the animal studies involving ketamine have a bearing on the
psychiatric research. Psychiatric researchers say animal studies
involve doses of ketamine much higher than those used in their
research.
</P>
<P>
   The dosages in the Science rat study are also much higher than
those used to anesthetize humans, researchers say, though the agree
the findings suggest a need for more research.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine was more widely used as an anesthetic about 15 years
ago, until its hallucinogenic effects were noted. (Ketamine causes
such effects only in adults, not children.) Better anesthetics have
since become available, but ketamine has the advantage of not
lowering blood pressure or blocking airways and is still useful for
patients in shock or with severe asthma, say anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a leap to incriminate ketamine based on that
article,'' said Dr. David Birnbach, president of the Society for
Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, which will be discussing the
study at its annual meeting in May. But, he added, ``I do believe
there are some subtle risks we do now have to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank McGowan, an anesthesiologist at Children's Hospital in
Boston and an officer of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia,
sought to reassure parents worried about children undergoing
anesthesia. ``Our drugs are very safe,'' said McGowan, whose
society discussed the study over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that ketamine was more widely used, no long-term
consequences were documented, McGowan noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issues raised by the article are in fact real''
and bear further investigation, he said, but ``it still is a drug
that has its place.''

IV BAG HAZARDS ARE ALLEGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most IV bags and tubing used in US hospitals can leach trace
amounts of a toxic chemical into the veins of patients, according
to a coalition of health and environmental groups, posing
particular risk for kidney dialysis patients or others who need
extensive intravenous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Health Care Without Harm, an alliance of 160 groups such as the
American Nursing Association and Physicians for Social
Responsibility, were to issue a national ``health alert'' Monday
(Feb. 22) warning that IV bags and tubing made of polyvinyl
chloride contain the same toxic ingredient that manufacturers
removed from toys under pressure from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lab tests show that some of the ingredient, called DEHP,
leaches into the intravenous fluid and is infused into patients
along with their medication. Already, the makers of drugs such as
Taxol recommend against the use of vinyl bags when administering
the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the manufacturers of medical products to phase out
polyvinyl chloride use and switch over to safer materials,'' said
Dr. Ted Schettler of Greater Boston Physicians for Social
Responsibility. ``There is compelling evidence that patients are
being exposed to this chemical at levels that are of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Baxter Health Care Corp., based in Deerfield, Ill.,
the top manufacturer of vinyl IV bags, said that 40 years of
experience with millions of patients had shown no ``significant
adverse affects'' from exposure to chemicals in their IV bags.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company issued a statement acknowledging that some
customers have raised concern about the safety of DEHP. ``To meet
the preferences of these customers, Baxter has developed a variety
of containers made without DEHP,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Pennsylvania-based B. Braun/McGaw, the leading
supplier of IV bags without DEHP, said Baxter isn't giving up
easily. They said Baxter recently supplied vinyl bags under an
unusually low bid to win over one of B. Braun/McGaw's biggest
customers, the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 80 percent of the 500 million IV bags sold annually
in the United States are made of polyvinyl chloride. To give IV
bags their characteristic flexibility and transparency, DEHP, a
member of the chemical family called phthalates, is added.
</P>
<P>
   The main alternative, a multilayered film bag, is stiffer than
the polyvinyl chloride, but widely accepted in hospitals. B.
Braun/McGaw controls 20 percent of the US market, including
hospitals such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute in New
York. In Boston, New England Medical Center is studying a switch.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the health effects of DEHP remain hotly
debated. The Environmental Protection Agency lists DEHP as a
probable cause of liver cancer, based on tests in rodents, but some
scientists say the results are irrelevant to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Burlington at the Food and Drug Administration said
DEHP is toxic in high doses _ it's been linked to heart, testicle
and liver damage _ but not in the extremely small quantities
getting into IV fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that IV bags, blood administration sets and the
other uses of PVC, including dialysis tubing are safe,'' said
Burlington, director of FDA's center for devices and radiological
health.
</P>
<P>
   But Health Care Without Harm activists say health care providers
shouldn't take needless risk with DEHP, which can reach
concentrations in intravenous solutions up to 830 times higher than
EPA allows in drinking water, according to an analysis by the
environmental group, Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Schettler conceded that people are exposed to DEHP from a
variety of sources, including food containers, and that exposure
from a single IV bag is usually modest. However, Schettler said
that the danger becomes significant for patients who require
repeated infusions, especially young children.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugmakers are already taking precautions. Taxol, used to
treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma as well as ovarian and breast
cancer, and Taxotere, a breast cancer medication, carry a warning
against administering them in polyvinyl chloride bags.
</P>
<P>
   Activists at Virginia-based Health Care Without Harm questioned
why regulators hadn't already taken action on IV bags. The Consumer
Product Safety Commission called for voluntary restrictions on DEHP
in toys in 1986, pushing toymakers to remove a similar phthalate
from a few rattlers and teething toys last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration ``has been asleep at the wheel
on this,'' said Bill Ravenesi of Health Care Without Harm's Boston
office.

MORE SUBSTANCE, LESS STYLE FROM   WHITAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pernell Whitaker's game always has been about
deception, but Saturday night he was only deceiving himself.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years Whitaker has been one of the most masterful boxers
in the sport's long history. A sleight-of-hand expert since he was
8, Whitaker followed in the footsteps of the Hartford Will o' the
Wisp, Willie Pep, often winning rounds without having to throw a
punch and winning fights by inflicting more mental damage than
physical on his often bewildered and always frustrated opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, Whitaker was beaten
up for the first time in his life. Time did the damage, with
assists from International Boxing Federation welterweight champion
Felix Trinidad and Whitaker's out-of-the-ring lifestyle. Together
they broke his jaw, cut his right eyelid, knocked him down, and
beat him back without beating him down.
</P>
<P>
   For seven rounds, the 35-year-old Whitaker was still Sweet Pea,
although not quite as sweet as before a self-imposed 16-month
layoff for twice testing positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   For seven rounds, he dipped and dodged and jabbed, jabbed,
jabbed, drawing first blood by turning Trinidad's nose red and
leaving dots of crimson on the younger man's white, satin shorts.
</P>
<P>
   But by then he'd also been dropped once by a straight right hand
so fast and true he neither could avoid it nor react to it anymore,
and in that seventh round _ his last as Sweet Pea _ he twice hurt
Trinidad but got clipped again himself. After that he would go down
five times, none of them knockdowns but all of them signs his body
had begun to surrender to the calendar and its 26-year-old
representative from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   He went down from a push, from a low blow, from bad balance and
good judgment, and several times simply because after he went into
his trademark low squat to avoid a punch his legs refused to push
him back up. Instead they buckled as he slipped to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Six times Whitaker hit the canvas, often without a punch
landing. Six warnings that it was time for him to leave the stage.
Whitaker had promised before the fight he would do just that if he
could see the tools were no longer there, saying, ``If they're gone
and I can't do what I've always done, I know they won't come back
the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it was over and he had lost a unanimous 12-round
decision by a wide margin to Trinidad, Whitaker's pride and
gameness _ two things that allowed a man who stands only 5 feet 6
inches to win six world titles in four weight divisions _ took over
and he refused to admit he had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did worse. He insisted he had won when it was
obvious he had not. To be sure, Whitaker had not disgraced himself.
He had, in fact, made the younger, bigger, stronger, faster man
look bad at times, especially before Whitaker suddenly began to age
in the eighth round. But by the end of the fight no one but
Whitaker still was trying to make a case for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``More punches, better punches,'' said Lou Duva, who has handled
Whitaker's career since his gold medal days on the 1984 Olympic
team. ``The other guy won.''
</P>
<P>
   The words had to have been bitter ones for Duva to spit out but
he is a realist in a game of dreamers. He knew the night they gave
the nod to Jose Luis Ramirez in 1988 and the draw to Julio Cesar
Chavez in 1993 and maybe even the decision to Oscar De La Hoya two
years ago that the judges had lied or been blind or both. Those
nights belonged to Pernell Whitaker regardless of the fiction on
the scorecards, but this one did not.
</P>
<P>
   This time the two 118-109 cards might have been a bit harsh but
the 117-110 wasn't far off. The Globe saw it a more kindly 116-112,
but nobody saw it close over the final five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That probably included Whitaker, although he never could admit
it. If he was that kind of guy he never would have lasted this long
or won so often, so for this one night you let him live a fiction
on the way to St. Vincent's Hospital to get his possibly fractured
jaw examined and hoped in a week or two he would remember what he
said in a Las Vegas hotel room a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tools aren't there Feb. 20, I won't go in again,'' he
said. ``The 13 years have been great. I've done some great things.
I'm happy with those 13 years. What I've done is in the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was the best pound-for-pound. I don't have to
pronounce that. It's on paper. No one could fight my style. You
can't teach what I got. When I'm gone, no one will ever be able to
fight that style again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Felix Trinidad couldn't fight that style, and so
even though he won a battle he lost the war of public opinion to
his World Boxing Council rival, De La Hoya, who had fought far more
furiously against undefeated Ike Quartey in defending his share of
the 147-pound championship a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, Pernell Whitaker couldn't fight that style
anymore either. Trinidad connected with 54 percent of the 512
punches he threw, landing 44 more blows than Whitaker, even though
Whitaker launched 237 more punches.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in that is one Whitaker will understand if he chooses
to heed it. The lesson is no one can fight his style anymore. Not
even him.

DIFFERENT TRAINING CAMPS LIKE SALT AND PEPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ They are salt and pepper, ebony and ivory,
Kennedy and Nixon, Schwarzenegger and DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Yankee spring training camp in Tampa and then there
is the Red Sox spring training camp in Fort Myers. I went back and
forth over the weekend and the contrast was painfully clear.
</P>
<P>
   The world champion Yankees had their first formal workout for
pitchers and catchers Thursday. Roger Clemens _ who used to arrive
late when he worked for the Red Sox _ reported to the Yankees
Saturday and began workouts immediately. He said he would ask for
no special treatment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitchers and catchers worked out for the first time
Sunday and the Sox' $75 million ace, Pedro Martinez, was absent,
reportedly because he's back in the Dominican for his father's
birthday party. Meanwhile, Rich Garces was absent with the
proverbial visa problems (could it be he didn't make weight at
customs?).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees worked out in shiny new Legends Field, across the
street from the giant stadium where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers routed
the Patriots in the infamous mosh pit game of 1997. Yankees fans
sat in the stands and watched the action. The Red Sox worked out at
their minor league complex in the swamplands of Fort Myers. Sox
fans stood around behind ropes.
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge ownership presence in the Yankee camp. General
George Steinbrenner wheels into the stadium lot each day and prowls
the premises, making sure everything is done right. The Boss is
available for comment on any and every issue. He'll even talk about
the potential Senate race between Hillary Clinton and Rudy
Guiliani.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ownership presence at the Red Sox practice site,
unless you want to count limited partner Dr. Arthur Pappas, who
Sunday administered physicals to Red Sox players. The Red Sox are
owned by an Oz-like invisible trust and invisible man John
Harrington is the caretaker of that trust. Say what you want about
Steinbrenner, at least he is an accountable owner with his own
money invested in the franchise. He doesn't hide or complain about
``60 years of unfair criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a cadre of full-time and spring training
coaches who inspire memories of the franchise's golden days. Rich
Gossage, Willie Randolph, Ron Guidry, and Chris Chambliss were
among those leading the charge out of the dugout Saturday. All of
them appeared in the 1978 playoff game at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox boast Jim Rice as a hitting coach, and a group of
hard-working instructors with little history in the Boston
organization. Carl Yastrzemski will be down later to work with Sox
minor league hitters. Happily, the Sox camp is also graced by the
ubiquitous presence of 79-year-old Johnny Pesky.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees camp features a horde of Japanese media covering the
continuing saga of Hideki Irabu. Camp Red Sox this spring is being
shared by the Samsung Lions of the Korean professional league. The
blue-and-white-clad Lions work at least eight hours per day at the
complex. Their presence quietly mocks the short work day of major
league ballplayers in Florida. The Lions drill hour after hour,
then return to the camp at night for batting practice in the cages.
</P>
<P>
   There are a million interesting stories in Yankee land. Darryl
Strawberry is recovering from a bout with cancer and battling to
win back the left field job. ``El Duque'' Hernandez is the subject
of a book and possible television special. And now there is
Clemens, joining David Cone and Andy Pettitte atop the New York
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' top stories will be the arrival of Jose Offerman, the
$26 million replacement for Mo Vaughn; the emergence of Nomar
Garciaparra as franchise player; Jeff Frye's recovery from knee
surgery; and Trot Nixon's long-awaited debut as a starting right
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Legends Field, there's a billboard touting the
Yankees as 24-time world champions. The marquee outside the stadium
cites Time magazine's declaration that the 1998 (125-win) Yankees
were the greatest team ever. The Red Sox no longer boast about
1918.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most chilling contrast is that of the respective
general managers. Yankees GM Brian Cashman, a 31-year-old whiz kid,
walks around the field, the clubhouse, and the press area,
available for comment on any and every baseball issue. He's
refreshingly candid, loves talking baseball, and actually said,
``Part of our job is to anticipate questions you might ask.''
Cashman readily explained the sequence of events that led to New
York's offseason signing of Bernie Williams and the conversations
that resulted in the Clemens trade.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Myers, quote-starved reporters wait for some word from
joyless GM Dan Duquette. The Duke hasn't been around all week. His
arrival was delayed until  &UR; today &LR;  by the flu that's hit so many New
Englanders this winter. In his absence, the Sox issue statements
that always sound like they were scripted by the Tass News Agency.
The releases usually start, ``Executive Vice President and General
Manager Dan Duquette announced  &UR; today &LR;  that . . .''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Duquette announced that Sox first base coach Dave
Jauss managed his team to the Caribbean World Series title. Why
does Duquette have to announce Jauss's triumph? The games were on
television. This is akin to the Sox releasing a statement reading,
``Executive Vice President and General Manager Dan Duquette
announced last night that the Red Sox lost to the Yankees, 11-2.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means anything this morning. The Red Sox and
Yankees remain tied atop the American League East with identical
records of 0-0. But the Yankees were 22 games ahead of Boston last
year and just added Clemens. The Sox subtracted Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably too much to expect the Sox to compete with the
Yankees. But the Duquette Sox are in danger of committing a more
grievous sin.
</P>
<P>
   They might be boring.

BAR OWNERS FUME OVER ANTI-SMOKING ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The police and public health officials have
fined 48 smoking offenders, including eight tavern owners, in a
three-week sweep that has re-ignited debate about the California
law snuffing out smoking in bars.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was slow to begin enforcing the law because of
complaints from bar owners that it would destroy business, but
recently began enforcement under pressure from health
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that they're stepping up to the plate to enforce
the law finally,'' said Diane Kaiser of the American Lung
Association's Smoke-Free Bar Program.
</P>
<P>
   The lung and heart associations lobbied City Hall hard last year
to enforce the law, getting little support from Mayor Willie Brown.
City Attorney Louise Renne brokered a deal that led to the current
enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance has been far from uniform. A recent survey by the San
Francisco Department of Public Health revealed about half the bars
in the city were ignoring the no-smoking rule.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Breslin, the senior health inspector coordinating the
enforcement operation, said for the next two weeks, a four-person
task force, including two police officers, would target
establishments that have drawn the most complaints about ignoring
the law. A wider and more random strategy will follow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a resistance movement is evolving. Bar owners or patrons
warn others of the sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd set up a phone tree,'' Breslin said. ``When we went in
these places, there was smoke everywhere, but nobody had any
cigarettes. It was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 11 letter, health director Mitchell Katz and Police
Chief Fred Lau warned the nearly 900 bar owners in San Francisco to
expect enforcement action to follow. Within two weeks, the task
force was writing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Among those slapped with a $76 fine: Norman Hobday, 65, who
poured his first whiskey shot 47 years ago. Hobday, the owner of
Eddie Rickenbacker's Hat in the Ring, said that for as long as he
can remember, has lighted his cigars for a moment to add flavor
before he chews them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a health inspector cited him for smoking in his own
bar; Hobday said the stogey wasn't lighted for more than 30
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just putting it out,'' Hobday said.
</P>
<P>
   Hobday said he and other bar owners have taken a financial hit
because of the law. ``It's a killer. Business is off 15 to 20
percent here. It doesn't make a lot of sense to do that to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, passed in 1994, is intended to protect restaurant
employees from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Stand-alone bars,
which hold 11 percent of liquor licenses, were phased into the
regulations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaints from restaurant and bar trade associations
about lost business, figures from the state Board of Equalization
show tax receipts from bars and bar-restaurant combinations were up
in the first quarter of 1998 _ the first year the ban covered bars
_ compared with the same period the year before.
</P>
<P>
   A report last year in the American Journal of Public Health
found no change in revenue at establishments in San Luis Obisbo,
Davis, Palo Alto and several other California jurisdictions where
local smoking prohibitions preceded the state rule.
</P>
<P>
   Not all bartenders oppose the law.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Metika of Uncle Bert's Place in San Francisco's Castro
district said she was alarmed when her doctor asked her almost two
years ago how long she had been smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even smoke,'' Metika said.
</P>
<P>
   She quit the bar job, but returned early last year when the
smoking ban took effect.

UNIONS AID INS IN OUSTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA GRACE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Immigration officials in upstate New York rely
heavily on a small pool of informants among labor activists who
regularly tip off the authorities when they find illegal immigrants
working in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials acknowledge they make efforts to root out
illegal immigrants, though they say it is in the interest of
ensuring better working conditions for everyone. U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service officials say that about one-fourth of
their cases in the region come from union tipsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of different types of policing of construction
projects because many of these agencies are so short staffed. We
help ourselves out, we help them out,'' said Daniel M. Boody,
secretary of the painters and glaziers union in Buffalo. Boody said
he coordinates with the INS and other agencies regularly.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical example in January, 10 undocumented Mexicans were
detained by INS agents near a hotel construction in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The tip came from the local painter's union, whose members
walked the site and talked to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Union workers say they are helping to ensure that work is done
in safe conditions, at standard wages and in a regulated
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are breaking the law and undermining existing
conditions _ wage and safety conditions _ that is what our job
is,'' said Harold L. Joyce, president of the Tri-City building
trades. ``That is what we do: We try to make working conditions
better for all workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics wonder if they are overstepping their bounds by
acting as the eyes and ears of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would almost seem counterproductive for unions, who
represent the interest of workers ... to report them to the
immigration service,'' said Christina Chavez Cook, an attorney with
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
Washington, D.C. ``It leaves the worker without a job and does
absolutely nothing to the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   When INS finds illegal workers at a site, the immigrants are
detained and normally deported. The employers are investigated and
can be fined up to $2,000 per worker if it can be proved they
knowingly hired illegal workers.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials welcome the help from a network of labor
informers. ``I have a small staff,'' said Gary L. Hale, the officer
in charge in Albany. ``We develop the lead as much as possible and,
when we get a good guy who gives us good information, we take the
leads very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials elsewhere say they take a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen McInnis, a district council representative for the New
York City District Council of Carpenters, said his organizers focus
on problems involving safety and other regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our agents might use the INS. It's a discretionary
thing,'' he said, adding that the urge to call the INS may be born
out of frustration with either the inaction or inefficiencies of
the other enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Union agents in upstate New York say they don't hesitate to call
immigration officers. ``They are a public authority, we have their
phone number, and when we know for sure there may be undocumented
people working, then we call,'' Boody said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against immigrants,'' said Austin Devine, a member
of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades in
Albany. ``We are against illegal immigrants that come into the
area, take our work, take our money, don't pay taxes and who don't
leave any of it behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Devine is an immigrant who arrived from Belfast, Northern
Ireland, in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin R. Hick of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America said, ``We feel like our members are part of
this community, and they should be doing the work in this
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Joyce: ``If I find what I believe to be illegal workers, I
call INS. Who you going to call _ ghostbusters?''

   SCI-MASSACRE-ANTHROPOLOGY (Guatemala City) _ Based on accounts
of four survivors and people in neighboring communities, 376 people
in an isolated Mayan hamlet of Guatemala died in a massacre by army

<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Philadelphia) _ A colony of 54 rhesus monkeys
are pioneers in a bold medical frontier, the treatment of disease
by reprogramming the body's genetic instructions. Gene therapy, as
it is hopefully known, has long been a field of high promise and
low fulfillment. But inserting genes into human cells in full
working order has proved to be exasperatingly difficult. Along with
a batch of recent experiments at other universities, the Penn
monkeys represent one of the few rays of hope in a series of
setbacks. Not only do six of them now carry a newly inserted gene
that makes a therapeutic protein, but the gene can be switched on
at will by giving the monkey a simple pill. By Nicholas Wade. (2100

   SCI-MADCOW-DEER (Undated) _ As a 30-year-old deer hunter lies

   SCI-SYNESTHESIA (Undated) _ For years, people with a condition
known as synesthesia _ in which the customary boundaries between
the senses appear to break down, sight mingling with sound, or
taste with touch _ received little attention. But in the past 10
years, the arrival of imaging techniques and other new technologies
for studying the brain at work has revived interest in synesthesia
by a core of researchers who hope that the condition will give a
greater understanding of all kinds of perception or even shed light
on the nature of consciousness itself. By Erica Goode. (1700 words)

   _ Siblings are fighting as much as ever, but many parents are
letting them go at it, according to a new study that surveyed
parents about conflict management strategies they felt confident
exercising. Although most parents didn't feel that non-intervention
was the best conflict management response, while being observed
they used it three times as often as other strategies. (375 words)

improved prognosis for patients found little empirical support for

   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Philadelphia) _ A colony of 54 rhesus monkeys
are pioneers in a bold medical frontier, the treatment of disease
by reprogramming the body's genetic instructions. Gene therapy, as
it is hopefully known, has long been a field of high promise and
low fulfillment. But inserting genes into human cells in full
working order has proved to be exasperatingly difficult. Along with
a batch of recent experiments at other universities, the Penn
monkeys represent one of the few rays of hope in a series of
setbacks. Not only do six of them now carry a newly inserted gene
that makes a therapeutic protein, but the gene can be switched on
at will by giving the monkey a simple pill. By Nicholas Wade. (2100

   SCI-SYNESTHESIA (Undated) _ For years, people with a condition
known as synesthesia _ in which the customary boundaries between

taste with touch _ received little attention. But in the past 10
years, the arrival of imaging techniques and other new technologies
for studying the brain at work has revived interest in synesthesia
by a core of researchers who hope that the condition will give a
greater understanding of all kinds of perception or even shed light
on the nature of consciousness itself. By Erica Goode. (1700 words)

   _ Siblings are fighting as much as ever, but many parents are
letting them go at it, according to a new study that surveyed
parents about conflict management strategies they felt confident
exercising. Although most parents didn't feel that non-intervention
was the best conflict management response, while being observed
they used it three times as often as other strategies. (375 words)

   BAALBEK, Lebanon _ Details make any story come alive. The ruins
at Baalbek tell their story so vividly that it's easy to imagine
the sacrifices, decadence, pagan worship and hard labor that took
place here 1,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the detail of Baalbek are lavish stone carvings of snarling
lions and bulls, mourning women, leafy vines and intricate
geometric designs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the monumental architecture gives lasting credence to
old myths that the city was built by giants. Still standing are
some of the largest columns in the world and several 800-ton,
60-foot-long foundation blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Baalbek is considered perhaps the most spectacular example of
Roman architecture in the world and among the most impressive
archaeological sites in the Middle East. Now, nine years after the
end of the bloody Lebanese civil war, the country and Baalbek are
reopening to the world.
</P>
<P>
   A new Baalbek museum, tucked away in ancient tunnels below the
ruins, provides a comprehensive modern explanation of the layers of
history above it. The museum, which opened in November, shows
delicate artifacts along with an excellent English narrative of
Baalbek history -- filled with conquering Phoenicians, Greeks,
Romans, Byzantine Christians and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two-hour drive from Beirut to Baalbek (cabs can
be hired for around $100 round-trip and service taxis cost as
little as $15 round trip) is itself a lesson in the current
turbulence of the Middle East.

   Baalbek is in the Bekaa(CQ) Valley. It's a stronghold of
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed ``Party of God,'' which is fighting a
war against Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon. Posters of
Iranian and Hezbollah clerics line the roads, as do yellow banners
with slogans in Arabic like, ``We must destroy the Israeli
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria controls Lebanon and posters of Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad are common. So are Syrian secret police, wearing their
black leather jackets and toting assault weapons. Uniformed
Lebanese troops also keep checkpoints, backed up by tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department in 1997 lifted a ban on American
travel to Lebanon, images of a bomb-out Beirut barely faded from
their memories. Ominous travel warnings about the Bekaa -- for
example, noting that a grenade was fired at the U.S. embassy in
June -- are not entirely a thing of the past. But there have been
few other incidents of violence against foreigners recently, common
street crime is relatively uncommon and a few U.S. travel agencies
are sending groups.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to Baalbek, take your passport for the checkpoints.
Don't take photos of the soldiers or police, and stick to the
tourist areas and Baalbek's small town center. Then relax. Overall,
people are friendly and eager for tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the ruins costs 10,000 Lebanese lira each, or about
US$6.60. Guides can be hired for 15,000 to 20,000 lira per group,
and you can cover the ruins and the museum in under three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The city gets its name from Baal, a Phoenician god of fertility.
The Greek empire rolled in in 330 B.C., lead by Alexander the
Great. They rededicated the temples to Venus, Jupiter and Mercury.
Julius Caeser's Roman troops took over in 47 B.C. and the great
building -- much of it with slave labor -- began.
</P>
<P>
   The Temple of Jupiter, which was completed before in 60 A.D.,
still has a portion of its ornate ceiling ledges held up by six of
the largest columns on earth -- seven feet wide, and nearly 70 feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   With the extravagant Temple of Bacchus as the backdrop, guides
weave tales of pagan decadence to eager tourists. The floor -- once
a mosaic -- may have been the site of orgies. Stone carvings show
grapes and poppies, the ingredients of wine and opium.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, most of the 1,850-year-old temple remains, though the
ceiling, once of 45-ton blocks, has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Temple of Bacchus, underground, is a small new museum
showing artifacts from Roman graves excavated within the last few
years. The eerie vaulted passageway is now home to a stone
sarcophagus, covered in glass, containing the bones of the deceased
and the carved gold disks that used to adorn the body and head.
</P>
<P>
   The larger wing of the museum, opened by the Lebanese
antiquities agency and a German archaeological institute, is in a
long tunnel near the entrance to the ruins. Once, possibly, used as
housing for bulls being prepared for sacrifice, the arched tunnel
is both a piece of, and showcase for, the Baalbek history.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though the idolatry has stopped, the ruins still
perform a living function. Each summer, revived after the civil
war, thousands of music lovers come for the Baalbek arts festival.
Singer Ella Fitzgerald and dancer Rudolf Nureyev have performed in
the Great Court at the base of the Temple of Jupiter.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ From above, the rusty trapdoors in the large
expanse of pavement look like the cover of a missile bunker or
maybe a hide-out for one of James Bond's villains.
</P>
<P>
   But, late at night, the hydraulic panels grind open and a large
mirror gives passing drivers a blurry view of what's below --
dancing and drinking in Beirut's booming night life.
</P>
<P>
   The club is B018 (say it, ``Beezero-18''), located on the site
of a notorious 1976 civil war massacre in the portside Quarantine
neighborhood. The name comes from an old apartment number. The
bar's youthful owners used to listen to records in the apartment
back when the civil war made it hard to bar hop.
</P>
<P>
   Hard, that is, but not impossible. Even during the carnage from
1975 to 1990, Beirutis would wait for breaks in the shelling to
head to the bars.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they had a reputation to maintain. Despite the city's
teeming slums and the civil war, which laid bare Lebanon's
religious strife, Beirut has for decades clung to its slogan as the
``Paris of the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   The French did govern here until 1943 and the city, with about
1.5 million people, still has a European flavor. Though it is split
between Christian and Muslim sectors, the downtown is largely
secular and it's easy to find people who supplement their Arabic
with English or French.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly 10 years after the war, Beirut is literally being
rebuilt. Scaffolding wraps much of the downtown and night spots are
popping up like mushrooms in the shadows of the bombed-out
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Sports Cafe, where you can catch games off of a
satellite feed and rub shoulders with a champion Lebanese rally car
driver or a snowboarding star. If you're a homesick American, check
out the autographed basketballs from Michael Jordan or NBA center
Rony Seikaly, a Lebanese-American and occasional customer.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to Caracas to hang out with the leftist crowd --
Lebanon's Greenpeace director was there recently -- and listen to
vintage blues albums.
</P>
<P>
   If you seek the arts with your spirits, go to Zinc in the Sodeco
neighborhood. Located in a 70-year-old mansion that still has
bullet holes in the facade, artists and musicians line the bar.
Lebanese art is featured in a nightly slide show, while the smell
of chestnuts roasting in a drum wafts over the patio.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can always go with the traditional. In the Arab
world, that means mellow hours listening to Arab music and smoking
the ``hubbly-bubbly'' water pipes.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Cafe Grand sits on the Mediterranean coast --
next door to the not-so-traditional TGIFriday's.
</P>
<P>
   At least two traditional coffee shops offer the same in the new
Solidere district, a rebuilt promenade near Martyr's Square.
Solidere is good for shopping or watching the modern Beirut crowd
-- women in slacks, short skirts and leopard skin jackets, and men
in turtlenecks and blazers; and everyone, it seems, toting a
cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But no night scene is complete without snobbery, and there are
several night-spots in Beirut with bouncers trained to keep out the
uncool. One of the latest is Gotha, a downtown disco near the
``Green Line'' border between the Christian and Muslim sides of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that large rats scurry between abandoned buildings
nearby, you can't get into Gotha unless you look chic. After
midnight -- when the clubs truly get going -- the streets nearby
are lined with Range Rovers and Mercedes-Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, anyone is welcome down the dark stairs into B018, a
bar uniquely modern and Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Opened last April -- the new trap doors were made to look rusty
and industrial -- the tables inside are made of marble and resemble
tombstones. On each, is a red rose in water, a memorial candle and
a framed picture of an American musical great, such as Miles Davis
or Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Sparse furnishing allows the entire space to be used for
dancing. The chair backs fold over so you can dance on top of them
for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of exhibitionism in that. It's a very Lebanese
thing,'' explains co-founder and co-owner Bernard Khoury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drinks are brought by attentive servers in all-white
uniforms that create, as Khoury says, the ``asylum'' look.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect is of a friendly dance party in a wartime
bunker. But, when the ceiling retracts and the bar opens up to the
starlit Beirut sky, you are reminded that, these days, it's safe to
go outside.

   BAALBEK, Lebanon _ Details make any story come alive. The ruins
at Baalbek tell their story so vividly that it's easy to imagine
the sacrifices, decadence, pagan worship and hard labor that took
place here 1,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the detail of Baalbek are lavish stone carvings of snarling
lions and bulls, mourning women, leafy vines and intricate
geometric designs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the monumental architecture gives lasting credence to
old myths that the city was built by giants. Still standing are
some of the largest columns in the world and several 800-ton,
60-foot-long foundation blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Baalbek is considered perhaps the most spectacular example of
Roman architecture in the world and among the most impressive
archaeological sites in the Middle East. Now, nine years after the
end of the bloody Lebanese civil war, the country and Baalbek are
reopening to the world.
</P>
<P>
   A new Baalbek museum, tucked away in ancient tunnels below the
ruins, provides a comprehensive modern explanation of the layers of
history above it. The museum, which opened in November, shows
delicate artifacts along with an excellent English narrative of
Baalbek history -- filled with conquering Phoenicians, Greeks,
Romans, Byzantine Christians and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the two-hour drive from Beirut to Baalbek (cabs can
be hired for around $100 round-trip and service taxis cost as
little as $15 round trip) is itself a lesson in the current
turbulence of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Baalbek is in the Bekaa(CQ) Valley. It's a stronghold of
Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed ``Party of God,'' which is fighting a
war against Israeli troops occupying south Lebanon. Posters of
Iranian and Hezbollah clerics line the roads, as do yellow banners

cancer.''

travel to Lebanon, images of a bomb-out Beirut barely faded from
their memories. Ominous travel warnings about the Bekaa -- for
example, noting that a grenade was fired at the U.S. embassy in
June -- are not entirely a thing of the past. But there have been
few other incidents of violence against foreigners recently, common
street crime is relatively uncommon and a few U.S. travel agencies

   When Diane Kelly describes her unusual field of study, her
listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's because she
spends her days doing experiments on the penises of mammals from
rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the first and only
scientist to study the biomechanics of the male organ _ in other
words, the principles of engineering and physics that enable the
penis to do what it's supposed to do. Mary Roach, a contributing
editor of Discover magazine, reports.

   Forensic scientists use the presence of pollen in decades-old

saber-toothed cat is unearthed.

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>

tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a

<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.

created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.

spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and

   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared

   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can

   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some
of the deadliest features of the other two species. Like Smilodon
(the picture-book example of a sabertooth), it had a powerful,
stocky build.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like Homotherium, it had broad, knifelike teeth that are
very coarsely crenulated, and then a projecting set of long, curved
incisors that are serrated like a steak knife,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the largest, most ferocious sabertooth in the world at
that time,'' says Martin. ``If I were going to choose who would win
a bout of mortal combat,'' he adds, ``I'm not sure that this thing
wouldn't clean Smilodon's _ or Homotherium's _ plow.''

TRIBE SOUNDS ALARM OVER FETAL DEATHS

 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKELAND, Wash. _ Something is killing the future of the tiny
Shoalwater Bay Tribe. A generation is being wiped out in the womb,
and nobody knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Of 13 pregnancies in 1997 and 1998, only one baby is alive
today. It is a statistic so startling that last month, a team of
investigators from the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta descended on this southwest Washington
reservation, where the Tokeland Peninsula points into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the team's mission is to determine whether the
miscarriages and other complications of pregnancy are limited to
the reservation or also involve non-Indian residents of the region.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recurrence of a scourge that tribal members thought was
behind them. In 1992, the tribe hit the panic button when it
realized that 10 of 19 pregnancies since 1988 had ended in
miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth or the death of the baby
within a year of birth. Although scientists and physicians led by
the federal Indian Health Service never pinpointed a cause, people
set aside their concerns when four apparently healthy babies were
born from 1993 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nightmare is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our people cannot keep their babies, our way of life here
will die,'' said Herbert ``Ike'' Whitish, chairman of the
impoverished, 200-member tribe. ``Most of them would have grown up
to be my great-nephews and -nieces _ the future of the tribe. It
just feels like if something isn't done, that this place will cease
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, two women on the reservation have
suffered molar pregnancies, a condition in which the embryo dies
quickly but a group of precancerous cells continues to grow in the
uterus, making the woman think she is still pregnant. The condition
is so rare that having two cases in a tiny community ``is clearly
worrisome,'' said Dr. William Freeman, director of research for the
Indian Health Service in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were seven miscarriages, one molar pregnancy
and one successful birth among the reservation community. In 1997,
there were two miscarriages, one molar pregnancy and one other
fetal death. This year, there has been one miscarriage and one baby
whose 10-pound birth weight could indicate problems such as
gestational diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, 30 percent to 40 percent of all pregnancies end in
miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokeland, tribal health department officers Gale Taylor and
Kim Zillyett spend many hours reviewing old charts and planning how
to improve medical surveillance of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   It's an especially tough task for Zillyett, who as one of those
who recently miscarried, is reminded of her loss at work every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those statistics, and I'm scared to death to try to
have another baby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zillyett describes herself and her husband as working people who
take care of themselves and receive good medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days before it happened, we saw the heartbeat,'' she
said. ``It doesn't make sense. Every single day since it happened,
working here is a constant reminder that I should be six months
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Now another member of her family is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard when she has her baby, because they
should be little cousins together,'' Zillyett said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Whitish sent a letter to members of the tribe that
began: ``Some years ago, the Shoalwater Bay Tribe experienced a
dark time in its history _ the unprecedented high rate of infant
deaths. It saddens me to inform you that it appears that the
problem has not been overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter drew no response from tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could not stand to confront the tragedy again,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at the request of the tribe and the Pacific County
Commission, a four-member CDC team arrived on the reservation. When
the team got there, ``The tension was so thick you could cut it
with a knife,'' Zillyett said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said she ``could see how hard this had hit the tribe. You
could see the pain of having to face it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress responded to the concerns in the early 1990s by paying
for construction of a health clinic staffed by a physician. Federal
and state agencies conducted studies to look for chemical
contaminants. They found high levels of pesticides in nearby
cranberry bogs, but made no direct connection to the fetal deaths.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, many women of the tribe were afraid to become
pregnant. But when four healthy babies were born from 1993 to 1996,
tribal members put the bad times behind them.
</P>
<P>
   So when the CDC team arrived last month, they were greeted with
gratitude as well as alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC doctors gave three briefings to tribal members on molar
pregnancies and miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very helpful and healing for the people around here to
actually go in and face their demon,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitish's wife, Teresa, a member of the Tulalip Tribe, believed
the Shoalwaters needed another kind of help to combat hopelessness
and despair.
</P>
<P>
   She called on a shaman, who traveled to Tokeland with spirit
boards, a divining device phonetically pronounced squi-day-lich.
</P>
<P>
   When the shaman read the boards, ``The spirits revealed to him
that death was coming down in the form of rain,'' Teresa Whitish
said.
</P>
<P>
   While no one else has pointed to rain as a possible cause,
experts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the state
Department of Ecology have studied the area around the reservation
for pesticide contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Possible sources of pollutants surround the Shoalwater
Reservation, including an old military-weapons site that is now a
municipal dump. In addition, pesticides have been sprayed on nearby
commercial forest lands and cranberry bogs, and on Willapa Bay to
kill aquatic weeds and oyster parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not identified any of these sources as
responsible for the deaths, and say making such a connection would
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't tell us what it is, we're looking for someone to
tell us what it's not,'' Ike Whitish said. ``I'd like to hear that
our water is safe, that our land is safe, so we can have some
comfort to stay where we are at.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports released in 1997 by the EPA and the state Ecology
Department in response to the fetal deaths, while not exhaustive,
found only one unambiguous problem. There are high levels of
pesticide contamination in the drainage waters of the cranberry
bogs. The Ecology Department has worked with growers for years on
the problem. But there hasn't been much progress.
</P>
<P>
   Levels of three pesticides in the cranberry drainage ditches _
guthion, lorsban and diazinon _ violate federal Clean Water Act
standards and, according to the DOE report, can kill aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Burns, the tribe's environmental program manager, says even
though studies have linked pesticides to reproductive problems in
animals, it would be difficult to connect the Shoalwater Tribe's
fetal deaths with the pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an environmental link to this, we probably won't
make it,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an advisory board convened to help the tribe _
toxicologists, epidemiologists and physicians from federal and
state government _ agree that linking the environment and the
reproductive problems would be difficult. But they say the tribe
should do whatever is possible to minimize its exposure to
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Rochat, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of
Reproductive Health and a member of the team that visited the
reservation, said last week from Atlanta that at this early stage,
the team is not even looking for any tie between the environment
and the fetal deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, CDC scientists are gathering information on pregnancies
in the area to determine whether the miscarriages and molar
pregnancies are simply random or something more sinister.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one expert thinks toxins could play a role.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of genetic material in human ova that leads to molar
pregnancies could be caused by environmental factors, said Dr. Kurt
Benirschke, a nationally recognized expert on molar pregnancies and
diseases of the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is to understand why there are eggs that
don't have a nucleus,'' he said. ``People have considered the
possibility that this ... is an environmental feature. I think that
it is a good possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also are concerned that a cluster of molar
pregnancies might extend beyond the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   When CDC scientists requested documentation of all molar
pregnancies and similar diagnoses from pathology labs in the
region, they learned that roughly 100 were reported during 1997 and
1998. If all those were molar pregnancies, it would be roughly the
number one might expect for the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Benirschke says the U.S. incidence of molar pregnancies is one
in 2,000 pregnancies. The CDC epidemiologists use a figure of one
in 1,000 pregnancies. Washington state has about 55,000 births a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Benirschke says the incidence of molar pregnancies varies by
race and runs much higher among Asians. In Hong Kong, it is 1 in
242; in Mexico, 1 in 200; in Sweden, 1 in 1,500. He called it a
regular occurrence in Japanese obstetric wards. But he knows of no
data on the incidence among Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that it is unclear what region the pathology
reports encompass. If the 100 instances are confirmed as molar
pregnancies that occurred in just a few counties in southwest
Washington, authorities would consider that evidence of a major
problem. But if many of the reports are incorrect, or the area
covers much of the state and into Oregon, there may be no problem
at all. That's what the CDC team wants to clarify.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific County Health Department Director Kathy Spoor has been
deeply involved in collecting data for the CDC epidemiologists. And
she plans to improve medical surveillance to see whether the
reproductive problems run countywide.
</P>
<P>
   There is an anecdotal sense that miscarriages have occurred at a
high rate in the county, she said. But until now, such data have
not been collected. Most miscarriages are not reported because
state law does not require it.
</P>
<P>
   At a Feb. 5 meeting in SeaTac, experts from the CDC, the Indian
Health Service, the state Health Department, the EPA and the
Pacific County Health Department met with tribal leaders to address
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As they discussed topics such as medical monitoring of women of
child-bearing age and preserving tissue samples from miscarriages,
tribal council member Lynn Clark responded by sharing the tribe's
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community was suffering from a broken heart,'' Clark
said, recalling the first time the Shoalwaters faced these
concerns. ``I hate to get back to it again, because it just opens
up such a big, huge void. It was too overwhelming. I can't do it.
That's what you guys are going to help us do _ move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitish, who rarely betrays emotion, winced as he heard Clark's
palpable pain.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``We just can't sit and let things go on as they are
and hope they get better. If we are going to pass out of existence,
at least we want to go out fighting. That's the way our ancestors
did it. We want some truth. We want people to look at the data and
tell us what it means.''

sportswear for evening and knee-high boots (flat or with heels) are
key to fall '99 fashions.
</P>
<P>
   Those messages _ too loud to ignore _ were sent by designers to
retailers and media gathered here last week to preview their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   But the best message of all is these are very wearable clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Skirt hems hover around the knees for day. They move easily.
Narrow, ankle-length skirts that have made walking hazardous aren't
part of the fall '99 lineup. Even long skirts now have a bit of
fullness.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts or pants worn with sweaters could become uniforms for day
or night. They were staples in almost every collection _ a
turtleneck or twinset with an A-line skirt for day, perhaps a
cropped or jeweled sweater with a full satin skirt or silky pants
for evening.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, little black dresses were not just
upstaged, they weren't even invited to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allard, creator of the Ellen Tracy line, put a pumpkin
pullover sweater over a taupe shetland wool skirt for day and
showed a cropped beaded cardigan with satin pants for late day.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren featured ballgown-sized skirts of duchess satin
with patterned pullovers (Nordic-inspired) cropped short to show a
little skin between sweater and skirt. A black and white sweater
with a red skirt was powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's collection was colorful. Although he opened his show
with an unobtrusive pale blue turtleneck sweater and light gray
skirt, he moved right into pink, periwinkle, lilac, fuchsia, lime,
yellow and red _ bright hues that could be worn alone or paired
with neutrals.
</P>
<P>
   But like almost every other New York designer, Lauren included a
heavy dose of cream clothing. Whites, off-whites and cream appeared
throughout fashion week. So did pale camel tones sometimes labeled
``champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the pastels shown by everybody from Tommy Hilfiger to Oscar
de la Renta and it's apparent that these pale tones are no longer
just for the winter holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Pleats have been erased from pants, along with waistbands.
Pants, whether they rise to the waist or end at the hips, are
close-to-the body on top, with pant legs ranging from very wide to
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Tight denim jeans have been on runways, part of a very subtle
Western influence in the fall '99 fashion mix. It shows up in
lumberjack checks, shearling, leather, serapes, ponchos and plaids
faded like old flannel shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs showed spotted calfskin skirts and
jackets. Ccowboy boots were seen on several runways. But it wasn't
head-to-toe Western wear.
</P>
<P>
   A more powerful influence is outdoor wear: Satin parkas with fur
trim, jackets with map pockets in the back, pants with built-in
pouches. At times it looked like New York designers had been
inspired by Seattle's own Filson, Eddie Bauer and REI.
</P>
<P>
   But take away the details and the design influences, and the
over-all silhouette is narrower. There are darts, princess pieces,
shapely coats with slightly higher arm holes. Drawstrings have been
used on dresses; even blowses snug fabric into an empire line.
</P>
<P>
   Knit dresses cling to the body. Sheath dresses double as jumpers
with a sheer, skin-tight sweater under them.
</P>
<P>
   Closures are hidden. There was an unconfirmed rumor that some
designers were using magnets, like those on handbags, to hold
skirts together. Others used Velcro closures, old-fashioned hooks
and eyes, and hidden zippers. Buttons were almost always behind a
placket.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fall '99 fashions were previewed about six weeks
earlier than previous years, it means smart shoppers can visit
markdown racks now for things to wear next fall.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for? Pastels, off-whites, sweaters, pants without
pleats, anything with a fur trim, shiny leathers and skirts with
flare _ short or long.

WILSON FORGOES PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ With a growing field of Republican
candidates and little time left to raise enough money, former
California Gov. Pete Wilson said Monday he would not to run for
president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilson has the resume of a presidential candidate _
including stints as mayor of San Diego, state lawmaker and U.S.
senator _ the daunting prospect of raising at least $20 million to
capture the 2000 nomination appeared too great for Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 65, had spent the past several weeks huddling with his
close political associates and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reluctantly, I'm compelled to conclude that it is just not
practical to pursue a candidacy for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000,'' Wilson said in statement.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue the work he started at the Bear Flag Forum, a
nonprofit public policy foundation in Century City, where he has
moved with his wife, Gayle.
</P>
<P>
   He also will join forces with the Hoover Institute at Stanford
University and is sponsoring a state ballot measure to reform
California's juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   If he had decided to run, Wilson faced expensive, grueling
campaigns in states that hardly know him, and rivals that could
include Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Other hopefuls for the Republican nomination are former Vice
President Dan Quayle, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and Sen.
Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for Wilson were varied. He leaves the state with a
Republican Party hurt in recent elections, including the defeat of
the party's candidate for governor, Dan Lungren, to Democrat Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who is pro-choice on the abortion issue, faced a primary
system that favors conservatives. And Wilson's short-lived run for
the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 could have haunted
him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lure of California's primary being among the earliest,
giving a candidate a boost of credibility, wasn't enough. The
problem is that about 10 other states _ including New York,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Florida and possibly New Jersey _ also
plan to hold primaries the same day as California, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   That will require candidates to be stretched and tremendous
amounts of money for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his advisers determined he could raise up to $8
million, not enough to run an effective campaign, despite his high
name recognition in California.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits presidential primary candidates from
accepting any amount over $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means 15,000 separate, maximum contributions,'' Wilson
said. ``I've waited too long. The last two years we kind of ran up
the score as governor because it's what I wanted to do. If you're
going to govern California, it's a full-time job. But now it's too
late to raise that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has a rich donor list from 32 years in politics, but he
faced the task of convincing them and hundreds of Republicans
nationwide that he was a viable national candidate compared to the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson still owes money from his unsuccessful campaign for the
1996 presidential nomination. Records show his principal
presidential campaign organization is $347,691 in debt, up nearly
$47,000 from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson piled up the new bills by meeting with political
consultants, traveling and paying for mailings during his last year
as governor. His three federal campaign committees had a total of
$377,305 in the bank as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of money killed Wilson's bid for the 1996 nomination.
He kicked off his presidential campaign near the Statue of Liberty
with a fierce attack on ``the oppression of federal tyrants'' in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The operation uncharacteristically dissolved in just a month,
hampered by a lack of money and organization.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foot injuries are a major problem for recreational athletes,
particularly those past their bright college years. Because feet
that spend Monday through Friday under a desk literally bear the
brunt of the weekend athlete's Saturday enthusiasm, there is an
awful lot of limping on Monday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is unavoidable. The foot is, after all, a
complicated structure that has to absorb the force transmitted from
the body to the ground _ up to eight times body weight in a running
jump.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent review of foot injuries of the adult recreational
athlete did have some suggestions for ways to avoid the
orthopedist's office.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen M. Simons, the associate director of the family
practice program at St. Joseph's Medical Center in South Bend,
Ind., said in the article, in a recent issue of The Physician and
Sports Medicine magazine, that such weekend flings account for up
to 15 percent of all athletic foot injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The most common, he said, are problems of the Achilles' tendon,
connecting the back of the heel to the calf muscles, and of the
plantar fascia, the tissue between the heel and toe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tales of ruptured Achilles' tendons, with the sudden
agony and the months on crutches, Simon said, some weekend athletes
_ ``myself included'' _ have given up basketball altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The classic case, he said, is a man of about 38 who ruptures the
tendon in his left heel on a weekend while jumping for a shot or a
rebound. (``Right-handed people tend to jump off their left leg,
because the right leg can swing up faster,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Treatment usually comes down to surgery or immobilization.
Simons said that a review of case studies found that patients who
were operated on were more likely to return to playing sports at
the same level, and only 2.8 percent ruptured the tendon again.
</P>
<P>
   Those who used the more conservative treatment, a cast, had a
reinjury rate of 11.7 percent. But the benefits of the cast are
quicker recovery _ 8.2 weeks on average compared with 10.5 with
surgery _ and fewer minor complications.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of players have pain in their Achilles' tendons without a
rupture. But Simons said people who suffer acute injuries often
have no warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the person who's not hurting doesn't temper
their activity,'' he said. ``As you fatigue, the muscle does not
relax as well. That means that if in your fourth hour of basketball
you come down with a rebound, the calf muscle is not as good a
shock absorber as it was, and a consequence of that is an increased
chance of rupture.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he added, is to ``hang it up when you're not too
tired,'' though few are willing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   If Achilles' tendon problems are the most common trauma to the
foot, the less well-known plantar fasciitis is the most common
overuse injury. Simons described its usual symptoms as ``insidious
onset of heel pain'' that is worse after inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The plantar fascia is a layer of fibrous tissue that runs from
the heel to the toes. When a person is walking or running, the
plantar fascia can take on the shape of a bowstring _ ``and you can
get a lot of tension in that bow,'' Simons said. That tension puts
strain on the tissue's attachment point in the heel, which can
gradually become inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   People often put up with the nagging problem, which only
prolongs the pain, Simons said, because prompt treatment usually
means better results.
</P>
<P>
   Common treatments in less serious cases include wearing more
supportive shoes, minimizing barefoot walking and taking
anti-inflammatory drugs. He also suggests tying shoelaces as
tightly as tolerable to help provide support.
</P>
<P>
   The best way of staving off either of these injuries _ and other
strains, breaks and fractures to small toe bones _ is perform
activities during the week that are similar to those involved in
the weekend sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get in just a little of the same activity, you're
going to have a better chance of conditioning the tissues to stand
that specific stress,'' Simons said. ``If that's not possible, find
some sort of stretching or strengthening exercise that comes close
to the kind of forces the foot is going to be subjected to.''
</P>
<P>
   He also urged people to resist the temptation to stay off their
sore feet all week to rest them for a big game on Saturday. Doctors
have a term for that, Simons said: ``straining tissue instead of
training it.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A golden parachute for Y2K
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Stopping by the post office the other
morning, I ran into a couple of fellows I've known since school
days.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell they were excited, and they couldn't wait to tell
me why.
</P>
<P>
   Their gold shipment had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They opened up the boxes to show off their booty, a couple of
rolls of gold coins about the size of dimes, each valued at
one-tenth of an ounce of gold, about $32 at current prices.
</P>
<P>
   If events develop as they expect, those coins will be worth much
more, come the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Y2K thing _ I wouldn't understand _ but when the
computers freeze up as the clock ticks down next New Year's Eve,
we'll be back on a barter system at best and gold will be worth its
weight in ... well, gold and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you've heard all about it, that our computers weren't
designed to service civilization past 1999, and as the millennium
turns over, the computers will be trying to turn the clock back to
1900.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a disaster something on the scale of gravity trying to
reverse itself.
</P>
<P>
   So say the naysayers who are expecting the worst and then some,
as water faucets dry up and generators grind to a halt, ATM
machines go tilt and our computer-pampered way of life goes poof.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a cockeyed optimist, but I can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not buying gold, I'm not drilling my own water well, I'm not
stocking up on food stuffs and I'm certainly not arming myself to
the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of it, too, the prospect of fighting off your
neighbors when they try to take from you what they didn't have the
good sense to put back for that rainy day. Shoot-fire, it'll be
raining bullets.
</P>
<P>
   My old friends made no bones about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I look down the road and see you hungry SOBs coming toward
my house, I'll be ready for you,'' one said and the other agreed.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``By the way. Just how long you think you can go
without nourishment?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. About the noontime most days.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to ask:
</P>
<P>
   What are you going to do if you're wrong? Won't you look like a
fool, fool's gold and all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' I was told. ``But we can always cash in the
gold, drink the water and eat the food we've saved back.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and then added:
</P>
<P>
   ``But what are YOU gonna do if I'M right?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.

LIKE IT OR NOT, AMERICANS WANT TO KEEP CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, people are still talking about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mr. Thompson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Sunday column contained a major misrepresentation of
fact: `Most Americans didn't want Clinton removed from office. ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong!
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, you too have been falsely persuaded by national
poll results and/or you insulated yourself from what most Americans
really wanted from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every one friend, relative and business associate of mine
who wanted Clinton to stay, ten others have expressed to me the
opposite desire. I am among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 60 years as a citizen, I have not once been polled by
someone representing himself as national media. I do not know a
single individual in all my experience who has been contacted by
such organizations. Who are the people polled? Where are the people
polled? How are these people selected?
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton did was despicable. He defiled our highest public
office. He should have been ousted and disbarred. However, because
of a group of spineless Senators, scared for their own political
future, we are left to try explaining another failure of the system
to our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a pathetic charade our elected officeholders perpetrated.
Now we have a President whom most of my friends, relatives and
business associates want no part of. They do not want to see him,
hear him or read about him, period!
</P>
<P>
   ``Our President now is without credentials. He is viewed as a
joke. And, we have this White House jester for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arlington, Texas, reader who wrote this letter signed off
with ``Sincerely,'' and it was heartening to learn that he was
sincere in his viewpoint. If there is one thing I can't stand, it's
a reader who rips me to shreds and isn't sincere about it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people who despise Bill Clinton are as sincere
as sincere can be. Clinton-haters loathe Slick Willie with an
intensity that defies description.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have no use for Clinton. I enthusiastically
supported Bob Dole last time around _ and I figured out long before
Clinton ran for re-election that he was a lying, double-dealing
worm.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody needs to tell me that what Clinton did in the
sex-and-lies scandal was despicable. For Clinton, despicableness is
an art form.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment that the scandal exploded into the headlines
right up until the Senate voted him not guilty of perjury and
obstruction of justice, I never believed that Clinton should be
removed from office against the wishes of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I've said it before, and now I'll say it again: Most
Americans did not want Clinton removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   That is a fact _ a fact supported by poll after scientific poll.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the president's detractors would like to believe
that the polls are wrong or maybe even rigged. If you are
absolutely, positively certain that the president should be booted
out of the White House, it's plenty disconcerting to think that 60
to 70 percent of your countrymen disagree.
</P>
<P>
   It also stands to reason that a person with strong opinions on a
controversial topic will communicate those opinions most often to
people who are likely to agree. Most of us gravitate toward folks
who think as we do.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Polling your family, pals and co-workers is no
way to gauge the attitudes of the public at large. Past performance
has shown that scientific, nationwide polls such as those
commissioned by major newspapers and television news organizations
are extremely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   There might be an argument here if the impeachment polls had
been all over the map _ if one said that 70 percent of Americans
wanted Clinton removed and the next said that 70 percent wanted him
to stay. But virtually every poll turned up the same result:
Somewhere between 60 and 70 percent wanted Clinton to finish his
term.
</P>
<P>
   You can disagree with the majority opinion that the polls
reflect. But you're deluding yourself if you insist that the polls
are wrong just because you don't like the results.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A colony of 54 rhesus monkeys at the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia was peacefully watching an episode
of the second ``Star Trek'' series one recent afternoon when an
alien-looking squad of higher primates, decked out in masks and
white disposable boiler suits and ridiculous bootees, marched into
their quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders politely avoided staring any monkey in the face, a
perilous faux pas in simian society, but there was no disguising
their intent: to make one of the residents surrender a sample of
her blood.
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys are press-ganged pioneers in a bold medical
frontier, the treatment of disease by reprogramming the body's
genetic instructions. Gene therapy, as it is hopefully known, has
long been a field of high promise and low fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   The promise is evident: all diseases, even infections, have a
genetic component, and the best possible treatment in many cases
would be to repair the genetic defect that permits the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But inserting genes into human cells in full working order has
proved to be exasperatingly difficult. More than 230 clinical
trials of genetic engineering techniques are now in progress, but
most are at a preliminary stage and none has yet led to an approved
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a batch of recent experiments at other universities,
the Penn monkeys represent one of the few rays of hope in a long
series of setbacks. Not only do six of them now carry a newly
inserted gene that makes a therapeutic protein, but the gene can be
switched on at will simply by giving the monkey a pill.
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys belong to the university's Institute for Human Gene
Therapy, directed by a youthful-looking veteran of the gene therapy
wars, Dr. James M. Wilson. Wilson has corralled the resources to
pursue a broad-based strategy. Not for him the gamble of going
after a single disease, with heavy odds of failure. He is pursuing
a wide range of maladies with a variety of methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will allow nothing technical to get in our way,'' he says
firmly in a late-evening conversation in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Mouse rooms and monkey colonies, where gene insertion techniques
must be tested before being tried in patients, do not come cheap.
Wilson's virus manufacturing center cost $5 million to build.
Merely walking into it costs $20 _ the price of the disposable
clothes worn to prevent people from contaminating the growing
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses are both the hope and despair of genetic engineers.
Viruses can focus in on specific kinds of cells, penetrate their
membranes and insert their genes in working order into the cell's
DNA. Most approaches to gene therapy use viruses as the vehicle to
convey genes to target cells. The idea is to strip the virus of the
genes that make it pathogenic and replace them with a therapeutic
gene.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, when Wilson joined the field, a disabled mouse
virus was everyone's favorite candidate. But the virus infected
only cells that were dividing. The next candidate was adenovirus, a
cause of the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Adenovirus is a fine vehicle; it inserts new genes into many
kinds of human cell, and the genes produce protein. But only for
eight weeks or so. That is how long it takes for the body's immune
system to identify and root out every Trojan horse cell where an
adenovirus, even a disabled one, is lurking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Wilson left the University of Michigan and a Howard
Hughes fellowship _ a munificent but nontransferable kind of
research grant _ to move to Penn. The dean of its medical school,
Dr. William N. Kelley, made it a crusade to get gene therapy off
the ground and persuaded Wilson, his former PhD student, to head
the new institute.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later the whole community of genetic engineers was
plunged into a crisis of confidence. The National Institutes of
Health, finding that $200 million, some 2 percent of its budget,
was going into gene therapy research, commissioned a critical
review of the field. The review's authors chided gene therapists
for promising too much and delivering too little.
</P>
<P>
   The many exaggerated claims for gene therapy ``threaten
confidence in the integrity of the field,'' the institutes' report
said.
</P>
<P>
   A shakeout followed, but Wilson escaped damage. ``Personally it
helped us, because it eliminated a lot of the hacks,'' he said.
``So we contrived to grow after that.'' His institute, the largest
of its kind, has a staff of 187 people and an annual budget of $25
million, half of which comes from the National Institutes of Health
and the rest from industry and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very impressive operation and he has been combining a
lot of basic science with applications,'' said Dr. Theodore
Friedman, a gene therapy expert at the University of California,
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is now working with a new gene delivery system, one based
on a small virus called adeno-associated virus. It has only two
genes, both of which can be removed, leaving just its head and tail
as a shell to carry therapeutic genes into target cells.
</P>
<P>
   Because it does not provoke the body's immune system nearly as
much as does adenovirus, the genes it inserts can continue to work
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has also incorporated an important device that genetic
engineers had neglected, a switch for regulating the inserted
genes. Cells usually activate genes by having an agent known as a
promoter attach itself to a stretch of DNA just upstream of a
target gene. Once the promoter is in place, the gene's program is
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Ariad Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., Wilson
has inserted genes for a two-part promoter into adeno-associated
virus. The two parts assemble into a working promoter only in the
presence of the drug rapamycin. This means a gene can be inserted
but will work only when rapamycin is taken.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reported last month that the system had proved successful
in mice and in rhesus monkeys. He used the gene for a powerful
hormone known as erythropoietin, which spurs the bone marrow to
churn out more red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Adeno-associated viruses carrying the rhesus version of the
erythropoietin gene and the new promoter system were injected into
the animals' muscle cells. The gene was silent until the monkeys
were given a rapamycin pill.
</P>
<P>
   In the treated monkeys, the gene remains active for several
days, requiring the red blood cell count to be checked regularly.
If the red cell count gets too high, the monkeys are bled to reduce
the risk of stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who need kidney dialysis and others with low blood
counts have regular injections of erythropoietin itself. A better
therapy, if feasible, might be to have extra copies of the gene
inserted in their muscle cells, and to flick the gene on every
month or so with a rapamycin pill.
</P>
<P>
   The erythropoietin project is just one of many that Wilson and
his colleagues are pursuing. His strategy is to develop ways of
inserting genes into as many different tissues as possible. ``We
are pursuing a blitz of activity across the board on a range of
diseases,'' he says. He has projects for delivering corrective
genes to the liver, the eye and the lun as well as to muscle
cells.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A second group of projects is focused on cancers, including
those of the skin, lung and brain. The cancer projects still rely
on adenovirus as the delivery vehicle. Because the goal is to
insert genes that will kill the cancerous cells, the vehicle's
limited period of effectiveness is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is switching all his genetic repair projects from
adenovirus to the more promising adeno-associated virus. One of
these projects, designed by his colleague Dr. Jean Bennett, is an
attack on a form of retinitis pigmentosa, a degeneration of retinal
cells caused by an inherited defect in one of the enzymes that
helps convert light into a nervous signal.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, at present incurable, affects mice and certain
breeds of dogs, like Irish setters, as well as people. Dr. Bennett
has prepared viral vehicles that carry a correct version of the
gene for the dysfunctional enzyme. The virus can be injected into
the fluid-filled compartment behind the retina, where it will
infect retinal cells.
</P>
<P>
   Having proved the concept in mice, she then tried it in dogs and
found that the treatment can restore a dog's sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so exciting to see the dog follow my fingers with one
eye, while the other eye was still searching,'' she said. One eye
had been left untreated, to serve as a comparison for the treated
eye. The improvement lasted for only seven weeks or so because the
virus vehicle was the short-lived adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bennett is now repeating the experiment with
adeno-associated virus. If that works, she said, she will seek
approval to try the method in patients.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his team face numerous pressures. ``We get 50 calls a
week from parents of children with awful diseases,'' said Nelson A.
Wivel, deputy director of the institute. The money must be kept
flowing with constant grant applications. Even when a genetic
engineering technique should prove successful, there are many
scientific and regulatory problems that remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   One is that a virus and its cargo of improving genes might
inadvertently get into the patient's eggs or sperm. The virus could
insert itself in the middle of a gene, disrupting the gene's
function and causing an inherited defect. Or it could insert
correctly, remedying a genetic disease in the patient's
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Though that might not seem like a problem, making inheritable
changes in the human genome is a bridge that no one is yet ready to
cross.
</P>
<P>
   Another awkward problem is the extreme xenophobia of the body's
immune system, which instinctively assails any substance that it
did not grow up with. Gene therapy aims to provide the correct
genes to people who inherit some genetic defect, but the normal
protein produced by the correct gene may nevertheless be treated as
foreign by the patient's immune system, which has never seen the
normal protein before.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has a staff of some 20 people
who review applications to try genetic engineering techniques on
patients. The agency has liberally allowed first-phase clinical
trials but in giving final approval for a therapy may require more
assurance on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   One is whether the virus vehicles, especially a disabled form of
the AIDS virus, which some gene therapists favor, might not find
occasion to reacquire their missing genes. ``Here is where we are
beginning to get into difficult areas,'' said Dr. Philip D.
Noguchi, head of the agency's gene therapy unit.
</P>
<P>
   A different danger on the gene therapists' horizons is that of
being overtaken by the new technology of stem cells, the
multi-purpose cells from which each organ is thought to repair
itself. Inserting corrective genes into these cells, once they can
be identified, could prove more effective than messing with viruses
and other provocations to the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But stem cell technology is in its infancy, and Wilson says he
is not concerned that it will put him out of business. ``It doesn't
worry me at all,'' he said, noting that part of an organ must be
destroyed to make room for any new tissue derived from stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the monkey colony, a female rhesus, known only by a
number, is deftly removed from her cage and placed in an open box.
The edges of a permanent collar she wears slip neatly into grooves
in the box, keeping her immobile. However human the monkeys may
seem, they are wild animals and require sophisticated handling.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael A. Schnell, the supervisor of the monkey center,
feeds her from a child's pack of Kellogg's Fruit Loops while his
colleague Ernest Glover scratches her back in the grooming motions
that are simian peace gestures.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, when she seems sufficiently calm, Glover
deftly inserts a needle into a tiny leg vein to remove blood. The
monkey soon starts to moan, fretful to escape from the constraining
box. She is returned to her cage, just in time for the afternoon
round of orange segments.
</P>
<P>
   The whole elaborate procedure will result in a single point on a
graph recording the erythropoietin gene's state of activity.
Evolution's programming system took 3.5 billion years to develop;
learning to fix the bugs in it is not going to happen overnight.

TIME TO HALT INDEPENDENT COUNSEL INSANITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Bar Association is advising Congress to end the law
that authorizes the appointment of independent counsels. Congress
should heed that advice. Let the flawed experiment lapse.
</P>
<P>
   The power that law confers on an unelected individual to dictate
the nation's agenda while harassing private citizens and high
public officials, including the president, is more power than any
good man or woman should want _ and clearly more than a bad one
should have.
</P>
<P>
   Our republic managed well enough for almost 200 years without an
independent counsel. The Founding Fathers foresaw no need for one.
Our three constitutional branches of government sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the mischief that might have bedeviled this infant
nation if Congress had endowed some ambitious barrister with
subpoena power and sufficient public funds to mount an inquisition
into rumors questioning President Jefferson's chastity in the years
after his wife's death. Should the House then have impeached him if
he denied those rumors?
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's private relationship with Sally Hemmings, whatever
it may have been, cannot diminish the luster of his life, the
vision that inspired the Louisiana Purchase, or the living legacy
of Jeffersonian principles embodied in the Declaration of
Independence and the Virginia Statute of Religious Toleration.
</P>
<P>
   What a tawdry pity if Thomas Jefferson, instead of being
remembered for these enduring treasures, were recalled chiefly as
an eccentric inventor who messed around with a slave girl. Who
among us would be better off?
</P>
<P>
   If America has learned nothing else from the great embarrassment
we've endured for the past 12 months, it should be that we really
don't need a battery of gumshoes _ whether motivated by political
hatred, professional zeal or moralistic voyeurism _ traipsing
around trying to find crimes with which to accuse our elected
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the independent counsel law was to divorce
investigations of executive branch officials entirely from
politics. It arose from the Nixon era. But even Leon Jaworski, who
came to symbolize the nonpartisanship for which everyone yearned,
was aware of the proper limitations upon an investigative lawyer's
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress intended, by authorizing the appointment of someone
outside the Justice Department, to protect the investigator's
objective independence from any possible presidential pressure to
go easy on sitting officials. Congress never intended that the
counsel should have a hostile attitude toward the target of his
investigation, or a predetermined plan to find guilt. One extreme,
obviously, would as bad as the other.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the idea was to investigate a specific complaint or
enumerated list of charges. The counsel was expected to respect
those boundaries, not search out additional excuses for pursuing
his prey. In theory, the counsel was an adviser, not a combatant.
His mission was not to get a conviction but to learn whether
serious infractions had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, the counsel began to see himself not
as an objective adviser but as a prosecutor whose job it was to win
a conviction of some sort _ if not on the matter he was initially
appointed to investigate, then on some other charge if he could
find or develop one.
</P>
<P>
   This warped misconstruction of original congressional intent was
manifest in the arbitrary action of a three-judge panel in
summarily removing Robert Fiske, originally appointed as the
independent counsel investigating allegations of Whitewater abuses,
and replacing him with Kenneth Starr. The stated rationale was that
Fiske, although a Republican and possessed of distinguished legal
credentials, was not proven to be sufficiently adversarial. In
Starr, the Republican judges had someone with a record of
conservative political activism and a demonstrable predisposition
to give the president no slack.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is easier, against the peculiar background of his
appointment, to see how Starr _ or at least some of his more
zealous prosecutorial assistants _ may have come to infer that it
was the mission of the outside counsel to ``get'' President
Clinton. This end, so desirable in the minds of some, came to
justify the sometimes questionable means employed by the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone can doubt that the Starr prosecution efforts
during the past five years at a taxpayer cost of some $50 million
have raised serious issues of prosecutorial discretion. In the
opinion of some of the nation's top legal authorities, they've set
off a series of grievous abuses of power.
</P>
<P>
   These include the constant shift of focus from one unrewarding
allegation to another until the discovery of Linda Tripp's
illegally taped conversations brought Starr's attention to rest
upon Monica Lewinsky, whose relationship with Clinton had nothing
whatever to do with the questions that Starr was appointed to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The numerous press leaks; the flagrant breaches of grand jury
security; the holding and grilling of Lewinsky for several hours
without her lawyer, accompanied by the intimidating threats of
legal action against her mother; the spiteful imprisonment of Susan
MacDougal because she refused to swear to things she declares
untrue; and finally the taunting public boast of Starr that he had
the power to prosecute the president even while he's in office _
all these contribute to a pattern of arrogance and overreach.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the unnecessary waste of tax money and good people's
reputations by other special prosecutors seeking their own
aggrandizement at the expense of former Cabinet officers Mike Espy
and Henry Cisneros. Think of the pettiness of the charges against
each of these two, measured alongside the overbearing zeal with
which each has been hounded. There's no excuse for prolonging this
sort of madness.

IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A MAKEOVER TO MAKE THIS CROWD LOOK GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey there, Bill, Hillary, Linda, Monica and Paula. You're all
lookin' good. Well, better, anyway. OK, actually, Bill's looking a
mite more haggard, but we can pass that off to age, if not stress.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something your mamas apparently didn't tell you:
Pretty is as pretty does. No matter how good you look after your
makeovers, most of you Clintonesque celebrities have simply
misbehaved too much to really look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, given the dosage we've had of all these people after
this long a period of time, that it will take more than a
Vaseline-covered lens to fix their image,'' said Lisa LeMaster, a
Dallas communications consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you're trying. There's Linda Tripp on the ``Today'' show,
losing the glasses and the tent of hair for a demure swept-up 'do.
There's Monica Lewinsky, taming her own big hair and going to a
physical trainer before appearing for a deposition (and, not
coincidentally, a book-cover photo shoot). There's Paula Jones,
sporting a new nose.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you've all found out what it's like to be a media
star _ and that it's not always fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every comedian in the world has done Linda Tripp, because she
had such bad hair and bad makeup,'' said Leon Hall, co-host of
``Fashion Emergency'' on the E! Entertainment Network. ``All these
women started out like caricatures. Artists go for the big noses or
small noses or big mouths because they're easy to draw.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Paula, Monica and Linda finally saw themselves
as other people did. It wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see our true selves in the mirror,'' Hall said.
``When you see yourself on camera, you see yourself from the side,
the left, the right, under the chin, over the chin, and it can be
shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton had a head start on the others, long ago
ditching the headbands of '92 and then the too-girlish long tresses
of '95. Now she looks more like a president's wife. (Or, perhaps,
senatorial?) And President Clinton _ uh, well ... he really didn't
do all that much, did he?
</P>
<P>
   It's not fair, but Bill probably wasn't expected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, men are accepted in the way they look,'' said
Kathryn Bryan, owner of Kasal Image Consulting and Boutique in Fort
Worth. ``Women are under a lot more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   For both sexes, however, it's unclear whether looking better
actually helps one's image. Despite Bill Clinton's distinguished
gray hair and carefully tailored suits, people still are aware that
he's an acknowledged adulterer. Perhaps Linda Tripp looked better
on ``Today,'' but people still remember that she surreptitiously
taped conversations with her one-time friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the general public, I'm not sure it does much good,'' said
Susan Huston, a Fort Worth personal development and etiquette
consultant. ``For the person, though, it gives them more
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, however, disagrees that the damage is done. He believes
that the notoriety is going to make Linda, Monica and Paula
happening babes on the social circuit. Especially Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will always get invited to the best parties in the
world,'' Hall said. ``And they will all feel better about
themselves when they walk into a room.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, take heart. The impeachment hearings are behind us, and
although people might remember you more now for what you did than
how you look, that won't last.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who really remembers Fawn Hall, Jessica Hahn or Donna
Rice?

A VIEWERS GUIDE TO THE 41ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominated by women and chock-full of Texans, the 41st annual
Grammy Awards show comes to CBS on Wednesday _ with silly
nominations, potentially great live music and, we hope, enough
genuinely weird moments to keep you watching for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the Grammys combine the formal atmosphere of an
award ceremony with the what's-gonna-happen-next excitement of a
good rock 'n' roll show. You may or may not remember who won Best
Album last year, but who can forget that half-naked guy who painted
``Soy Bomb'' on his chest and somehow made it onstage to dance with
Bob Dylan?
</P>
<P>
   This year's Grammys show is ... well ... shaping up fairly
nicely. There's a good mix of live performers (Madonna, Lauryn
Hill, Alanis Morissette), some interesting races, and several
Texans _ including Kirk Franklin, who is up for one of the most
coveted awards, Song of the Year, for ``Lean on Me.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? Maybe Soy Bomb will make a repeat appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BEST RACES
</P>
<P>
   SONG OF THE YEAR: It's a long shot, but we're pulling for Kirk
Franklin's ``Lean on Me.'' And anything's preferable to Shania
Twain's gooey ``You're Still the One.''
</P>
<P>
   ROCK PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL: Four of the five
nominees _ Aerosmith's ``Pink,'' Fastball's ``The Way,'' Hole's
``Celebrity Skin'' and the Verve's ``Bitter Sweet Symphony'' _
provide an interesting stylistic range. The Wallflowers' cover of
David Bowie's ``Heroes'' is atrocious. We'd like to see the Verve
get it; they've never gotten the Stateside popularity they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   POP COLLABORATION WITH VOCALS: Highlights are Elvis Costello and
Burt Bacharach's ``I Still Have That Other Girl'' and the Van
Morrison/Chieftains summit meeting, ``Shenandoah.'' It would be a
crime for the diabetes-inducing ``I'm Your Angel'' by R. Kelly and
Celine Dion to win, but we're not betting against 'em.
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPORARY FOLK ALBUM: Talk about a lot of great music in one
place: Steve Earle's ``El Corazon,'' Lyle Lovett's ``Step Inside
This House,'' Lucinda Williams' ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,''
Emmylou Harris' ``Spyboy'' and the Billy Bragg/Wilco collaboration
``Mermaid Avenue.'' All are deserving, but Williams' CD is the best
of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WEIRDEST NOMINATION
</P>
<P>
   John Hiatt's ``Have a Little Faith in Me'' is up for Male Rock
Vocal Performance and Rock Song. It's not a bad song _ in fact it's
a good song. It's just that it's been out since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SMART MOVES
</P>
<P>
   Now, show some respect. Sometimes the Grammys really do have
their finger on the pulse of pop music. This year's proof:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lauryn Hill's 10 nominations. While that may be a few too
many, there's no question her first solo CD was a hip-hop benchmark
and well worth all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   _ All the attention paid to Dallas' own Dixie Chicks, because we
like them, and they worked long and hard to get to where they are.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nominations for both BR5-49 and The Mavericks in the Country
Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal category. Recent CDs by
both bands didn't sell well, so it's good to see their merits
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recognizing Johnny Cash, Mel Torme, William ``Smokey''
Robinson, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke with Lifetime Achievement
Awards. They all certainly deserve them.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   NEW STUFF
</P>
<P>
   No contest; the Grammys have too many categories. But these new
ones actually make sense:
</P>
<P>
   BEST TRADITIONAL R&AMP;B VOCAL PERFORMANCE. This is a good way to
honor the urban acts out there who aren't 22 years old and making a
mint off one hit CD. The nominees are Regina Belle, Patti LaBelle,
Aaron Neville, The Temptations and Luther Vandross.
</P>
<P>
   BEST CLASSICAL CROSSOVER ALBUM: So many classical artists record
in other genres, or team up with pop artists, that this was a
natural move.
</P>
<P>
   BEST TEJANO MUSIC PERFORMANCE: Setting this apart from all other
Mexican/American music makes perfect sense. The nominees are
Fiebre, Jaime y Los Chamacos, Flaco Jimenez, Leyendas y Raices and
Little Joe y La Familia.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WORST RACES
</P>
<P>
   OK, sometimes this show just misses the boat. Our biggest
complaints:
</P>
<P>
   POP ALBUM: Eric Clapton's ``Pilgrim'' is here basically because
it's by Eric Clapton; Brian Setzer's ``The Dirty Boogie'' is hardly
the best swing CD, just the one featuring the guy with the most
name recognition. Look for Celine Dion's ``Let's Talk About Love''
to win, even though the best choice (at least in this company) is
Natalie Imbruglia's ``Left of the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE MUSIC PERFORMANCE: Again, several nominations for
subpar efforts from name artists, including Tori Amos' ``From the
Choirgirl Hotel'' and Smashing Pumpkins' ``Adore.'' Radiohead's
``Airbag/How Am I Driving?'' is easily the best choice here.
</P>
<P>
   POP PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCAL: Or, let's put a
bunch of songs we're all really sick of in one category.
Aerosmith's ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,'' Barenaked Ladies'
``One Week'' and the Goo Goo Dolls' ``Iris'' are the worst
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   HARD ROCK PERFORMANCE: When a so-so song by Pearl Jam (''Do the
Evolution'') is the best bet, you know a category is weak. Kiss'
``Psycho Circus'' and Marilyn Manson's ``The Dope Show'' are
horrible, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant's ``Most High'' is a mere
shadow of their former glories in Led Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   PERFORMANCES TO WATCH FOR
</P>
<P>
   Possibly in an attempt to keep folks watching, the show won't
list a schedule of performances, and some artists may be added at
the last minute. But here are the ones we're looking forward to:
</P>
<P>
   LAURYN HILL. Last year's ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' was
so good, and besides, she's never played around here as a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   MADONNA. Fun to watch, just to see what she's going to wear.
</P>
<P>
   KIRK FRANKLIN _ with Bono (yes, you read that correctly, the
lead singer of U2), Mary J. Blige and Crystal Lewis. How cool is
that?
</P>
<P>
   SHERYL CROW. We always like Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   ALANIS MORISSETTE. Because she's, well, Alanis.
</P>
<P>
   WYNTON MARSALIS. He'll lead a tribute to Duke Ellington, who
would have been 100 this year, and he'll be joined by Natalie Cole
and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THAT HOST
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessly perky Rosie O'Donnell is this year's host.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, why? O'Donnell tirelessly promotes Broadway on her afternoon
talk show, but what connection does she have to rock 'n' roll?
</P>
<P>
   Some better ideas:
</P>
<P>
   STING. He's poised, he's handsome, and he isn't getting many
nominations these days.
</P>
<P>
   BILL MURRAY. He's funny, he's hot again thanks to ``Rushmore,''
and he could do that lounge-singer guy murdering ``Stairway to
Heaven,'' just like on the old ``Saturday Night Live'' skit.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER LOPEZ. Because there's no such thing as too much
Jennifer Lopez. The music connection is that, um, give us a second
_ ``Out of Sight'' had a great soundtrack. Yeah. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA GOODING JR. OK, no obvious music connection here either.
But he's just so darned cool. And enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TEXANS
</P>
<P>
   Man, are there a lot of Texans up for Grammys this year _ more
than two dozen, from Arlington's Kirk Franklin to Dallas' Erykah
Badu and Dixie Chicks to Houston's Yolanda Adams and Clint Black.
Some we'd really like to see win _ or who may actually do so:
</P>
<P>
   KIRK FRANKLIN. He's the underdog for Song of the Year and Best
R&AMP;B Song, but he looks like a lock for Best Contemporary Soul
Gospel Album.
</P>
<P>
   THE DIXIE CHICKS. They deserve that Best New Artist trophy, but
we can also see them crossing the stage for Best Country Album and
Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal.
</P>
<P>
   LUCINDA WILLIAMS. No, she wasn't born here and she doesn't live
here anymore, but she did live in Texas for nearly 20 years. We're
betting she takes Best Contemporary Folk Album; her shot at Best
Female Rock Vocal Performance is not nearly as strong.
</P>
<P>
   BRAVE COMBO. This is the second time the Denton institution has
been up for Best Polka Album. Here's hoping.
</P>
<P>
   FASTBALL. The Austin trio is up for both Best Rock Performance
by a Duo or Group and Best Long Form Music Video for ``They Wanted
the Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LIGHT CRUST DOUGHBOYS (in collaboration with the James
Blackwood Quartet) have a shot at Best Southern, Country, or
Bluegrass Gospel Album for ``They Gave the World a Smile: The
Stamps Quartet Tribute Album.'' Good luck to 'em.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   PARING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   There are 95 Grammy categories. Way too many. Our suggestions
for a leaner, meaner show:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make ONE metal category by combining Hard Rock Performance and
Metal Performance. We don't need both, and in either case we don't
need Judas Priest's ``Bullet Train.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Make ONE country collaboration category by combining Country
Music Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal and Country
Collaboration With Vocals. Repeat after me: We don't need both.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album category, and lose the
Rock Gospel Album category. If they're not exactly the same thing,
they're close enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's the difference between Traditional Blues Album and
Contemporary Blues Album? Both feature mainly veteran performers,
such as Etta James, B.B. King and Otis Rush. So one last time: We
don't need both.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For years, members from Grace Lutheran Church
car-pooled from Arlington to neighboring Fort Worth to help make it
possible to bring the Scriptures to the blind and visually
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, sometimes more, they'd make the trek to Zion
Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really matter where they worked; their goal was
simple, if lofty: producing books of the Bible in Braille.
</P>
<P>
   When volunteers asked about the feasibility of having their own
center last summer, Grace Lutheran gave them the go-ahead to open
one in the church basement. And in September, the center was
dedicated in memory of E.O. Voge, one of the team's charter
members.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, under the leadership of husband and
wife Harvey and Ruth Brown, the Grace Lutheran team has produced
more than 500 Braille versions of books of the Bible for
distribution throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   This, the Browns say, is their ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I are retired, and it's something that's really
needed,'' Ruth Brown said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Nine teams _ five from Grace Lutheran, two from Cross of Christ
in DeSoto, one from Holy Cross in Arlington and one from Christ
Lutheran in Fort Worth _ meet at the Arlington church.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the teams at Grace Lutheran, 13 others, including
three youth groups, meet at Zion Lutheran Church in suburban
Watauga under the leadership of Verna Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are part of a network of more than 7,000 volunteers
nationwide who make up the Lutheran Braille Workers, based in
Yucaipa, Calif. Their work is financed by donations and gifts from
churches and other groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At Grace, teams make the book of Numbers in Spanish and a
Mustard Seed devotional titled ``And When You Pray'' in English. At
Zion, it's the book of Psalms in English, Corinthians in Portuguese
and the Sermon on the Mount in Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning at Grace Lutheran, a dozen volunteers were
deep in an assembly-line process.
</P>
<P>
   The operation begins with one person punching holes in white
81/2-by-11-inch sheets of paper. The next volunteer puts the paper
between two zinc plates that contain the bumpy Braille imprints.
</P>
<P>
   Each set of zinc plates contains one page of a book of the Bible
in Braille. Then the plates are put inside a metal jacket and run
through the press.
</P>
<P>
   When the plates come out of the jackets, the paper goes through
a binding process, and part of the book is made. The whole
procedure lasts about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lutheran Braille Workers began some 55 years ago when Helene
Loewe and her father, Carl Loeber, learned from a Lutheran magazine
that Braille religious books were needed in Germany because so many
were destroyed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Brown and her husband have been Lutheran Braille Workers
volunteers for more than 20 years. So has Verna Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was enchanting to think that we could make books of the
Bible for the blind,'' Montgomery said. ``And it's fun and I feel
that God really called me to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women, though, would like to spread their work to other
churches in the county. Letters seeking help have been sent out to
nearly every church in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Lutheran, but this doesn't mean other churches can't
participate,'' said Ruth Brown. ``These books are going all over
the world, and not just to Lutherans.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in volunteering with the Braille teams or
anyone who would like a Braille Bible, should call Ruth Brown at
(817) 274-8600, Verna Montgomery at (817) 831-6622 or Lutheran
Braille Workers at (909) 795-8977, or write to Box 5000, Yucaipa,
CA 92399.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Five decades of population decline is over.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Albany's population will level off at slightly more
than 100,000 in the 2000 census, narrowly averting getting shoved
into the urban minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The city isn't going to experience anything like dynamic growth,
but experts believe the population has stabilized. There are
several reasons for the turnaround. The number of people leaving
the city isn't increasing. Experts also cited growing immigrant and
minority communities, as well as a steady influx of college and
university students.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, the out-migration of persons leaving the city
has been substantially reduced in Albany _ it's not a declining
city,'' said Rocky Ferraro, planning director of the Capital
District Regional Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, cities nationwide have been losing population
to the better schools, services and open spaces of the suburbs.
This trend was exacerbated in Northeastern cities as the industrial
economic base folded. Upstate New York has been slow to recover
from the economic downturn earlier this decade, which is why
Albany's projected population increase isn't larger, Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   The population of New York's capital city peaked in 1950 at
134,995, and has declined at each census since then, coming
perilously close to 100,000 in 1990 when it hit 100,031.
</P>
<P>
   It's about more than prestige. Dipping below 100,000 would have
a devastating impact on the city's ability to attract business, its
prestige and the amount of federal aid it receives. Failure to meet
that mark would mean cuts in federal and state funding such as the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community
Development block grant program, which is allocated based in part
on population.
</P>
<P>
   A drop below 100,000 makes it difficult to lure new development
to the city, said Wallace Altes, president of the Albany-Colonie
Regional Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Declining numbers can be very scary for businesses and can
lead to reconsideration in investments,'' Altes said. ``A growing
population base typically translates into greater willingness on
the part of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jerry Jennings said his ``indicators'' show that Albany's
population may even top 104,000 in 2000. To ensure a complete and
accurate count, the mayor has appointed a committee that will be
enlisting the assistance of neighborhood associations, churches,
social services providers and other groups, to encourage people to
fill out census forms, which will arrive in the mail the last week
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The city's salvation may turn out to be the minorities and
immigrants moving here. Albany's minority population is projected
to increase in 2000. Sixty percent of the 12,000 people moved to
the region between 1991 and 1994 were African-Americans, Hispanics
or Asians, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released in 1997.
These populations traditionally settle in inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the 2000 census will also have an impact on
politics. Redistricting for U.S. congressional seats and city wards
is done based on census data.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau's most recent estimate done in 1997 was
103,564, compared to 100,031 in 1990. But some experts find that
number overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reasons to believe the city is growing, but that
number is somewhat surprising,'' said Todd Swanstrom, political
science professor at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro also has a more conservative estimate for Albany's
population in 2000: 101,733. That number would have been higher,
Ferraro said, if not for the mid-1990s economic downturn from which
upstate New York is still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Population estimates are made on the number of births and deaths
in the city, new residential building permits filed and income tax
information from the Internal Revenue Service. Actual head counts
are only done every 10 years on April 1.

STOPPING SOCIAL PROMOTIONS ONLY A FIRST STEP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and the Texas Senate, which
unanimously approved a bill to tackle social promotions in the
public schools, are absolutely right. Children shouldn't be
advanced to the next grade if they haven't mastered the necessary
skills.
</P>
<P>
   But this bill, assuming it passes the House in a form with which
the Senate and the governor can agree, is only a first step. After
years of failing to meet the needs of thousands of young people,
state educators and policy-makers are going to have to make a huge
commitment of time, energy and money _ and keep making it, long
after Bush and today's lawmakers have departed from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The need for reform is great. Some 42,000 third-graders _ more
than one-third of the students at that grade level _ failed the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the state's standardized
measurement of student achievement, in the spring of 1997. But
38,000 of the failing students were advanced to the fourth grade
anyway. They were ``socially'' promoted to keep up with their age
group.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that many Texas employers have difficulty finding
young workers with more than minimal literacy skills.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, also, that ending social promotions was a key part
of Bush's re-election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the governor proposed that students simply be held
back a grade if they failed the TAAS test. It was a
three-strikes-and-you're-out proposition because a child would have
had three chances to pass the exam or be held back.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush revised that proposal in the face of opposition from
some lawmakers and school officials. Some parents, myself included,
also believe it is not right to pass or fail a child simply on the
basis of one standardized test. The test should be an important
factor, but human input also is needed from those who know the
students and their overall capabilities the best _ their teachers
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by the Senate is an improvement over the
governor's original plan and may be an acceptable compromise. But
perhaps the House can improve the measure some more. Several House
members already have said they will try.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would still make the TAAS test the major factor
in determining promotions for third-, fifth- and eighth-graders,
beginning with the third-grade class of the 2002-2003 school year.
Those are the children who will be starting kindergarten this
August.
</P>
<P>
   The changes wouldn't affect students already in school.
</P>
<P>
   Third-graders, beginning in the spring of 2003, would have to
pass the TAAS reading test to be promoted to the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the fifth grade, they would have to pass the
reading and math sections of TAAS, and in the eighth grade they
would have to pass reading, math and writing sections of the exam.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, students would be given three chances in each year
to pass the test, and those who fail would be assigned to intensive
remedial classes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's initial plan was changed by the Senate to give
students who fail the required sections of the TAAS _ even after
three attempts _ an opportunity to still be advanced to the next
grade. A failing child could be promoted if a committee that would
include his parents, teacher and principal approves. Even then,
though, the student would have to take remedial classes.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal committee would provide a subjective look that may be
important in some students' cases. But to keep the appeals process
from being misused to gut the reform effort, the number of social
promotions that a school allowed would be considered by the Texas
Education Agency in grading a school's performance on the exemplary
to low-performing scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate plan, the state would spend $203 million for
remedial classes and teacher training. But some House members
already are questioning whether that is enough money, and minority
lawmakers, in particular, are concerned about the effect of the
bill on minority children, who make up a large portion of the
failing students.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the Legislature's sometimes-neglectful track record,
state Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, convinced the Senate to adopt an
amendment that will release school districts from enforcing the new
program if the state doesn't adequately fund it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Senate bill ``sent a strong message that no child
will be left behind in our state, that when a child is identified
with a reading deficiency we'll correct it early before it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly nothing wrong with strong messages, but this
exercise better be much more than a message. Without adequate,
continued funding for the all-important remedial instruction _ and
it won't be inexpensive _ the new program will be little more than
a cruel joke on Texas children.

CHURCH MAINTAINS BRIDGE TO PAST BY KEEPING LETTERS FROM WWII
HEROES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A few months before D-Day, the 6th of June,
1944, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower received a letter from boys in a
Sunday school class at Fort Worth's Broadway Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, England, at the time, preparing for World War
II's momentous invasion of Normandy, Eisenhower dictated this reply
on Jan. 19, 1944:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very interested to hear what you are doing. I am a firm
believer in the power of prayer and it gladdens my heart to hear
that you are praying for me and all the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about Eisenhower's letter _ and similar letters of
reply in the same wartime year from Gen. George S. Patton, Adm.
Chester W. Nimitz and Adm. Ernest J. King _ came to light in a
chance conversation between church members.
</P>
<P>
   Opal Carson, who had kept the letters in her personal files,
learned that the letters from the military leaders might be
valuable when she told a fellow Sunday school worker about them.
Her late husband, Fort Worth lawyer Robert C. Carson, had taught a
World War II-era Sunday school class for boys ages 12 and 13.
Letters of support written by the class elicited the responses from
the military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Opal Carson, who died last year, said she would like to donate
the letters so the church could sell them to help pay for its $3.5
million project to buy a new organ and renovate its sanctuary. The
project was completed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Opal Carson's son, Robert Carson II, and his wife, Judy, are
members of Broadway, and they encouraged the donation idea.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials made inquiries and learned from New York
auction authorities that the letters were valued at more than
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But before the letters were offered for sale, church members
stepped forward and donated $3,700 to the church's
organ-and-building fund so the generals' letters could remain a
part of church history, church spokewoman Martha Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Steve Shoemaker, pastor, said the church's finance
committee chairman, Walt Jennings, led the way in getting people to
donate money for the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely the widow's mite,'' said Larry Borne, one of
several church members who urged church officials to keep the
letters. Borne said Opal Carson had a desire to make a generous
donation to the church, and the letters allowed her to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the letters and photographs of the generals will be framed
and placed on display in the church. Former U.S. Rep. Pete Geren, a
church member, said he worked with the Library of Congress to
obtain photographs of the generals that had been taken about the
time the letters were written.
</P>
<P>
   James Lowe, a New York autograph expert recommended by Sotheby's
auction house, analyzed the letters, said Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's signature was the most valuable and would bring between
$2,500 and $3,000, Lowe said in an interview. All the signatures
except Eisenhower's are authentic, he said. Eisenhower's name was
signed by his aide, Kay Summersby, according to Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Patton scrawled ``G.S. Patton'' to this typed note:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear friends: Please accept for all the members of your class
the sincere thanks of myself and the soldiers whom I have the honor
to command for the prayerful words in our behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Nimitz, a Fredericksburg, Texas, native who commanded the
Pacific Fleet and engineered the crucial Midway victory, wrote:
``It is always gratifying to hear from young men of such high
ideals. I deeply appreciate your prayers for me and the officers
and men of the Fleet, and assure you we are doing our best to
defeat the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   A note from King, the chief of naval operations, declared: ``It
is good to know of the interest taken by your class in the welfare
of military leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Borne said Opal and Robert Carson both had been his Sunday
school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were humble, dedicated people,'' he said. ``I think
historically this is a wonderful thing for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   LaVonne Wilson, retired pastor's administrative assistant at
Broadway, said Opal Carson was a good friend who kept volunteering
for church jobs even into her mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the most gentle lady you ever saw, one you would want
to emulate as a Christian person,''

afterwards, the stock market rose about six inches.''

   ``According to a new poll by ABC News, only 17 percent of kids

   ``In her interview with Larry King, Linda Tripp said that if she

This would be a classic case of adding injury to insult. Actually,
Tripp said she would hug Monica very tight, then Tripp would
unhinge her jaw and swallow her whole.''

<P>
   ``According to a poll in the New York Post, if Hillary Clinton

Hillary would have the advantage because of her mean spirit and
powerful legs.''

early tonight. I found out I was just traded to Toronto.''

<P>
   ``Big news from the world of sports -- the Yankees have traded
David Wells...They traded him for Roger Clemens, a fine pitcher
there too. David Wells, don't kid yourself, he's so upset, I hear
he's stopped drinking.''

<P>
   ``You've probably heard stories about how Major League Baseball
players will be screwing around and stuff and I've heard that they
actually have pizza pies delivered during the game to the bullpen.
David Wells is the only pitcher I know who actually had pizzas
delivered to the mound.''

<P>
   ``Yeah, the trade -- David Wells, trading him away from the
Yankees -- is not very popular and, as a matter of fact, they're
already starting to talk about impeaching George Steinbrenner.''

   ``The New York Yankees have traded away our good friend David
Wells. He's going to Toronto... But it's not that bad a deal. In
return for David Wells, it's kind of complicated, here's what we
get: we get Roger Clemens, that's not a bad thing, Roger Clemens.
We also get George Clooney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashion week here in New York City...and whenever we have
something like this, everybody gets into the spirit of fashion
week. For example, all week long, the New York City cops are
outlining bodies with colorful pastel chalk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was Chinese New Year.'' Let's see if I have this
straight: it's the Year of the Rabbit, and here's how dumb I am.
I'm still writing Year of the Pig' on my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, down there in New Orleans, people were celebrating Mardi
Gras...Down there in New Orleans, Mardi Gras is a huge deal. Here
in New York City, Mardi Gras is not a big deal. In New York City,
people do not need an excuse, they do not need a special holiday to
get drunk and urinate in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there in California yesterday, they had a big auction and
they were selling off , they're trying to raise money now selling
off all of the remaining O.J. Simpson possessions. Big auction,
unbelievably successful, wildly successful -- they raised an
incredible amount of money, so much money in fact that at one
point, O.J. runs in and screams, Hey, wait a minute, is it too late
to add the knife?'''

   ``Some sad news: tonight was George Clooney's last episode of

advisors, David Caruso and Shelley Long.''  &QL;

to lose, now you just don't know when.''

the books on tape version? She already has that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Dennis Rodman hasn't signed yet with the Lakers; it's
not official. The reason is he said today, he first wants to talk
it over with his wife, Carmen Electra. That could take years! He
doesn't know where she lives!''

soon as the trial ended, all White House interns were told to
report to spring training.''  &QL; 
``I'm watching the news today (Tuesday), I see people drunk and out

Romijn-Stamos helped promote the 'Sports Illustrated' swimsuit
issue by ringing the opening bell on Wall Street. Immediately
afterwards, the stock market rose about six inches.''

   ``According to a new poll by ABC News, only 17 percent of kids

Clinton said, 'Hey, it's the only way to make Al Gore seem

live because George Clooney is leaving 'E.R.'''
</P>

thing.''

husband's. Reportedly, they have very different opinions on foreign
policy, capital punishment and threesomes.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week President Clinton flew to Mexico for
meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo. What a perfect way for
President Clinton to show the country he's a changed man. He goes
on spring break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The race for Senate in New York is already heating up. Mayor
Rudy Giuliani took a shot at Hillary Clinton yesterday, saying she
made a 'big mistake' by endorsing the Palestinian state. She
responded saying that big mistakes run in her family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juanita Hickey Broaddrick is the latest woman to come forward
to claim she was sexually assaulted by the President. In an
interview in today's Washington Post, she claims that in 1978 in a
Little Rock hotel room, Clinton bit her lips, tore her panty hose
and forced her to have sex with him. When asked for comment,
President Clinton said he couldn't have committed these acts
because on the date in question: 'I was sexually harassing Paula
Jones in another Little Rock hotel.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, Boris Yeltsin warned President Clinton not to
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia, even if they fail to reach
peace with Kosovo rebels. Yeltsin received no response to his
threat because he was talking to a coat stand with a hat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin also met with officials from the European Union this
week to discuss plans for reviving Russia's failing economy. So far
the only plan they came up with was a Yakov Smirnoff Pay-Per-View
Special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In her interview with Larry King, Linda Tripp said that if she
could meet Monica Lewinsky again, she would want to give her a hug.
This would be a classic case of adding injury to insult. Actually,
Tripp said she would hug Monica very tight, then Tripp would
unhinge her jaw and swallow her whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a poll in the New York Post, if Hillary Clinton
were to run for President against Elizabeth Dole, Dole would win in
a landslide. But if Hillary Clinton and Liddy Dole were to wrestle,
Hillary would have the advantage because of her mean spirit and
powerful legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army may start reaching out to high school dropouts in an
attempt to bolster recruitment. We're looking for a few good . .
okay forget it. Come on, dumb-ass, get in the truck. Just what we
need: an equivalency army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than two million people jammed New Orleans for Mardi
Gras, the festival of excessive eating drinking and sex, which ends

</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Clapton is selling off most of his guitar collection to

guitar. It's a crazy world, isn't it folks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots has pleaded guilty to
possession of heroin. He was given a harsh sentence of five to ten
VH-1 'Where Are They Nows.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is among the 118 people nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize. The nominators say Clinton has helped contribute to
world peace. Upon hearing this, Saddam Hussein responded from under
pile of rubble: 'Hello! Don't you people have CNN?'''

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry I may have to leave a little
early tonight. I found out I was just traded to Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news from the world of sports -- the Yankees have traded
David Wells...They traded him for Roger Clemens, a fine pitcher
there too. David Wells, don't kid yourself, he's so upset, I hear
he's stopped drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably heard stories about how Major League Baseball
players will be screwing around and stuff and I've heard that they
actually have pizza pies delivered during the game to the bullpen.
David Wells is the only pitcher I know who actually had pizzas
delivered to the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the trade -- David Wells, trading him away from the
Yankees -- is not very popular and, as a matter of fact, they're
already starting to talk about impeaching George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Yankees have traded away our good friend David
Wells. He's going to Toronto... But it's not that bad a deal. In
return for David Wells, it's kind of complicated, here's what we
get: we get Roger Clemens, that's not a bad thing, Roger Clemens.
We also get George Clooney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashion week here in New York City...and whenever we have
something like this, everybody gets into the spirit of fashion
week. For example, all week long, the New York City cops are
outlining bodies with colorful pastel chalk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was Chinese New Year.'' Let's see if I have this
straight: it's the Year of the Rabbit, and here's how dumb I am.
I'm still writing Year of the Pig' on my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, down there in New Orleans, people were celebrating Mardi
Gras...Down there in New Orleans, Mardi Gras is a huge deal. Here
in New York City, Mardi Gras is not a big deal. In New York City,
people do not need an excuse, they do not need a special holiday to
get drunk and urinate in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there in California yesterday, they had a big auction and
they were selling off , they're trying to raise money now selling
off all of the remaining O.J. Simpson possessions. Big auction,
unbelievably successful, wildly successful -- they raised an
incredible amount of money, so much money in fact that at one
point, O.J. runs in and screams, Hey, wait a minute, is it too late
to add the knife?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In honor of President's Day, today I took an intern up to my
office.''
</P>
<P>

heart-shaped pin...Here's what happened: President Clinton gave

 UNDATED: Doogie Howser .'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this week President Clinton flew to Mexico for
meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo. What a perfect way for
President Clinton to show the country he's a changed man. He goes
on spring break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The race for Senate in New York is already heating up. Mayor
Rudy Giuliani took a shot at Hillary Clinton yesterday, saying she
made a 'big mistake' by endorsing the Palestinian state. She
responded saying that big mistakes run in her family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juanita Hickey Broaddrick is the latest woman to come forward
to claim she was sexually assaulted by the President. In an
interview in today's Washington Post, she claims that in 1978 in a
Little Rock hotel room, Clinton bit her lips, tore her panty hose
and forced her to have sex with him. When asked for comment,
President Clinton said he couldn't have committed these acts
because on the date in question: 'I was sexually harassing Paula
Jones in another Little Rock hotel.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, Boris Yeltsin warned President Clinton not to
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia, even if they fail to reach
peace with Kosovo rebels. Yeltsin received no response to his
threat because he was talking to a coat stand with a hat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin also met with officials from the European Union this
week to discuss plans for reviving Russia's failing economy. So far
the only plan they came up with was a Yakov Smirnoff Pay-Per-View
Special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In her interview with Larry King, Linda Tripp said that if she
could meet Monica Lewinsky again, she would want to give her a hug.
This would be a classic case of adding injury to insult. Actually,
Tripp said she would hug Monica very tight, then Tripp would
unhinge her jaw and swallow her whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a poll in the New York Post, if Hillary Clinton
were to run for President against Elizabeth Dole, Dole would win in
a landslide. But if Hillary Clinton and Liddy Dole were to wrestle,
Hillary would have the advantage because of her mean spirit and
powerful legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army may start reaching out to high school dropouts in an
attempt to bolster recruitment. We're looking for a few good . .
okay forget it. Come on, dumb-ass, get in the truck. Just what we
need: an equivalency army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than two million people jammed New Orleans for Mardi
Gras, the festival of excessive eating drinking and sex, which ends
with the beginning of Lent, the Catholic 12-step program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Clapton is selling off most of his guitar collection to
raise money for a drug abuse center in Antigua. Meanwhile,
somewhere in Jersey, there's a kid selling pot to raise money for a
guitar. It's a crazy world, isn't it folks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots has pleaded guilty to
possession of heroin. He was given a harsh sentence of five to ten
VH-1 'Where Are They Nows.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is among the 118 people nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize. The nominators say Clinton has helped contribute to
world peace. Upon hearing this, Saddam Hussein responded from under
pile of rubble: 'Hello! Don't you people have CNN?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry I may have to leave a little
early tonight. I found out I was just traded to Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news from the world of sports -- the Yankees have traded
David Wells...They traded him for Roger Clemens, a fine pitcher
there too. David Wells, don't kid yourself, he's so upset, I hear
he's stopped drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably heard stories about how Major League Baseball
players will be screwing around and stuff and I've heard that they
actually have pizza pies delivered during the game to the bullpen.
David Wells is the only pitcher I know who actually had pizzas
delivered to the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the trade -- David Wells, trading him away from the
Yankees -- is not very popular and, as a matter of fact, they're
already starting to talk about impeaching George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Yankees have traded away our good friend David
Wells. He's going to Toronto... But it's not that bad a deal. In
return for David Wells, it's kind of complicated, here's what we
get: we get Roger Clemens, that's not a bad thing, Roger Clemens.
We also get George Clooney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashion week here in New York City...and whenever we have
something like this, everybody gets into the spirit of fashion
week. For example, all week long, the New York City cops are
outlining bodies with colorful pastel chalk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was Chinese New Year.'' Let's see if I have this
straight: it's the Year of the Rabbit, and here's how dumb I am.
I'm still writing Year of the Pig' on my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, down there in New Orleans, people were celebrating Mardi
Gras...Down there in New Orleans, Mardi Gras is a huge deal. Here
in New York City, Mardi Gras is not a big deal. In New York City,
people do not need an excuse, they do not need a special holiday to
get drunk and urinate in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there in California yesterday, they had a big auction and
they were selling off , they're trying to raise money now selling
off all of the remaining O.J. Simpson possessions. Big auction,
unbelievably successful, wildly successful -- they raised an
incredible amount of money, so much money in fact that at one
point, O.J. runs in and screams, Hey, wait a minute, is it too late
to add the knife?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In honor of President's Day, today I took an intern up to my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton for Valentine's Day...gave Hillary a lovely
heart-shaped pin...Here's what happened: President Clinton gave
Hillary the heart-shaped pin and then Bettie Currie asked her to
give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons are in Mexico. President Clinton is in Mexico
City meeting with President Zedillo and Hillary is in Cancun
getting her groove back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is moving on, he's got things to do, so he
and his lovely wife Hillary are down in Mexico talking to President
Zedillo. President Clinton is trying to arrange a trade -- and I
think it's Hillary for Jennifer Lopez.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited because President Clinton, recently impeached
President Clinton who was acquitted a couple of days ago, now is
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. He's being recognized for
maintaining that fragile peace between his wife and his
girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, President Clinton is one of 118 people nominated for a
Nobel Peace Prize. However, historically, and I'll check this in
the encyclopedia when I get upstairs, I believe he's the only one
to ever be nominated for a Nobel Prize while having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recent poll about presidential
behavior...Fifty-six percent of Americans believe that President
Clinton has the lowest moral standards of any modern president. You
know what this means? This means this guy could win a third term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday morning, Linda Tripp was on the Today' show, and
earlier tonight, Linda Tripp was on the Larry King Live' show, and
when you see Linda Tripp, it gives you a really good idea of what
J.Edgar Hoover looked like at cocktail parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More bad news for President Clinton -- did you hear about
this? He comes back from Mexico and his mother-in-law has moved
into the White House...Clinton's doing everything he can to get her
out of his hair, because, you know, it's trouble there having your
mother-in-law in the White House, so today he fixed her up with
Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about this? President Clinton's mother-in-law has
moved into the White House. I want to tell you something, there is
nothing like a long visit from the mother-in-law to take care of an
already shaky marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Clinton's already getting fed up with his
mother-in-law. Earlier today, he asked Vernon Jordan to get her a
job at Revlon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what Linda Tripp has given up for Lent because I know
last year, she gave up Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is back up there in New Hampshire...It's a
very nostalgic trip for President Clinton, returning to New
Hampshire. That's the state where he first lied about sex.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sad news: tonight was George Clooney's last episode of
'E.R.' Dr. Ross is gone. He said leaving 'E.R.' was a tough
decision, but he decided to do it after talking it over with his
advisors, David Caruso and Shelley Long.''  &QL; 
``Dole was on 'Good Morning America' this morning (Thursday). Now
that he's on Viagra, the producers use the Elvis shot: they only
shoot him from the waist up now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night the L.A. Clippers lost in double overtime. I
think they're getting better. I mean, you still know they're going
to lose, now you just don't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Tripp was on 'Larry King' the other night. She says she
may still write a book. Wouldn't it be a lot easier to just release
the books on tape version? She already has that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Dennis Rodman hasn't signed yet with the Lakers; it's
not official. The reason is he said today, he first wants to talk
it over with his wife, Carmen Electra. That could take years! He
doesn't know where she lives!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Clinton has learned his lesson? I don't think so. As
soon as the trial ended, all White House interns were told to
report to spring training.''  &QL; 
``I'm watching the news today (Tuesday), I see people drunk and out
of their minds, I see men throwing beads, women bearing their
breasts. That Clinton victory party is unbelievable!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN &LR; '
</P>
<P>
   ``It was announced yesterday that President Clinton was
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. The President was singled out
for his effort to end violence in the Middle East and his attempts
to get Hillary to stop hitting him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday President Clinton said that 'The tide of spring has
brought a new season for friendship.' In other words, it's getting
warmer out and he's horny again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick Jagger took Jerry Hall skiing over Valentine's weekend to
try and patch up their relationship, but it didn't work. Apparently
everything was going fine until Jagger got somebody on the ski lift
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning in the financial district, supermodel Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos helped promote the 'Sports Illustrated' swimsuit
issue by ringing the opening bell on Wall Street. Immediately
afterwards, the stock market rose about six inches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll by ABC News, only 17 percent of kids
say that they'd like to be President of the United States when they
grow up. Most kids today say they'd rather sleep with the President
and sign a huge book deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reported today that Air Force One recently started
serving a beer made from hemp. When asked about it, President
Clinton said, 'Hey, it's the only way to make Al Gore seem
interesting.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, President Clinton told reporters that his
mother-in-law has moved into the White House. The President said he
allowed her to move in because she's all alone and she doesn't have
a bad body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been reported in a magazine that when Demi Moore is
filming a movie, she will only wash her hair with Evian water. Not
only that, she'll only wash her breasts with cleansers that don't
harm plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane Sawyer is very upset because the other day she did an
interview with a zookeeper and during the interview a chimpanzee
sat on top of her head. Afterwards, Sam Donaldson called up to say,
'Don't feel bad. I wear a chimp on my head everyday.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier tonight, George Clooney's character on 'E.R.' left the
show because he was caught helping a patient with an assisted
suicide. Ironically, the patient was a woman who'd lost her will to
live because George Clooney is leaving 'E.R.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Lucy Lawless who plays Xena the Warrior
Princess, said she likes being a gay icon even though she's married
with children. In a different interview, Tinky Winky said the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Political experts are saying that if Hillary Clinton does run
for Senate, she may end up expressing views that conflict with her
husband's. Reportedly, they have very different opinions on foreign
policy, capital punishment and threesomes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Celine Dion vehemently denied that
she's anorexic. However, Celine did admit that her music is one of
the leading causes of bulimia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last couple of years, one million additional people
started riding New York's subways. In fact, people say the subways
are so crowded these days you can barely urinate without hitting
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, Michael Jackson broke his wrist and had to be
taken to the hospital. Apparently, when Jackson got to the
hospital, his only request was that his doctor be Doogie Howser.''

   SAN FRANCISCO DE NENTON, Guatemala _ On the morning of July 17,
1982, a convoy of army trucks made its way up a nearly impassable
trail to this remote Mayan Indian hamlet and unloaded a company of
troops. Soon afterward a helicopter arrived with the unit's
officers.
</P>
<P>
   As the troops spread out they ordered the village men to round
up some cows for a feast. But meanwhile soldiers corralled the rest
of the people into the huts that dotted the site _ a magistrate's
tiny office, a chapel and mud-walled dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was a butchery that left all but four of the
village's inhabitants dead and all the buildings razed. According
to contemporary accounts by people who lived in neighboring
communities, many of the women were ordered to disrobe and were
raped.
</P>
<P>
   Children were torn from mothers' arms and eviscerated by knives
or beheaded by machetes. The rampaging troops killed all they
found, shooting some villagers, blowing some up with grenades,
hacking some to death, burning some or crushing them under the
walls of falling buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and acquaintances of the victims compiled a list of
376 villagers believed to have perished. For the last 17 years
there had been no serious effort to check this list or details of
the massacre by independent means, but finally the light of
scientific inquiry has begun to expose material evidence of the
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   The facts unearthed by scientists who have been working here in
the last few weeks appear to corroborate contemporary accounts all
too graphically.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of San Francisco de Nenton was common throughout
Guatemala in the 1980s, as the government, which had support from
the United States, sought to crush rebel guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the country's 36-year civil war formally ended, and with
peace came an end to massacres (although isolated cases of
political violence have continued). The present government has
sought to heal some of the wounds of war, and recently sentenced
three men to death for murders of civilians they were accused of
having committed while serving in the dreaded paramilitary Civil
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   But the tally of dead and missing victims of Guatemala's reign
of terror is far from complete, and a band of volunteer forensic
anthropologists, acting with the government's blessing, has set out
to decipher a few of the massacre sites, gathering evidence from
shattered bones, spent bullets and domestic objects including the
pitiful remnants of children's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no political objectives,'' said Fredy A.
Peccerelli, a forensic anthropologist who heads the Foundation for
Forensic Anthropology of Guatemala. ``What we're attempting to do
is check the accounts of witnesses and wherever possible to apply
the techniques of forensic science to set the record straight. We
examine massacre sites using many of the same techniques police use
at crime scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Money for the project is all but nonexistent, except for
sporadic donations by the George Soros Foundation and some other
philanthropic groups. Despite the lack of money, the volunteers,
supported mainly by their wives and husbands, have come from
various countries to join their Guatemalan forensic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they apply their experience as anthropologists,
archeologists and osteologists in sifting truth from legend as they
pick through the rubble of recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never exhume and investigate all the many massacre
sites in Guatemala,'' Peccerelli said, ``but our work in San
Francisco de Nenton will stand as a symbol of all the communities
that were wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their lack of material resources the team is rich in
experience. In the San Francisco project as in dozens of other
projects involving massacre sites in Guatemala, the group has had
support and guidance from Dr. Clyde Collins Snow, 71, a forensic
anthropologist who lives in Norman, Okla. Snow, a legend among
forensic experts, has investigated massacres in 20 countries in
Latin America, Africa, the Balkans and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known cases was an investigation of the identity
and manner of death of a young woman slain, along with about 10,000
other people, by Argentina's military regime in the ``dirty war''
of the 1970s. At a 1985 trial in Buenos Aires of military officers
charged with the murders, Snow presented such compelling and
detailed evidence of judicial crime that several high-ranking
officers were convicted and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the young Argentine anthropologists who worked with Snow
in his investigation was Dario Olmo, who went on to investigate
massacre sites elsewhere, including Bosnia, Kurdistan and,
rejoining Snow, here in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The place where San Francisco de Nenton stood covers a cluster
of picturesque hills a few miles south of the Mexican border.
Adorned by an ancient Mayan pyramid, the site would make a lovely
picnic ground.
</P>
<P>
   But just beneath the grassy surface lies the horror the forensic
team is unearthing, as it measures, photographs and catalogs the
grim remnants before transporting them to Peccerelli's combination
home and laboratory in Guatemala City. There, the bones will be
X-rayed and further examined.
</P>
<P>
   At one of a half-dozen burial sites discovered at San Francisco
de Nenton so far, Renaldo Acevedo, a Guatemalan anthropologist,
paused to look into a shallow pit where he and several colleagues
had been digging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dos ninos o ninas,'' he murmured as Snow arrived. A cluster of
children's bones covered by the faded but still colorful clothing
of an adult Indian woman lay exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Snow carefully dislodged one of several jaw bones in the pit and
held it close to his glasses. Speaking carefully in a slow Texas
drawl as if addressing a tape recorder in the Oklahoma City morgue
where he often works, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the site of a house said to have belonged to one
Felipe Sylvestre. We have here a juvenile skull with several
fractures, probably post-mortem. Two of the teeth are deciduous but
one molar has erupted. This child was between 6 and 7 years old.
Sex undetermined, but may be inferred from laboratory measurements
and a statistical computer program called discriminant function
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, he explained to an onlooker, ``is essentially a
tool for comparing measurements taken of one individual with a huge
data base accumulated over many years.'' Of its accuracy, he said,
``The computer picks the sex correctly about 90 percent of the time
but gets the race right in only about 80 percent of the cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo held up a handful of cartridge cases he had found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Snow said. ``These are all .223-caliber M-16 rounds.
That means that the troops who shot these children were regular
army, not Civil Patrol men, who carried only .22-caliber sporting
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   He paused and added, ``Poor little kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A hundred yards away, working with a dental pick and toothbrush,
Claudia Rivera and several other Guatemalan archeologists were
excavating the village magistrate's office. So far, they had found
skull parts and the jaws of 11 bodies.

STUDY SHOWS SURPRISING NUMBER OF GIRLS WORK TO SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A surprising number of girls and young women
work while attending school, and nearly a quarter either support
themselves or others in often illegal employment situations,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Young Women's Work Project recently
issued its first national study of the work experiences of poor and
working-class females under 21. The national nonprofit organization
surveyed 865 girls and women, ages 12 through 20, from 26 states
and the District of Columbia who worked with community agencies.
Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than two-thirds of those surveyed worked between seven
and 35 hours per week event though they attended school;
</P>
<P>
   _ 27 percent worked illegally because they were too young for
legal jobs;
</P>
<P>
   _ 22 percent supported themselves and, in many cases, others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results smash the stereotypes,'' said Lateefah Simon,
executive director of the Center for Young Women's Development in
San Francisco, which established the Young Women's Work Project
last year. ``They argue for a shift in how we view and enforce
child labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The center advocates for employment for young women while
providing them with leadership training and job opportunities. The
new project takes that concept nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, laws designed to protect children from labor
exploitation work against young women seeking work by pushing them
into illegal jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in legal jobs, young girls are frequently unaware of job
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes and saddens me that 43 percent of those questioned
said they didn't know they could take a 10-minute break on their
jobs,'' said Kelly O'Neill, co-founder of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young women really, really want the opportunity to do things,
learn things, be leaders and make a difference,'' O'Neill said.

 SAN FRANCISCO DE NENTON, Guatemala: 11 bodies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a painstaking process of sorting and matching, the first
batches of bones and artifacts were packed in plastic bags and
cardboard cartons. The team's pickup truck doubles as a hearse,
transporting the forensic treasure through the bandit-infested
Guatemalan highlands to Peccerelli's laboratory in Guatemala City.
There the skeletons are being laid out on tables for closer
scrutiny and measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much the same as excavating an archeological site,'' Ms.
Rivera said. ``As the years pass, everything in a site like this
decays, and it gets harder to interpret, just as ancient sites are
hard to interpret. But for us this is not academic archeology. This
place _ how shall I say? _ it has special meaning for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said, ``We see some straight-edged machete cuts on the arms
and skulls of the men who died in this building, with many shell
cases and bullets all over the place. Witness accounts spoke of
soldiers forcing men into this building, bringing them out 8 or 10
at a time and shooting them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the troops fired their weapons into the men still
inside the building, and then tossed in one or more grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Ms. Rivera said, ``we've found many bullets that seem
to have come from the door. There are traces of an explosion. The
house was apparently set on fire _ we've found the charred wooden
door lintel and other evidence of burning. Then the troops
collapsed the walls of the house to bury the corpses.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow pondered the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is that we are seeing lots of fragments of
skulls, pelvises, vertebrae and ribs, but almost no femurs.
Scavenging animals could have carried off small bones, but probably
not femurs, so what became of the femurs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, let's imagine a hypothesis and see if we can find some way
to test it,'' he continued. ``We know that all the sites we've
found in San Francisco so far have been disturbed, and we know from
witnesses that some time after the massacre troops came back to
tidy things up and conceal the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then the bodies would have partly decomposed. It could be
that the legs of a lot of victims were protruding from the
collapsed building walls. When the troops tried to pull them out
the legs could have separated from the bodies, and the soldiers
might have buried the legs somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   About then there arrived a local man named Mateo Perez Ramos,
who had narrowly escaped being herded into the magistrate's house
and who had fled Mexico. Perez said he had seen the burial of three
large sacks of loose bones some months after the massacre, and he
pointed to a place between two trees.
</P>
<P>
   But even aided by a bulldozer, Peccerelli's group failed to find
the bones in the first few days of work.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of bones elsewhere, however. Skeletons turned
up under the collapsed walls of the village chapel and in a house
where coffee beans seemed to have been roasting just before the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen skeletons from San Francisco and other massacre sites
have already arrived at Peccerelli's Guatemala City laboratory,
grotesquely arrayed on tables around a front-yard swimming pool.
Each set of bones was assembled as completely as possible,
post-mortem breaks in skulls were glued together, and case dossiers
were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the massacre victims had managed to get extensive dental
repairs in their lives, including gold crowns and dentures. These
and healed fractures in arm and leg bones are being compared with
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic teams sometimes make as many as 200 skeletal
measurements in pursuing identities. For example, slight
disparities in the lengths of the radius and ulna arm bones can
reveal a person's handedness. Another useful gauge is the degree of
fusion between two adjoining pelvic bones (the pubic symphysis),
which indicates an adult's age quite accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of an eye socket's width to its height, the distance
between brow ridges, the width of nose bridges and many other
facial characteristics can suggest kinships that help in tracing
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where relatives (and money) are available, DNA analysis
is a powerful identification tool, Snow said. Even in badly decayed
skeletons, hard shells of dentine usually protect the pulp cavities
of teeth, preserving the DNA inside.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeletons show evidence of torture before death; one man
showed marks left by wires that had bound his wrists while he was
assailed on all sides by machete. Another skeleton's pelvis was
riddled with bullet fragments; the man apparently remained alive
until he was dispatched by a machete blow.
</P>
<P>
   The copper cladding of military bullets leaves traces on bone
when it corrodes, depositing indelible green stains that help
forensic experts reconstruct events.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the many forensic expeditions he has made to Guatemala
since 1991, Snow examined the skeletons of people whose lumbar
vertebrae had been smashed before death by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out,'' he said, ``that the Civil Patrol troops had a
habit of tying their victims to trees and then forcing relatives in
the village at gunpoint to chop away at the prisoners' backs with
machetes. When the troops got bored they would shoot the dying
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivera said: ``I just cannot understand how people can do
these things to each other. How can a man cut a child's throat?
Must these things go on forever?'' &QL;

WEIGHING `MAD COW' RISKS IN AMERICAN DEER AND ELK

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a 30-year-old deer hunter lies dying at his home near Salt
Lake City, consumer advocates and government regulators are
squabbling over a terrifying question that cannot be answered to
anyone's satisfaction: Is it possible to contract a version of mad
cow disease from eating deer or elk?
</P>
<P>
   Mad cow disease appeared in British cattle in the mid-1980s and
caused an epidemic that left the brains of infected animals spongy
and riddled with gum-like strings. Eventually, the British
government ordered the destruction of more than 4 million animals.
At least 34 young people in Britain contracted a human form of the
fatal disease, possibly from eating infected beef or from coming
into contact with products made from sick cows.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing similar has turned up in American beef, although experts
believe one in a million cows will develop the disease
spontaneously and animal feeding practices have been revised to
reduce the chances of transmission. But a similar disease has been
seen in sheep and mink and now people are worried about a version
of mad cow disease that is endemic in deer and elk in parts of
Colorado and Wyoming, raising the possibility that hunters who eat
infected animals might similarly develop a human form of the deer
and elk malady, called chronic wasting disease.
</P>
<P>
   The cow, elk, deer and human diseases belong to a family of
disorders called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or TSE.
The human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD, occurs in three
varieties. Most cases are spontaneous and have no known cause.
About 10 percent of cases run in families due to inherited gene
defects. The British cases are called new variant CJD.
</P>
<P>
   In all three varieties, the disease agent is believed to be not
a virus or bacterium but a mysterious particle called a prion _ a
kind of renegade protein that transforms normal proteins into
abnormal, indestructible substances that create spongy holes in the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Prion diseases have been found in 85 species, passing easily
between some animals and not others. When a prion ``jumps''
species, new TSE diseases are created that can be more or less
virulent for reasons no one can explain.
</P>
<P>
   This is the question raised by the deer hunter's case: Does he
have a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease contracted from
deer and elk, and if so, what would it look like? Health and
wildlife officials are quick to point out that there is no proof
that mad deer or elk disease has ``jumped'' to humans. At the same
time, consumer advocates point to the dying hunter, Doug McEwen,
whose illness is uncannily similar to that seen in the young
victims of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   According to his wife, Tracie, McEwen hunted in season, and
often ate deer and elk that he bagged. But he never hunted in
Colorado or Wyoming, where chronic wasting disease is found. So no
one knows if he contracted his brain disease from animals or
spontaneously developed the illness destroying his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, McEwen was a frequent donor of blood plasma and his
plasma was pooled with many blood products and shipped to 21
countries. Blood safety officials here and abroad at first
quarantined the blood products but have since let some of them be
used.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the mad cow outbreak in Britain, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration barred blood banks from accepting
donations from people with family members with CJD. But given that
it is not known if blood or plasma can transmit the disease, and
the fact that almost all Americans with the disease have the
sporadic form, which tends not to involve the blood, the Public
Health Service and food and drug agency changed the nation's blood
policy in August. Now only those people with familial or genetic
versions of CJD are prohibited from donating blood, said Dr. Jay
Epstein of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the
drug agency.
</P>
<P>
   American public health officials say that chronic wasting
disease in deer and elk and McEwen's plasma donations pose no
threat to people. Careful epidemiological surveys have not shown
any increase in the type of brain disease afflicting McEwen and no
indication that frequent users of blood products, like
hemophiliacs, have a higher incidence of any kind of CJD, said Dr.
Lawrence Schonberger, a physician and epidemiologist who
coordinates surveillance activities for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are unconvinced. ``The fact that we have a disease
in elk and deer at levels equivalent to mad cow disease at the
height of the British epidemic is truly alarming,'' said John
Stauber, director of the Center for Media and Democracy, a group
that reports on government and industry public relations, and the
author of ``Mad Cow USA,'' a book critical of American health
officials. In both cases, an estimated 6 percent of animals carry
the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Stauber and others interested in the disease say they distrust
government estimates, citing, among other things, published reports
estimating that 6 percent to 8 percent of people who are told they
have Alzheimer's disease may actually have a form of CJD, said Dr.
Thomas Pringle, a scientific consultant for the Sperling
Foundation, a charitable public health organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was nothing learned from the British experience?'' asked
Pringle, who maintains an encyclopedic Web page on the subject
(www.mad-cow.org). ``Why are we repeating the gamble they took?''
British officials for years adamantly denied the cow disease was
any threat to humans but were mistaken, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McEwen, a territory manager of a groceries firm who lives in
Kaysville, Utah, first showed symptoms last June when he forgot how
to spell his wife's name and could no longer do simple arithmetic.
His condition worsened rapidly and by the end of the summer he was
forced to quit his job.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists carried out scores of tests, including brain scans
and spinal taps, to no avail, until Nov. 24, when they finally took
a brain biopsy. The next day, McEwen was given a diagnosis of CJD.

</P>
<P>
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease strikes one in a million people over
age 50, said Dr. Michael Hansen, a scientist who closely follows
the issue for Consumer's Union. The disease strikes fewer than one
in a billion people worldwide at McEwen's age, 30. Moreover, in
McEwen's case, the disease has moved with astounding rapidity,
leaving him near death, unable to recognize his two young daughters
and wife.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by McEwen's age and the speed of his illness, state
health officials sent a brain tissue sample to Dr. Pierluigi
Gambetti, an expert on prion diseases at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland. Gambetti ruled out most known causes of
CJD. McEwen never received transplanted tissues that might have
been infected with abnormal prions. His disease was not inherited
and it definitely did not come from cattle. The diagnosis: sporadic
CJD, meaning no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like that are rare but not unknown, Gambetti said. And
while McEwen's case is atypical, it fits the normal variation of
sporadic CJD worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Pringle and others do not accept this diagnosis as final.
They point out that no one knows what chronic wasting disease would
look like in a human and tests to determine the nature of such a
disease have not been done.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals have prion proteins whose structure varies by just a
few building blocks called amino acids, Pringle said. The
difference between a cow and a human prion might be eight of these
building blocks out of hundreds. But when the abnormal cow prion
co-opts the normal human prion, a new abnormal human prion _ and a
new disease _ is formed. It looks exactly like a CJD-related human
prion but it can be more insidious. If the new variety of human
prion is injected into a cat, yet another disease can be created.
It might be more infectious or less infectious in the cat. Such
experiments in which the infectious prion of one species is
``passaged'' into another species is a standard test for sorting
out various TSEs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many imponderables in these experiments,'' said Dr.
Byron Caughey, a prion expert at the National Institute of Health
Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton, Mont. ``One prion is an
infectious unit large enough to give you the disease. But it can be
terribly inefficient going across species. A person could take in a
billion infectious units from a deer or elk and never get sick in
his lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberger said that there were no plans to carry out
interspecies tests on McEwen's brain tissue because it is clear
that he has a natural human form of the disease and because there
is no increase of CJD where deer and elk hunting occurs.
</P>
<P>
   According to wildlife officials, chronic wasting disease affects
about 5 percent of the deer and 1 percent of the elk found in a
small area in northeastern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Sick
animals drool excessively, stagger around and lose weight before
dying. Hunters in several states are required to turn in deer and
elk heads so that the brain tissue can be tested. So far the
disease in the wild has not spread beyond Colorado and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Game farms are another story. The disease is found in captive
deer and elk herds in three states _ South Dakota, Nebraska and
Oklahoma _ and in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, said Dr.
Beth Williams, the nation's leading expert on chronic wasting
disease, at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. The disease was
reported in the mid-1960s in the foothills Wildlife Research
Station in Fort Collins, Colo., where it eventually wiped out 90
percent of the animals. But before people knew what was happening,
many infected animals were sold to game farms or zoos in other
states for breeding purposes, thus spreading the infection.
Ranchers made large profits selling antlers to Asia, where they are
used in making herbal remedies and aphrodisiacs.
</P>
<P>
   The disease was first observed in the wild in 1981, Dr. Williams
said. No one knows how it spreads. The infectious prion may be shed
in saliva, feces or placenta and if wild animals come across downed
fences, they might step on contaminated ground. There is new
evidence that the prion may be concentrated in inflamed skin cells,
suggesting that the disease could be spread via scratching posts or
trees in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Miller, a veterinarian with the Colorado Department of
Wildlife who is familiar with the problem, said that thousands of
people have consumed deer and elk meat and field dressed hundreds
of infected animals in the Fort Collins area over the last 25
years. ``We make no secret of where the disease occurs,'' and leave
it up to hunters to decide the risks for themselves, he said,
although hunters are advised to wear gloves when cutting up animals
and to avoid brain and spinal cord tissue.
</P>
<P>
   But a deeper reason to worry is the diabolical nature of the
infectious prion particle. It seemingly cannot be destroyed. When
medical instruments contaminated with prions are boiled at high
temperatures for 30 minutes, the prions remain infectious _ and
have passed the infection from person to person. When infected
materials are incinerated, the ash contains prions, which remain
infectious.
</P>
<P>
   This problem is highly relevant to Tracie McEwen, who has
learned that her local funeral home will not embalm her husband if
an autopsy, which would expose his brain tissue, is performed.
Several prion laboratories are urging her to donate her husband's
brain to them exclusively, said Mel Steiger, also from Salt Lake
City, whose wife died last spring from CJD and who is helping Mrs.
McEwen through her ordeal. ``She has not decided what to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal officials are caught in a classic regulatory
bind of weighing risks and benefits. The risks of spreading CJD
contracted from deer and elk seem minuscule compared with
threatening jobs (the Colorado Department of Wildlife gets half its
income from selling deer and elk tags to mostly out-of-state
hunters), frightening hunters needlessly and shaking confidence in
the nation's blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberger is confident that the best decisions have been made
on the available evidence. ``If something happens down the road
people will come and chop our heads off,'' he said. ``But I don't
think that's going to happen.''

IN THE HISTORY OF GYNECOLOGY, A SURPRISING CHAPTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga., Texas)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electricity has given so much comfort to womankind, such
surcease to her life of drudgery. It gave her the vacuum cleaner,
the pop-up toaster and the automatic ice dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps above all, it gave her the vibrator. In the annals
of Victorian medicine, a time of ``Goetze's device for producing
dimples'' and ``Merrell's strengthening cordial, liver invigorator
and purifier of the blood,'' the debut of the electromechanical
vibrator in the early 1880s was one medical event that truly worked
wonders _ safely, reliably, repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Rachel Maines describes in her exhaustively
researched if decidedly offbeat work, ``The Technology of Orgasm:
`Hysteria,' the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction'' (Johns
Hopkins Press, 1999), the vibrator was developed to perfect and
automate a function that doctors had long performed for their
female patients: the relief of physical, emotional and sexual
tension through external pelvic massage, culminating in orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors, the routine had usually been tedious, with about as
much erotic content as a Kenneth Starr document. ``Most of them did
it because they felt it was their duty,'' Dr. Maines said in an
interview. ``It wasn't sexual at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The vibrator, she argues, made that job easy, quick and clean.
With a vibrator in the office, a doctor could complete in seconds
or minutes what had taken up to an hour through manual means. With
a vibrator, a female patient suffering from any number of symptoms
labeled ``hysterical'' or ``neurasthenic'' could be given relief _
or at least be pleased enough to guarantee her habitual patronage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the women felt much better afterwards, slept better,
smiled more,'' said Dr. Maines. Besides, she added, hysteria, as it
was traditionally defined, was an incurable, chronic disease. ``The
patient had to go to the doctor regularly,'' Dr. Maines said. ``She
didn't die. She was a cash cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it is hard to fathom doctors giving their patients
what Dr. Maines calls regular ``vulvular'' massage, either manually
or electromechanically. But the 1899 edition of the Merck Manual, a
reference guide for physicians, lists massage as a treatment for
hysteria (as well as sulfuric acid for nymphomania). And in a 1903
commentary on treatments for hysterical patients, Dr. Samuel Howard
Monell wrote that ``pelvic massage (in gynecology) has its
brilliant advocates and they report wonderful results.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that many doctors had difficulty treating patients
``with their own fingers,'' and hailed the vibrator as a godsend:
``Special applicators (motor driven) give practical value and
office convenience to what otherwise is impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that by the turn of the 20th century, about 20
years after Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville patented the first
electromechanical vibrator, there were at least two dozen models
available to the medical profession. There were musical vibrators,
counterweighted vibrators, vibratory forks, undulating wire coils
called vibratiles, vibrators that hung from the ceiling, vibrators
attached to tables, floor models on rollers and portable devices
that fit in the palm of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   They were powered by electric current, battery, foot pedal,
water turbine, gas engine or air pressure, and they shimmied at
speeds ranging from 1,000 to 7,000 pulses per minute. They were
priced to move, ranging from a low of $15 to what Dr. Maines calls
the ``Cadillac of vibrators,'' the Chattanooga, which cost $200
plus freight charges in 1904 and which, in its aggressive
multi-cantilevered design, is more evocative of the Tower of London
than the Pink Pussycat boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors used vibrators for many non-orgasmic purposes, including
to treat constipation, arthritis, muscle fatigue, inflammation
laryngitis and tumors; and men as well as women were the recipients
of vibratory physic. But that a big selling point for the devices
was their particular usefulness in treating ``female ailments'' can
be gleaned from catalog copy and medical textbooks at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A text from 1883 called ``Health For Women'' recommended the new
vibrators for treating ``pelvic hyperemia,'' or congestion of the
genitalia. Vibrators were also marketed directly to women, as home
appliances. In fact, the vibrator was only the fifth household
device to be electrified, after the sewing machine, fan, tea kettle
and toaster, and preceding by about a decade the vacuum cleaner and
electric iron _ perhaps, Dr. Maines suggests, ``reflecting consumer
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertised in such respectable periodicals as Needlecraft,
Woman's Home Companion, Modern Priscilla and the Sears, Roebuck
catalog, vibrators were pitched as ``aids that every woman
appreciates,'' with the delicious promise that ``all the pleasures
of youth ... will throb within you.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the vibrators and their accoutrements almost
never took the form of the dildo, for the simple reason that
vibrators were meant to be used externally. As a result, medically
indicated massage therapy could be pitched as upstanding and
asexual _ and less risque than the gynecologist's speculum, which
came under heavy ethical fire when it was first introduced in the
late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maines, head of Maines and Associates, a firm that offers
cataloging and research services to museums and archives, first
stumbled on her piquant subject while researching a paper on the
history of needlework. Thumbing through a 1906 needlepoint
magazine, she found, to her astonishment, an advertisement for a
vibrator. When she realized there was no scholarly history of the
vibrator and related ``technologies of orgasm,'' she decided to
research the topic, consulting libraries around this country and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her investigations led her to conclude that doctors became the
keepers of the female orgasm for several related reasons. To begin
with, women have been presumed since Hippocrates' day, if not
earlier, to suffer from some sort of ``womb furie'' _ the word
``hysteria,'' after all, derives from uterus. The result was
thought to be a spectacular assortment of symptoms, including
lassitude, irritability, depression, confusion, palpitations of the
heart, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, muscle spasms, stomach
upsets, writing cramps, ticklishness and weepiness.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to treat the wayward female than a physician, and
where better to address his ministrations than toward the general
area of her rebellious female parts?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maines also proposes that women historically have suffered
from a lack of sexual satisfaction _ that they needed somebody's
help to have the orgasms they were not having in the bedroom. By
the tenets of what she calls the ``androcentric'' model of sex,
women were supposed to be satisfied by the motions of heterosexual
intercourse _ the missionary position and its close proxies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as many studies have shown, at least two-thirds of women
fail to reach orgasm through coitus alone, Dr. Maines said. As a
result, she said, many women historically may have spent their
lives in an orgasm deficit, without necessarily identifying it as
such. At the same time, religious edicts against masturbation
discouraged women from self-exploration. ``In effect,'' she writes,
``doctors inherited the task of producing orgasm in women because
it was a job nobody else wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The vibrator was not the first therapeutic approach to treating
feminine ``pelvic hyperemia.'' Dr. Maines and other historians have
described the practice of hydrotherapy, the taking to the baths or
spas, as an ancient means to a sometimes climactic end. A century
ago, spas like Saratoga Springs were a favorite destination of the
well-to-do, who enjoyed the diversity of aqua-regimens: the warm
baths, the bracing baths, the mineral baths, the gas-infused bubbly
baths, the swirling proto-Jacuzzi baths, and, especially, the
``douche'' baths, in which a current of water was directed through
a high-pressure hose or nozzle against the surface of the body _ or
into a cavity of the body, if the bather so desired.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman named Abigail May, who traveled to Ballston
Springs, N.Y., in 1800, seeking relief from the pain of her cancer,
found happiness, if not a cure, in the water treatments, Dr. Maines
writes, using information from a journal she found during her
research. At first nervous at the sight of the douche hoses, May
made sure to ``have laudanum handy'' and then took the plunge. ``I
screamed merrily _ so says Mama,'' May wrote in her journal. ``For
my own part I do not remember much about it _ I felt finely for two
hours after bathing'' and was ``so much pleased with the Bath''
that she went again not long afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The vibrator remained a staple of the doctor's armamentarium and
the proper wife's boudoir until the 1920s, Dr. Maines said, when it
began showing up in stag films and quickly lost its patina of
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrators are still widely available, of course _ unless you
happen to live in Alabama, Georgia and Texas, where state
legislatures have banned the sale of vibrators and other ``sex
toys.'' The American Civil Liberties Union is now vigorously
challenging the Alabama statute. If Alabama permits the prescribing
of the anti-impotence drug Viagra, the ACLU argues, how dare it
tell women that they can't have their own electromechanical
prescription for joy?

SOME RARE PEOPLE SEE A SOUND AND HEAR A COLOR

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people, when not under the influence of hallucinogenic
drugs, smell, experience the sensory world as a place of orderly
segregation. Sight, sound, taste and touch live in different
neighborhoods and commute on separate freeways: A Beethoven
symphony is not pink and azure; the name Angela does not taste like
creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are those for whom these basic rules of the sensorium
do not seem to apply. They have a rare condition called
synesthesia, in which the customary boundaries between the senses
appear to break down, sight mingling with sound, or taste with
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the composer Olivier Messiaen, speaking of the union of
color and tone in his music, explained to an interviewer: ``When I
hear music, I see inwardly, in the mind's eye, colors which move
with the music. This is not imagination, nor is it a psychic
phenomenon. It is an inward reality.'' A 21-year-old woman,
participating in an continuing synesthesia study at the National
Institute of Mental Health, told researchers that when she ate
buttered toast, ``it is rough, but not pointy; and if it has jelly
on it the rough texture is rounded.'' And Carol Steen, a New York
artist who, like most synesthetes, has had synesthetic experiences
from an early age and who uses her perceptions in her work, says
she distinguishes different types of headaches by their colors.
``If it's a sinus headache, it's green,'' Ms. Steen said.
</P>
<P>
   Synesthesia received a flurry of attention from artists and
psychologists at the turn of the century. But until relatively
recently, modern science largely ignored it. Those who experienced
synesthesia rarely complained (``It's the most wonderful thing in
the world!'' exclaimed one synesthetic woman). And the private
nature of the perceptions made investigation difficult _ there was
no objective way to tell what, if anything, unusual was taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, however, the arrival of imaging techniques
and other new technologies for studying the brain at work has
revived interest in synesthesia, capturing the interest of a small
core of researchers in a variety of countries and disciplines. PET
scanners, electrophysiological recording, DNA analysis and other
techniques are increasingly being used. In the current issue of The
Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, for example,
German researchers from the University of Hanover Medical School
report electrophysiological findings from a group of synesthetic
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   An understanding of synesthesia as a perceptual anomaly,
researchers hope, may eventually help elucidate normal perception,
or even shed light on consciousness itself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much more remains unknown about the comingling of the
senses than is known. Even basic facts about synesthesia _ its
prevalence, for example _ are still less than certain. One
newspaper and magazine survey, however, by Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen, a
psychologist, and his research group at Cambridge University in
England, found that one out of 2,000 people reported synesthetic
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists offer differing theories of synesthesia's cause: Some
argue that it represents an innate difference in neurophysiology,
others that it is a result of associations learned at an early age.
And researchers disagree about how exactly the condition should be
defined, with some viewing it as a perceptual framework entirely
distinct from normal perception, while others envision a continuum
of synesthetic experience, with normal sensory perception at one
end. Dr. Lawrence Marks, a psychologist at Yale University, for
instance, has found that normal subjects show ``implicit''
associations that may be milder versions of the links found in
synesthesia: Most people, for instance, associate brighter colors
with higher pitched sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Also mysterious is why the extent and form of synesthetic
perceptions differ so widely from person to person. Seeing letters
of the alphabet in different colors is a common synesthetic
phenomenon. But, Baron-Cohen said: ``Even within families, people
argue about the colors of different letters. It seems to be highly
individual and idiosyncratic.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the majority of synesthetes, who are about six times
as likely to be female as male, find their unusual sensory
abilities enjoyable, in some cases synesthesia can be disruptive.
One woman, Baron-Cohen said, not only saw colors when she heard
sounds, but heard sounds whenever she saw colors. ``For her it was
very unpleasant, and her reaction was to try to control the
environment and keep everything very low key,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this uncertainty, a growing body of evidence supports
the notion that whatever synesthesia is, it represents more than
the clever use of metaphor by creative individuals. Hallucinogenic
drugs like mescaline and LSD, as well as some organic diseases, can
produce synesthesia, suggesting a physiological basis. And people
who report synesthetic experiences _ seeing particular colors
evoked by particular sounds, for example _ demonstrate a remarkable
consistency in their associations over time. In a 1989 study,
Baron-Cohen and his colleagues found that synesthetic subjects
showed a 92 percent consistency in their color-sound associations
after a full year, in contrast to only 37 percent consistency after
one week in control subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Synesthesia also appears to run in families, leading some
researchers to believe it has a genetic basis. Certainly, many
synesthetes report that a family member shared their ability. The
writer Vladimir Nabokov, for example, wrote that as a young child,
he informed his mother that the painted colors on his wooden
alphabet blocks were ``all wrong.'' She understood immediately,
Nabokov recalled, because she, too, saw each letter in a
distinctive hue.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Steen remembers a family visit 30 years ago,
when she was in college: Sitting at the dinner table, she mentioned
casually that the numeral ``5'' was yellow, but her father
corrected her. ``No, it's yellow-ocher,'' he said. Her mother and
brother, Ms. Steen said, sat in silent perplexity.

 UNDATED: silent perplexity.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing as arguments for the ``realness'' of
synesthetic phenomena, however, are the handful of brain studies
that show differences in brain functioning of subjects who have
synesthesia. In 1982, Dr. Richard Cytowic, a Washington neurologist
and the author of ``The Man Who Tasted Shapes'' (Putnam, 1993), led
the way by measuring brain metabolism in a single synesthetic
subject _ a man who at a dinner party announced that the meal would
be late because ``there are not enough points on the chicken.''
Cytowic found that during synesthetic experiences, the man showed
decreased blood flow in brain areas of the cortex responsible for
language and abstract thought _ findings the neurologist argued
were indications that synesthetes were not simply using their
imaginations or playing with language.
</P>
<P>
   A more sophisticated PET scanning study, published in 1996 in
the journal Brain by Dr. Eraldo Paulesu, Baron-Cohen and
colleagues, compared brain functioning in six synesthetes to that
in six members of a control group. The subjects, all women, were
blindfolded and listened to sound cues delivered through
headphones. Synesthetes, the researchers found, showed increased
activation in some areas of the visual cortex when responding to
sounds; control subjects did not.
</P>
<P>
   The areas showing increased activity are not the same as those
activated when someone is imagining images, said Baron-Cohen. He
said an MRI study, as yet unpublished, by researchers at the
Institute of Psychiatry in London had replicated these results.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the team of German researchers compared
recordings of electrophysiological activity in the brains of 17
synesthetes, who experienced color images upon reading letters or
numbers, with recordings from 17 control subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The results, said Dr. Thomas Muente, a neurology professor at
Hanover who took part in the study, suggest that in synesthetic
experiences, subjects show inhibitory activity in regions of the
frontal cortex that control attention and are also involved in
integrating input from several sensory modalities, though further
research is needed to discover what this means.
</P>
<P>
   Murkiness in science is not without its rewards, and one benefit
of the absence of conclusive data about synesthesia is that it has
left ample room for the construction of titillating theories.
Cytowic, for example, argues on the basis of his own research and
the subsequent brain study findings that synesthesia is a kind of
``cognitive fossil,'' left over from a time before the separation
of sensory pathways evolved. In this sense, synesthesia may be
``closer to the essence of what it is to perceive,'' Cytowic has
said, and may be tied to phylogenetically older, subcortical brain
structures involved in emotion and other primal functions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Grossenbacher, a senior staff fellow at the National
Institute of Mental Health, who with Christopher T. Lovelace and
Carol Crane has interviewed more than two dozen synesthetic
subjects as part of a current study, has a different theory. He
suggests that in synesthetic experiences, neural pathways that
normally act to suppress irrelevant sensory input and allow focused
perception in a single sensory mode, may be selectively
disinhibited, resulting in multimodal perception.
</P>
<P>
   For Patricia Duffy, a 46-year-old instructor in the United
Nations' language and communication training program, the cause of
her perceptions is less important than the richness they have
brought to her life. She sees the words she speaks fly by in a
rainbow of colors. She sees a year as an oblong circle, a week as a
sidewalk with seven colored squares of pavement. The month of
January is garnet red; December is dark brown. ``I don't really
know where it comes from,'' she said. ``I just know it's always
been that way.''

   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Dr. Charles Gerba's office is plastered with
photographs of parasites and bacteria; his file drawers are full of
antibacterial soaps and disinfectants. The counters of his lab are

Tucson, where he is a professor of microbiology at the University

   He speaks with reverence of Cloacina, the long-forgotten Roman
goddess of the sewer, and hands a visitor a biography of Thomas
Crapper, inventor of the flush toilet, saying, ``He doesn't get

</P>
<P>
   For Gerba, 53, all roads lead back to the toilet. A bearded,
fidgety man in yellow tinted glasses and blue jeans, he has spent
the last two decades ferreting out where bacteria lurk in our daily
lives. But for much of that time, his interest in the bathroom went
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba is best known in his field of environmental microbiology
for his work in uncovering how viruses infiltrate drinking water,
and has consulted for American cities and other countries on how to
improve water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba developed the first method to test water for the presence
of cryptosporidium, a parasite responsible for sporadic outbreaks
of diarrhea in the last decade. His papers, numbering more than
400, make his name impossible to ignore in his field, but his work
in household microbes has also been gaining him wider recognition
more recently. ``I'm the only scientist to publish toilet paper,''
Gerba said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Syed Sattar, director of the Center for Research on
Environmental Microbiology at the University of Ottawa, said:
``Twenty-five years ago, when Gerba started, it wasn't fashionable
to be in environmental microbiology. He did pioneering work in how
microbes got into our environment. At that time, it didn't matter
what human beings got, because we could always pump them with
antibiotics. We don't have that luxury anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerba's obsession began in the early 1970s when he was a
postgraduate student at Baylor University in Houston, studying
viruses in water. ``My adviser, Craig Wallace, dragged me into the
bathroom and told me to drop my drawers and sit down. Then he
flushed the toilet a few times. `Can you feel the aerosol?''' he
kept asking.
</P>
<P>
   That experiment led Gerba to create what he calls a
``commodograph,'' a method of fingerprinting a toilet flush to
determine patterns of droplet emission from the bowl. He has also
used a strobe light to shoot a time-lapse photograph of a flush,
which shows droplets of water, usually invisible, each containing
thousands of bacteria and viruses, being ejected from the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your toothbrush in the medicine cabinet,'' Gerba advised.
Though Gerba never published the photograph (he freely distributes
it to interested parties), research from that experiment was
published in 1975 in the journal Applied Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Gerba landed at the University of Arizona, near the
home of his youth, and continued his research into water quality.
But he remained fascinated by household microbiology. In the
mid-1970s he numbered squares of toilet paper in public restrooms,
and checked them hourly to gauge how many were used. Twenty years
later, with a grant from the Scott Paper Co., he did the same
experiment, this time with microprocessors in the dispensers, and
found that men used an average of two squares per visit and women
used seven.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered which sex had dirtier bathrooms (women, by far),
and where the bacterial hot zones were in bathrooms (outside
sanitary napkin disposals, the floor and the sink, in that order;
the doorknob is surprisingly clean).
</P>
<P>
   The average employee uses the bathroom 3.3 times per working
day, and women spend twice as much time in the bathroom as men.
</P>
<P>
   For Gerba, a man who exults in the unspeakable, the toilet was
only the beginning. In a study published last year in Applied
Microbiology, Gerba sampled spots all over the house and found that
in most homes, the bathroom is much cleaner than the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Because of contamination introduced by meat and vegetables,
sinks harbor the most dangerous bacteria, and people who appear
cleanest _ who wipe down counters regularly with their kitchen
sponge _ tend to have that bacteria all over their kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerba's latest project is the laundry, a task he believes
Americans regard with not nearly enough caution or diligence. He is
preparing his latest paper for presentation this spring at the
meeting of the American Society of Microbiology. His study examines
how fecal bacteria infiltrate washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on four-person families in Tucson, Gerba's team
randomly visited 60 homes and washed a sterile washcloth in their
machines. One-fifth of the machines contained E. coli, while a
quarter were contaminated with fecal matter.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry, Gerba contends, is becoming less clean. Fewer
Americans wash clothes in hot water, and only 5 percent use bleach,
he said. Wash cycles are only 20 minutes, while the average drying
time is only 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba found that some salmonella and hepatitis A survive through
laundry _ including the dry cycle _ and remain on clothes. ``We
have no idea how well we clean clothes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerba's own laundry machine yielded E. coli, prompting him to
change his own washing habits. ``I always washed my underwear last,
in a separate load, but I started using bleach, and now I run an
empty wash, with just bleach, when I'm done. It's mouthwash for the
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gerba says he has covered most of what he can in the
household, he has no fear that he will run out of material. He
predicts that infectious disease, or microbe-caused illness will
become more prevalent, explaining that antibiotic resistance, our
aging drinking water infrastructure, and emerging pathogens will
give microbes the leverage they need in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   And his work may not be confined to this planet. He is a
consultant to National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
advising it on dealing with human waste during extended space
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Current ideas include drying out solid wastes and diluting urine
into potable water, but he is not, he emphasizes, on the panel that
taste-tests the samples. ``Oh no, not me,'' he said. ``I have my
limits.''

AT 50, IT'S TIME TO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you are reading this, I am about to do to my guts what your
mechanic does when he boils out your radiator and back-flushes your
cooling system.
</P>
<P>
   They call it a pre-surgical catharsis. You and I would call it a
real pain in the whatchamacallit. But my innards must be squeaky
clean for tomorrow's surgery to remove a couple of polyps from my
colon.
</P>
<P>
   And with a sort of pre-surgical hindsight, I feel compelled to
share this with you not only to explain my subsequent temporary
absence from this space, but also to urge you to have your own
pipes checked.
</P>
<P>
   I am by no means a guru of gesundheit (literally,
``healthiness''). I'm at least 10 percent overweight. I suffered a
heart attack almost 15 years ago. I am something of a binge eater.
And my exercise is limited primarily to noontime walks and
strolling the aisles of hardware stores. My recommended daily eight
glasses of water are hidden in as many cups of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I can endorse and pass-along this general
recommendation from my several doctors: By the time you turn 50,
male or female, you should have some sort of periodic colo-rectal
exam. The polyps discovered in my colon last year have about a 25
percent chance of becoming cancerous, I was told. Samples cut from
the polyps were benign, they said, but little cuttings don't tell
the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to rush, I was advised, but neither could I
put it off like waiting for my muffler finally to fall off
somewhere along Mercer Street.
</P>
<P>
   Preventive maintenance isn't a guarantee. I eat a whole lot of
what the experts say is good stuff to ward off gastro-intestinal
cancers, including brussels sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower, oat
meal, bran cereals, fresh fruit, tomatoes, olive oil, Vitamin E,
and garlic ... boy, do I love garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I also love steak and chicken, especially
barbecued. And who doesn't like pizza or a large serving of french
fries? And candy. Charred meats and fish have been linked to cancer
in numerous studies. So has sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are no guarantees, even with clean, healthy living.
Some people are predisposed genetically to colon cancer. But the
rest of us also are at risk. More than 95,000 new cases of colon
cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. last year. That's diagnosed, as
opposed to Lord only knows how many undetected.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly don't have to wait like New York Yankees outfielder
Darryl Strawberry, who was sidelined last year after discovery of a
cancerous tumor almost blocking his colon. Or the too-late
discovery of a colon cancer that a year ago killed NBC-TV legal
commentator Jay Monahan, husband of ``Today'' show co-host Katie
Couric.
</P>
<P>
   Best options for most of us are three, according to Dr. Peter
Justus, the gastroenterologist who will perform a colonoscopy to
dye-mark my polyps before Dr. E. Stan Lennard, the surgeon, does
his thing.
</P>
<P>
   1. Periodic fecal-smear samples for occult blood, that nasty
little do-it-yourself thing where you try to stab elusive targets
with a little wooden stick and smear samples on a flimsy piece of
cardboard. This is supposed to help detect blood in your bowel. It
should be combined with a sigmoidoscope exam every five years, one
of those doctors-office exams where they tell you that ``this may
feel a little uncomfortable'' as they peer into the lower third of
your colon.
</P>
<P>
   2. Colonoscopy every 10 years. Done under anesthesia, a 3-foot
scope is threaded through all 4 or 5 feet of your colon. This is
how they found my polyps.
</P>
<P>
   3. Air or double-contrast barium enema with X-ray. Frankly, this
is the most uncomfortable procedure, although when used in
combination with sigmoidoscopy is considered almost as good as a
colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   At your end, so-to-speak, any of these tests is better than
sticking your head in the sand ... or anywhere else. The casual
discovery of my two polyps _ I displayed no symptoms or problems _
came not during an earlier routine sigmoidoscopy, but when a
routine colonoscopy went the whole nine yards, or 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That exam revealed two tubulovillous adenoma, or, polyps that
could progress to cancer. And unlike some, which are like little
mushrooms on stalks, mine are ``sessile'' (from the Latin word for
``sitting''), and more likely to become cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what got me sitting where I am right now. And I am so
full of good intentions that I may eventually address another of my
potential health problem. But then, I already know they won't let
me smoke cigars in the hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are your medicine chest is well stocked with first-aid
supplies to help you cope with the myriad injuries that sooner or
later befall every man, woman and child _ Band-Aids, bite and burn
ointments, cold packs, perhaps even a first-aid manual.
</P>
<P>
   But what have you got for your dog? In most households, this
beloved member of the family, even if regularly groomed, carefully
trained and fed a specially formulated diet, is sorely neglected
when it comes to first aid.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what to do, for example, if your dog should choke,
break a leg, injure an ear, cut a foot pad or swallow poison? Do
you have on hand the first-aid supplies needed to prevent further
damage and safely transport your dog to the vet? And what if a
disaster should strike _ a fire, earthquake, hurricane or flood _
that forces you to evacuate in a flash? Do you have a disaster plan
in place to rescue your pet?
</P>
<P>
   Knowing full well that for the vast majority of dog owners, the
answer to these questions is invariably no, veterinary specialists
at Purdue University have put together a manual called ``Rescuing
Rover: A First Aid and Disaster Guide for Dog Owners,'' written by
Dr. Sebastian E. Heath and illustrated by Andrea O'Shea (Purdue
University Press, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anticipating calamities is antithetical to the
American spirit of optimism. But let's face facts: Accidents do
happen, to dogs as well as to people. Dogs love to jump but can
land badly and break a leg. They can step on glass and cut a foot
pad, which may gush like a geyser.
</P>
<P>
   They can get hit by a car, tear their flesh on a jagged edge, be
bitten by another dog or a snake or kicked by a horse. Or, as my
dog Max did twice (do they ever learn?), they may bite a porcupine
and end up with a mouth full of quills.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, you'll need to know how to restrain your pet
so that first aid can be applied without your being bitten. An
animal that is frightened and in pain may snap at even the most
adored owner, especially when a painful injury is being treated.
You may also be called upon to restrain your dog while the vet
administers treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the area involved, there are two ways to restrain a
pet: with the animal lying down or sitting. With the dog lying on
its side, place your knees against the animal's back, one forearm
on its neck and the other on the dog's flank. With each hand, hold
the limbs that are against the floor and shift your weight over the
dog.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the dog will need to be muzzled so that no one
gets hurt. If you do not have a muzzle, you can fashion one with a
four-foot strip of two-inch gauze tape. Circle the dog's mouth and
tie a half-knot above the nose. Then bring the ends back under the
jaw and tie another half-knot, bring the ends under and behind the
ears and tie a firm bow at the back of the neck. After you've
muzzled your dog, you're ready to bandage a leg or paw or treat an
injured eye or ear.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, your dog breaks a leg or dislocates a joint
above the knee or elbow, applying a splint can keep matters from
getting worse on the way to the vet. Or if the dog's foot pad is
cut, apply pressure to stop the bleeding, flush and clean the wound
with saline solution (one heaping tablespoon salt in one gallon
water), then an antiseptic like triple antibiotic ointment, dry the
foot and cover the injured area with a nonstick dressing and gauze
squares. Then wrap the foot in cotton wool covered by a tight wrap
of stretch gauze (but not so tight that it impedes circulation).
</P>
<P>
   If your dog ingests or inhales a poisonous substance or absorbs
poison through the skin, prevent further exposure to the poison and
avoid poisoning yourself. Wear protective clothing and wash the
contaminated skin liberally with water and soap (not detergent).
See a vet without delay (if possible, bring the poison with you) or
consult (for a fee) the National Animal Poison Control Center at
(800) 548-2423.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you'd be wise to keep your pet out of urban park areas
that have been treated with rat poison. The bait is as attractive
to dogs as it is to rats, and just a few pieces can kill an animal
of 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are famous for trying to eat things that no sensible owner
would give them. Sometimes the object, a bone, for example, gets
stuck and impedes the dog's ability to swallow or breathe. The
animal is likely to gag and retch, shake its head, paw at its mouth
or cough persistently. First restrain the dog, then try to remove
the obstruction by sticking your hand down the dog's throat. If
this proves unsuccessful, see a veterinarian without delay.
</P>
<P>
   If the dog (or cat) is choking and unable to cough because the
object was inhaled instead of swallowed and has totally obstructed
the windpipe, the Heimlich maneuver can save the animal's life.
Time is of the essence; by the time you reach a veterinarian, the
animal will be dead. If the dog is medium-sized or large _ say, 30
pounds or more _ Dr. Ann Hohenhaus, who heads the department of
medicine at the Animal Medical Center in New York, suggested the
same approach you would use on a person who is choking. Stand
behind the animal and wrap your arms around it, with your hands
just below the rib cage. Make a fist with one hand and wrap the
other hand over it. Then thrust up and forward sharply.
</P>
<P>
   If your pet is very small, the Heimlich maneuver for infants
would be more appropriate. With the animal lying on its side,
thrust upward with one fist placed just below the rib cage.
Hohenhaus said that one woman used this approach to rescue her cat,
who had inhaled instead of swallowing a pill and then was unable to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Another life-threatening emergency involves bloat, the buildup
of gas in the dog's stomach that, if severe, can compress the
animal's heart. Veterinary help must be obtained as soon as
possible. Owners should take care to avoid the problem by feeding
the dog small meals at regular intervals and keeping it from
strenuous exercise for at least two hours after the animal eats. If
for some reason the dog has not eaten for more than a day,
reintroduce food gradually, giving small amounts at a time and
allowing time in between for the animal to digest each serving.
</P>
<P>
   When falling bricks and a collapsed crane forced hundreds of
people to evacuate their homes in Manhattan last year, many ran
out, leaving the pets behind. Days passed before all the starving
animals could be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to include your dog in any disaster preparations you
make for yourself and your family. Remember that your dog is
completely dependent on you for its survival in case of fire or a
weather-related crisis. Vaccinations should always be up to date
and the dog should always wear a collar with identification tags
indicating its name, your name and address and the vet's name and
address. You can also have an identification tattooed on the animal
or a microchip implanted under the dog's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the American Red Cross' Family Disaster Plan
brochure. A copy is available at www.redcross.org/disaster on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Establish a surrogate caretaker for your pet should you become
incapacitated or unavoidably separated from the animal. Make sure
the dog is familiar with the surrogate and the area you are likely
to escape to in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Your pet is most likely to survive an emergency if it is
obedience-trained, responsive to commands and accustomed to being
transported in a crate. When a disaster strikes, crate the dog
immediately, before it tries to hide. Be sure to have with you any
medications the dog must take, as well as a list of what they are.
Finally, practice evacuating your home until you are sure you can
get your family and your dog out safely in a few minutes.

THE MUMMY'S CURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Can you be cursed for going into an ancient tomb?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can certainly be cursed AT, by archeologists. The history
of ancient Egypt, for example, is full of holes left by grave
robbers, and remaining tombs are at risk from tourism and
encroaching civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians believed tomb inscriptions could confer either
blessings or curses on visitors, and early visitors probably
believed so, too, according to Dr. Peter Dorman, former director of
Egypt House, the Oriental Institute of Chicago archeological
installation in Luxor, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Tomb builders wanted to encourage passers-by to leave food for
the dead or just to recite a standard ritual wish for ``bread,
beer, cattle, and fowl, which, merely through the spoken word,
would magically generate those commodities for the soul of the
deceased,'' Dorman said.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2000 B.C., standard inscriptions included both
praise and blessings for those who recited the ritual and warnings
cursing those who might damage the tomb or its images, he
continued. The warnings invoked ``condemnation and even outright
slaughter at the hands of the gods of the underworld,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an idle threat,'' he said. ``There was a clear
understanding that the dead could intervene in the lives of people
on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic that so many tombs show intentional damage and
that so few burials in ancient Egypt have been found intact,'' he
said.

ON-LINE JOB SEARCHES GIVE NEWSPAPERS A RUN FOR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Mike Gnoss was looking for a job in
December, he turned to the Internet instead of the newspaper want
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude was that once it was in the paper, the job was
pretty old, and I didn't have time to look through the ads, to do
any of that leg work,'' Gnoss said. ``I just cut to the chase. I
told Career Central.com to send me what fits my criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnoss, 30, had just graduated with a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Southern California and knew
that he wanted to work in the San Francisco area, in the food
industry, in a finance-related position. He entered these criteria
in his posting at Palo Alto-based Career Central's Web site
(www.careercentral.com), and within a few weeks he accepted a job
in the corporate finance department of Chevys Fresh Mex. He now
forecasts the restaurant chain's future.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two years, the future of job and candidate
searching has changed with the extraordinary rise of Internet-based
services and employers' using their own Web pages to recruit
directly.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers and companies have been the first to adapt to
the new technology, eschewing print classifieds, threatening a
reliable newspaper revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   The American newspaper industry, with annual classified
advertising revenues of $19 billion in 1998, has watched the change
with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be newspapers,'' said Renee LaBran, vice
president for classified advertising, new media and print at the
Los Angeles Times. ``Are we immune from being affected by the
Internet? Not a chance. We will see some of our business migrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that help-wanted classified advertising sales have
dipped in the past four months at newspapers in technology-heavy
regions of the country for a variety of reasons. Ad sales are
cyclical in nature and are affected by economic forces, but one of
them is the rising tide of Internet-based services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past two years, we've probably dropped our print ad
budget by 60 to 70 percent,'' said Diane Schlageter, director of
employment at Adobe Systems Inc. in San Jose, the nation's largest
maker of desktop publishing and graphics software. ``A half-page ad
in the San Jose Mercury News may be $15,000 to $18,000. You can do
a lot of stuff on-line for that amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet as a human resources tool provides a more focused
applicant pool at less cost. This ``has been the most fundamental
shift I have seen in this business in 20 years,'' Schlageter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting group Forrester Research
Inc. issued a recent report, ``Goodbye to Classifieds,'' showing
that business will spend more and more money on Internet job
advertising. Of the 6 million businesses in the United States,
Forrester estimated that only 15,000 are recruiting on-line today,
but pervasive Internet access will drive the figure to 124,000 by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conducting paid searches for prospective
employees through the growing number of Internet job service
providers, companies are posting positions on their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael,
creators of marvelous visual effects, where Rick Ross, recruiting
manager for parent Lucas Digital, seeks gifted computer scientists
and artists from among the 100 resumes he receives daily. Some 75
percent of them arrive via the Internet (www.ilm-jobs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the Web has greatly expedited the recruiting process,
especially in assessing the technical skills of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing the impossible here, and it's important to have
people who can communicate both with a keyboard and verbally
because it's a team environment,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross added, however, that technology isn't very helpful in
measuring communications skills and judgment, so there is still
some conventional human resource filtering to do.
</P>
<P>
   On-line help-wanted services say technology allows them to match
candidates' strengths and interests to job openings quickly and
accurately _ faster and generally less expensively than advertising
in a newspaper. The services don't charge people who post resumes
or surf for openings. They earn their revenues by charging
employers who use the site to find workers.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is fierce in this fast-growing sector. Profitability
has so far eluded most sites as they pump revenues into keeping up
with the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders in terms of numbers of job seekers and employer
clients are Monster.com (www.monster.com), Career Mosaic
(www.careermosaic.com) and Career Path (www.careerpath.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hotjobs (www.hotjobs.com) and Monster.com spent millions of
dollars on Super Bowl advertising. For New York-based Hotjobs, that
was a reach: Its 1998 revenues were $4 million, yet it spent $2
million on advertising. It was necessary, said company president
Richard Johnson, because the Internet world is evolving rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, newspapers responded to the changing classified
industry by forming CareerPath.com (www.careerpath.com), which is
owned by the nation's eight largest newspaper companies _ The New
York Times Co., Times-Mirror, Tribune Co., Knight-Ridder Corp.,
Washington Post Co., Cox Newspapers, Gannett and the Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   On average, there are 300,000 job listings on the Los
Angeles-based site, by far the largest of any such service,
according to Stephen Ste. Marie, CareerPath's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In January CareerPath had some 8 million job searches, a 71
percent increase over searches completed a month earlier. It
offers, among other listings, jobs from 83 affiliate newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Its pitch to advertisers is that they can pay once to have their
message appear both in affiliate newspapers and on-line at
CareerPath.com. ``No one else can do that,'' Ste. Marie said.

   While heeding change, some newspaper executives are skeptical
about whether the Internet is truly revolutionizing recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every article about this reads, `Golly, gee whiz ... It's
incredible that somebody found a job on the Internet,' and they
forget that thousands of people are finding their jobs in
newspapers every day,'' said Charlie Diederich, director of
recruitment advertising at the Newspaper Association of America in
the Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Diederich considers Internet recruiting ``a wake-up call for the
newspaper industry,'' but he smells hype. ``I could be the guy who
is saying buggy whips will always be or men will always wear hats,
but radio did not replace papers and TV did not displace radio, nor
has cable displaced TV. All of these things have created new
opportunities for papers.''

   Over the past decade, treadmills have exploded in popularity,
and technology has sped along at a clip. And if several new models
unveiled at last week's sporting goods extravaganza _ the Super
Show in Atlanta _ are any indication, treadmills may soon do
everything but the running.
</P>
<P>
   The ProForm CD Coach, for example, has a CD player built into
its console. The treadmill comes with an interactive CD that
contains two 30-minute workout programs designed by certified
personal trainers. Digital impulses from the CD soundtrack
automatically adjust the speed and incline of the treadmill to
coincide with the workout. The machine is available only at Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. and sells for about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another new model, the True 500, allows the user to change the
feel of the running surface. A manual dial on the side of the
treadmill includes 12 manually adjusted settings, ranging from
bouncy to firm.
</P>
<P>
   What purpose does this serve?
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkers tend to like a springier surface that's close to the
feel of wet sand while runners usually prefer a surface that's more
rigid, like hard packed dirt or asphalt,'' said Richard Cotton, the
chief exercise physiologist at the American Council on Exercise.
Prices start at $3,700.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Fitness 4500HR treadmill comes with a heart rate zone
training program designed to work much like the cruise-control
setting on a car: The treadmill automatically adjusts the speed and
hill incline to keep the user's heart beating at a steady rate.
Users must wear a heart rate monitor strapped to the chest or
abdomen to activate this feature. This model costs $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cotton says all this technology can be fun and
motivating, he cautions treadmill buyers to hold their enthusiasm
in check and look for a high-quality machine that is well
constructed and built to hold up through years of regular use.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends shopping at a reputable dealers who specialize in
exercise equipment, and he urges consumers to pay close attention
to warranty and repair service offered.

<P>
   Siblings are fighting as much as ever, but many parents are
letting them go at it, according to a new study that appears in the
current issue of the American Psychological Association's journal,
Developmental Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 88 two-parent, two-sibling households, with
children ages 3 to 9, the researchers asked the parents to describe
strategies they used to resolve sibling conflicts and which
strategies they felt confident using.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents believe that a certain strategy is most effective,
they are less likely to use it unless they also feel comfortable
enacting it,'' said Dr. Laurie Kramer, an associate professor in
the Department of Human and Community Development at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and co-author of the study with
the late Dr. Lisa Perozynski.
</P>
<P>
   Although most parents did not choose nonintervention as the best
strategy, observation showed that they used it three times as often
as strategies like helping their children communicate with each
other or asserting parental authority.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' sex also made a difference. When dealing with
shouting matches, when parents were confident in their abilities to
perform specific disciplinary techniques, mothers believed that
child-centered interventions, like helping their children talk with
each other, were more effective than other strategies and felt more
comfortable using them than fathers did.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers, on the other hand, said they were more comfortable with
parental control tactics and believed such tactics to be most
effective.
</P>
<P>
   When siblings pushed and kicked, mothers and fathers were both
more likely to endorse parental authority methods as the
appropriate intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still controversy in the advice given to parents as
to how to respond to their children's fighting,'' Dr. Kramer said.
``Parents' concerns about how to handle the conflict that occurs
between their children may be best addressed by helping parents to
identify the goals they have for their children's relationship and
helping them to formulate a plan for achieving their goals.''

<P>
   A review of medical studies linking religious faith to an
improved prognosis for patients found little empirical support for
claims, according to an article in the current issue of the medical
journal Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the best studies, the evidence of an association
between religion, spirituality and health is weak and
inconsistent,'' concluded Dr. Richard Sloan, director of behavioral
medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. ``We
believe therefore that it is premature to promote faith and
religion as adjunctive medical treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan and his colleagues spent more than a year looking at
methodology used in hundreds of published studies that examined
religion and the physical outcomes of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The review excluded studies involving mental health outcomes and
health behaviors like smoking or drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The one consistency they found was the inconsistency of
methodology and findings even among well-conducted studies. ``The
findings were all over the place,'' Sloan said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Applying standards of medical scientific reliability and
statistical soundness, researchers faulted murky definitions of
religious activity, failure to control for variations like sex and
education and inappropriate statistical methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, lack of consistency is characteristic of an
evolving field and may be the product of differences in study
design, definitions of religious and spiritual variables and
outcome variables,'' the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these inconsistencies as well as ethical questions,
Sloan, a psychologist, concluded that health professionals should
not ``intrude'' in the area of religious beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, there is a danger that failure of
religious activity to produce a cure could lead to guilt feelings
in a patient.

WILD STOCK PRICES PROVE CHALLENGING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's volatile investment markets have a way of turning what
looks like a triumphant moment into a financial Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of Golden Books Family Entertainment, a
children's book publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare occurrence last week, the stock of the New York
company had the dubious distinctions of being the biggest
percentage gainer and the biggest percentage loser _ all in one
day, and all within a period of about two hours _ because of
Internet stock fever.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who didn't catch the stock at the right price would
have found themselves paying more for the stock than they wanted or
selling it for less than they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and selling at exactly the price you want can prove
impossible when stock prices are gyrating wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a fast market, orders are submitted to market makers
and specialists at such a rapid pace, there's likely to be a
backlog that can create significant delays, sometimes exceeding 30
minutes,'' Charles Schwab, chairman of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., told
customers in a recent report on trading in fast markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE RISK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While you can't control the pace of markets, you can take some
steps to help reduce your risk.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to buy stable, large capitalization stocks whose
prices don't dance around.
</P>
<P>
   But if you love the thrill of buying and selling in a
fast-moving market, place a ``limit order'' instead of a ``market
order.''
</P>
<P>
   A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the best
available price. Market orders are executed on a first-come,
first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   In rapidly moving markets, in the short time between when your
market order is placed and when it's executed, orders in line ahead
of yours can significantly shift a stock's price.
</P>
<P>
   By placing a limit order, you set the highest possible price
you're willing to pay for a stock or the lowest price at which
you're willing to sell a stock.
</P>
<P>
   If a stock is rising, your limit order may not be filled because
sellers hold out for the highest possible price, said James Angel,
associate professor of finance at Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a serious investor, investing for the long term,
the best way is to put in a limit order,'' said Frank Lallos,
senior analyst at Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., consultants to
online brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding whether to place a market order or limit order
for a stock buy, determine how soon a stock's price will rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, if you think that the stock is about to make a
major move, then you are better off getting the immediate execution
of a market order, rather than running the risk that your order may
not be filled and the stock may run away from you,'' Angel said.
</P>
<P>
   Set a limit order that allows for little less than perfect
execution so you don't waste your time placing orders that don't
get filled all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pay to get really greedy with limit orders,'' Angel
said. ``If you really want to buy this stock, put in a limit order
pretty close to the current bid price because if you bid too low,
the chances of your getting your order filled fall dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The bid price is the price at which you're prepared to buy a
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The asked price is the price at which the owner of a stock
offers to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have to execute the trade immediately, consider
placing a limit order at the bid price or even lower for a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're doing is saying, `I can be patient because at some
time during the day, its natural volatility will take it through
the (price) level,''' Angel said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ONLINE TRADING DELIVERS QUICKLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're trading online, market orders aren't as risky because
execution is quicker, Angel said. Still, lightning-speed markets
can throw that off.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find out which online brokers best execute trade
orders, go to Gomez Advisors' Web site at www.gomez.com and click
on ``Internet Broker Scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, click on ``Select A Category'' and ``Customer
Confidence'' and you'll see how Gomez ranks online brokerages in
such areas as phone response time and the quality of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better the Customer Confidence ranking, the more likely
they are to have a high level of execution,'' Lallos said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is justice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the stock of Golden Books was taken off the Nasdaq
Stock Market because the financially troubled publisher's stock
price had fallen so low. It's also negotiating a bankruptcy
reorganization plan with its creditors.

HARD-BITTEN AND CYNICAL? ONLY SOME OF US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspaper executives, alarmed at surveys showing a dropping
level of credibility for their papers, commissioned an extensive
examination of this issue in 1998 under the auspices of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   We've been working our way through that study in this column,
and today we'll consider what it called Major Finding No. 2: ``The
public perceives that newspapers don't consistently demonstrate
respect for, and knowledge of, their readers and their
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban &AMP; Associates Inc. did the study for the ASNE, using a
national stratified random telephone survey of 3,000 interviews, 16
focus groups and a random, stratified sample of 1,714 journalists
at American newspapers with daily circulation of 5,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   For years, journalists themselves and television and movie
producers have worked hard to establish a sort of persona of the
typical reporter or editor. Some of these were kind. More often,
they were portrayed as hard-bitten, cynical, hard-drinking and
aggressive people.
</P>
<P>
   My mother wanted me to be a preacher. When I told her I was
going to be a journalist, she was mortified _ picturing, I'm sure,
a guy in a trench coat with a pint of whiskey stuck in his hip
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   It's an image that has been around for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A popular book among wire service journalists is ``Kansas City
Milkman,'' an out-of-print spoof of the old United Press. In it,
the central character at one point tells friends that if they ever
see his mother, they're not to tell her he's a journalist. They are
to tell her that he plays piano in a house of ill repute.
</P>
<P>
   We've been wildly successful in establishing that persona,
according to the results of the study. People think that
journalists are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Motivated _ 78 percent think journalists pay more attention to
what their editors want than what readers want.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart _ 75 percent think journalists are better informed than
average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cynical _ 67 percent think journalists are more cynical than
other professionals, ``although most agree that they share the same
kinds of ethical and personal values as most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard-bitten _ only 28 percent believe that journalists would
tone down a story that could hurt the lives of the people they are
writing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these are professional virtues or vices, then, this
persona is a prevailing operational profile in how the public views
journalists, and 53 percent believe the press is out of touch with
mainstream Americans,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Fort Worth Star-Telegram puts millions of dollars
back into the communities it covers through direct sponsorships,
promotional assistance and advertising, special sections and other
forms of community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   We publish highly customized editions for the three major
divisions of our county so that we can emphasize local and
community news, and we do it in the most expensive way possible:
delegating decision-making to almost completely autonomous editors
in separate newsrooms located in the geographic areas we are
covering.
</P>
<P>
   We print ``Hometown Stars'' in some communities to cover even
more highly local news that cannot be fitted into the main
newspaper, and we have Sports Zone sections that take coverage of
high school athletics to levels that none of us have seen before.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen reporters writing stories with tears in their eyes.
I've met with staff members so disturbed by the scenes they had
witnessed at tragedies that they wondered whether they could remain
in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the perception. In one focus group, a woman told
the researchers: ``You wouldn't be a good reporter if you were a
nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other disconnects _ educational and economic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the U.S. population lives in households with total
incomes of below $47,000 per year (54 percent of them achieving
that income level with two or more full-time workers). Only 34
percent of U.S. adults are college graduates _ 39 percent never
went beyond high school,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study suggested that when ``the public
perceives a bias toward wealthy people, then it's not inconceivable
to believe that many suspect that individual journalists make a
salary more substantial than their own.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting about that statement to me is that I've
always thought there might be a bias ``against'' wealthy people,
not in favor of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When newspaper readers see feature articles about ways to make
an elegant presentation of artichoke hearts, many study the
photograph to find out what, exactly, an artichoke looks like,''
the study said. ``When adjectives like church-going or right-wing
or suburban or radical appear in print or broadcast news stories,
they sense that judgments are being made by folks not very much
like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But we are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. Some of
us are very religious, and some are not. Some keep their desks tidy
(well, actually very few), and some do not.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of us coach youth teams or work in PTAs or serve in Boy
Scout or Girl Scout troops and volunteer at other not-for-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And some of us are cynical and hard-bitten.
</P>
<P>
   What we are not very good about is telling our own story _ who
we are and what we do. Some of that is self-defense, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming that the ASNE study is accurate, we're going to
need to get a lot less defensive and much better at letting you see
who we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's specious to dismiss these criticisms by assuming that the
public is being sloppy in their judgment by lumping the media
together with ... other large or powerful institutions, or to
assume that the public tars newspapers with the same brush they use
on supermarket tabloids,'' the study said. ``They know the
difference.''

COURT EXAMINES TEXAS JURY'S DECISION TO IMPOSE DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could affect death row inmates
around the country, the Supreme Court on Monday weighed whether
jurors in a Texas murder case were so confused by the judge's
instructions that they mistakenly opted to sentence a man to death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a U.S. District Court jury in Lubbock, Texas, found
Louis Jones Jr. guilty of kidnapping Air Force Pvt. Tracie Joy
McBride, 19, from a laundry room on the Goodfellow Air Force Base
in San Angelo, beating her over the head with a tire iron and
leaving her dead body under a bridge on the night of Feb. 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the jurors found him guilty, Judge Sam R. Cummings read
them the 1994 federal death penalty sentencing law. He said that if
they did not come to a unanimous decision for capital punishment or
life in prison without the possibility of parole, ``the court shall
impose any lesser sentence that is authorized by law.''
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for nearly two weeks, the jury sentenced
Jones to death.
</P>
<P>
   Jones appealed, arguing that some jurors were confused by the
judge's instructions and by four verdict forms that he gave them.
It was possible that some jurors who favored life in prison without
parole feared that if the jury failed to reach a unanimous
decision, he would receive a lesser sentence, such as life in
prison with the possibility of parole. So these jurors opted for
the death penalty to make sure Jones received a tough sentence, the
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones contended that the jury should have been told that in his
case, there was no lesser penalty than life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Jones'
argument, saying that the judge's failure to give clarifying
instructions had no legal effect on the jury's recommendation for
death.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals court gave little weight to
affidavits from two jurors saying they would have spared Jones'
life had the judge said life in prison without parole was the only
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision in the case, which is expected by
July, could open the door to appeal for many of the 20 inmates now
on death rows who were sentenced under the Federal Death Penalty
Act of 1994. It could also affect dozens of defendants awaiting
trial under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing before the high court, Jones' lawyer, Timothy Crooks of
Fort Worth, Texas, urged the justices to give his client a new
sentencing trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these instructions, jurors who don't want the death
penalty will believe that if they don't cave in, the defendant
might get off with a lighter sentence that he didn't deserve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia told Crooks, ``I don't understand why
you think it would be the people favoring life in prison without
parole who cave in. It seems to me that the people favoring the
death penalty have more to lose, so to speak, because if they don't
give in, not only is this guy going to avoid the death penalty,
he's going to have the chance to get out of prison someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department attorney Michael Dreeben, arguing against
Jones, said the jury was not instructed to consider what might
happen if it could not reach a unanimous decision. Therefore, he
contended, each juror should have considered only the two options
of death or life in prison without parole and should not have given
any thought to the consequences of a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether Dreeben
was being realistic. ``It would difficult for these jurors not to
completely disregard what happens if they can't come to
agreement.''

RECOVERING AFTER SURGERY, WITH ALL THE AMENITIES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANDREE BROOKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently scheduled a long-overdue operation that could have
been readily carried out in a doctor's office or in a hospital on
an outpatient basis. It was nothing serious, but even so, my
elderly mother begged me not to rush home because I lived alone.
Instead, she urged me to remain in the hospital overnight, in case
I needed attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's not possible, I argued, explaining with a hint of cynicism
that procedures have become so sophisticated and coverage so
restrictive that, in all but the most serious cases, patients are
supposed to climb right off the operating table and march out the
door. Try anyway, she admonished, ``just so I won't sit here
worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   It prompted me to ask the surgeon about options. In turn, he
introduced me to the expanding world of medical hotels and
postoperative recovery centers _ facilities used by patients who
would otherwise have to travel a long distance, who do not have a
caregiver at home or who are well-to-do and prefer the comfort and
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Louis F. Reuter 4th, the executive vice president at New York
Presbyterian Hospital, which is considering a hotel at its
Washington Heights complex, said these kinds of centers were
proliferating to meet the changing patterns of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Although outpatient surgery has become more common, some
patients still ``prefer to recover in the hospital milieu,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the specialization of hospitals means that patients may
come from far away, sometimes accompanied by family members who
also need somewhere to stay. Centers like the Inn at Mayo Clinic in
Jacksonville, Fla., operated by Marriott International, offer
mini-apartments for $89 to $109 a night for longer-term stays.
These are useful to patients having extensive tests or are too weak
to travel after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. And, such
centers cater to family members, normally charging only a nominal
fee, about $25 a night, for added guests and assuring that extra
beds are available.
</P>
<P>
   Some private physicians, particularly in those in cosmetic
surgery, have picked up on the trend. Two years ago, for example,
Dr. William Beeson, president of the American Academy of Cosmetic
Surgery, built four luxury recovery suites at his surgical offices
in Carmel, Ind. He offers his patients _ most of whom are business
executives recovering from face lifts, nose jobs and hair
transplants _ all-night physician and nursing care. ``We can better
control pain and there's less worry,'' he said. Beeson, who
includes one night's stay in the cost of surgery, estimated that an
overnight stay in such a center would cost $300 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is the social benefit: ``You don't want your
doorman finding out you just had a face lift,'' said Dr. James R.
Lyons, a plastic surgeon in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance generally does not cover the entire cost of staying in
a recovery center, though many patients qualify for partial
reimbursement, depending on their carrier and the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers provide nursing; others do not. Among those that do
not include medical care, the range of luxury is almost as broad as
the hotel industry itself. Multipurpose recovery centers like the
62-room Tower Inn, run by Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, can
cost as little as $50 night. Most are within a block or so of the
hospital or surgical unit and patients can bring their own nurses
or caregivers, if needed. The hourly cost for those nurses may also
be covered by insurance, especially if nursing care would have been
provided at home, hospital administrators said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonmedical centers offer amenities like wide hallways and doors
for easy wheelchair access, shower stools in each bathroom, medical
waste disposals in each room and large easy chairs for daytime
lounging.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, New York University-Cornell Medical Center's
midtown hospital complex offers the the 96-suite Helmsley Medical
Tower and Residence, connected by underground walkway. The cost
ranges from $160 to $210 a night. Mount Sinai-New York University
Medical Center opened its 17-room Mount Sinai Guest Residence two
years ago by redesigning two floors of its staff residential
building. Nightly charges are $145 to $195. Both are expanding
because of heavy demand. Neither includes nursing.
</P>
<P>
   But the one I chose did. I stayed at the Temple Recovery Care
Center, a specially designed floor of the New Haven Hotel in
downtown New Haven and near St. Raphael's hospital, where I was
having surgery. The center, with 20 beds, has Colonial-style
private rooms with equipment like electric beds and services like
bedside meal delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel driver picked me up in a van after surgery. I did not
even have to get dressed. He returned me to the surgeon's office
the next morning for the removal of bandages, after which I really
was ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   The room was so cozy and the care so special that I was tempted
to stay longer, were it not for the $483 per night out-of-pocket
expense. A nurse was at my bedside within in a minute of two of my
call, eager to fix bandages, order a meal, check my vital signs or
refill my jug of ice water and even get me to the doctor's office
on time.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed the pampering and felt secure knowing a doctor or
nurse was at hand.

HARD-BITTEN AND CYNICAL? ONLY SOME OF US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspaper executives, alarmed at surveys showing a dropping
level of credibility for their papers, commissioned an extensive
examination of this issue in 1998 under the auspices of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   We've been working our way through that study in this column,
and today we'll consider what it called Major Finding No. 2: ``The
public perceives that newspapers don't consistently demonstrate
respect for, and knowledge of, their readers and their
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban &AMP; Associates Inc. did the study for the ASNE, using a
national stratified random telephone survey of 3,000 interviews, 16
focus groups and a random, stratified sample of 1,714 journalists
at American newspapers with daily circulation of 5,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   For years, journalists themselves and television and movie
producers have worked hard to establish a sort of persona of the
typical reporter or editor. Some of these were kind. More often,
they were portrayed as hard-bitten, cynical, hard-drinking and
aggressive people.
</P>
<P>
   My mother wanted me to be a preacher. When I told her I was
going to be a journalist, she was mortified _ picturing, I'm sure,
a guy in a trench coat with a pint of whiskey stuck in his hip
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   It's an image that has been around for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A popular book among wire service journalists is ``Kansas City
Milkman,'' an out-of-print spoof of the old United Press. In it,
the central character at one point tells friends that if they ever
see his mother, they're not to tell her he's a journalist. They are
to tell her that he plays piano in a house of ill repute.
</P>
<P>
   We've been wildly successful in establishing that persona,
according to the results of the study. People think that
journalists are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Motivated _ 78 percent think journalists pay more attention to
what their editors want than what readers want.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smart _ 75 percent think journalists are better informed than
average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cynical _ 67 percent think journalists are more cynical than
other professionals, ``although most agree that they share the same
kinds of ethical and personal values as most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard-bitten _ only 28 percent believe that journalists would
tone down a story that could hurt the lives of the people they are
writing about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether these are professional virtues or vices, then, this
persona is a prevailing operational profile in how the public views
journalists, and 53 percent believe the press is out of touch with
mainstream Americans,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Fort Worth Star-Telegram puts millions of dollars
back into the communities it covers through direct sponsorships,
promotional assistance and advertising, special sections and other
forms of community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   We publish highly customized editions for the three major
divisions of our county so that we can emphasize local and
community news, and we do it in the most expensive way possible:
delegating decision-making to almost completely autonomous editors
in separate newsrooms located in the geographic areas we are
covering.
</P>
<P>
   We print ``Hometown Stars'' in some communities to cover even
more highly local news that cannot be fitted into the main
newspaper, and we have Sports Zone sections that take coverage of
high school athletics to levels that none of us have seen before.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen reporters writing stories with tears in their eyes.
I've met with staff members so disturbed by the scenes they had
witnessed at tragedies that they wondered whether they could remain
in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the perception. In one focus group, a woman told
the researchers: ``You wouldn't be a good reporter if you were a
nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other disconnects _ educational and economic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the U.S. population lives in households with total
incomes of below $47,000 per year (54 percent of them achieving
that income level with two or more full-time workers). Only 34
percent of U.S. adults are college graduates _ 39 percent never
went beyond high school,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study suggested that when ``the public
perceives a bias toward wealthy people, then it's not inconceivable
to believe that many suspect that individual journalists make a
salary more substantial than their own.''
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting about that statement to me is that I've
always thought there might be a bias ``against'' wealthy people,
not in favor of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When newspaper readers see feature articles about ways to make
an elegant presentation of artichoke hearts, many study the
photograph to find out what, exactly, an artichoke looks like,''
the study said. ``When adjectives like church-going or right-wing
or suburban or radical appear in print or broadcast news stories,
they sense that judgments are being made by folks not very much
like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But we are mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. Some of
us are very religious, and some are not. Some keep their desks tidy
(well, actually very few), and some do not.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of us coach youth teams or work in PTAs or serve in Boy
Scout or Girl Scout troops and volunteer at other not-for-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And some of us are cynical and hard-bitten.
</P>
<P>
   What we are not very good about is telling our own story _ who
we are and what we do. Some of that is self-defense, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming that the ASNE study is accurate, we're going to
need to get a lot less defensive and much better at letting you see
who we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's specious to dismiss these criticisms by assuming that the
public is being sloppy in their judgment by lumping the media
together with ... other large or powerful institutions, or to
assume that the public tars newspapers with the same brush they use
on supermarket tabloids,'' the study said. ``They know the
difference.''

ANCIENT HORSES' SECRETS  
 TALKING NEANDERTHALS?  
 THINKING SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The true age of a horse, common wisdom holds, can be told by
looking in its mouth. The teeth hold few mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The fossilized teeth of ancient horses, it turns out, hold few
mysteries either. A team of researchers from the Florida Museum of
Natural History and other institutions, taking a close look at the
dental remains of six species dating from five million years ago,
has cast doubt upon a widely accepted model of horse evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Under that model, until about 20 million years ago horses had
short-crowned teeth and were primarily browsers, eating leafy and
soft-tissue plants. Then, as patterns of climate and vegetation
changed, horses underwent a rapid and widespread adaptation,
developing long teeth more suited to grazing on grasses and other
abrasive plants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in a recent issue of Science,
examined the isotopic composition of tooth enamel in the six
fossilized species, all of which were found in central Florida.
Depending on whether the horse had a browsing or grazing diet, the
enamel contains different proportions of particular carbon
isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   The six species all have high-crowned teeth and should, under
the evolutionary model, be grazers. But the isotopic analysis,
coupled with examination of microscopic pits and scratches on the
tooth surfaces, showed that not all of the six species were
grazers: Some were browsers, and some had a mixed diet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It was big news last year: Researchers at Duke University had
concluded that Neanderthals and other human ancestors might have
been able to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three graduate students at the University of California at
Berkeley are disputing that idea. In a paper in The Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, they asserted that the anatomical
feature the Duke anthropologists said was a predictor of vocal
ability _ a hole in the base of the skull through which nerves run
from the brain to the tongue _ is no predictor at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke researchers had argued that a larger hole, or
hypoglossal canal, meant larger nerves and more complex tongue
function. And they noted that the canal in Neanderthals and other
Homo ancestors was close in size to those of modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Berkeley researchers pointed out that many speechless
monkeys and apes have human-sized canals. They also examined human
cadavers and found no correlation between size of a canal and the
number of nerve fibers running through it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The life of an astronomer searching for extraterrestrial
intelligence can be a tough one, a constant struggle to be taken
seriously in a scientific community that often treats SETI projects
as the stuff of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of dedicated observing
time on the world's large radio telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that problem, researchers at the University of
California at Berkeley and the SETI Institute have announced plans
to design and build a huge radio telescope. The researchers want to
do their project on the cheap, building not one huge dish, like the
bowl at Arecibo in Puerto Rico, or even an array of large dishes,
like the Very Large Array in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   What the SETI team has in mind might be called a Very Tiny
Array, a network of small, 12- to 18-foot dishes. By electronically
coupling 500 to 1,000 of these receivers, the researchers say they
can create an instrument with a collecting area that rivals some of
the largest radio telescopes, at a fraction of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The array would enable researchers to scan many more star
systems for radio emissions that could be a sign of an alien
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The SETI team plans to first build a prototype of perhaps a
dozen small dishes near Mount Lassen in Northern California. A full
system could cost about $25 million. The money will be raised from
private sources, under the auspices of the SETI Institute.

REPORT FINDS LONDON'S POLICE FORCE `RIVEN WITH RACISM'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's
police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized
racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that
conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white
communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations
for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to
usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the
author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government
inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure
of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service
to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin''
reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which
amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance,
thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of
the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that
``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it
extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the
community in the way that policing by consent demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations were measures making individual
officers liable for legal judgments of up to $800,000 for racist
behavior, giving the Commission for Racial Equality statutory power
to investigate the police, making racist language even in private
conversations criminally punishable, changing the national schools
curriculum to emphasize cultural diversity and improve race
awareness and empowering the Court of Appeal to allow acquitted
defendants to be tried anew if compelling new evidence comes to
light.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection
against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to
the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old
Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history
of race baiting. Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a
widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the
subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks
and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances
to the way Lawrence was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police
ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month
period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play
based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is
playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is
moving to the West End in May.
</P>
<P>
   At many points in the lengthy proceedings, police witnesses
including Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner,
turned aside all references to the existence of institutional
racism on the force, the very characterization they are now being
told they must embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The official originally in charge of the Lawrence investigation,
deputy assistant police commissioner David Osland, said at the
time, ``The suggestion that any police officer would investigate a
murder less competently because the victim was black is an absolute
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the hearings, Lawrence's parents, Neville and
Doreen Lawrence, and others pursuing the case protested the choice
of Macpherson as chairman, saying he was insensitive to their needs
and perspectives. But on Monday there was praise and expression of
some astonishment at his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers,
said that Sir William had ``managed to grasp the nettle'' of
Britain's race relations. ``Our expectations were low, but if they
had been higher, this is the sort of thing we should have
expected,'' he said.

   Lee Jasper, director the black policy group The 1990 Trust,
said: ``We are very pleased. The report is full-blooded in its
criticism, and it does reflect, as far as we can see, the broad
concerns of the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ros Howells, a friend of the Lawrences, suggested that Sir
William had had his views changed dramatically by the evasive
testimony of police officers, which in their current staged
retelling, draw gasps of disbelief from theatergoers. ``He was
shocked during the inquiry by the incompetence of the police,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which has received praise from backers of the
Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism
on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication
of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw obtained a judicial order on Saturday
night forcing The Sunday Telegraph to drop an exclusive account of
the report in its early editions, then had to back down when other
papers protested the move.

FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR WILL NOT SEEK PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ending months of speculation about his political
future, former Gov. Pete Wilson of California announced Monday that
he would not seek the Republican presidential nomination next year
because he had concluded that he could not raise the $15 million to
$20 million it would take to wage a credible campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reluctantly, I'm compelled to conclude that it is just not
practical to pursue a candidacy,'' Wilson wrote in a four-page
letter to supporters released Monday, adding: ``I won't pretend
that I don't feel genuine disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 65, was forced from office by term limits last month,
and he had said he would spend several weeks telephoning potential
fund raisers and supporters around the nation to assess his
presidential prospects. But one former aide said Monday that, in
the end, Wilson had made hardly any calls and had concluded on his
own that he simply could not raise enough money to compete with the
likes of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and the magazine publisher
Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson faced formidable obstacles, including lingering bad blood
among some California Republicans who thought he had hurt the party
with his outspoken stands against illegal immigration and
affirmative action. Last month, a majority of the California
Legislature's Republican caucus wrote a letter to Bush, asking him
to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited too long,'' Wilson told George Skelton, a
political columnist for The Los Angeles Times, who first published
news of Wilson's decision in Monday's editions. Wilson said he had
spent the last two years consolidating his efforts as governor in
the face of the state's economic rebound, ``because it's what I
wanted to do,'' and added: ``If you're going to govern California
it's a full-time job. But now it's too late to raise that kind of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson flirted with the presidency four years ago, but his
campaign collapsed for lack of money and support after throat
surgery left him unable to speak for three months. By starting that
campaign, he broke the pledge he made in his 1994 re-election not
to seek the White House, and supporters said Monday that his
current prospects had been badly hurt by that aborted effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' said Dan Schnur, a former senior aide.
``If he had not run in 1995, he'd be viewed now not just as a
candidate but as one of the party's strongest. That's the kind of
toll a campaign like that can take.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said some people wanted Wilson to give the race another
shot. ``There was a strong argument,'' he said, ``to running a $5
million to $7 million live-off-the-land kind of campaign, hope you
finish first in Iowa and New Hampshire and then blow that into
California and New York.'' But in the end, Schnur said, ``He just
decided he was better positioned to influence the debate at both
the state and national levels as an elder statesman than as one of
a pack of candidates hoping to break through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has formed a nonprofit group, the Bear Flag Forum, to
work on behalf of issues he supports. He plans to form a political
action committee to support Republican candidates, and he has
accepted a post as a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a
conservative think tank at Stanford University. He also plans to
write a book.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, said the former governor was
visiting his father in Ohio Monday and would not be available for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to supporters, Wilson said: ``Don't expect me to
go quietly into the night. I'm not going to.''

AS LICE RESIST TREATMENT, THE BATTLE ESCALATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting rid of head lice used to be a straightforward affair. An
insecticidal shampoo or rinse was slathered on the hair at night,
and the lice were gone the next morning. But that has changed in
the last few years, with the pest that is scientifically known as
Pediculus humanus capitis showing resistance to standard remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, children are missing days, even weeks, of school because
they cannot get rid of head lice. ``I know of kids who've been left
back because they missed two months of school,'' said Terri Lynn
Meinking, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard J. Pollack, an entomologist at the Harvard School of
Public Health, studied head lice resistance to permethrin, the
active ingredient in some over-the-counter products. Because the
study has just been accepted for publication in a medical journal,
he would not comment on the research. But he and other researchers
did say that there have been thousands of anecdotal reports of
resistance to permethrin and pyrethrum, a similar ingredient in
other lice treatments. And studies in Europe and Israel have
documented resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Parents doing battle with bugs often get conflicting advice, and
the Internet abounds with entrepreneurs selling unproven herbal
lice treatments, said Deborah Z. Altchuler, president of the
National Pediculosis Association, a nonprofit education
organization. And the pediculosis group itself has been criticized
by consumers and manufacturers for bias against de-licing products
other than Lice Meister, the lice comb that it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the missed days of school and work, to say nothing of
the discomfort of a lice infestation, reports of treatment failures
have led to another problem. More doctors are prescribing lindane
shampoo, an old remedy whose overuse can cause neurological damage
in children, Ms. Meinking said. Because of this risk, the Food and
Drug Administration recommends that lindane be prescribed only for
people who cannot use other approved therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with or frightened by the standard therapies, many
parents are turning to home remedies, such as petroleum jelly,
olive oil and mayonnaise, in hopes that these substances, when
applied to the scalp, smother the lice.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Meinking tested these preparations in a small study
last year at Key Largo Elementary School in Florida, she found that
none killed all the lice on the children's heads. The most
effective alternative remedy that she used was HairClear 1-2-3,
which contains anise oil, ylang-ylang oil and coconut oil in
rubbing alcohol. But even that product did not kill all the lice
with one application, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinking said that in all cases she had to comb through the
children's hair to get rid of the eggs, or nits. She said that the
Lice Meister comb was the easiest to use and the most effective,
adding that an advantage of using HairClear or olive oil was that
they loosened the nits, making it easier to comb them out.
Petroleum jelly, on the other hand, ``was more trouble than it's
worth because it makes the nits hard to see and remove,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is some evidence that new treatments get rid
of the lice without laborious combing or harmful side effects. Dr.
Lawrence Schachner, a spokesman for the American Academy of
Dermatology, said that many doctors get good results with
ivermectin, an oral drug approved in this country for treating
intestinal parasites. ``More and more of the cutting-edge doctors
are prescribing it,'' he said. Side effects, which are rare,
include dizziness or low blood pressure, Schachner said.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising treatment is trimethoprim sulfanethoxazole, an
oral antibiotic that kills bacteria in the lice's gut that are
necessary for their survival, Schachner said. And Ms. Meinking said
that she has been involved in testing new herbal and insecticidal
products. Though she said she could not yet discuss the
preparations or their makers, she described some of the treatments
as ``exciting.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A narrow swath of moderate snow will blanket parts of the Middle
West on Tuesday as a weakening low-pressure system and a trailing
jet stream disturbance cut across the middle Mississippi and lower
Ohio River Valleys. Snow, from 2 to 4 inches, is possible from
eastern Missouri to southern Illinois, southern Indiana and
southwest Kentucky. Broken areas of sleet and possibly snow are
possible farther south in parts of Tennessee, northern Mississippi
and northern Alabama, where the air is further cooled as some of
the precipitation evaporates into the initially dry air.
</P>
<P>
   Showers of rain, with isolated peals of thunder, will develop
within a few hundred miles of the Gulf Coast across parts of
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. With humidity levels over the
northern Gulf of Mexico relatively low, the risk of heavy rain will
be practically nil.
</P>
<P>
   North of the low-pressure system, broken areas of generally
light snow will fall across the southern Great Lakes region as far
north as Chicago and Milwaukee, but accumulations, where they
occur, will generally be light.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and wind will intensify Tuesday night in the Pacific
Northwest as a potent jet stream disturbance approaches from the
Pacific. Increasing winds from the southwest will build to 25 to 50
mph along the Oregon and Washington Coasts by Wednesday morning,
with gusts to 60 mph or more possible over exposed beaches. Rain
will become heavy Tuesday night in western Washington and western
Oregon, with rainfalls of 2 inches or more on west-facing slopes of
the Coastal Range.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Bay-effect Snow
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lakes do not own a monopoly on lake-effect snow. Early
Monday, ``bay-effect'' snow fell at Norfolk along the southeast
coast of Virginia as Arctic air was moistened in transit over the
comparatively tepid waters of Chesapeake Bay. Because of the
narrowness of Chesapeake Bay, only a narrow range of wind
directions typically produce bay-effect snow at Norfolk. Indeed,
Arctic winds must blow from the north or north-northeast, a small
window in wind direction that maximizes the distance and time that
Arctic air spends over the moistening waters of Chesapeake Bay. &QL;

TOUGH EDUCATION CHOICES AWAIT DISTRICT IN DISARRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians spent $300 million over 15 years to
buy computers, news classrooms and hire teachers to help
desegregate schools in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the money failed its first and most fundamental goal:
getting black children to do well in school.
</P>
<P>
   The failure is undeniable. The districtwide grade point average
for black high school students was 1.81 in spring 1998. While
blacks are 16.6 percent of the district's 62,000 students, they
represent half of all students suspended and just 1.28 percent of
those who take advanced placement exams.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which has made its name fighting segregation,
acknowledges the limits of court-ordered integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you do things such as train teachers to deal with a
class of students from different cultures, integration by
assignment alone is superficial,'' said Michael Harris, a lawyer
for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, the schools have been governed by a federal consent
decree requiring them to enroll students through a rigid racial
formula: No more than 45 percent of students at any school could be
of one race and at least four ethnic groups had to be represented
at each school.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, to settle a lawsuit brought by Chinese-American
families kept out of elite public schools because of quotas, the
district agreed to stop using race in admissions. Now the district
must craft a new enrollment policy.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Bill Rojas said Schools have to play a balancing
act, giving certain children what they need to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race alone is not sufficient, and race alone is not allowable
in determining admissions,'' he said. ``So we must now set up
alternative plans that use more than race but still lead us to a
desegregated system.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has a long and tumultuous history of trying to
integrate schools. Busing began in 1971, following a lawsuit filed
by the NAACP. But the level of integration varied from school to
school, prompting the NAACP to push for the 1983 federal
desegregation order.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise of desegregation is dimmed by disparities in the
quality of schools and the persistently low performance of black
students.
</P>
<P>
   The district has also failed to accomplish key goals of the
court order, ranging from hiring more minority teachers _ 17.7
percent of the district's 2,350 teachers are minorities _ to
reducing suspensions of black students.
</P>
<P>
   And while the desegregation order has achieved integration in
schools, it has failed to keep classrooms from becoming segregated.
</P>
<P>
   An independent review of the district last July found that
``within-school segregation in San Francisco today is an issue of
monumental importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the money, despite all the efforts of integration
over 15 years, what I want to know is why hasn't there been a
perceivable increase in test scores for those who were supposed to
be helped?'' said John Yoo, professor of law at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question that must be asked is, `Has integration, to
the extent it occurred, helped students become better students?'''
</P>
<P>
   Test score data and grade point averages by ethnicity are not
available before 1983 because the district did not track such
scores before the court order. But educators say it is hard to
imagine scores of black students being much lower than they are
today.
</P>
<P>
   While the average grade point average for black high school
students in the city is 1.81, the average GPA is 2.84 for
Chinese-Americans, 2.51 for whites and 1.98 for Hispanics. Grade
point averages above 4.0 are possible if students take
advanced-placement courses, which assign 5.0 grades for an A.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement reached last week requires the district to draft
by October a new admissions formula that is blind to race.
</P>
<P>
   The district is considering redrawing boundaries around schools
to draw children from ethnically diverse neighborhoods, or giving
preferences to children who face personal and economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did research looking at what would happen if you went from
a race-based policy to a policy based on socioeconomics,'' state
Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin said. The
results were similar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, she added, policies based on
socioeconomics ``are perceived to be fairer _ and won't stir
resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   If San Francisco is able to integrate schools successfully by
using such factors as whether a child resides in public housing,
there is ``a lesson for the whole country,'' said Gary Orfield, a
Harvard University professor and specialist on school
desegregation. ``This will be harder for them to implement than the
desegregation order,'' he said, but could provide a valuable
national model for how to achieve affirmative action without
considering race.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco has to figure out what to do when there is no
other model _ and do it with great urgency,'' Orfield said. ``The
question is not so much how they will do it, but can San Francisco
do it.''

<P>
   One day last spring, Gene Siskel was an in-studio guest on the
radio program I was co-hosting at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we talked about Siskel's beloved Bulls and their
chances for a sixth title, but we also played verbal racquetball
with a number of other topics _ and as always, Siskel was right on
his game and held nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned a rather mundane idea I had for a TV sitcom,
Siskel coated his words in sarcasm: ``That's really great, Rich,
you oughta move straight to L.A., because that's just the best idea
anyone's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an underappreciated skill _ and certainly a small thing
compared to Siskel's legacy as a dedicated family man who partnered
with Roger Ebert to form the most successful critic duo we've ever
known _ but Siskel was a terrific live guest, alone or with Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon last May, Gene had agreed to sit in for an
hour. He was crisp and lively and funny, and if you were listening
to the show you wouldn't have thought anything was amiss _ but
during the commercial breaks Siskel asked for a cup of water,
rested his eyes and said he didn't feel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some coffee the other day and I think it really affected
me,'' he said. ``I can't get rid of this headache.''
</P>
<P>
   We offered to cut the segment short, but Siskel insisted on
gutting it out. After we thanked him and said our on-air goodbyes,
Gene went out to the lobby to rest. Eventually he had to call for a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm sure he was thinking: Coffee. A headache. No big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Siskel would undergo emergency brain surgery in
a New York hospital. He returned to work briefly, but a full
recovery was not to be. Less than a year after that day in the
radio studio, we lost a great Chicagoan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Siskel's dearest friends worked in the media, and over
the weekend they delivered moving tributes in print and on the air.
The CBS affiliate in Chicago, where Siskel worked for more than two
decades, devoted nearly all of its main broadcast Saturday to
Siskel, and it was magnificent television. Several longtime Siskel
buddies in particular stood out, striking just the right note
between solid reporting and heartfelt eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   My own encounters with Siskel weren't nearly as deep or
personal, but we did have some moments. He had this tendency to
want to direct careers _ but always to the betterment of everyone
involved. Not long ago he decided I should be working at his TV
station, even though neither I nor the honchos at his station were
particularly in agreement on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he and Ebert were inducted into the Museum of
Broadcast Communications' Hall of Fame, he yanked me from my table
and marched me over to his TV bosses and said, ``All right, let's
stop ------- around and get you guys together.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was at lunch with these people _ both sides
really only there because we didn't know how to say no to Gene.
</P>
<P>
   In a column a couple of years ago about celebrities who are
rabid sports fans, I poked gentle fun at Siskel's courtside antics
at Bulls games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that if they were having a one-night
screening of a restored version of `Citizen Kane' at the Fine Arts
movie house (in Chicago) on the same night there was a Bulls
playoff game, Gene would be leaving Roger all alone in the
balcony,'' I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That day an ``anonymous'' caller with a very familiar voice left
a message on my machine: ``Way to give it to that Gene Siskel,''
said Gene Siskel. ``I really hate the way he acts at those Bulls
games. Keep up the good work, and keep giving it to Siskel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siskel and Ebert celebrated the 20th year of their TV
partnership, it was my privilege to interview them in the Loop
screening room where they spent countless hours in the dark, always
sitting apart, watching movies. The conversation included this
exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Times: You guys need each other. What happens if one of you
says, ``I don't want to do the show anymore''?
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: We've never discussed ...
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: Never discussed that.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: How'd you like how we finished our sentences, wasn't
that impressive?
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: I have a feeling we'll be doing this show until no one
wants us to, and at that point we'll stop.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: My fantasy is that in another 40 years we'll be in
wheelchairs and we'll have attendant nurses and we'll do the show.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it still would have influenced our moviegoing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of Siskel's passing Saturday, I said my prayers
for his eternal peace, and then I paid tribute to him in the
simplest way possible.
</P>
<P>
   I went to the movies.

<P>
   One day last spring, Gene Siskel was an in-studio guest on the
radio program I was co-hosting at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we talked about Siskel's beloved Bulls and their
chances for a sixth title, but we also played verbal racquetball
with a number of other topics _ and as always, Siskel was right on
his game and held nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned a rather mundane idea I had for a TV sitcom,
Siskel coated his words in sarcasm: ``That's really great, Rich,
you oughta move straight to L.A., because that's just the best idea
anyone's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an underappreciated skill _ and certainly a small thing
compared to Siskel's legacy as a dedicated family man who partnered
with Roger Ebert to form the most successful critic duo we've ever
known _ but Siskel was a terrific live guest, alone or with Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon last May, Gene had agreed to sit in for an
hour. He was crisp and lively and funny, and if you were listening
to the show you wouldn't have thought anything was amiss _ but
during the commercial breaks Siskel asked for a cup of water,
rested his eyes and said he didn't feel well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some coffee the other day and I think it really affected
me,'' he said. ``I can't get rid of this headache.''
</P>
<P>
   We offered to cut the segment short, but Siskel insisted on
gutting it out. After we thanked him and said our on-air goodbyes,
Gene went out to the lobby to rest. Eventually he had to call for a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm sure he was thinking: Coffee. A headache. No big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Siskel would undergo emergency brain surgery in
a New York hospital. He returned to work briefly, but a full
recovery was not to be. Less than a year after that day in the
radio studio, we lost a great Chicagoan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Siskel's dearest friends worked in the media, and over
the weekend they delivered moving tributes in print and on the air.
The CBS affiliate in Chicago, where Siskel worked for more than two
decades, devoted nearly all of its main broadcast Saturday to
Siskel, and it was magnificent television. Several longtime Siskel
buddies in particular stood out, striking just the right note
between solid reporting and heartfelt eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   My own encounters with Siskel weren't nearly as deep or
personal, but we did have some moments. He had this tendency to
want to direct careers _ but always to the betterment of everyone
involved. Not long ago he decided I should be working at his TV
station, even though neither I nor the honchos at his station were
particularly in agreement on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he and Ebert were inducted into the Museum of
Broadcast Communications' Hall of Fame, he yanked me from my table
and marched me over to his TV bosses and said, ``All right, let's
stop ------- around and get you guys together.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I was at lunch with these people _ both sides
really only there because we didn't know how to say no to Gene.
</P>
<P>
   In a column a couple of years ago about celebrities who are
rabid sports fans, I poked gentle fun at Siskel's courtside antics
at Bulls games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that if they were having a one-night
screening of a restored version of `Citizen Kane' at the Fine Arts
movie house (in Chicago) on the same night there was a Bulls
playoff game, Gene would be leaving Roger all alone in the
balcony,'' I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That day an ``anonymous'' caller with a very familiar voice left
a message on my machine: ``Way to give it to that Gene Siskel,''
said Gene Siskel. ``I really hate the way he acts at those Bulls
games. Keep up the good work, and keep giving it to Siskel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Siskel and Ebert celebrated the 20th year of their TV
partnership, it was my privilege to interview them in the Loop
screening room where they spent countless hours in the dark, always
sitting apart, watching movies. The conversation included this
exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Sun-Times: You guys need each other. What happens if one of you
says, ``I don't want to do the show anymore''?
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: We've never discussed ...
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: Never discussed that.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: How'd you like how we finished our sentences, wasn't
that impressive?
</P>
<P>
   Ebert: I have a feeling we'll be doing this show until no one
wants us to, and at that point we'll stop.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel: My fantasy is that in another 40 years we'll be in
wheelchairs and we'll have attendant nurses and we'll do the show.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it still would have influenced our moviegoing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of Siskel's passing Saturday, I said my prayers
for his eternal peace, and then I paid tribute to him in the
simplest way possible.
</P>
<P>
   I went to the movies.

THE THRILL OF BEING DULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday Feb. 24)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There nothing like getting together with a group of people with
whom you have something in common, which is why I'm thinking of
joining the Dull Men's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Administered by the National Council of Dull Men located,
appropriately enough, in Washington, D.C., the Dull Men's Club is
the place for guys whose idea of a good time is watching the
airport baggage carousel go 'round and 'round and who ride the
elevator for hours at a time so they can listen to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Dull men spend a lot of their time alone in a room staring at a
computer screen, like I am doing right now. So it stands to reason
that dull men would have their own dull Web site,
http://www.dullmen.com/
</P>
<P>
   (The Dull Men's Club is not to be confused with the Boring
Institute or the National Association of Wheat Growers, although
there are some obvious similarities.)
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure if I had what it takes (or lacks) to be a member
of the Dull Men's Club, so I took the test. Although I was stumped
by the first question ``Name the three most exciting things you
have ever done,'' I think I did OK on the others:
</P>
<P>
   - Do you prefer luggage carousels that go clockwise,
counterclockwise, or are you undecided? (Undecided.)
</P>
<P>
   - Do you like airplane food? (I can't remember having anything
more elaborate than peanuts in the last 10 years, but they were
delicious.)
</P>
<P>
   - Do you like English food? (Any national cuisine that includes
such items as bangers and mash and toad in the hole is fine with
me, especially reheated.)
</P>
<P>
   - Do you like Vegemite? (That depends. Is that a food or a brand
of housepaint?)
</P>
<P>
   - Do you like macaroni? (I'd shoot it straight into my vein if I
weren't afraid of needles.)
</P>
<P>
   - Do you think women should be allowed in the club? Why not? (I
have not met a woman yet who appreciates the subtle pleasures of
watching wood warp, and many have trouble accepting Spam as a
vegetable.)
</P>
<P>
   - Does your wife think you are dull? (Does the sound of corn
growing make me giddy? She doesn't call me Mr. Excitement for
nothing.)
</P>
<P>
   - Have you ever had an urge? How did you get over it? (I once
had an urge to watch some airport baggage carousels go 'round and
'round but I overcame it with lots of bed rest.)
</P>
<P>
   - What is your favorite shade of gray? (Pale.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that the impeachment trial is over, many dull men are
wondering how they will fill those long empty hours. Watching the
Weather Channel is one possibility, though the sight of approaching
cold fronts may be too exciting for men who have spent the past
several weeks absorbing the wit and wisdom of Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are several events remaining in the month of
February to help dull men wean themselves from the wacky
shenanigans of Chief Justice Rehnquist and reaccustom themselves to
everyday dull life.
</P>
<P>
   For example, February is Return Shopping Carts to Supermarkets
Month, an event you may have overlooked while you were busy folding
your socks. While I, personally, do not have any shopping carts
that need returning, I'm thinking of stealing one and immediately
returning it just so I can participate in this event and feel that
I made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   February is also National Winter Bird Feeding Month, though if
you haven't thought of feeding your winter birds before now, it's
probably too late. The National Council of Dull Men does not
explain why feeding winter birds is duller than feeding summer
birds, though I think it's safe to say anyone who would pose such a
question is deserving of membership.
</P>
<P>
   After you have finished disposing of the dead winter birds
littering your yard, you may want to take advantage of the fact
that February is National Embroidery Month.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys like to do embroidery while listening to corn grow,
but that strikes me as a trifle too adventurous.

 &HT;    VENTURA WARNS PARTIES TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS OR FACE MORE LOSSES
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura warned the Democratic
and Republican parties Monday that unless they change their ways, a
wave of Reform Party candidates will be elected across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major national speech, Ventura bemoaned partisan
politics, called for more individual responsibility and hinted that
he might have his eye on the White House in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The former professional wrestler told a National Press Club
luncheon that his come-from-behind victory last November should be
a ``wake-up call'' to the major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am not a wake-up call to them, I think they're going to
suffer more losses,'' Ventura said. He said the parties must ``wake
up to the fact that people are concerned about the real issues
going on out there and to the fact that they are there to serve the
public; they are not there in their quest for power.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the public's antipathy toward partisan posturing, Ventura
said, ``if these two parties don't wake up from their bipartisan
bickering in everything that they do, there will be more Jesse
Venturas on the horizon. Rest assured of that. But that's not
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, whose first election was as the non-partisan mayor of
Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb, said he felt at home in the
Reform Party because ``I can be me. In my opinion, the other two
parties, you have to become them. You have to change who you are
and fit into their two narrow agendas on the far left and the far
right, to become part of them and to achieve success.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura stressed his view that people need to take
responsibility for their actions and not depend on the government
to take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People must learn (to) be self-sufficient. Don't look to the
government when you make a mistake. Pull yourself up by your own
bootstraps, correct the mistake, and in the long run you'll be
better off for it, because you'll keep a core sense of values.''
</P>
<P>
   While he hasn't decided whether to seek re-election when his
four-year term is up, Ventura said he would not be a presidential
candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 2004? Well, who knows? I could end up down the street here
in that big white house, or I could end up living in a hut on the
beaches at Kona _ I don't know right now what my future holds. I'm
just going to do the job that I am doing right now. And, as I've
done in all my life, we'll see what happens when a new day
arises.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he enjoyed meeting President Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton at a reception Sunday night at the White
House. At one point the Clintons and Venturas where the only ones
on the dance floor. Ventura said he was tempted to ask Mrs. Clinton
for a dance, but his wife told him, ``don't you dare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he felt snubbed last year when the World
Championship Wrestling Federation came to Minnesota and did not
recognize him or acknowledge his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you very honestly it hurt, personally it hurt.
Because I gave my heart and soul to the world of wrestling for a
number of years. And so, because of what happened there, I didn't
refer to wrestling at all in my inaugural address and I had no
wrestlers or anyone in wrestling who came to my inauguration.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing reports that pro wrestler Hulk Hogan might run for
office in California, Ventura said Hogan should think about running
in Florida, where he lives, rather than in California. Ventura has
also said he thinks Mrs. Clinton should consider running for office
in Arkansas, rather than in New York, because she doesn't live
there.

KAZAN HONOR STIRS PROTEST BY BLACKLIST SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Slowly and quietly, plans are being made for a
series of protests over the decision by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences to present an honorary Oscar to the
89-year-old director Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was perhaps the most formidable filmmaker of the 1950s and
'60s, with such movies as ``On the Waterfront,'' ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' ``A Face in the Crowd'' and ``East of Eden.'' But
he has not been forgiven by some writers, actors and others for
appearing before the House Committee on Un-American Activities on
April 10, 1952, during the height of the McCarthy era. He informed
on eight old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him,
had once belonged to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   By planning to award the ailing Kazan an honorary Oscar at the
71st annual Academy Awards on March 21, the academy opened some old
wounds, especially among writers and others who were blacklisted.
At the annual Writers Guild Awards dinner in Beverly Hills last
Saturday night funds were solicited by a small group of
screenwriters who plan to place advertisements in The Hollywood
Reporter and Daily Variety asking academy members not to applaud
Kazan when he is introduced. The group is made up of mostly
elderly, former blacklisted writers, members of their families and
supporters, though none of them were named to the House committee
by Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   In the text for those advertisements, scheduled to appear in the
next few weeks, the writers say: ``We do not wish to disrupt the
awards ceremony, which is important for the industry and for many
of our fellow workers. But we do ask for some minimal evidence of
disapproval for the academy's insensitive and unconscionable act.
Do not stand and applaud Kazan. Sit on your hands. Let audiences
around the world see that there are some in Hollywood, some
Americans, who do not support blacklisting, who do not support
informers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizers of the advertising effort, Bernard Gordon,
a 79-year-old writer who was blacklisted, said the group was also
planning a protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the
Music Center of Los Angeles, where the Oscar ceremony is being held
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an attempt to keep people from going in,'' Gordon
said. ``We want to convey our basic position that it is shameful to
honor a man who knuckled under to the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, a man who had such prestige and financial
invulnerability that there was no need to do this in order to
protect his own career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, like several other veteran screenwriters, said an
apology from Kazan for naming names would defuse much of the
opposition to him. But, for the moment, that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apologize? Recant? That's a good Stalinist word,'' said Floria
V. Lasky, Kazan's longtime lawyer. ``It seems to me he never said
it was an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Kazan's strongest opponents have never apologized ``for
supporting Stalinism and communism,'' Ms. Lasky said. ``I expect
Kazan will say `Thank you' in his speech.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kazan's defenders have argued that it was
absurd to say that he personally destroyed careers, because he
named names that the committee already knew. But Kazan's critics
said that by informing he gave his tacit support to McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   In honoring Kazan, who has had a powerful influence on
contemporary filmmakers and actors, the academy was seeking to
divorce his extraordinary career from his private life. In recent
years groups including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and
the American Film Institute have ignored efforts to give Kazan life
achievement awards.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, a blacklisted writer, said today: ``The issue
for me is, if he apologized, nothing would take place. It would be
accepted that people make mistakes. Sterling Hayden apologized. He
wrote a book about it.'' But in Kazan's case, he continued, ``The
point is, he's silent. So there'll be protests because of what he
said and did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan placed an advertisement in The New York Times after his
testimony before the House committee, justifying his action. In the
advertisement Kazan denounced communism as a ``dangerous and alien
conspiracy,'' and said that ``liberals must speak out.'' In his
1988 memoir, ``Elia Kazan: A Life,'' Kazan said he had acted
honorably by informing and would do the same given the chance
again.

   Gordon said he was unsure how many demonstrators might gather on
the day of the Academy Awards because many people blacklisted
during the McCarthy era were too old to appear. Regarding the
Academy Awards, he said with a laugh, ``People from all over the
world will be watching this silly affair, so we'll get a lot of
media coverage.''

EARLY ROMANTIC WITH A SALON AMBIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before beginning his recital on Sunday afternoon at
the Frick Collection, the pianist Frederic Chiu told his audience
that he was greatly relieved not to be playing, for once, in some
generic concert hall before an audience of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a specialty of the early Romantic piano repertory,
and the Frick's intimate, oval music room struck him as similar in
ambiance to the Parisian salons where the works on his program by
Mendelssohn, Liszt and Chopin would have been played, often by the
composers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu has absorbed the atmosphere of Parisian salons firsthand:
though born to Chinese immigrants and raised in the United States,
he now lives in France. Through his chatty remarks to the audience
(in which he pretended to be a gracious host at a fabled salon) and
his informal attire, the young ponytailed pianist further evoked
the mood he was after.
</P>
<P>
   He began his program dashingly, with Mendelssohn's Introduction
and Rondo Capriccioso. Following this were transcriptions by Liszt
of four songs from Schubert's ``Schwanengesang,'' fascinating
works, more like transformations of the songs than mere
transcriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sprightly ones are pianistically formidable. In
``Abschied,'' for example, the evocation of the vocal line is
situated where it belongs, in the piano's tenor range, with the
leaping, chordal accompaniment figurations surrounding it above and
below. There were also accounts of Chopin's gripping Ballade in G
minor and the whimsical, seldom-heard Rondo in E flat.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu has a palpable connection to this music and an idiomatic
feeling for the style. Yet he brings his own touches to it,
including a spare use of pedal and an interesting penchant for
slightly dry, articulate textures. His technique is resourceful and
often impressive, as his traversal of Chopin's daunting 12 Etudes
(Op. 10) in a neat 30 minutes during the program's second half made
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he often seemed to be pushing at the limits of his
technique, which accounted for some uncertainty, dropped notes and
glossed-over passagework. He may have been struggling with the
Frick's Yamaha concert grand piano, an instrument with a very
bright top range, which, given the room's reverberant acoustics,
cannot be easy to control.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu was at his best and most musical in the works that did not
tax his pianism, especially Chopin's Four Mazurkas (Op. 24), played
with lilting grace, a vivid ear for nuance, and intimacy. For a
moment, we might have been in the candle-lit salon of a Parisian
duchess.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: COME BACK, LITTLE CAESAR, TO SHOW THEM HOW IT'S
DONE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What made Meyer Lansky run? ``Lansky,'' David Mamet's dreamy
version of the life and tribulations of the Jewish brain behind the
Italian muscle that once controlled bootlegging, gambling and
associated diversions and gave us Las Vegas in all its glory and
squalor, suggests that Lansky's character somehow was developed by
watching a pogrom as a lad in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   But Mamet doesn't seem particularly persuaded of that dubious
and derivative proposition or with much else that might explain the
Lansky genius or his line of work. What these two hours, to be seen
on HBO on Feb. 27, provide instead is a reflective essay, dotted
with Mametisms, of an aged and ailing man at the end of his tether.
</P>
<P>
   In putting his trust in so sedentary a figure as Lansky, Mamet
was bucking the proven conventions of the crime drama, a risky
endeavor. This playwright's hope seems to have been to challenge
the cartoon nature of Mafia movies, to invest his subject with an
offbeat originality, with an air of poignancy and inklings of
social significance. As the poker player in Mamet must have known,
the odds were against him. His ambition collided with the crime
formula at its strongest point.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's problem in turning Lansky into the sort of gangster who
provides a writer with the stuff that fans of the form have come to
cherish is built into the man's image. No creature of the
underworld comes closer to the evocative description by the movie
critic Robert Warshow in his rewarding 1948 rumination on the great
gangster movies of the 1930s and 40s, yet is further removed from
it.
</P>
<P>
   Warshow wrote: ``The gangster's activity is actually a form of
rational enterprise, involving fairly definite goals and various
techniques for achieving them. But this rationality is usually no
more than a vague background; we know, perhaps, that the gangster
sells liquor or that he operates a numbers racket; often we are not
given even that much information. So his activity becomes a kind of
pure criminality; he hurts people. Certainly our response to the
gangster film is most consistently and most universally a response
to sadism; we gain the double satisfaction of participating
vicariously in the gangster's sadism and then seeing it turned
against the gangster himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansky, the vaunted mastermind operating the strings for some
grand criminal enterprise, lacks the jolt of sadism offered by the
characters memorialized by Edward G. Robinson, Paul Muni and many
of the later Goodfellas. Once Mamet gets past his hero's youthful
high jinks, the inherent violence surrounding the man's calling is
mainly consigned to surrogates. He himself is as peaceable as any
conventional accountant; he is as likely to be caught carrying an
adding machine as a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   That makes things tough for the crime writer. It's like trying
to keep ``The Godfather'' crackling without its big, smartly staged
scenes of mayhem. In models like ``Scarface'' and ``Little
Caesar,'' Warshow noted, the criminal's temporary success assures
his ultimate destruction; somebody is always out to kill him and
the movie succeeds along with the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   But Lansky the bureaucrat falls victim not to bullets but merely
to the paperwork of other bureaucrats. There are no shootouts to
help the dramatist along, and although the screenplay may be more
realistic than bloodier crime chronicles, it is wan as drama.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the grave of his grandfather in Jerusalem (a few
lines of Yiddish, a Jewish tune), where a beset Lansky (Richard
Dreyfuss) is trying to find sanctuary from American crime hunters,
the story drifts somewhat confusingly over the decades as a fairly
familiar account of a kid from New York's Lower East Side who falls
in with the likes of Benjamin Siegel (Eric Roberts) and Charlie
(Lucky) Luciano (Anthony LaPaglia) while managing to steer clear of
their propensity to murder and batter.
</P>
<P>
   If a scene or two seems to have been borrowed from more
original, violent and ambitious works, that comes naturally to an
imitative genre. (The patient viewer is promised yet another
variation on NBC in the fall, about the childhood friendship of
Lansky and Luciano.)
</P>
<P>
   Mamet faces up to the dry fact that the Lansky career was short
on the color of those of more visceral pals in the syndicate. You
can't imagine this man laying a bat to anybody's skull. His pal,
Ben, may erupt at any moment (if you're looking for trouble, just
call him ``Bugsy''), but Lansky goes his calculating way with never
a frisson of threat. In search of character Mamet finds himself
relying on his own patented sort of wit and wisdom, which turns out
to be a frail substitute for action.
</P>
<P>
   Young Lansky learns early not to gamble ``unless it's your
gamble'' and never to fight fair: ``Who wants to get involved in a
fair fight?'' Somebody says, ``You get nuttin' for nuttin', '' and
Arnold Rothstein, fabled gambler, counsels, ``Never write it down;
keep it in your head,'' before being killed over a poker hand.
</P>
<P>
   Such fruits of the criminal life might have come straight from
the street-hardened Scarface, who shared his secret of success with
his henchmen: ``Do it first and keep doing it!'' But in that
enduring movie, the cheap lesson is accompanied by the killer gun
battles that reward moviegoers for their patience.
</P>
<P>
   No such rewards are forthcoming, as Lansky falls into the
tiresome role of a wandering Jew with a weak heart and strong
opinions, being pursued from Israel to Paraguay to Panama and
finally to Miami Beach. His ultimate lesson: ``Nobody is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he is certifiably right about that: Scarface and Little
Caesar and the Godfather and most of the other unforgettable screen
criminals learn that lesson but in a more entertaining way, with a
lot less whining. ( Warshow observed that if a major character in a
gangster movie finds himself alone on screen, you can be pretty
sure he's about to be wasted. But Lansky seems always to be alone
and nobody takes advantage of it to shut him up, although by the
end of this show many viewers may be hoping.)
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss does what he can with an ungiving script, but there's
more kvetcher than character for him to work with. Mamet's Lansky
evidently thinks of himself as a savior of the young Jewish state
as well as a provider of a universally popular pastime, gambling in
its various forms, who is hounded by hypocritical Washington
officials, politicians and other Jew-baiters. His laments and rants
verge on incoherence, but his loyalty to his old pals, Ben and
Charlie, is portrayed as steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   The period style can be engaging, but the tough stuff of the
classic crime yarn is lost in a failed search for a wise guy's
wisdom. Scarface and Little Caesar and their offspring knew how to
settle matters in a blast of bullets. What we are left with in
``Lansky'' is an affable buddy movie with aspirations, or maybe
they are just affectations.

A TEXAS CASE ABOUT LEGAL FEES COULD AFFECT THE STATE'S TOBACCO
SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LINDA P. CAMPBELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case file in Burrow vs. Arce _ or Arce vs. Burrow, as it's
also known _ gushes superlatives worthy of a raging clash over
attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   Did attorneys for Carol Arce and other plaintiffs engage in a
``deplorable spectacle'' of signing up victims of a chemical plant
explosion in Pasadena, Texas, and then conduct a settlement
``charade'' that left the clients ``shocked and disappointed'' and
the lawyers rolling in dough?
</P>
<P>
   Or are David Burrow's dissatisfied clients motivated by
``suspicion and jealously'' that ``drove them wild'' because they
believed that co-workers represented by other lawyers got better
deals?
</P>
<P>
   The fight could have been the final chapter in litigation over
the 1989 explosion at Phillips Petroleum Co.'s Houston Chemical
Complex that killed 23 workers and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the case's significance has mushroomed in light of
state Attorney General John Cornyn's investigation of the private
attorneys who helped Texas extract a record $17.3 billion
settlement from the tobacco industry for the public costs of
treating ill smokers.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk that the Texas Supreme Court's ruling in the
Phillips litigation could determine whether Cornyn has a legal hook
for trying to rescind all or part of the $3.3 billion in fees that
a federal arbitration panel awarded the legal team headed by the
firms of attorneys Walter Umphrey, Wayne Reaud, John Eddie
Williams, John O'Quinn and Harold Nix.
</P>
<P>
   Lest the potential import of the case escape the Supreme Court,
a friend-of-the-court brief filed in January by Texans for
Reasonable Legal Fees spells it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court's decision in the present case, although it will of
course not directly determine any tobacco fee case and should not
prejudge it, will affect the law under which Attorney General
Cornyn can investigate the tobacco fee facts,'' says the brief,
written by Austin lawyer Pete Schenkkan, who represents the fee
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Cornyn must decide whether the facts show sufficient
breaches of fiduciary owed by those lawyers to their client, the
state of Texas, to warrant the state filing a breach of fiduciary
duty suit against the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Reasonable Legal Fees, a coalition of business and
``lawsuit reform'' groups, formed last year to oppose the size of
the tobacco attorneys' payment. The group's brief proposes that, as
a general rule, a lawyer should have to give up all fees in a case
involving ``clear and serious breaches'' of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Political conspiracy theorists in the state capital see all
sorts of ominous possibilities in the explosion case. Here's one
way the dots get connected:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, now all-Republican, already has a reputation
for a conservative philosophy that tends to favor business
interests over plaintiffs _ and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Cornyn was a member of that court. After he
left the court and announced his run for attorney general, Cornyn
sued to protest the huge fees that the tobacco lawyers stood to
gain, although he later dropped the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush appointed four current court members and
named a fifth to a lower appellate bench from which she
successfully ran for the high court last year. Bush, too, has
loudly criticized the fee award and, earlier in the process, also
went to court trying to block the lawyers from collecting. In fact,
the governor's latest court appointee was Al Gonzalez, who as
Texas' secretary of state helped represent his boss in the tobacco
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cornyn have been advised by Republican political
consultant Karl Rove, a former Philip Morris lobbyist, and lawsuit
reform groups have given generously to their campaigns. For
instance, Texans for Lawsuit Reform's political action committee
and 24 of the group's members combined for more than $1 million in
contributions to Cornyn's campaign for attorney general, according
to a recent report from a government watchdog group, Texans for
Public Justice.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the tobacco attorneys are well-known major
donors to Democratic candidates. The five lead firms reportedly
gave more than $1.8 million to the Texas Democratic Party last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, some thinking goes, a ruling that opened the door to axing
the tobacco fees would prevent that money from being channeled into
political races against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The theorizing does sidestep the likelihood that any fee suit
that Cornyn filed in state court probably would get sent back to
the Texarkana federal court that oversaw the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco lawyers are wealthy even without the massive
fees and can be expected to continue their pattern of giving
generously to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely unfortunate that this has become a partisan
political game,'' said Patrick Woodson, a spokesman for the tobacco
attorneys' team.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there are any facts that would merit'' a suit
or loss of fees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schenkkan said the political impact makes no difference if an
investigation shows that the tobacco lawyers sold the state short
in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conspiracy talk about this on either side ... is simply
irrelevant to the legal issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of ironies surrounding the explosion case help fuel
the undercurrent of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the plaintiffs originally sued five lawyers in
1992, three of whom later joined the state's tobacco team. Those
three _ Reaud, Umphrey and Williams _ settled with the explosion
plaintiffs several years ago, leaving David Burrow and F. Kenneth
Bailey as defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one of the plaintiffs' current attorneys,
William Skepnek, also has represented asbestos maker Raymark
Industries. And some of the tobacco lawyers have made fortunes
suing asbestos companies.
</P>
<P>
   In another coincidence, the tobacco attorneys' ethics advisers,
University of Texas law professors Charles Silver and Lynn Baker,
filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the explosion case in
November, arguing against the plaintiffs' position.
</P>
<P>
   The professors say in their brief that they were not paid to
write it and that they ``speak only for ourselves'' as academics
who have written on aggregate settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion case ``could affect every case in which a lawyer
represents a client,'' Silver said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single instance is threatened'' by what the plaintiffs
are arguing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion clients say their original attorneys railroaded
more than 40 Phillips victims and their relatives into a mass
settlement that did not take into account their individual cases.
That kind of settlement is barred by lawyers' ethics rules unless
all the clients are informed and agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that because their individual interests
weren't adequately represented, the attorneys should forfeit the
millions they made in fees.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys counter that they represented their clients
properly. And even if that were not true, they argue, the
plaintiffs should lose the case because they didn't prove they were
harmed. And even if the clients don't have to prove they were
harmed, the lawyers argue, they shouldn't have to relinquish all
their fees _ just a fair amount determined by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston judge ruled for the lawyers without a trial, but the
14th Court of Appeals disagreed. The appeals court said the
plaintiffs could make their case simply by proving the lawyers
breached their duty _ harm or no harm _ but that even lawyers who
let down their clients don't have to forfeit all their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Silver and Baker argue that lawyers should not have to forfeit
their fees unless the clients show they were harmed by their
attorneys' breach of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fee forfeiture makes any sense at all, it makes sense only
when violations are `clear,''' the professors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said that threatening lawyers with forfeiting their fees
for any breach of duty no matter the impact could make it
impossible to sue companies for dangerous products that cause mass
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn acknowledged knowing about the explosion case but said
recently: ``It's really premature to talk about our office filing
any lawsuits. We are merely at this point trying to figure out what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect that Cornyn's office is looking into is the work done
by Marc Murr, a Houston lawyer long connected to former Attorney
General Dan Morales, who initiated the tobacco suit. Murr claimed
he was due at least the $260 million in fees that a secret state
panel said he was entitled to, but late last year the federal
arbitration panel awarded him $1 million. Morales has called Murr
an essential consultant in the litigation, but the other private
attorneys have said they don't know what work he did.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn confirmed that federal officials also have been asking
questions about Murr and said his office would cooperate in that
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Cornyn's investigation have suggested that he could
topple the entire state settlement if he tries to capture the
attorney fees for the state. Schenkkan called that a ``scare
tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesman Scott Williams called the fees ``a matter
between the state and their attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement specifically provides that the tobacco
industry will pay _ over more than two decades _ the attorney fees
separately from the amount going to the state. Although forfeited
fees in a typical case would return to the client, it appears that
the tobacco settlement would make any forfeited fees the property
of the industry paying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement with the state is concluded,'' Williams said.
If the state were to try to capture some of the attorney fees for
itself, ``that would probably result in litigation,'' he said, but
``that would not impact the settlement itself.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cornyn is saying little about his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't reached any conclusions because we don't have all
the evidence yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue our investigation and let the chips fall
where they may.''

LIKE PRINCESS DI, 7-YEAR-OLD HELPS SICK CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff and Paige Dunham felt they had done something
right when their then-6-year-old daughter, Bree, said she wanted to
give away her birthday presents to sick children.
</P>
<P>
   Our child is so sweet, the San Fernando Valley couple thought,
figuring she'd certainly forget about her plan by the time she
turned 7. That's a long time in kid years.
</P>
<P>
   But sure enough, eight months later, Bree reminded them of her
wish.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Dunhams included a letter in her birthday party
invitations requesting that everyone bring a toy to donate instead
of a gift for Bree. Bree felt so good about her accomplishment that
she decided to try it again last Christmas. This time they asked
everyone on their Christmas card list to send a donation.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Bree raised $3,500 that she donated to the Ronald
McDonald House, a residence for the families of children
hospitalized with serious illnesses. For her selflessness, Bree was
named February's ``Kid of the Month'' by Radio Disney KDIS-AM
(710).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not stage parents pushing a child to do something,''
said Jeff Dunham. ``She honestly wants to do this and enjoys doing
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bree got the idea for the toy drive when she asked her mom about
the pretty lady on the cover of all the magazines. It was Princess
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know who she was and why my mom liked her so
much,'' Bree said. ``So, my mom told me about her and what she did.
She went around the world helping sick children and giving poor
children and children who need stuff like toys and clothes. I
started to want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The family plans on continuing the toy drive and getting Bree's
two younger sisters involved.
</P>
<P>
   When she grows up, Bree wants to be a horseback rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm probably going to grow up to be someone like
Princess Diana and still be a horseback rider. I think I'm going to
keep on doing this for a long time because all the kids looked so
happy when I did it.''

ROLL THAT DICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social conservatives deplore what they claim is a
national decline in moral standards, as symbolized by President
Clinton's survival and Congress' failure to embrace an agenda
dictating a right-wing concept of virtuous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the alleged threat to the republic from our supposed ethical
collapse would be far more persuasive if our self-appointed moral
arbiters were less selective about the sins they see as the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a cultural monster is rapidly smashing old notions
of personal and community vice all across America. Yet most leaders
of the religious right have not taken up arms against it. The beast
does not appear regularly among their top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is legalized gambling, which used to be widely
considered a dangerous sign of moral decline and a flagrant
disavowal of the honest virtues of hard work and responsibility.
But all of a sudden in the last decade gambling has become so
pervasive it has steadily invaded even the most conservative states
of the southern Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right remains conspicuously reticent about the
traditional fears generated by legalized gambling. Somehow games of
chance that were once considered the gateway to corruption,
bankruptcy and crime no longer upset our moral militia even though
the poor and innocent are often the major victims.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to family values? Where is the religious
right's moral outrage? Or was its anger really directed only at
Clinton all along?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan, a 1992 Republican presidential candidate,
listed in a recent newspaper column his favorite symptoms of
cultural decline as: ``divorce, dirty language, adultery,
blasphemy, euthanasia, abortion, pornography, homosexuality and
cohabitation.'' You may note six of the nine sins are associated
with sex. Perhaps that's why gambling, a sexless activity, didn't
make the cut?
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, former head of the Family Research Council and a
2000 presidential candidate, repeatedly made a one-note pitch for
``values'' that cited only his dream of ending all abortion in an
ABC-TV interview on Sunday. He did not mention any other social
issue, not even legalized gambling, although he has said in a less
visible context that he is opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, has
complained more about the power and influence of the gambling
industry on political leaders and elections than its effect on
American lives. He is a member of a federal commission studying the
impact of gambling on the economy, on families and on compulsive
gamblers that is to make a report in June.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, a disgruntled right-wing crusader, simply threw in
the moral towel. He suggested that conservatives drop out of
society because voter support for Clinton means the nation has now
become a ``hostile culture.'' He will now apparently allow others
to take up the burden of lecturing Americans on how to behave.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these signs of intellectual exhaustion on the
right there is a rational explanation for a reluctance to address
the social changes that pervasive gambling may bring: money, lots
of money. It is not going to be popular to take on this particular
tiger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the industry has taken a sophisticated approach and
has benefited from tolerant state laws that have provided a fresh
sense of social legitimacy. Gaming creates local jobs, and taxes on
its revenues go for education or other desired programs. It has
attracted a middle class in search of amusement, and for most
people there is no harm in it.
</P>
<P>
   Legalized gambling now has a foothold in every state but three,
in the form of casinos, parimutuel betting, dog racing, horse
racing, video poker, keno or lotteries. In 44 states churches and
charities get in on the act, mostly by sponsoring bingo nights.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic candidates have received huge
campaign contributions from the industry, which is pursuing
favorable operating and tax deals. According to Common Cause, each
party received nearly $9 million from 1988 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, conservative South Carolina kicked out GOP
incumbent Gov. David Beasley largely because he promised to shut
down the state's video poker industry and opposed a state lottery.
Nearly half of the $6 million in campaign contributions that went
to Beasley's victorious pro-gambling Democratic opponent Jim Hodges
came from the state's video poker operators.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message not lost elsewhere in politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Republican Committee meeting in January, South
Carolina GOP National Committeeman Buddy Witherspoon tried to take
revenge on the industry for defeating his party's governor. He
proposed that the GOP formally reject all campaign contributions
from gambling interests and prohibit RNC financial support to GOP
candidates who support gambling. It was billed as a major challenge
to the party hierarchy from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   But it died with barely a whimper. Republican candidates want
those contributions.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt either that the president of the American Gaming
Association is Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., a widely respected moderate
former RNC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling may yet emerge as a big political controversy, if the
federal commission can document an increase in individual addiction
and corporate corruption. But thus far the industry has little to
fear from an intimidated, toothless religious right. Nor should it,
if it can keep its nose clean.
</P>
<P>

   Oops. In a column last week, I referred to Texas Rep. Richard
Armey as House minority leader. He is, of course, House majority
leader.

OPERA REVIEW: A `PEONY' FINALLY ARRIVES, IN TRADITIONAL STYLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The big news of the Lincoln Center Festival last
summer was a production that did not in the end take place: a
complete, 18-hour staging of Tang Xianzu's ``Peony Pavilion,'' a
late-16th-century Chinese opera that has come down as the classic
of the Kunqu regional style. At the time, members of the Kunqu
Society of New York made no secret of their objections to the
unseen staging, which, as conceived for the Shanghai Kunqu Opera
Company by Chen Shi-Zheng, a New York director, was to draw on
aspects of Chinese opera tradition now lost as well inject touches
of naturalism into a medium that has become rigidly stylized.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center was finally forced to cancel the production when
bureaucrats in Shanghai, who also presented themselves as guardians
of Kunqu tradition, refused to let the troupe leave China. And soon
afterward, the Kunqu Society announced plans for its own
large-scale production of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' under the
auspices of the China Institute. That version, directed by Shen
Xiao-ming, was presented last weekend at the Kaye Playhouse.
Drawing on nine of the epic work's 55 scenes, and thus steering a
middle course between Chen's epochal compleatism and the typical
presentation of a mere two or three scenes, the production ran
three hours.
</P>
<P>
   In this sequence, the beautiful young Du Liniang is seen
distracted in a classroom; strolling in a garden, where, in the
Peony Pavilion, she dreams of a handsome young lover; pining to her
death for want of him; languishing in the netherworld, and
resurrected after Liu Mengmei, her dream lover's real-life
counterpart, has discovered her self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   It was gratifying on one level finally to see such a substantial
representation of the work, with much artistry and expertise
lavished on it. Du Liniang was played by Hua Wenyi, famous for her
portrayals of the role over the decades and now also part of Peter
Sellars' touring production of the work, which turns up next week
in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the disruption of Chinese opera tradition caused by
the Cultural Revolution, older performers have become familiar in
youthful roles, and Ms. Hua's artistry (if not always her voice)
was often such as to encourage a suspension of disbelief. (A viewer
was inevitably reminded of the older Margot Fonteyn in Prokofiev's
``Romeo and Juliet.'') Sie Jiehua was fetching as Fragrance, but
Wang Taiqi portrayed the dashing hero with resources grown slender
and fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The production offered beautiful costumes and, in the
netherworld scene, skillful acrobatics. But the Blossom Fairies
seemed to have wandered in from a Las Vegas stage, and the lighting
was often garish. The music seemed diluted to appeal to bland
Western tastes (though some lack of impact in the drums and cymbals
undoubtedly resulted from the stifling acoustics of the Kaye
stage).
</P>
<P>
   If the attempt was, as it was made to seem, to show the one true
way to draw on a venerable tradition, it left a neophyte admirer of
the art form unpersuaded. Tradition, after all, is manifold, and
nobody owns it.

   TECH-INVESTING _One of the good things about the Internet is
that it cuts out the middleman. So far, that's meant less-expensive
books and CDs and, in some cases, cheaper stock buying. If you're
buying a book, most of the time losing the middleman is a fairly
innocuous omission, maybe saving you some small talk at the cash
register. But in a stock transaction, it could cost you money.
(Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY_ Seldom do I return to a specific topic within a few
weeks of writing about it. After all, my beat _ technology _ is so
broad that it covers everything from Nintendo games to computers to
HDTV to ham radio. If it has batteries, computes or makes beeping
sounds from time to time, I have probably written about it.

   NETWATCHER _ America Online, the nation's largest online
service, has had its virtual wrist slapped time and time again for
censoring its highly popular message boards and chat rooms. A
letter-writing campaign is now under way from members who want to
be able to send their own newsletters to AOL subscribers but are
finding themselves violating the company's legendary ``terms of

   CYBERSCENE _ The World Wide Web is actually a useful place these

button. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

who will play the lead roles, about the story line and about other
movies to come in the ``Star War'' series.. (Haddad, Atlanta

   MAC-REPORT _ You know it must be tax time when Intuit releases

ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT CHALLENGES HERSELF WITH 12,000-MILE BICYCLE
JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Megan Timothy looks back on her life, there
are no ``if onlys'' or ``I should haves.'' And with a lifetime of
different careers and exploits behind her, at 59, the
Rhodesian-born North Hollywood woman is heading into her biggest
adventure ever: a 10-month, 12,000-mile solo bicycle journey around
Western Europe and part of Africa, equipped with less gear than
most people pack for a weekend at a country inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have adventures in the world anymore,'' the lean,
gray-haired Timothy says with a tinge of wistful sadness in her
voice. ``The world is so small, and there are no challenges left. I
was born in the wrong century. I should have been born in the
1800s, when they still had frontiers. The last frontier is the
outer galaxy, and I don't have enough money to go there. So I'm
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll fly to Paris on Monday to begin a personal odyssey she's
been planning for a year, ever since she felt like Wonder Woman
after pedaling a rented bike 800 miles around France's Loire Valley
_ and then learned that an English schoolteacher had spent the
summer biking 10,000 miles around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I can do better than that,' and decided I would,''
Timothy said.
</P>
<P>
   She sold her historic, stained glass-filled showpiece of a home
in North Hollywood, her well-worn Honda Civic and nearly all her
possessions and bought a lightweight bicycle with saddlebags to
hold her gear. When she's not riding around the Valley to get in
shape, she's learning to repair her bike in case it malfunctions on
the long trek.
</P>
<P>
   And she's spent the past six months reading guidebooks,
collecting maps and planning a detailed route that'll take her
through France, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Holland,
Belgium, England and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   She'll likely spend her 60th birthday, June 21, in Italy,
reveling in the sights and sounds and smells of somewhere she's
never been before.
</P>
<P>
   With time off to rest up and see the sights along the way,
Timothy figures to end her journey Nov. 3 in Paris, closing the
loop.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the latest adventure for the screenwriter, who's
finishing up one last script before climbing on the plane for
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy is driven by curiosity _ always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so interesting, that's my problem,''' Timothy
said. ``It's the learning that's exciting. Once I know about it _
or how to do it _ I feel that I'm stagnating. Then there's
something else to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief career as a horsewoman and horse trainer, she left
her African homeland, now called Zimbabwe, for Hollywood in the
early 1960s. Even with an untrained voice, Timothy _ who could play
the guitar _ found work as a folk singer, performing at
coffeehouses and entertaining U.S. troops in Vietnam on USO tours.
</P>
<P>
   After a 14-month stint as a Playboy bunny in Hollywood, Timothy
got fired when she set fire to a patron's beard while trying to
light his cigarette and put the fire out by throwing a glass of
water in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Time for another job, this time as an actress. Timothy had a
number of bit parts and even appeared in the 1969 Elvis Presley
movie ``Charro'' before adventure called.
</P>
<P>
   She and a companion built a raft, lashed airplane wings beneath
it for buoyancy, put the hull of an old travel trailer on top for a
cabin and set off down the Mississippi, braving a hurricane along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The travel ``fix'' worked _ for a while. A decade later,
wanderlust beckoned, and Timothy headed to Brazil because she'd
heard it was a gorgeous country. Joining some other travelers she
met on the plane, they headed off with two native guides on an
unplanned trek through the headhunter country of the Amazon jungle
by canoe, taking quick dips in the river and scrambling out before
flesh-eating piranhas could swim near and sleeping in a hammock to
thwart the fire ants that swarmed over the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, she became fascinated with stained glass and
decided to learn the craft. Eventually she filled her home _ a
historic house built in the 1920s _ with more than 100
stained-glass windows. The house became such a showplace, she
turned its guest houses _ also filled with stained glass _ into a
bed-and-breakfast inn, where she doubled as chef. Expanding her
culinary repertoire, she learned to make fantasy wedding cakes so
elaborate they were featured in Chocolatier and Good Housekeeping
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a stint as a caterer, then a movie
stuntwoman, before she became a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wake up one morning and decide I'm going to do
something,'' she said simply. ``Then I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Timothy woke up one morning and decided to take a nice long
bicycle ride _ through much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But for this adventure, she's made meticulous plans, right down
to what she'll wear, what she'll pack, what she'll eat, where
she'll sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an adventurous person, but I don't think I'm a reckless
person,'' she said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother has kept meticulous scrapbooks chronicling her
daughter's many journeys, and she said she's never worried about
her yen for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very self-sufficient sort of person,'' said Helen
Timothy. ``She can take good care of herself ... She knows what she
wants, and she goes for it. And 95 percent of the time, she's
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Timothy radiates competence, she admits she's a bit
frightened as time to begin her journey nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' she said. ``I'm scared of traffic. I can't
compete with 18-wheel trucks, so I'll stay on side roads. I'm
scared of smokers running amok, which they do in Europe (she's a
nonsmoker). I'm worried about someone being so kind to me that they
put a big slab of some poor, dead animal on my plate (she's a
vegetarian). I'm worried about things like being able to get dental
floss in Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects language to be a bit of a problem on her trip but
plans to overcome difficulties with a smile, a handshake and her
own version of charades.
</P>
<P>
   Friends Nancy and Richard Wedeen of North Hollywood, members of
the Los Angeles Wheelmen for 20 years, have helped Timothy prepare
for her trip _ Nancy coaching her in riding techniques and safety,
and Richard teaching her how to do bike repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll be ready for anything, any time,'' Nancy said.
``Even if she doesn't have all the skills, she'll learn along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hoffman, owner of North Hollywood's Pedal Shop and
Timothy's outfitter, said her 21-speed bike should carry her
anywhere she wants to go. Most of his customers are male and
decades younger than Timothy, he said, admitting to be amazed by
``the fact that she's a lady _ and just the sheer independence of
her, that she's doing this alone. But it'll be an adventure of a
lifetime for her.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure all goes smoothly, a tiny tool kit, an extra tire,
brake cables and spokes are among her luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a lightweight tent, sleeping bag, water bottle,
bedding, camera and first-aid kit, she'll take only her itinerary
and a few maps.
</P>
<P>
   Her wardrobe will be basically the clothes she has on her back.
In a resealable plastic kitchen bag, she'll carry a change of
underwear, an extra Lycra top, a couple of extra pairs of socks.
She'll do laundry every night so she'll have clean clothes the next
morning. If they're not dry, ... well, the next day will be a wet
ride.
</P>
<P>
   She'll subsist on yogurt, bananas, dried fruit, rice and fresh
vegetables, with an occasional restaurant meal as a luxury. But
most meals will be cooked over a campfire in a stainless-steel
bowl, which will double as a serving dish. That, a Swiss Army
knife, a spoon and a fork are all the utensils she'll take.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ominous challenges in her route will come
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of my trip is going to be pure misery,''
Timothy said. ``I expect it to be cold and rainy all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days into the trip, she'll cross the Spanish border and then
pedal over the snow-covered Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the long journey will be relieved by an occasional
ferry or hydrofoil (a high-speed boat) trip _ from Spain to Morocco
and back, from Italy to Greece, from Bulgaria to Turkey _ and one
short train trek, through Italy's steepest mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Along with learning the routes she'll be traveling, she's had to
learn the rules and customs of the countries she'll visit.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Bulgaria, she must have her visitor's card
stamped by an official every night. If she misses more than two
nights, government agents will start looking for her; when they
find her, they'll throw her out of the country if she's lucky _ or
imprison her if she's not.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the summer, when she'll be pedaling through
Italy (``1,000 miles of sweating and swearing''), Greece, Turkey
and Bulgaria, she plans to be on the road by 5 a.m. With five hours
a day of pedaling, she plans on covering about 50 miles, six days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   She figures the trip will cost about $35 a day, ``which will
take some creativity. But I'll be camping a lot, and that only
costs about $4 a night (at campgrounds with bathing facilities). I
know I'll go over budget in France and Italy the first three weeks,
but it's going to be cold and wet, and I'm going to cuddle up under
some nice down comforter in an inn somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's too cold and wintery once she reaches Belgium, she'll
cut the England/Ireland leg of her journey short and head back to
Paris and home, armed with photographs and memories.
</P>
<P>
   What'll she do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll think about that next year,'' Timothy said with a grin.
``I'll fall out of bed one morning and say, `How about this?' or
`How about that?' and off I'll go.''

`EVENING NEWS': A DEATH IN, AND OF, THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The characters in Marly Swick's last collection of stories,
``The Summer Before the Summer of Love'' (1995), worried about the
fault lines running beneath the surface of their placid,
Formica-tiled lives: the emotional sinkholes and random acts of
violence that could easily destroy their carefully tended dreams.
One man observed that he had spent his entire life ``waiting for
some ax to fall that never falls,'' while another feared that he
would walk into his daughters' room one morning and ``find nothing
but two little piles of wilted petals lying on their twin beds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Swick's affecting new novel, ``Evening News,'' all her
characters' worst fears come true. In the opening pages something
terrible happens, one of those things that usually happen to other
people on the evening news. Nine-year-old Teddy is playing at his
next-door neighbor's house when his best friend hands him his
father's gun; somehow the gun goes off, and Teddy's 2-year-old
half-sister, Trina, is suddenly lying in a pool of blood, as their
horrified mother, Giselle, looks on.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment, Giselle thinks, it seemed as if ``their real
life had been canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or someone had flipped the channel. And now they were stuck in
some godawful soap opera that could go on and on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The story Ms. Swick spins from this melodramatic event possesses
both the psychological suspense of Sue Miller's best-selling family
drama ``The Good Mother'' and the emotional acuity of Alice Munro's
short stories. In charting the impact that Trina's death has on
Teddy, Giselle and Giselle's new husband, Dan, Ms. Swick shows us
how that event irrevocably alters the mathematics of love in their
little family: how Dan finds himself unable to forgive his stepson
for killing his daughter, and how Giselle finds herself torn
between her loyalty to Teddy and her passion for Dan.
</P>
<P>
   Although we are given Teddy's point of view in italicized
passages running throughout the novel, the bulk of ``Evening News''
is told from Giselle's perspective. We learn that Giselle (who
portentously shares the name of the doomed ballet heroine) grew up
in Lincoln, Neb., and that she once planned to become a journalist
or lawyer. Her life, however, took several unexpected detours:
While still in college, she became pregnant with Teddy, married his
father, Ed, and settled down to life as a wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   When that marriage began to unravel, she took Teddy and left for
California where she planned to finish college and go to law
school. This time her methodical plans unraveled happily. She fell
in love with Dan, who was one of her professors, got married again
and gave birth to Trina. Now, with Trina's death, she thinks, her
hopes for a new life with Dan have been shattered. Dan not only
harbors a deep bitterness toward Teddy but has also begun to write
a book about the loss of his daughter, a book that enrages Giselle
and threatens to destroy their family's privacy forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of a lesser writer, such events might echo with the
tinny sound of the talk-show confessional, but Ms. Swick writes
about Giselle with such unsentimental precision that she's able to
make her predicament feel utterly palpable and real. Like so many
of Ms. Swick's earlier characters, Giselle has a self-conscious
ability to see her life from within and without at the same time;
she is constantly comparing her experiences to books and television
shows, measuring her emotions against an impersonal standard as a
way of distancing her own confusion and pain, while underscoring
the almost comical gap between art and life, expectation and
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Trina's funeral, Giselle finds herself
wondering if she and Dan should be comforting each other: ``She
kept catching herself thinking in terms of `should' and
`shouldn't,''' Ms. Swick writes, ``as if there were correct and
incorrect ways they should be handling this. Was there a Miss
Manners guide for grief-stricken parents that everyone but her had
read? It made her worry that she was shallow, that somehow her
grief was inauthentic if she could be worrying about whether she
was doing it right _ when who could tell her she wasn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, trying to make up for an outburst at Teddy, she kisses
him, smiling down ``at him as if he were little Timmy and she were
June Lockhart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As she turned off the light, she could almost hear Lassie
wagging her tail in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   As Giselle struggles to forgive Teddy for shooting his sister _
he will later call his mother's love for him ``an act of will,''
requiring ``strenuous daily exercise'' _ he struggles to come to
terms with his own feelings of guilt. Convinced that he has forever
compromised his mother's chance of happiness with Dan, Teddy begins
acting out: He grows increasingly hostile and defensive, and tries
to kill himself by swallowing a bottle of Nytol. His actions,
combined with Dan's mounting anger, will force Giselle to send
Teddy home to his father, Ed, in Nebraska, and they will force her
to re-evaluate her entire life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard for the reader to predict what will happen to
Giselle: As in Ms. Swick's weaker short stories, her penchant for
stage-managing her characters' lives grows increasingly pronounced
as the novel progresses. Her account of Giselle and her family,
however, remains so moving that the reader doesn't really care if
the book's ending is a little too shapely, a little too pat, more
the ``Lassie'' version of real life, than the evening news.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance has been handed down for centuries from one
body to another. But little by little it has been moving into the
electronic era. Technology has been used in dance for several
decades to record and reproduce existing choreography, but the
means and results have exponentially grown more sophisticated in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has also been used increasingly to ornament or
enhance the look and content of dances on a stage and even to
affect how they unfold. And now technology is being used as a
creative tool for choreographers. Today's computer technology can
make important contributions to the inherently visual art of dance,
and dance contributes to the evolution of the technology, as it did
with film.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the technological spectrum are software programs
that drastically cut the time necessary to set up and study dance
notation scores and can create comprehensive archival Web sites,
databases for dance teachers and records of little known work. A
heady development at the other end of the spectrum is ``virtual
dance,'' generated by and for the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ghostcatching,'' a recent virtual-dance installation at
Cooper Union created by Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar of the
Riverbed new-media studio in Manhattan, elegantly drawn figures
moved through space that seemed eerily three dimensional in an
abstraction of a dance by Bill T. Jones. Another example is Ralph
Lemon's ``Mirrors and Smoke,'' created at Arizona State
University's Institute for Studies in the Arts in Tempe, a CD-ROM
in which the viewer walks through the many chambers of a dance for
electronic space by Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   The implications are considerable, both philosophically and for
the day-to-day life of dance. Could stages and studios soon be a
thing of the past, as some anticipate? Is virtual dance the future
of dance? Those questions are sure to be discussed in
``International Dance and Technology '99,'' a conference at Arizona
State University from Thursday through Sunday. Information about
the conference is available on its Web site:isa.fa.asu.edu/IDAT99 &QC; 
Richard Loveless, director of the institute at Arizona State,
describes the form as an ``extension of live performing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a simulation of what is live,'' he said. ``Dance
becomes something else. This is not about how you displace the live
performance but how you extend its boundaries to other spaces where
other populations exist to experience that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is just as emphatic. ``Nothing can replace seeing a human
being performing on stage,'' he said. ``That's an incredible form
of art. But there are other art forms that can derive from that,
and that's what we're interested in exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   Using computer technology to compose dance goes back about a
decade. Merce Cunningham began testing the boundaries of human
movement and theatrical space in 1991 using animated figures in a
computer composition program called Life Forms. Capable of
astonishing physical feats, the figures gave Cunningham new
choreographic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ghostcatching'' and some other virtual dances, figures
``capture motion,'' in Kaiser's words, edging toward the look of
animated cartoons. Working with Kaiser and Eshkar, Cunningham has
also choreographed a multimedia piece to be performed by his
company this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alwin Nikolais' experimentations with stage light and shape
beginning in the mid-1960s led to dances that abstracted the human
body and the ways it moved. Trisha Brown used comparatively
advanced technology to explore interactive performance in her 1989
``Astral Convertible,'' a piece, designed by Robert Rauschenberg,
in which dancers activated electronic sensors that in turn
activated the lighting and music.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Robb Lovell and John Mitchell have upped the
ante considerably with Intelligent Stage. Developed at Arizona
State, the program allows performers to produce sound, lighting and
video imagery in new, once-unimaginable ways through onstage
movement-sensing systems and computer-controlled stage media.
</P>
<P>
   Another very active area is the dance department at Ohio State
University in Columbus, where A. William Smith has created programs
like ``Interactive Multimedia Dance,'' a CD-ROM that can help a
dance company save money by creating prototypes of virtual sets and
scores in virtual space.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Mitchell were among the representatives of more than
20 institutions that participated in ``Decade of Dance Preservation
Symposium,'' a seminal conference held last year at the Joyce SoHo
Theater. Sponsored by Preserve Inc., a service organization for
performing arts documentation and preservation, the conference
offered a dizzying overview of practical and fantastic new programs
and the uses to which they are being put in dance.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conference symposiums and video screenings were
devoted to new electronic preservation techniques, an increasingly
urgent topic in dance as video, once considered an affordable
alternative to film, has proved fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago the dance community discovered that it was
losing two generations simultaneously, from age and AIDS, and also
discovering that videotape doesn't last,'' said Leslie Hansen Kopp,
director of Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the field has very little control of the new technology.
Most dance companies and independent choreographers still do not
have access to or cannot afford the latest equipment for good
electronic documentation of their work, an increasingly serious
handicap in an electronic age. And though once unimaginable ways
are opening up to create once unimaginable kinds of dance, these
tools are being used almost entirely by technologists rather than
by experienced choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Will choreographers of the future head for the computer rather
than the rehearsal studio? The experience of creating with
technology is undeniably exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we need to imitate reality,'' said Smith at Ohio
State. ``What is dance history? Dance, and in fact all art, has
been about what's in people's minds and imaginations. And I think
that in 1999 the people who don't have any models are the ones who
are out there being innovative, who are truly expressing their
period.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand choreographers and companies may be
increasingly unable to control the reproduction and even the
viewing of their work. ``Video is going to be available on demand
to anyone with a phone line and a computer,'' Mitchell of Arizona
State said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's new ``dancecodes'' program, created with money from the
National Initiative to Preserve American Dance in Washington, will
enable the viewer to watch a videotaped piece from just about every
angle outside and inside the dancing, depending on how many cameras
and perspectives have been used to tape the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ruin the choreography!'' a participant in the Preserve
conference said in horror.
</P>
<P>
   Smith replied with equal passion: ``We're talking about
documentation. We're dealing here with the analytical mode. If you
want an esthetic experience, watch live or from a front angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dance, as inherently suggestive and metaphorical as it is
physical, has always been a virtual art form to some extent.
Extract the physical, though, and what do you have? As written
material accompanying the ``Ghostcatching'' installation rather
chillingly asked, ``What is human movement in the absence of the
body?''

SAVING THE EPHEMERAL, BY PENCIL OR A LAPTOP

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Archivists were among the first to use technology in
dance. And preservationists of all stripes attended the symposium
on the topic at the Joyce SoHo Theater last spring, including a few
low-tech participants, as David Vaughan, the white-haired longtime
archivist of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, dryly described
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dance technocrats were well represented, too, bent over laptop
computers in the dark theater and muttering about Macs and
megabytes as they sent small arrows flying across wall projections
of complex multimedia diagrams representing the latest in CD-ROM
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Owen, director of the Jose Limon Dance Institute in
Manhattan and director of preservation at the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Becket, Mass., managed to bridge the two worlds,
endearing himself to the crowd by casually referring to the subject
matter as ``stuff'' in the panel discussion ``Library and Archival
Initiatives.'' Owen looks like the proverbial mild-mannered
scholar, but he presides nonchalantly over gleaming IBM computers
and video decks in his Limon and Pillow offices and yearns for an
editing system.
</P>
<P>
   One of the computers is being used to catalog the Pillow's
archival holdings on the Web site of the Dance Heritage Coalition,
which the festival joined last summer. The site,
www.danceheritage.org, an ambitious three-year project to catalog
dance collections throughout the world, was developed with seven
national library and academic institutions, including the American
Dance Festival and the Duke University Library in Durham, N.C.
``When we talk about the wonderful things to be done with the
technology, I think mainly of that access to information,'' Owen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owen and his archival staff now videotape interviews with
visitors who have stories to tell. The interviews are stored in a
climate-controlled ``cocoon,'' along with 1,200 current and
historical performance videotapes, some of which had been in danger
of disintegrating. They were copied with a preservation grant from
the ubiquitous National Initiative to Preserve America's Dance.
``There is not very much we don't tape these days,'' Owen said.
``People's stories are tangential in one sense, but in another way
they are the threads that make up the fabric of history,'' he
continued. ``It is the anecdotal things that get lost, because they
are not earth shaking. I think sometimes about the Bourgeois
Gentilhomme learning the difference between poetry and prose and
suddenly understanding that he is speaking prose.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks of Vaughan and how his fabled and exhaustive index-card
archival system started. ``No one ever told him how to do it or
that he should. As a teen-ager he had made lists of performances of
ballets.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be a place for the David Vaughans and Norton Owens in
the brave new technological world?
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools are wonderful, but I don't want to see them used as
a barrier,'' Owen said. ``I don't want people to say that something
cannot be preserved or documented because they don't have the
tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen contributed to ``An Unfinished Memoir,'' a recent book by
and about Jose Limon. ``His tools were a No. 2 pencil and a legal
pad. Those are still available to us and shouldn't be overlooked.''

 &HT;    JUDGE TO TAKE MICROSOFT TRIAL OFF THE STAND
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government lawyer David Boies abruptly cut off his
cross-examination of a key Microsoft Corp. manager Monday after the
judge voiced concerns that the lengthy trial may have spun out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything in the interest of economy,'' an exasperated U.S.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told defense attorney
Michael Lacovara in granting Lacovara's bid to question his
witness, Dan Rosen, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Boies had suddenly sat down, leaving several
planned avenues of attack unexplored, after seeing Jackson
repeatedly rolling his eyes and staring at the courtroom ceiling in
response to Rosen's erratic testimony. Lacovara, unprepared for the
turn of events, asked that he have overnight to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The brief delay in the proceedings came after a frazzled Jackson
ordered a recess for the end of the week, when the last of the
three remaining Microsoft witnesses is expected to finish
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the world's largest software firm on broad
antitrust charges will not resume until some time after April 12,
depending on when two other cases _ one involving Jackson and the
other involving Boies _ are over.
</P>
<P>
   After the long break, as many as six rebuttal witness are to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jackson had been told by both sides in the landmark
case that it would take no more than six to eight weeks to
complete. In a further effort to speed things up, Jackson had
limited each side to a dozen witnesses and cut the time spent in
the courtroom to only cross-examinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's efforts proved to no avail as a flood of
documents, including once super-secret e-mails, were offered into
evidence. Fresh material was still being produced Monday, when the
trial entered its 18th week.
</P>
<P>
   Boies showed Rosen, Microsoft's manager of new technology, a
memo Rosen had drafted in May 1995 entitled ``Internet Direction.''
He then sought to show that in the memo, Rosen had called on
Microsoft to step up its effort to control the personal computer
desktop through the dominance of its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was important because, in his direct testimony, Rosen
had cast himself as the leading Microsoft official to press for a
friendly strategic alliance with Netscape Communications Corp.,
thereby avoiding a bruising Internet browser war.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Rosen denied he had ever e-mailed the memo to
anyone, saying he had merely used the memo to sort his thoughts.
But, subsequently, upon being shown documentary evidence, he
acknowledged that he had in fact sent his memo to at least one
Microsoft official, Ben Slivka.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, this lapse seemed to be least of Rosen's
problems. He repeatedly failed to square his pre-trial deposition
with his direct testimony. And he continually sparred with Boies
over what seemed to be the plain meaning of such words as
``browser'' and software ``client.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen denied that he had ever heard anyone at Microsoft use the
terms ``browser'' or ``browser battle'' at any time between 1995
and 1997. He denied Boies' contention that Microsoft sought to gain
browser market share, at Netscape's expense, during the three-year
period, despite Microsoft memos and e-mail messages citing that
fact. Instead, he asserted that Microsoft was interested merely in
``usage share of Internet technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   At several points, courtroom spectators erupted in skeptical
laughter as Rosen rebuffed Boies' attempts to show that Microsoft
executives _ from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on down _ had
used those terms.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when Boies showed Rosen an e-mail from
another Microsoft employee, Chris Jones, that said the object of a
key June 21, 1995, meeting with Netscape's top brass was to ensure
that the competitor's Navigator browser would not evolve into a
substitute for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not be a platform competitor,'' Boies said. ``Isn't
it what this says?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not correct,'' Rosen shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said: ``I have no further questions.''

 &HT;    Monet &AMP; Bazille': Detective work
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1863, Claude Monet and Frederic Bazille met as
students in the studio of Charles Gleyre in Paris. That meeting
sparked a friendship that resulted in a relationship that
contributed to the development of impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Like its larger counterpart, ``Monet and Bazille: A
Collaboration'' can be enjoyed purely on a sensual level. Indeed,
Monet's ``The Bodmer Oak, Fontainebleau Forest, the Chailly Road,''
which reveals both the influence of the Barbizon painters and
Monet's talents at a young age, is one of the highlights of both
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   But this show, organized by High Museum of Art curator David
Brenneman, is built on an intellectual investigation. It started
with a comparison of Bazille's painting ``The Beach at
Sainte-Adresse,'' owned by the High, and Monet's ``Seaside at
Sainte-Adresse'' from the Minneapolis Museum of Art, long thought
to be the source of Bazille's composition, and broadened into a
study of the relationship of two young artists between 1863 and
1870 and the role it played in the development of this radical
painting style.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of impressionism can be traced in the pictures.
(Chronologically speaking, it should be viewed before the larger
impressionism show also at the High.) The smooth neoclassical style
and classical setting of Gleyre's ``The Bath'' exemplifies the
mainstream art of the period, which Monet and Bazille chose to
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Their mentors are Courbet, represented by a seascape, and the
Barbizon School, whose members painted outdoors in the forests of
Fontainebleau, exemplified by Theodore Rousseau's ``Sunset over the
Plains of Barbizon,'' dominated by pillowy, back-lit clouds
reddened by the sinking sun.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early paintings in the other show, ``A Seascape,
Shipping by Moonlight'' is Monet ``doing'' Courbet. But that
painting, as the seascapes in this show document, was a clumsy
aberration in his journey toward his own style.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't been explored before is how Bazille, with whom he
shared a studio and went on excursions to the seaside and
Fontainebleau, helped move him forward. Though suggested in the
wall texts in labels, it takes reading the catalog to fully
understand. Kermit Champa, one of the catalog essayists, described
it as co-dependence, with Bazille providing the admiration and
financial support that Monet needed at that time. Bazille, in turn,
got a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The High's Bazille is perhaps the most material example of his
dependence on Monet. Yet, it is clear that Bazille was no mere
imitator. Even his copy of Monet's study (he was not yet painting
completely out-of-doors, if indeed he ever did) reveals important
stylistic differences. Whether intentionally or not, Bazille does
not blend his colors and brush strokes like Monet does to achieve
an evenness in the picture surface. He doesn't emulate Monet's deep
space either. Bazille's version is a more post-impressionist and
pre-impressionist: His additions, the figure and sailboat in the
foreground, are outlined in black and keep your attention to the
surface, which is thicker than his counterpart's. Bazille's
painting seems to be an imagined landscape rather than one painted
on the site, even though he had visited Sainte Adresse before.
</P>
<P>
   As Monet during this period was concluding that his forte was
the landscape rather than the figure or integrating the two (note
his study ``Strollers''), Bazille was discovering the opposite. In
1868, two years before he died in the Franco-Prussian War, he
seemed to be on the way to finding his own artistic personality: In
``View from a Village,'' Bazille depicts a woman in the foreground
of a landscape gazing at the viewer in an engaging and convincing
way Monet couldn't accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Brenneman has packed a lot of information, including a broader
context for a painting in permanent collection, in an exhibition of
20 paintings, and lovely ones at that. He makes good on his
contention that ``more is not necessarily more.''

 &HT;    Political advice flows freely for first lady
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newsweeklies devote major space to Hillary Rodham
Clinton's flirtation with elected office. Newsweek ($3.50) calls
Clinton the ``hottest commodity in American public life,'' ranking
somewhere between Gwyneth Paltrow and Princess Diana. In a guest
column, George Stephanopoulos hints that the Senate would be a step
down for Clinton, and suggests aiming higher, post-Gore, with a
campaign that begins in Manchester (N.H.), not in Manhattan. In
addition to gauging Clinton's chances against Rudolph Giuliani,
Time ($2.95) offers free advice from Ed Koch (go for it) and Jimmy
Breslin (forget about it). U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) says
it's likely that a campaign would be ``nasty, brutish and long. For
a woman reeling from the Year of Monica, it could be a very
unpleasant way to spend her remaining 23 months as first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Filming the apocalypse: In a story about the difficulty of
putting World War II on the big screen, Forbes American Heritage
($4.95) surprises us with the information that American documentary
units covering the war included such filmmakers as John Huston,
Darryl Zanuck and David O. Selznick. In the same magazine, novelist
Larry McMurtry writes about the battle at Little Bighorn, where Lt.
Col. George Armstrong Custer, ``that erratic egotist,'' did what he
had always done: ``push ahead, disregard orders, start a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Into the teeth of the storm: Some of the bravest (or craziest)
National Guard members can be found among Alaska's 210th Rescue
Squadron, with the Air National Guard. These bravos jump from
airplanes, rappel out of helicopters, and snatch foolish
adventurers off of mountains and out of churning arctic seas. Men's
Journal ($3.95) shows the 210th at work trying to save an errant
climber on Mount McKinley. Also inside: the droll P.J. O'Rourke
offers a guide to spring break for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fresh air: Vladimir Joseph, the 25-year-old founder of Inner
Strength, leads inner-city Atlanta kids on hiking, rafting or
camping trips to prove to them that there are ``things that are
beautiful and brilliant'' outside the grim reality of the ghetto.
Read about Joseph, a reformed gang member and throwaway kid, in
People ($2.99).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blood brothers: Billy Bulger was, for 17 years, president of
the Massachusetts state Senate. His brother Whitey Bulger was,
during the same time period, a bloodthirsty gang leader in Boston's
Irish underworld. In George ($2.95), Peter Maas and Mike Barnicle
write about the odd duo, and explore the question: Was Whitey
working for the FBI, or was the FBI working for him?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Assembled by humans, not robots: The Morgan sports car, with
its wooden frame, whale-mouth grille and leather strap across the
bonnet, is the most elegant of the open-air two seaters, says Polo
($4.95). No argument here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Works on girlfriends too: Cartoonist Jeff MacNelly explains to
Cigar Aficionado ($5.95) that he doesn't smoke cigars socially,
calling his habit a form of crowd control. ``Fire up a cigar and
everyone leaves. It's kind of nice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pot wars: Last year, after the British medical journal the
Lancet concluded that ``moderate indulgence in cannabis has little
ill effect on health,'' the FBI released statistics showing that in
1997, 695,000 people were arrested for pot. That number represents
twice the arrests in 1992. Rolling Stone ($3) hammers home the
irony that a president who has admitted smoking has had more
Americans imprisoned for marijuana than at any other time in U.S.
history.

 &HT;    Lewinsky interview puts `exclamation' on story
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She laughs, she almost cries. Will she be better than
``Cats''?
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters' two-hour interview with Monica Lewinsky, airing
at 9 p.m. March 3 on ABC in an extended ``20/20,'' has the former
White House intern detailing her relationship with President
Clinton from ``the day of that famous thong,'' Walters says, to
Lewinsky's feelings about the president ``to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts an exclamation point finally on this year,'' Walters
said Monday from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Walters interviewed Lewinsky on Saturday in New York for about
190 minutes. Held inside a ``20/20'' studio, tricked up with
furniture to make the setting more homey, the two talked for 90
minutes, after which Lewinsky took a 20-minute break and ate a
roast beef sandwich. They then talked another 90 minutes, stopped,
and spent another 10 minutes taking publicity photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is open, expressive, sometimes very touching, funny and
extremely articulate _ she is not a Valley girl,'' Walters said.
``There are times when she's very emotional, where she is I think
teary, but it's not a sobbing interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters landed the interview over a parade of competitors,
including both ``60 Minutes,'' all the ``Datelines,'' Oprah Winfrey
and ``Roseanne.'' Fox reportedly dangled $3 million to get her.
</P>
<P>
   For her interview, there were few restrictions placed on
Lewinsky as part of her immunity agreement with Ken Starr's Office
of Independent Council: She could not describe the events of when
she was questioned by Starr's office, most notably during her first
encounter, on Jan. 16; and she couldn't contradict her grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's agreement with Lewinsky allows the network to air the
interview only once, though excerpts can be used during newscasts
and likely will be used to promote the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the president in a way I'm not sure you have been able
to see him before, you understand the role of her mother,
understand how she feels about Ken Starr,'' Walters said.
``Watching her expressions, she is reliving in this interview what
happened in a way that she could not with the Senate and the grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Lewinsky is still in love with the president, Walters
said coyly, ``I'm not going to give you the answer. Just say I know
the answer.''Drew Jubera writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    The impressionist exhibit at the high museum of art: More than
just pretty pictures
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Step beyond the velvet curtain and into the serene
world of impressionism. On view at the High Museum of Art are 88
paintings of the countryside, the seaside, Paris and its
inhabitants, most of them depicted in the flickering brush strokes
and cheerful palette that is synonymous with the most beloved
movement in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have a grand time viewing these two impressionist
exhibitions. They will certainly not disappoint the viewer happy
just to luxuriate in pretty pictures. Both shows, however, offer
more than immediately meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European Museums''
examines the intersection of art and commerce and the role the
latter played in the acceptance of a movement that was _ as
difficult as it is to imagine now _ viewed with horror and contempt
a little more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The impressionists set in motion the art world ecology _ artist/
dealer/collector/museum _ that exists today. Because of their
rejection from the Salon, at that time the ultimate venue for
seeing and selling art, these renegades organized their own shows
and began using art dealers such as Paul Durand-Ruel to sell their
work. The maroon color of the High's first gallery, replete with
molding and wainscots, replicates the walls of Durand-Ruel's
gallery _ an homage to the man whose missionary zeal was largely
responsible for his clients' eventual acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The High has installed a reproduction of his storefront in the
second gallery. Inside are photographic blowups of what the gallery
looked like and synoptic histories of major collectors, dealers and
museum directors. A few of the most important collectors were
impressionist artists themselves. The paintings Gustave Caillebotte
bought from his less-moneyed friends are the nucleus of the Musee
d'Orsay's fabled collection. Caillebotte had willed them to the
French nation, much to the horror of museum personnel, who took
only about half the collection, and that after two years of
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most courageous players in this drama were the
museum directors who made acquisitions when such decisions were, as
managing curator Michael Shapiro says, still ``fraught with
danger.'' The Kaiser ultimately sacked Hugo von Tshudi because of
his purchases for the Berlin Nationalgalerie.
</P>
<P>
   Though chosen because they were among the earliest to make it up
the food chain, so to speak, into Europe's museums, these
paintings, assembled by Shapiro and guest curator Ann Dumas, must
succeed on their visual impact as well. Despite some questionable
moments, the show is a special opportunity for Atlantans to see
fine examples by the major participants in the movement as well as
the less famous who merit more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir's ``Woman with a Parasol in a Garden,'' painted the year
of the impressionists' first independent exhibition (1874), is an
archetypal, casually composed view painted with flecks of color
that almost flatten the image into a weaving. The landscapes by
Sisley, Monet and others similarly revel in the beauty of nature
and seasonal effects. They show the continuum of impressionism,
from Pissarro's more structured approach to Monet's ``Hoarfrost,
near Vetheuil,'' in which the world seems about to dissolve into
color and light.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, viewers expecting a parade of ``textbook''
paintings will be disappointed. On the other, those looking for a
less, say, predictable, sample of impressionism will have a fine
time. Portraits by the four women in the show are good examples.
Berthe Morisot understood perfectly how to apply impressionist
principles to the figure. Marie Bracquemond demonstrates her
compositional, figurative and paintings skills in ``On the Terrace
at Sevres,'' a flurry of short, dynamic strokes that build a lively
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Though considered marginal because of his smoother style,
Gustave Caillebotte's delightful ``Le Pont de l'Europe'' embodies
impressionist immediacy and interest in urban life. The strong
diagonal of the new-fangled bridge draws the viewer into the
painting, right behind the dog in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, why devote a wall to formulaic late Renoir
portraits, in which all the female subjects bear rouged cheeks,
beady, astigmatic eyes and what the great collector Henry McIlhenny
dismissively described as bovine figures? The post-impressionist
section is sketchy and the quality inconsistent. True, Cezanne, van
Gogh and Gauguin went through impressionist periods before arriving
at their mature styles, but their presence, especially the Cezanne
examples, seem almost token as if suddenly the show has become a
historical survey.
</P>
<P>
   No need to be all things to all viewers. The premise, which
initially seemed to be just another excuse to trot out crowd
pleasers, is actually quite illuminating. An artwork is not
complete until someone other than its maker can see it. Exploring
how that happens reiterates one point : It takes individuals with
vision.

CLINTON AND GOVERNORS GO HEAD-TO-HEAD ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and the nation's governors
squared off Monday on federal education rules that some governors
characterized as burdensome and evidence that big brother in
Washington still thinks he knows what's best.
</P>
<P>
   Those governors, many from the 31-strong Republican contingent,
complained that laws aimed at reducing class size in grades 1-3 and
assisting students with disabilities, require huge expenditures of
state funds. The governors said they should have freer rein to
spend federal education dollars on problems that arise at the local
level.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a former governor, assured the governors that there is
flexibility in federal regulations when it comes to education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say the federal government should be giving states
more flexibility, not demanding more accountability,'' Clinton told
the governors. ``I say it's a false choice, and the federal
government should be giving you more of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress last year
approved his plan to reduce class size in early grades by hiring
100,000 teachers. This year Clinton is focusing on renovating or
building 6,000 new classrooms, ending social promotion of students
not performing up to grade level, and insisting on effective
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   But governors said they made clear to Clinton that they felt
hamstrung by regulations imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government should be a limited partner, not a
general partner,'' said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a leading
contender in early speculation about the GOP's presidential
nomination in 2000. ``If they feel like sending money back to the
states, fine. But don't tell us how to run things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York, also a Republican, said only
state and local officials are in a position to determine the needs
of schools in their areas.
</P>
<P>
   Washington shouldn't dictate to states ``whether they should be
investing in teachers, computers, new boilers, new roofs or new
schools,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   While he welcomes the administration's emphasis on higher
standards and discipline, Pataki said that ``when it comes to the
actual decisions as to where to allocate the funds, the differences
between Buffalo and Batavia (in New York state) are enormous, let
alone the differences between New York and Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat from California, attending his first
Washington governors meeting as the state's newly elected top
official, said that asking for waivers from federal regulations is
cumbersome but achievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the best of all worlds, (Washington would) just give us the
money and hold us accountable for results,'' Davis told reporters
after the meeting. ``But that's a long process to change ... I'm
happy to work within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' staff distributed a Feb. 19 letter fron California's
superintendent of public instruction, Delaine Eastin, to Education
Secretary Richard Riley, requesting a waiver from requirements that
federal funds go to reducing class size in early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letter said, California wants to reduce class size
in about 100 districts drawn to serve students only in grades 7-12.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said California has succeeded in reducing class size in
grades K-4 to about 20, and now needs to concentrate on the upper
grades. ``I hope we'll get there,'' he said, adding that as a
former governor, Clinton was ``as receptive and as flexible as you
could possibly ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Several governors also complained that the $4.3 billion in
federal aid this year for educating six million children with
disabilities actually forces states to spend their own money to
comply with federal mandates.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements in federal law dating back to 1975 require schools
to provide ``to the maximum extent possible'' a ``free, appropriate
public education'' in the ``least restrictive'' environment.
</P>
<P>
   At the local level, that often means significant extra
expenditures for staff to teach disabled children, building
modifications and instructional equipment _ everything from
specialized furniture to books on tape to computers that talk.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bradshaw, spokesman for the U.S. Education Department, said
federal money accounts for only 10 percent of the money necessary
to educate disabled children. The remainder, he said, must come
from state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the request we are making (to the states to share the
funding) is a fair one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a Republican who is vice-chairman of
the National Governors' Association, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Republican and Democratic governors want is a national
agenda for reform of education, not a federal agenda,'' Leavitt
said. On special education, ``our message (to Washington) is make
it more reasonable and fund it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Governors also expressed concern over talk that the Clinton
administration wants to grab a big share of the $195 billion
tobacco settlement reached between the states and the tobacco
industry last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the governors that the Justice Department believes
Washington must try to recoup money the federal Medicaid program
has expended on those with smoking-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that Clinton ``doesn't want the money back.'' But,
Davis added, Clinton wants to make sure states use money from
tobacco settlements for anti-smoking programs, especially those
aimed at teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing that anyway (in California) so we don't see a
problem with that,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was encouraged that the president said he wasn't
trying to take the states' money,'' said Gov. John Engler of
Michigan, a Republican. ``We couldn't see if the fingers were
crossed or not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One item that did not come up was the prospect of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigning in 2000 to be a senator from New
York. Asked about a potential bid by Mrs. Clinton, Pataki said:
``We've got 18 million bright, talented, capable residents of New
York State. We should be able to find one ... who is able to
represent us well in Washington.''

`OH, COWARD!': WORLD WEARY? SAIL AWAY, FOR STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Noel Coward's Champagne seems a lot like beer by the
time the well-meaning but lackluster revue ``Oh, Coward!'' winds to
its end.
</P>
<P>
   Bright looking but fundamentally bland, this generous little
show playing through March 14 at the inviting Irish Repertory
Theater, offers more than 30 of Coward's bright songs, plus
snippets from his writings.
</P>
<P>
   So here, divided into such categories as England, Travel, Love
and Women, are Coward gems like ``London Pride,'' ``Why Do the
Wrong People Travel?,'' ``Mrs. Worthington,'' ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' ``Mad About the Boy'' and ``I'll Follow My Secret
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The three performers, William B. Hubert II, Brendan Powers and
Maggie Runfola, accompanied at the piano by Stephen Vasta, try
earnestly to summon up the panache needed to deliver this bright,
brittle material. But in this context, the importance of being
earnest is that earnestness weighs heavily on these songs. The
Cowardly way through this repertory calls for blithe spirits.
</P>
<P>
   So the plus fours, vested suits, white nautical blazer and, in
the second act, the white tie, tails and a deep blue gown provided
by Geraldine Dusk can carry the cast only to the shores of
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the journey must be propelled from within, and while
the spirit of the three young performers may be willing, the flash
is weak. All too often, insubstantial interpretations result in
renditions without flair, and eventually a certain monotony
pervades the show, devised by Roderick Cook and directed by
Augustine Towey.
</P>
<P>
   While the three principals give evidence of sufficient talent to
suggest that they would be at home playing specific roles in a
musical, none radiates the convincing worldliness, intelligent
insight, mischievous wit and considered affection that a performer
like Steve Ross, currently at the Firebird Cafe, brings to much of
the same Coward repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Coward's songs remain a lighthearted pleasure, but regrettably
``Oh, Coward!'' slogs along when it ought to sparkle. &QL;
</P>
<P>

ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT CHALLENGES HERSELF WITH 12,000-MILE BICYCLE
JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Megan Timothy looks back on her life, there
are no ``if onlys'' or ``I should haves.'' And with a lifetime of
different careers and exploits behind her, at 59, the
Rhodesian-born North Hollywood woman is heading into her biggest
adventure ever: a 10-month, 12,000-mile solo bicycle journey around
Western Europe and part of Africa, equipped with less gear than
most people pack for a weekend at a country inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have adventures in the world anymore,'' the lean,
gray-haired Timothy says with a tinge of wistful sadness in her
voice. ``The world is so small, and there are no challenges left. I
was born in the wrong century. I should have been born in the
1800s, when they still had frontiers. The last frontier is the
outer galaxy, and I don't have enough money to go there. So I'm
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll fly to Paris on Monday to begin a personal odyssey she's
been planning for a year, ever since she felt like Wonder Woman
after pedaling a rented bike 800 miles around France's Loire Valley
_ and then learned that an English schoolteacher had spent the
summer biking 10,000 miles around Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I can do better than that,' and decided I would,''
Timothy said.
</P>
<P>
   She sold her historic, stained glass-filled showpiece of a home
in North Hollywood, her well-worn Honda Civic and nearly all her
possessions and bought a lightweight bicycle with saddlebags to
hold her gear. When she's not riding around the Valley to get in
shape, she's learning to repair her bike in case it malfunctions on
the long trek.
</P>
<P>
   And she's spent the past six months reading guidebooks,
collecting maps and planning a detailed route that'll take her
through France, Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria,
Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Holland,
Belgium, England and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   She'll likely spend her 60th birthday, June 21, in Italy,
reveling in the sights and sounds and smells of somewhere she's
never been before.
</P>
<P>
   With time off to rest up and see the sights along the way,
Timothy figures to end her journey Nov. 3 in Paris, closing the
loop.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the latest adventure for the screenwriter, who's
finishing up one last script before climbing on the plane for
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy is driven by curiosity _ always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is so interesting, that's my problem,''' Timothy
said. ``It's the learning that's exciting. Once I know about it _
or how to do it _ I feel that I'm stagnating. Then there's
something else to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief career as a horsewoman and horse trainer, she left
her African homeland, now called Zimbabwe, for Hollywood in the
early 1960s. Even with an untrained voice, Timothy _ who could play
the guitar _ found work as a folk singer, performing at
coffeehouses and entertaining U.S. troops in Vietnam on USO tours.
</P>
<P>
   After a 14-month stint as a Playboy bunny in Hollywood, Timothy
got fired when she set fire to a patron's beard while trying to
light his cigarette and put the fire out by throwing a glass of
water in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Time for another job, this time as an actress. Timothy had a
number of bit parts and even appeared in the 1969 Elvis Presley
movie ``Charro'' before adventure called.
</P>
<P>
   She and a companion built a raft, lashed airplane wings beneath
it for buoyancy, put the hull of an old travel trailer on top for a
cabin and set off down the Mississippi, braving a hurricane along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The travel ``fix'' worked _ for a while. A decade later,
wanderlust beckoned, and Timothy headed to Brazil because she'd
heard it was a gorgeous country. Joining some other travelers she
met on the plane, they headed off with two native guides on an
unplanned trek through the headhunter country of the Amazon jungle
by canoe, taking quick dips in the river and scrambling out before
flesh-eating piranhas could swim near and sleeping in a hammock to
thwart the fire ants that swarmed over the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, she became fascinated with stained glass and
decided to learn the craft. Eventually she filled her home _ a
historic house built in the 1920s _ with more than 100
stained-glass windows. The house became such a showplace, she
turned its guest houses _ also filled with stained glass _ into a
bed-and-breakfast inn, where she doubled as chef. Expanding her
culinary repertoire, she learned to make fantasy wedding cakes so
elaborate they were featured in Chocolatier and Good Housekeeping
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a stint as a caterer, then a movie
stuntwoman, before she became a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wake up one morning and decide I'm going to do
something,'' she said simply. ``Then I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Timothy woke up one morning and decided to take a nice long
bicycle ride _ through much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But for this adventure, she's made meticulous plans, right down
to what she'll wear, what she'll pack, what she'll eat, where
she'll sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an adventurous person, but I don't think I'm a reckless
person,'' she said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her mother has kept meticulous scrapbooks chronicling her
daughter's many journeys, and she said she's never worried about
her yen for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very self-sufficient sort of person,'' said Helen
Timothy. ``She can take good care of herself ... She knows what she
wants, and she goes for it. And 95 percent of the time, she's
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Timothy radiates competence, she admits she's a bit
frightened as time to begin her journey nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' she said. ``I'm scared of traffic. I can't
compete with 18-wheel trucks, so I'll stay on side roads. I'm
scared of smokers running amok, which they do in Europe (she's a
nonsmoker). I'm worried about someone being so kind to me that they
put a big slab of some poor, dead animal on my plate (she's a
vegetarian). I'm worried about things like being able to get dental
floss in Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects language to be a bit of a problem on her trip but
plans to overcome difficulties with a smile, a handshake and her
own version of charades.
</P>
<P>
   Friends Nancy and Richard Wedeen of North Hollywood, members of
the Los Angeles Wheelmen for 20 years, have helped Timothy prepare
for her trip _ Nancy coaching her in riding techniques and safety,
and Richard teaching her how to do bike repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she'll be ready for anything, any time,'' Nancy said.
``Even if she doesn't have all the skills, she'll learn along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hoffman, owner of North Hollywood's Pedal Shop and
Timothy's outfitter, said her 21-speed bike should carry her
anywhere she wants to go. Most of his customers are male and
decades younger than Timothy, he said, admitting to be amazed by
``the fact that she's a lady _ and just the sheer independence of
her, that she's doing this alone. But it'll be an adventure of a
lifetime for her.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure all goes smoothly, a tiny tool kit, an extra tire,
brake cables and spokes are among her luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a lightweight tent, sleeping bag, water bottle,
bedding, camera and first-aid kit, she'll take only her itinerary
and a few maps.
</P>
<P>
   Her wardrobe will be basically the clothes she has on her back.
In a resealable plastic kitchen bag, she'll carry a change of
underwear, an extra Lycra top, a couple of extra pairs of socks.
She'll do laundry every night so she'll have clean clothes the next
morning. If they're not dry, ... well, the next day will be a wet
ride.
</P>
<P>
   She'll subsist on yogurt, bananas, dried fruit, rice and fresh
vegetables, with an occasional restaurant meal as a luxury. But
most meals will be cooked over a campfire in a stainless-steel
bowl, which will double as a serving dish. That, a Swiss Army
knife, a spoon and a fork are all the utensils she'll take.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ominous challenges in her route will come
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of my trip is going to be pure misery,''
Timothy said. ``I expect it to be cold and rainy all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days into the trip, she'll cross the Spanish border and then
pedal over the snow-covered Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the long journey will be relieved by an occasional
ferry or hydrofoil (a high-speed boat) trip _ from Spain to Morocco
and back, from Italy to Greece, from Bulgaria to Turkey _ and one
short train trek, through Italy's steepest mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Along with learning the routes she'll be traveling, she's had to
learn the rules and customs of the countries she'll visit.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Bulgaria, she must have her visitor's card
stamped by an official every night. If she misses more than two
nights, government agents will start looking for her; when they
find her, they'll throw her out of the country if she's lucky _ or
imprison her if she's not.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the summer, when she'll be pedaling through
Italy (``1,000 miles of sweating and swearing''), Greece, Turkey
and Bulgaria, she plans to be on the road by 5 a.m. With five hours
a day of pedaling, she plans on covering about 50 miles, six days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   She figures the trip will cost about $35 a day, ``which will
take some creativity. But I'll be camping a lot, and that only
costs about $4 a night (at campgrounds with bathing facilities). I
know I'll go over budget in France and Italy the first three weeks,
but it's going to be cold and wet, and I'm going to cuddle up under
some nice down comforter in an inn somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's too cold and wintery once she reaches Belgium, she'll
cut the England/Ireland leg of her journey short and head back to
Paris and home, armed with photographs and memories.
</P>
<P>
   What'll she do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll think about that next year,'' Timothy said with a grin.
``I'll fall out of bed one morning and say, `How about this?' or
`How about that?' and off I'll go.''

INVESTIGATORS SAY TERRORIST NETWORK LINKED TO NORTH TEXAS CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (DUPLICATION WARNING: Story is being filed in ``a'' general and
``i'' international categories)( 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KIMBERLY DURNAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Federal prosecutors are preparing their case
against an international terrorist network that they allege
stretches from East Africa to a mosque in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case against suspects whom officials believe are
responsible for killing more than 200 people in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies Africa on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely connection for the 290,000-population city halfway
between Fort Worth and Dallas began in October with the arrest of
38-year-old Wadih el Hage, who is being held without bail in a
high-security prison in New York City. He is charged with
conspiring with Osama bin Laden to bomb U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage has pleaded not guilty, but he acknowledges that he
worked as personal secretary to bin Laden, the wealthy Islamic
militant whom U.S. prosecutors say ordered the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The few people who would talk about el Hage describe him as a
devout Muslim and family man who wouldn't have participated in
terrorism. Yet the people who are closest to him are reluctant to
talk and have made themselves unavailable to counter the
government's allegations. If convicted, el Hage could get the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Now federal investigators say that a second man from Arlington
is connected with the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   During a pretrial hearing for el Hage, federal prosecutors in
New York connected Moataz Al-Hallak, imam of the Islamic Society of
Arlington mosque, to their case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have records showing that Al-Hallak has been
a longtime contact in the bin Laden organization al Qaeda, which
means ``the base'' in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The link came from el Hage's files found in a bin Laden charity
organization in Kenya. The documents included coded correspondence
that referred to Al-Hallak, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick
Fitzgerald said during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moataz Al-Hallak has served as a contact between members of
the bin Laden organization,'' Fitzgerald said. ``This is a case
about murder and conspiracy to murder, not about religion. The fact
that he is an imam is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these allegations, Al-Hallak referred questions
to a spokesman at the mosque. Messages left at the mosque were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Mosque board member Hassan Shishakly said the imam was not
political with those who worship at the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imam doesn't talk that much,'' Shishakly said. ``He just
encourages us to be pious people. I never heard any speech to go
fight or to do something bad, just to help your family and your
neighbor. That's all we have heard from him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-profile case that brings international intrigue
close to home.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, el Hage and his wife, April Ray, led a quiet
existence in a two-bedroom apartment on Cooper Street near the
University of Texas at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage is a Lebanese immigrant who became a citizen after
marrying Ray, a U.S. citizen. He worked at Lone Star Wheels &AMP; Tires
in Fort Worth, earning $1,600 a month to support his wife and their
seven children. The family worshiped regularly at the mosque on
Center Street in central Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the family members kept to themselves, rarely
coming out of their apartment except to do laundry or take the
children to school or to the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial hearing this month in New York, el Hage's
court-appointed attorney, Bruce McIntyre, asked that his client be
released on bail so he could support his family.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said el Hage is a well-respected member of his
community who serves on the mosque board and on the board of the
mosque's elementary school. He also protested el Hage's limited
contact with his family. He has only been allowed to call home
seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never been charged with any crime of violence,''
McIntyre said during the hearing. ``He has been married to the same
woman for 14 or 15 years now. He has seven children. He is working
in a responsible job as a manager of the store. He is the sole
support for his family. He is active in his community. He has no
reason to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the mosque said el Hage isn't being treated
fairly by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Hage is just a regular person. He's just trying to make a
living,'' Shishakly said. ``It's not fair. He's an American citizen
and should have the right to talk to his family. His wife and kids
need him.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied bail after prosecutors painted a different
picture, one that portrayed el Hage as a key player in bin Laden's
terrorism against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said el Hage acknowledged buying guns in Arizona for
Mahmud Abouhalima but never delivered them. Abouhalima was
convicted in the World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said El Hage lied to the FBI when he said he
traveled across Kenya to Lake Victoria, where hundreds died in a
ferry boat accident, including Abu Ubaidah al Banshiri, who was a
top military commander in al Qaeda. El Hage said he wasn't looking
for Banshiri but for another acquaintance, Adel Habib. Prosecutors
found papers belonging to el Hage that say Adel Habib is an alias
for Banshiri.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing also revealed allegations that el Hage was
intimately associated with Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, whom
prosecutors say is the principal person who organized the bombing
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked for Wadih el Hage, lived with Wadih el Hage, used
his phone, used his car, used his computer,'' Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also say el Hage lied to FBI agents and a grand jury
when he said he did not know Mahamed Sadiq Odeh. But Odeh, who was
also indicted in New York and charged with conspiracy in the
bombing, told the FBI that el Hage attended his wedding in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Hage's role in the organization was to be a front man who
established businesses, to move money, to engage in coded
correspondence, and a particular role of his was to lie,''
Fitzgerald said.

SUTURES LINKED TO BAFFLING HEALTH PROBLEMS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dozens of Americans who had surgery in 1994
developed unusual, debilitating post-operative infections, some
later traced to a rapidly growing bacteria found in dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Because of inaction by federal regulators, the nationwide
outbreak has never been investigated. But the chief suspect in the
stubborn, aggressive infection that caused months or even years of
suffering appears to be the medical sutures used to stitch up
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, according to court documents and U.S. Food
and Drug Administration records, patients got sick after their
surgeons used sutures sold by Ethicon Inc., a manufacturer whose
new, high-tech sterilization system had repeatedly malfunctioned a
few months before. The outbreak has affected about 100 people in
California, Connecticut, Oklahoma and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of lawsuits and reports filed with the FDA, patients
and doctors contended that the illnesses were linked to sutures
contaminated with infectious bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Vigliotti of Orange, Conn., said her illness had struck
with ferocity six weeks after she underwent reconstructive surgery
following a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so sick I was saying a Hail Mary,'' said Vigliotti, who
had to go back into surgery for removal of a breast implant and the
sutures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up from surgery, they had me packed in ice _ my
temperature was up to 106,'' she said. ``One more day and a few
more hours, and I would have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon, a division of Johnson &AMP; Johnson of New Brunswick, N.J.,
has denied in legal documents that the sutures caused any outbreak
of infection.
</P>
<P>
   But federal records show that in September 1994, after prodding
by FDA inspectors, Ethicon issued a recall for 3.6 million packages
of its trademark Vicryl sutures, acknowledging that a new $50
million sterilizer at a San Angelo, Texas, factory had
malfunctioned repeatedly some five months before.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the recall, the FDA issued a warning letter to
Ethicon, faulting the company for continuing to sell sutures to
hospitals after the malfunctions were discovered, and for failing
to conduct a proper investigation of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The specific violations noted in this letter ... may be
symptomatic of serious underlying problems,'' Dallas FDA Director
Douglas C. Payne wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Odenthal, Ethicon's director of communications, said the
sutures processed by the malfunctioning sterilizer had posed a very
low risk to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the company voluntarily decided to recall the
sutures, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient safety was first and foremost our objective'' in all
the company's actions, she said. ``The fact that we initiated this
whole recall speaks to our interest in patient safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the infection outbreak shows the haphazard way in
which investigations into public health problems like the outbreak
are begun, and the cloak of secrecy that can be draped over a
medical problem because of the threat of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta are
superbly equipped to unravel medical mysteries, and in 1981 the CDC
launched a massive investigation, including DNA testing, to find
the source of a similar infection outbreak that affected only six
patients in a single hospital in Texas, medical journals show.
</P>
<P>
   But the CDC has never investigated the cause of the larger 1994
outbreak nor sought to track down its victims, said Dr. Teresa
Smith, a CDC epidemiologist. The CDC has no power to investigate an
incident unless invited by another agency and no invitation ever
came, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the FDA made no move to call in the CDC because it
thought the sutures posed only a ``low or moderate'' risk to the
public, FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snider said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way the system ought to work, said Dr. Richard
Wenzel of the Medical College of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you identify a problem that has even potential for harm,
you should take a very active, proactive approach to it,'' said
Wenzel, a specialist in hospital-acquired infections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lawyers for infection victims contend that Ethicon
sought to keep the extent of the suture problem a secret and
resisted identifying potential victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon denies seeking to keep the lid on the infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that we were very responsive and cooperative
in all those legal proceedings,'' Odenthal said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some infection victims said they had learned of the suture
problems only by happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is quite likely that of those bazillions that went
out, those millions of packages, that many people got infections,''
said Philip Minter, the lawyer for Robert Beverage, a Mountain
View, Calif., man who said he had suffered from uncontrollable
infections after a shoulder operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon is a $1.2 billion medical powerhouse that dominates the
sutures market in the United States. Founded after World War II by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Ethicon sells more than 80 percent of the
sutures used by physicians, dentists and veterinarians to bind up
surgical incisions and stitch wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The company's trademark Vicryl is a strong synthetic that
dissolves as a wound heals, eliminating the need for a doctor to
remove stitches after an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon makes suture components at plants in Georgia and Puerto
Rico. Needles are attached and packets assembled at an
1,800-employee factory in the west Texas town of San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   A new sterilization system developed problems in early 1994. At
first, the sterilizer seemed to work _ lab tests on sample lots
showed that the Vicryl sutures were free of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records and a report written by an Ethicon
scientist, the new system may have begun to fail as early as March
8. On April 2, according to scientist John Paulson's report, the
company found evidence of what it called an ``aseptic break'' _ a
breach of sterile conditions. Later lab tests indicated
intermittent failures.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Paulson wrote, Ethicon salvaged sutures from runs
where samples showed evidence of contamination. The company said it
resterilized them and shipped them to customers.
</P>
<P>
   When tests continued to show some sutures contaminated with
bacteria that included a form of staphylococcus, Ethicon couldn't
figure out why, Paulson later testified. And so, on May 23, it shut
the new sterilizer system down and resumed use of the older one.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethicon made no move to recall any of the sutures it had
sold. Nor did it warn its customers about the problems or potential
health risks to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied that it recklessly endangered surgical
patients. A recall wasn't necessary, Paulson later wrote to one
doctor who complained. The failures had been infrequent, and the
contamination was so slight that there was little chance anyone
would get sick.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he wrote, ``because surgical patients are always
monitored for signs of wound infection, we knew safeguards were in
place to protect the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon began to change its mind about the need for a recall in
late July, when an FDA inspection team toured the Texas plant and
discovered that the new sterilizers had been shut down. The FDA
investigated, and on Aug. 17 it issued a warning letter to Ethicon,
charging that the company had violated federal safety rules by
continuing to ship Vicryl sutures after the malfunctions began.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the FDA threatened the company with ``seizure,
injunction and/or civil penalties'' if it did not correct the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 6, Ethicon issued a recall of about 3.6 million packets
of Vicryl sutures that had been run through the new system five
months before. But in its recall notice, Ethicon said the sutures
posed only a ``remote possibility of serious health consequences.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Laila Ali went to her father's Beverly Hills hotel
suite three weeks ago to get his blessing. She had decided she
wanted to box, to follow in his footsteps and perhaps one day earn
some six-figure purses. But Ms. Ali, 21 years old and her hands
already bearing the scars from her early work in the ring, did not
know how to begin, and so she sat down across from her famous
father and just blurted it out in one long stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Daddy,'' she said, recalling her conversation with her
father, ``I want to tell you I'm going into professional boxing,
and I love you, and I want your support, and I want to tell you
that even if I don't have your support, I'm going to do it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali, his face an expressionless mask as the result of
Parkinson's disease, dropped his head and paused. ``But I don't
want you to get hurt,'' Ms. Ali said her father told her, his voice
barely above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, I'm not going to get hurt,'' she reassured her father.
``I'm going to be fighting women, not men. And I have your
genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali laughed. Then, he asked his youngest daughter among nine
children to stand up and show him her best pre-fight stare-down. He
told her to keep her hands up, and the two, father and daughter,
reluctant tutor and aspiring protege, pretended to throw jabs at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be like Dad's son that he never had, and I don't
mean to sound rude,'' said Laila Ali, whose older brother has shown
no inclination to fight. ``I'm the only one who can do it. I've
always been a big healthy girl. I've always been aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's professional boxing is a sport struggling for stature.
While the number of women in boxing have increased greatly in
recent years, with women fighting in gyms across the country and
even on the undercards of some major prize fights, female
professional boxing is desperate for true stars but also concerned
that it not be turned into just a sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   And so the prospect of Laila Ali, a woman with a marketable name
and no proven skills, turning pro has infused the sport with a
sense of both promise and worry. If she is good, she could be a
godsend. If she is not, she could be a setback, perceived as the
product of a cynical stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing talent, after all, is not a surefire inherited trait, and
because Ms. Ali has yet to throw her first professional punch, it
is impossible for anybody to say with confidence whether she will
be a star or a flop. The records of sons following famous fathers
into the ring is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is well aware of Laila, and everybody is waiting to
see what she is going to do,'' said Jackie Kallen, the former
commissioner of the International Female Boxing Association and now
the director of female boxing for Magic Johnson Productions. ``She
has the looks, the background, and if she has the skills, she will
be the whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Laila's earning potential is going to be better than another
girl who just takes up the sport, because of who her father is,''
Ms. Kallen added. ``The marketing factor alone is going to set her
apart from everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ali, who does not yet have a promoter, does not apologize
about her potential advantage in appeal, and she is as interested
in the possible paydays her career may bring as in continuing her
father's legacy. That said, no one appears to begrudge Ms. Ali any
career jump-start she might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Martin, the top female boxer in the game, said Ms. Ali
could be a great bonus for the sport. Ms. Martin earns $100,000 to
$150,000 a bout, while female boxers at the start of their career
typically make about $200 a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she has to use her father's name, that's absolutely fine,''
Ms. Martin said. ``If you have a break, use it to its fullest. I'm
not going to be envious or jealous of anyone who uses what they
have to make it in the sport. She is Muhammad Ali's daughter, and
that's fine. If it were Muhammad Ali's son, he'd get the same
breaks as she would.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at some point, she's got to prove that she can fight,''
Ms. Martin said. ``People are really going to be waiting to see
that. It won't last long if she can't fight. It won't take many
fights, may be two or three, before people turn away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 inches tall and 160 pounds, Laila Ali is
statuesque. She can be both petulant and playful, but there is no
hint of insincerity in her expressive eyes. If her boxing is a
publicity stunt, she is going to great lengths to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes to the gym every night like clockwork,'' said
Richard Allen, the owner of the L.A. Boxing Gym where the
lightweight world champion, Shane Mosley, works out. ``She really
works hard. She wants to learn. And she's not a prima donna.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group of kick boxers smacked a row of heavy bags with their
feet, and other boxers, men and women, jumped rope and pounded the
speed bags, Ms. Ali sat in a corner of the expansive, two-story
L.A. Boxing Gym in downtown Los Angeles recently and talked about
her decision. For the past five months she has been coming here.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Ms. Ali's biggest opponent is a heavy bag, and she
admits she is a neophyte. She said she wants to box because it is
in her blood and she believes she has a natural appetite and
ability. Her trainer, Kevin Morgan, agrees. He thinks Ms. Ali, who
runs a beauty salon as her day job, will be ready for her first
professional bout in about six months. Her training until then will
include sparring and perhaps some simulated fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started out, we sparred,'' Morgan said. ``I
wanted to see what she was going to do when she got hit. If she
turned her back when she was hit, there wasn't anything I could do
with her. She turned, but then she came back with a punch. She's
fast, and she hits hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Laila Ali is one of two daughters Muhammad Ali had with his
second wife, Veronica. The two divorced when Laila was 7. She never
saw her father box in person, and she said she has few memories of
living under the same roof with him.
</P>
<P>
   But by boxing, Ms. Ali believes her father will gain a greater
appreciation for her as his child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's naturally going to see himself in me,'' she said. ``I'm a
lot like my mother and a lot like my father. But for the first
time, I think he actually can see that this is my child.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Her determination to fight with or without his approval, she
said, only underscored that sense of recognition on her father's
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad never listened to anybody,'' she said with a smile, ``so
what can he say?''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, her father's approval is grudging, at best.
</P>
<P>
   A long-time friend of Muhammad Ali, who refused to be
identified, said he had once asked Ali what he would do if his
oldest son, Ibin Muhammad, who is now 25, wanted to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said first he would try everything he could to talk him out
of it and then he'd do everything he could to help him,'' the
friend said. ``I would think he's probably on that first stage with
Laila right now. He probably wants to see how she's going to look
in her first couple of bouts.''
</P>
<P>
   The friend also said that as of two years ago Ali had opposed
female boxing because it went against his Muslim beliefs. Ali also
was not keen on the decision of another daughter, Miriam, to be a
standup comedian. Lonnie Ali, the former champion's wife, said the
elder Ali had no comment on Laila's decision to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read anything into that,'' Lonnie Ali said of her
husband's lack of public comment. ``This is something that Laila
wants to do. It has nothing to do with Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laila Ali said her father, while alarmed, was still allied
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that it was a dirty business,'' Ms. Ali said. ``He
let me know it's a hard business, and he let me know that he
supported me. That was my main concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ali said that she and her sister, Hana, grew up in Malibu,
Calif., with their mother but that she was always trying to escape
her neighborhood's comforts. She said she had several street fights
growing up, mainly after venturing into tougher neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those kids who was trying to get into the ghetto
when everyone else was trying to get out, because I wanted to
experience the other side,'' she said. ``When people find out
you're Muhammad Ali's daughter, they try to take advantage of you.
I never backed down from a fight. It's just natural for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is convinced, then, that she can at least take a punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that I can get my eyes busted and my nose broken
no matter who I'm fighting,'' she said. ``Hopefully, it won't
happen. But if it does, it's just boxing. And if it bothers me that
much, I can get plastic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of pain, then, does not deter her, nor does her
father's physical condition. While Ali has Parkinson's disease,
which has reduced his speech to a whisper and has given him
tremors, his daughter is convinced there is a direct link from his
fight career to his physical limitations. But she said she had no
intention of taking as much punishment as her father took.
</P>
<P>
   Much remains to be seen. Bridgett Riley, a featherweight whose
record is 7 wins and 2 losses with 7 knockouts and who expects to
fight on the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis card at Madison Square
Garden on March 13, works out in the same gym as Ms. Ali. Riley has
met Ms. Ali, but because they come to the gym at different times,
she has never seen Ms. Ali work out. But she worries about the
sport's standing, and hopes nothing, including Ms. Ali's fledgling
career, contributes to the sense that the sport is a circus act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already under a microscope,'' Riley said. ``People are
sitting back, waiting to pick us off. Hopefully, she's good. I
really hope she can fight and she can be taken serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Laila Ali believes that is a fair enough challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think I'm just trying to use my father's name,''
she said. ``That's why I'm going to let it all be seen when I get
in the ring. Right now it's just hype, because people don't know
whether I can box or not. But when I get into the ring, it's really
going to be a lot of hype when I'm knocking people out.''

HANDS OFF MEDICARE, AMERICANS SAY IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Congress poised to overhaul Medicare, Americans say they
generally like the national health insurance program for the
elderly and disabled, flawed though it may be, according to a study
jointly released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the
League of Women Voters.
</P>
<P>
   The message to Washington: tread carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Like Social Security, Medicare enjoys strong positive feelings
among Americans who see the program as a safety net for the
nation's 39 million elderly and disabled, according to the study.
The report included findings from focus groups held in July in nine
US cities, and discussions with 6,500 Americans in town hall-style
meetings in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study shows that people across generations, gender and
race really like and value Medicare,'' said Patricia Neuman, senior
policy analyst with Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Americans understand that Medicare is in desperate need
of fiscal and programmatic changes if it is to remain robust in the
coming decades as soaring medical costs threaten to thrust the
program into insolvency as early as 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Washington lawmakers say they are set to tackle the problem this
year and have set up a 17-member bipartisan commission to recommend
sweeping changes to fix Medicare. The commission is expected to
present its report to Congress by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kaiser and the League of Women Voters say they are
seeking to inject grass roots voices into the debate with their
report. Among the problems perceived by people interviewed :
excessive fraud and abuse by health care providers who receive over
$200 billion a year from Medicare and inefficient management of
program resources.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what they believed was wrong with Medicare, 48
percent of the 3,700 who responded to a questionnaire cited the
lack of prescription drug coverage, while 45 percent said fraud and
abuse by doctors and hospitals, and 29 percent said poor management
by the government. Respondents were allowed to cite more than one
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, were deeply ambivalent over how to resolve
the problems. While many supported expanded coverage for such
things as nursing homes, far fewer wanted to raise premiums or
taxes to pay for the added benefits. And while Americans believe
doctors and hospitals are overpaid, they worry that cutting
reimbursements could hurt the quality of and access to health care.
Americans were also divided over whether it was better to raise the
eligibility age from 65 to 67 years to save money, or whether to
lower the age to 62 in order to increase access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   One theme appeared to be consistent in the report: people want
Medicare to cover prescription drugs, even if it means paying more.
The finding is notable given that previous polls have indicated
that support for added benefits tends to melt when respondents are
confronted with the question of how to pay for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more aware of the burden of prescription
spending,'' said Neuman. ``As medications become a more common form
of medical treatment and people pay more out of pocket, this issue
will become more prominent.''

JUSTICES EXAMINE DECISION TO IMPOSE DEATH PENALTY IN TEXAS CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A public defender Monday urged the Supreme Court to
spare the life of a Texas murderer, arguing that the judge and jury
who condemned the man acted unconstitutionally in sentencing him to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Crooks, an assistant federal public defender in Fort
Worth, told the high court that U.S. District Judge Sam R. Cummings
of Lubbock should have told the jurors that Louis Jones Jr. would
be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole if
they failed to vote unanimously for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, believing that Jones could be paroled in a matter of
years, voted to condemn him for the 1995 beating death of Air Force
Pvt. Tracie Joy McBride, Crooks argued. The attorney told the
justices he had affidavits from two jurors saying they would have
spared Jones' life if the judge had said life in prison without
parole was the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was tried in federal court because the killing fell under
the federal kidnapping statute. In Texas courts, jurors do not have
the option of sentencing a defendant to life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Jones guilty of capital murder for kidnapping
McBride from a laundry room on the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San
Angelo, taking her to a remote location, beating her over the head
with a tire iron and leaving her body under a bridge in February
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In handing down its sentence in November 1995, the jury
considered the 19-year-old victim's youth, small size,
unfamiliarity with San Angelo and effect of her death on her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Crooks argued that this personal information about the victim
was ``vague'' and not relevant for the 12-member jury to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, pressing the high
court to uphold the death sentence, said the judge was under no
obligation to tell jurors that Jones would remain in prison for the
rest of his life if they did not sentence him to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lawyer also said the jury's consideration
of McBride's physical, emotional and familial characteristics was a
``harmless error'' and that the panel would have sentenced Jones to
death anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, which is expected to render its decision by
July, appeared to be just as divided as the lawyers. Several
justices questioned whether the judge's instruction had any effect
on the jury and if the jurors were swayed by McBride's youth, small
size, naivete and family.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to Crooks' argument on the jury instruction, Justice
Stephen G. Breyer said requiring judges to give complete
information to juries regarding sentencing might result in more
death penalties. If jurors know that a judge generally has wide
discretion in sentencing when a jury is deadlocked, they might feel
compelled to vote unanimously for death, lest the judge render a
relatively light punishment, Breyer added.
</P>
<P>
   But Crooks argued that judges have an obligation to tell jurors
all their sentencing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full disclosure of accurate information cannot be a bad thing
in death-penalty cases,'' Crooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the impact of a
victim's death on family members should be a special factor for
juries to consider in sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every victim is going to have a family,'' Ginsburg said,
noting that there are exceptions. ``Every victim is going to have a
personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter said ``you are really putting a thumb on
the scale'' in favor of the death penalty when the government
introduces emotional testimony from family members at the
sentencing phase.
</P>
<P>
   But Dreeben responded that the views of family members are
relevant in criminal cases. ``His crime caused harm, and this is
the harm that it caused,'' the attorney said.

TEARS, AND MORE, FROM LEWINSKY

<P>
   Yes, Monica Lewinsky does shed tears in her interview with
Barbara Walters, as countless other newsmakers and celebrities have
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But Walters maintained Monday that Lewinsky travels the full
gamut of emotions during her first television interview, reliving
her relationship with President Clinton and the year of scandal
that followed in a conversation that Walters claimed has ``a sense
of history about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is opening up two hours of prime time for the interview on
March 3, hoping for blockbuster ratings on the last day of the
``sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when she is emotional, and where she, I think,
is teary,'' Walters said Monday during a telephone conference with
TV writers. ``This is not a sobbing interview; this is not an
interview in which every 10 minutes she's crying. But this is very
painful material for her.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Lewinsky talk about? According to Walters, the
former White House intern describes ``her torment, her terrible
fright'' at being the center of a sex scandal that became worldwide
news, and at being the object of ``endless ridicule.'' Walters said
Lewinsky describes her past and present feelings about President
Clinton, offering ``some insights into him you may not have heard
before.'' (Walters said Lewinsky answered her question on whether
she is still in love with Clinton, but declined to say what that
answer was.) Lewinsky also gives her opinions of Hillary Clinton
and independent prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr, though again Walters
declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   And though Walters said it is ``not a prurient interview,''
Lewinsky does discuss the infamous blue dress in response to a
question that, according to Walters, was prompted by e-mailed
queries from viewers of her morning talk show, ``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand the history of the relationship really from day
one, the day of that famous thong,'' said Walters. ``You see the
president in a way that I'm not sure you have been able to see him
before, because she has not characterized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand the role of her mother; you understand how she
feels about Ken Starr,'' she added. ``And you understand what she
went through this past year more graphically. The emotions of this
past year, from the time she finds out she is on that list, are
simply staggering.''
   Throughout the one-hour conference Monday, Walters treaded
carefully the thin line between hype and full disclosure. She did
say, however, that she was surprised by Lewinsky's admission that
the most painful question grand jurors asked her was why she had
become involved with married men.
</P>
<P>
   Walters conceded that she wasn't always able to keep her
incredulity at bay as the 24-year-old told the tale of her
dalliance with the president. ``There were times when I would say,
`But Monica, how could you?' '' said Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Walters's interview with Lewinsky took place on Saturday, amid
much secrecy, in the same New York studio where ``20/20'' is taped.
The two-hour interview will air March 3 from 9 to 11 p.m. as a
``special edition'' of ``20/20 Wednesday.'' ABC News president
David Westin said that, under an agreement with Lewinsky, the
interview will air only once, though he said excerpts may be used
on ABC newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   The interview had been delayed because Lewinsky's immunity
agreement with Starr prohibited her from talking publicly about her
affair with Clinton until Starr gave the green light. Even when he
did so after Clinton's impeachment trial ended in acquittal, Starr
insisted on certain conditions: that Lewinsky have an attorney
present during the interview, that she not contradict the evidence
she gave to the grand jury, that she not, in Westin's words,
``characterize the conduct'' of Starr's office. That prohibited
Walters from asking questions about last Jan. 16, the day Starr's
lawyers first questioned Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that, in her quest for a new image or
bestsellerdom, Lewinsky has chosen to tell her story first to
Walters, the one TV personality who gives her the best shot at
attaining both goals.
</P>
<P>
   A weepy, confessional interview with Walters has become
virtually de rigueur for celebrities bent on redemption or
newsmakers intent on spin control. Spilling the beans to Walters _
whose subjects include Fidel Castro, Anwar Sadat, Colin Powell, and
innumerable movie stars _ has a cachet Lewinsky could not have
achieved by accepting the offers she got from Roseanne and Oprah
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt the most important thing for the rest of her life was
to establish credibility, and she felt she could do it with ABC and
me,'' said Walters.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Walters will kick off the marketing of
Monica, an effort that will gather steam on March 4, when a book
written by Andrew Morton (with Lewinsky's cooperation) will be
published and a British TV interview of her will air. Westin said
ABC's deal with Lewinsky stipulated that the network's interview
would precede the book and the British interview.
</P>
<P>
   Walters declined to say whether she would have been interested
in an interview with Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who says
that Clinton sexually assaulted her 21 years ago, and who has
reportedly been interviewed by NBC. Westin said an interview with
Broaddrick was ``raised as a possibility'' for ABC News, but ``we
declined.'' ``It's a very difficult subject, it's inflammatory
potentially, it is more than 20 years old, and there have been
conflicting reports about it from the parties involved,'' said
Westin.
</P>
<P>
   Though she insisted the Lewinsky interview was not ``a puff
piece,'' Walters is clearly sympathetic to Lewinsky. ``She is open,
she is expressive, she is sometimes very touching,'' she said,
conceding that ``sometimes, when she describes herself, you realize
she can be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she believes the interview ``puts an exclamation
point, finally, to this year'' of scandal, though she made one
exception. ``Unless the president sits down and does the same
interview, and we'd be happy to do that,'' she said.

PROTECTING THE BEAUTY THAT SURROUNDS US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hidden in valleys, ravines and small canyons
throughout the San Francisco Bay area are dozens of little creeks,
all of them riparian watersheds that once created a paradise for
fish, birds and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The first explorers from Russia, France and Spain described this
paradise in their diaries, unearthed by historian Malcolm Margolin,
describing the abundance in fantasy-like portrayals:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not any country in the world which more abounds in
and game of every description,'' wrote French sea captain Jean Le
Perouse. Geese and ducks ``rise in a dense cloud with a noise like
that of a hurricane. (The land has) inexpressible fertility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have seen game in such abundance,'' wrote Russian
explorer Otto von Kotebue. ``There is a superfluity of game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the paradise were the streams and wetlands,
which provided habitat for beavers and otters, steelhead and
salmon, bobcat, mountain lions and wolves, quail, ducks and geese,
grizzly bears, elk and antelope.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's almost all gone.
</P>
<P>
   Most all of the streams have had their freshwater flows diverted
or channeled, polluted or trashed, with many turned into
near-lifeless trickles. What's left in the region are islands of
habitat at the 125 parks in the foothills, protected greenbelt and
man-made reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a chance that in the coming years at least a small
resemblance of that former paradise can be reclaimed. Small groups
of volunteers are working to restore several of the streams in the
Bay area that once defined the abundance of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The streams with restoration programs and volunteer groups
include, north to south: Adobe Creek in Petaluma, Napa River in
Napa, Lagunitas Creek in Fairfax, Wildcat Creek in the Richmond
hills, Redwood Creek in the Oakland hills, Alameda Creek in Niles
Canyon, San Francisquito Creek in Palo Alto, Pescadero Creek on the
San Mateo County coast, San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz and Carmel
River near Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   How does a stream get destroyed? A classic example is in Marin
County, a region known for environmental awareness, where Lagunitas
Creek has been pillaged for its water to support urban growth and
mega-money real estate deals, regardless of the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lagunitas Creek, also called Papermill Creek by some, starts as
a trickle on the north flank of Mount Tamalpais, then runs its way
through canyons and valleys for roughly 25 river miles to Tomales
Bay, picking up additional flow from dozens of small feeder creeks.
It was once the crown jewel of coastal streams, with bigger coho
(silver) salmon and steelhead than anywhere else in California: The
state record coho, 22 pounds, was caught here in 1959, and the
largest steelhead ever documented in the state, 30 pounds, was
caught here in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Now the coho are nearly extinct on Lagunitas Creek and the
steelhead are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Where did the fish go? It started when four dams
were built, creating Lagunitas Lake, Bon Tempe Lake, Alpine Lake
and Kent Lake, in addition to seasonal dams placed during summer to
divert water for private ranches. Suddenly the steelhead and salmon
were blocked from their spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The water was then diverted to support dense urban growth in a
chain of towns that are virtually connected as one, Sausalito,
Marin City, Corte Madera, Mill Valley, Larkspur, Ross, San Anselmo,
Fairfax, San Rafael and others.
</P>
<P>
   As mitigation, the public gets access to the watershed lands for
hiking and biking. But even though there are now eight lakes in the
area, no boating of any kind is permitted at any of them, not even
floating around in a raft, an unbelievable rip-off, and there are
no fishery programs in place either, another rip-off, save for the
Department of Fish and Game dumping some dinker-size planter trout
in a few times a year in Bon Tempe, Phoenix and Lagunitas.
</P>
<P>
   How do you like the tradeoff for ruining the best steelhead
stream in the state? Lagunitas Creek is but one affidavit of the
nightmare that has occurred throughout the Bay area, area by area,
stream to stream.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you know somebody with a time machine, the clock cannot
be turned back, but conditions can be made a lot better if people
support preservation efforts and groups like the Greenbelt
Alliance, which seeks to protect open space.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is growth that allows officials to trade off open
space, streams, lakes and wildlife resources without conscience to
the damage.

SUPREME COURT HEARS FIRST CASE UNDER FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La., Okla, Calif., Nev., Va.) (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hearing its first case under the 1994 federal Death
Penalty Act, the Supreme Court on Monday began the process of
interpreting and applying the law that extended the death penalty
to more than 40 federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutionality of the law was not at issue in the appeal
by a retired Army Ranger, convicted and sentenced to death in 1995
for kidnapping a 19-year-old private from an Air Force base in
Texas and murdering her at his nearby home. But it was evident that
the justices found aspects of the statute confusing and
troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal dealt with two aspects of the case: whether the jury
received adequate instruction on procedures for arriving at its
sentence, and whether it was an error for the government, in the
sentencing phase of the trial, to introduce evidence of the
victim's youth, other personal characteristics and the impact of
the murder on her family.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding the death sentence for the retired Ranger, Louis
Jones Jr., the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, in New Orleans,
ruled last year that this evidence should not have been admitted,
but that the error was ``harmless'' in that the jury would have
sentenced Jones to death even without the sympathetic testimony
about his victim, Tracie Joy McBride.
</P>
<P>
   While the case is unlikely to produce a sweeping ruling, the
argument Monday marked the start of what is likely to be a long,
case-by-case process by which the court resolves the statute's
ambiguities and instructs the lower federal courts, which have gone
a generation without confronting a general federal death penalty,
on how the law should be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The last federal execution was in 1963, and it has been 50 years
since the court decided a federal death penalty case. The cases in
the 1970s by which the justices established the current
constitutional framework for capital punishment all dealt with
state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people have been sentenced to death under the 1994 law,
including Timothy J. McVeigh, who was convicted of murder and
conspiracy in the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City
in 1995 that killed 168 people. McVeigh is on death row for killing
eight federal law enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
   Five additional federal death row inmates were sentenced under a
narrower 1988 law, which authorized the death penalty for so-called
drug kingpins. Prosecutions are now under way in 154 cases that
could lead to imposition of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   One death penalty expert who has studied the new law, Professor
Rory K. Little of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, said in
an interview Monday that the case before the court was ``a
message-sending case for the broad question of how the law will be
administered.'' He said the justices were likely to want to set
clear guidelines for the lower courts in this case, Jones vs. U.S.,
No. 97-9361, so that the court could avoid a flood of federal death
penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious ambiguity that was unresolved by the argument Monday
is what happens if the jury cannot agree on a sentence with the
unanimity that the law requires. The statute says that if the jury
can agree on neither a death sentence nor on life without parole,
the judge will determine ``some other lesser sentence'' as the law
permits. But for a kidnapping that results in murder, as in this
case, the law permits no other option; following a conviction, life
without parole is the minimum sentence allowable.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing phase of Jones' trial, the judge refused a
defense request to instruct the jury that if they could not agree
on a sentence, the judge would impose a sentence of life without
parole. In the absence of such an instruction, the defense
maintained, the jury might have the misimpression that a deadlock
could open the door to the defendant's eventual release, and thus
might drive wavering jurors to eliminate that prospect by voting
for a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At the argument Monday, some justices questioned that
assumption. Might not a split jury avoid that outcome by simply
agreeing on life without parole? Justice Antonin Scalia asked
Timothy Crooks, a federal public defender from Fort Worth who
represented Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Crooks replied that in such a case, the jury deliberations
become ``a game of chicken,'' where ``those most stubborn will
prevail.'' The randomness of such an outcome is what the court's
modern death penalty cases have sought to avoid, he said, adding
that in any event, ``full disclosure in a sentencing hearing cannot
be a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general representing the
government, said the jury instruction proposed by the defense had
been properly excluded. He described the instruction as ``an open
invitation to any individual member of the jury to hang the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Dreeben said, the government took the position that
a deadlocked sentencing jury did not necessarily result in the
judge making the sentencing decision. Rather, the prosecutor could
request a new jury at this phase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After several justices questioned the basis for the government's
view, Dreeben acknowledged that the law was unclear and to some
extent internally contradictory on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The government's position that the evidence of the victim's
personal qualities was properly introduced as a sentencing
consideration also drew fire from the court because at an earlier
phase of the case, the government had appeared to concede that the
evidence was invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The court met Monday for the first time since the end of the
Senate impeachment trial 10 days ago, an event to which Chief
Justice William Rehnquist made no allusion as he began the
morning's proceedings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The following were among other developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ Without comment, the court refused to hear a challenge to a
1997 Virginia law that requires girls under 18 to inform at least
one parent before obtaining an abortion. Among several issues in
the case, Planned Parenthood vs. Camblos, No. 98-984, the
challengers attacked the adequacy of provisions for a girl to go
before a judge and obtain a waiver of the notice requirement. The
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, upheld the law last
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accepting an appeal from a convicted murderer in Nevada, the
court agreed to decide whether a state inmate forfeits the right to
be heard by a federal judge on constitutional issues that were not
included in an initial, abandoned, petition for a writ of habeas
corpus. Antonio Slack, convicted of committing a murder when he was
19, withdrew his first petition to pursue an appeal in the Nevada
courts, and then sought, this time with the help of an appointed
lawyer, to file a new, more complete petition. But the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, barred the additional
issues. The case is Slack vs. McDaniel, No. 98-6322.

EXPERTS SAY NEW APPROACH REDUCES WOMEN'S DEATH RATES FROM CERVICAL
CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By DENISE GRADY 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cancer experts are recommending a major change in the treatment
of advanced cervical cancer, urging that chemotherapy be added to
the standard treatment: radiation. The recommendation is based on
five new studies showing that the combination reduces death rates
from the disease by 30 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute announced the
findings on Monday and said they were mailing the new
recommendation to 20,000 cancer specialists worldwide in a
``clinical announcement,'' only the fourth such notification in the
past 10 years. Such announcements are used to alert doctors to
important advances in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The five new studies will not be published in medical journals
until later this year, but the journal editors agreed it was
imperative to release the information early so that it could be
used to help patients now being treated. The New England Journal of
Medicine, which will publish three of the papers in April, has
already posted them on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings apply to women with cancers classified as
``locally advanced'' or ``invasive,'' meaning that the tumor on the
cervix is large or has spread to nearby lymph nodes or other parts
of the pelvis. About 25 percent of women with cervical cancer in
the United States fall into that category. An estimated 12,800 new
cases of the disease are expected in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation for combined treatment does not apply to
women with earlier stages of the disease, who do not need such
aggressive therapy, or to women with cancer that has spread beyond
the pelvis, who are considered unlikely to benefit. They also do
not apply to women who have already completed a course of radiation
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first substantive change in the treatment of
advanced cancer of the cervix in 40 years,'' said Dr. Mitchell
Morris, who studied the combination treatment at the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Trimble, head of the surgery section at the cancer
therapy evaluation program at the National Cancer Institute, said:
``We think that based on these data the standard of care should
change. These are modalities available in every hospital treating
women with cervical cancer and should be adopted into clinical
practice immediately.'' He said he expected the combination
treatment to save thousands of lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among women aged 35 to 54, cervical cancer is the fifth leading
cause of death from cancer, after tumors of the breast, lung, colon
and rectum and ovary. The overall number of deaths in the United
States, 4,800, though small in comparison to the 47,000 deaths from
breast cancer, is excessive nonetheless, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Pap smears could detect more than 90 percent of the cases early,
when cure rates are high. About 50 million Pap tests are done in
the United States every year, but a 1994 survey showed that 20
percent of women ages 18 to 64 years had not been tested in the
past three years. A disproportionate number of the women who go
untested and wind up with advanced cases of cervical cancer are
older, uninsured, members of ethnic minority groups or poor.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, cervical cancer is a greater problem than in
the United States. Worldwide, it is the second most common cancer
among women, with 500,000 new cases a year. In Africa, Asia and
South America, it is the most common cancer in women.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, standard treatment for locally advanced cervical
cancer included only surgery and radiation, not chemotherapy. Dr.
Peter Rose, an author of one of the new studies and director of
gynecologic oncology at the University Hospitals of Cleveland-Case
Western Reserve University School of Medicine, said that research
tended to emphasize radiation because, unlike many other parts of
the body, the cervix can be bombarded with high doses of radiation
with little damage to other organs. That approach, Rose said, made
progress against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still didn't cure patients all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies, involving 1,912 patients, at different medical
centers around the United States, showed that the key to success
lies in giving chemotherapy and radiation at the same time. The
drugs that improved survival rates were cisplatin and 5-FU, or
5-fluorouracil.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said researchers think the combined treatment works
better than radiation alone because the drugs make cancer cells
more vulnerable to the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``When radiation hits a cancer cell, it damages
the DNA in that cell and can prevent it from dividing or
replicating. But cancer cells have a remarkable ability to repair
their DNA in order to begin dividing again. Radiation sensitizers
like these drugs attach to the DNA and prevent the DNA from
repairing itself. The cell can't fix the damage from the radiation,
and it dies.''
</P>
<P>
   In three of the studies, women were assigned at random to groups
that received either radiation alone or radiation plus chemotherapy
with cisplatin alone or cisplatin and 5-FU. In all three, after
about three years of follow-up, survival rates were higher in the
women who received chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the other two studies, all the women were given both
radiation and chemotherapy, but some were given cisplatin, and
others a different drug, hydroxyurea. Those who got cisplatin did
better.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said that independent safety committees set up by the
cancer institute to monitor experiments alerted the institute when
important differences in survival became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer specialists have already begun using the information. At
the University Hospitals of Cleveland, the treatment was offered
last fall to Bethany Brogan, a 29-year-old woman with invasive
cervical cancer. Mrs. Brogan, who has three young children, was not
in a study, but she was being treated by Rose, who already knew of
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind there was absolutely no option,'' Mrs. Brogan said.
``With three children, just starting my life, I wanted the most
aggressive treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She completed six weeks of therapy last December. ``At that
point they said everything looked very good,'' she said, adding
that although the treatment does not cause hair loss, like other
cancer therapies, it does cause fatigue and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble said that ultimately the best solution would be to
prevent the disease, by developing a vaccine against a virus called
the human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted infection that
causes more than 95 percent of cases. Research to develop a vaccine
is under way, he said.

SENATE'S CHIEF BUDGET NEGOTIATOR ASSAILS CLINTON PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's chief budget negotiator Monday
dismissed President Clinton's plan to use budget surpluses to help
preserve Social Security as an accounting gimmick that would do
little to shore up the program and rob Americans of much-deserved
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon with reporters, Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici said the president's plan to funnel surplus money
into the Social Security Trust Fund and then invest it in
government bonds would simply fill the program's coffers with
``IOUs'' that would eventually have to be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a blueprint for ``borrowing our way right into
solvency.'' When coupled with the new spending increases outlined
in Clinton's 2000 budget, the New Mexico Republican said it would
leave almost no room for major tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody advising the president is scared to death that there
might be a real surplus left over that could be used to cut
taxes,'' Domenici said. ``I would say the president has gone
through huge hoops to avoid leaving any money around for tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Republicans have staked out Social Security as a
major legislative battleground for this year. While both sides
advocate using some of the surplus to help extend the retirement
program well into the next century, they disagree over how best to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides disagree on whether to allow investments in the
stock market and on whether to use a large portion of the surplus
to help pay for tax cuts, which Domenici said would be a priority
for Republicans in budget negotiations with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that some estimates show a budget surplus over the next
10 years of about $787 billion, Domenici said the black ink
``represents a rare opportunity for some kind of tax reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he favors phased-in, ``across-the-board tax cuts'' that
could amount to 10 percent or more. Some Republicans, however,
support targeted tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici also announced Monday that he hopes to propose a 40
percent increase in education spending over the next five years.
His increase would be paid for primarily by cutting other federal
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put some real money where our rhetoric has
been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Republicans would also like to provide the states
with more ``direct funding,'' which would eliminate many of the
Washington requirements on how the money should be spent.

STUDY URGES CHANGE IN TREATMENT FOR CERVICAL CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute urged doctors around the world
Monday to change the way they treat cervical cancer on the basis of
surprising results from five separate studies.
</P>
<P>
   Combining chemotherapy with radiation reduces a woman's chances
of dying from advanced cervical cancer by as much as 50 percent
compared to the standard, radiation-only treatment, the federal
agency said in an advisory mailed to thousands of cancer
specialists _ only the fourth such alert the cancer institute has
ever issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really surprised. It's rare to see such a dramatic
difference,'' said Dr. Mitchell Morris of M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston, who directed one of the studies. ``This is the
first major change in the treatment of cervical cancer in 40
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the cervix _ the neck of the womb _ strikes 13,000 to
16,000 American women annually and kills about 5,000, numbers
dwarfed by the annual breast cancer toll of 175,000 new cases and
44,000 deaths. Pap screening has made cervical cancer one of the
most preventable and curable malignancies since the test was
introduced in the 1950s. But 40 percent of all new cases have
already spread beyond the cervix at the time of diagnosis, sharply
reducing the chances of cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early cervical cancer causes very few signs or symptoms,''
Morris said. ``By the time it causes pain it's usually very far
advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Rose of University Hospitals in Cleveland, who led one
of the new studies, said two-thirds of women with cervical cancer
have not had regular Pap smears. ``They're so busy taking care of
their families they don't take care of themselves,'' he said. ``Or
they lose their health insurance and just stop going to the
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I see are women in their 50s or 60s who
had not had a Pap smear since they last delivered their last child
_ a period of up to 15 years,'' said Dr. Harrison G. Ball of UMass
Memorial Health Care in Worcester, Mass., who participated in one
study. ``They just aren't seeing a doctor, or their family
physician doesn't do Pap smears.''
</P>
<P>
   The five studies, which involved a total of 1,700 women, show
that combining standard radiation treatments with a platinum-based
chemotherapy drug sharply improves a woman's chances of beating
advanced cervical cancer. Standard therapy for early-stage cervical
cancer is surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine, which will publish three of
the studies in its April 15 edition, took the unusual step Monday
of releasing the articles early on its web site, citing their
``implications for public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study will be published this spring in the Journal of
Clinical Oncology while a fifth will be presented March 22 at a
meeting of the Society of Gynecological Oncologists in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute is mailing notices of the findings
to members of that group, the American Society for Clinical
Oncology, and two other specialty groups here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Trimble of the Cancer Institute said the agency hopes
doctors will embrace the new findings immediately to give women
their best shot at survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment we're recommending is not terribly complex or
unusual,'' Trimble said in an interview. ``Potentially they could
be used tomorrow in any hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining radiation and chemotherapy has a greater effect on
cervical cancer cells than either would be expected to have alone.
This synergistic effect may result from chemotherapy making cells
more vulnerable to radiation, or vice versa. ``We think the drugs
prevent the cell from repairing the DNA damage caused by
radiation,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   In studies lasting three to eight years, researchers found that
combining radiotherapy with a drug called cisplatin _ with or
without other drugs _ reduced women's chances of death by 30 to 50
percent compared to those who were randomly assigned to standard
radiotherapy alone.
</P>
<P>
   This improvement is called relative risk reduction. In absolute
terms, it meant that combination therapy improved a woman's chances
of being alive three years after diagnosis from 47 percent to 65
percent in one study. In other studies, women on combination
treatment gained about 10 percentage points in their chances of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reasonable to say that for women with advanced cervical
cancer, chemotherapy with radiation should be viewed as the new
standard of therapy,'' said Dr. Ross Berkowitz, co-director of the
Gillette Center for Women's Cancers at Dana Farber Cancer Institute
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz was on a 1996 federal consensus panel that found no
convincing evidence that combining chemotherapy with radiation
improved cervical cancer survival rates. He said the new studies,
taken together, were large enough and long enough to demonstrate a
significant difference.

`BUFFY'S' WILLOW NOT IN THE SAME P.R. VEIN AS THE OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much has been made of the strong, independent women of The
WB's dramas that it's hard to get through a mass-circulation
magazine without running into Sarah Michelle Gellar or Keri Russell
or the covenish triumvirate of Shannen Doherty, Alyssa Milano and
Holly Marie Combs. Add Carmen Electra to the mix and you get the
impression that ``strong and independent'' is magazine code for
``sexy and pouty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's good that Alyson Hannigan, who plays the bookish
Willow Rosenberg on ``Buffy,'' gets lost in this pulchritudinous
power play. What The WB marketing department is doing with its
white-hot (emphasis on white) women is really not very different
from what ABC did 20 years ago with ``Charlie's Angels,'' except
that some of The WB's shows happen to be pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hannigan says her feelings were hurt when Entertainment
Weekly magazine didn't invite her to a photo shoot last year that
featured Gellar _ Buffy of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _ and a
teen's dream team of other young female stars from ``Dawson's
Creek,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Charmed,'' ``Hyperion Bay'' and ``7th
Heaven.'' The photographer wrapped the women in yards of gauze and
placed them in a sylvan setting, achieving new spin on the term
``babes in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it bothered me,'' Hannigan said of her exclusion
from the diaphonous display. ``I was like, well, do they think I'm
a boy?''
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan can do the sexy, pouty thing when she wants to. She can
also take some consolation in knowing that Charisma Carpenter
wasn't contacted by Entertainment Weekly, either. It would seem
Carpenter, who plays babe of babes Cordelia Chase on ``Buffy,'' is
a slam-dunk choice for such a spread, but Hannigan has a theory
about their exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our show, they (The WB's marketers) promote it as Buffy
and Angel (David Boreanaz),'' Hannigan said, ``not as an ensemble
show like `Dawson's Creek.'''
</P>
<P>
   She has a point, even though the ``Buffy'' cast is a kick-butt
ensemble, certainly one of the best on television. But for three
seasons, The WB has been careful to place Gellar out front when
promoting ``Buffy,'' which is more or less a no-brainer, given her
movie-star looks. Now that a spinoff series featuring Boreanaz's
hunky good vampire is on tap for next season, he, too, is showing
up more in magazines and on the adoration Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hannigan is a weeping Willow by virtue of fan neglect.
An Internet check uncovered 10 Web sites devoted to her, including
one billing itself as the Alyson Hannigan Idolatry Shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan likes to surf the Internet, but she is hardly the
cyber-genius that Willow is in her quest to help best-pal Buffy
keep the world safe from vampires and other demon spawn. ``I could
never hack into a security system on the computer,'' she said.
``Willow's knowledge is far more advanced than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   And, bruised ego aside, she really doesn't mind playing the
whip-smart, geeky member of the group whose fashion sense isn't too
haute and whose guy sense isn't too cool. She also doesn't resent
playing a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not going to be playing my age right now,'' said
Hannigan, who's been acting since childhood and will turn 25 on
March 24. ``I go to R-rated movies and occasionally I'll get
carded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannigan, who grew up in Atlanta, says she's just happy to be on
a series that's on the top-10 lists of many TV critics (including
this one).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play a 24-year-old in real life. Nobody would buy it.
No way,'' she said. ``The bottom line is, this is a very hard
industry to keep your head up in, and I'm completely having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any actor, Hannigan likes it when her character gets to
stretch, as happened earlier this season in an episode that
introduced Willow's evil alter ego in a sort of dream sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The bad Willow returns Tuesday night in an episode titled
``Doppelgangland,'' but this time it's not a dream, meaning the
good Willow and the bad Willow appear together in some scenes.
</P>
<P>
   And, for what it's worth, the bad Willow is very, uh, toothsome.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ukraine's former prime minister, the target of
corruption inquiries there and in Switzerland, is being held by
American Customs agents after he tried to enter the United States
on a tourist visa, American officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration agents detained the former prime minister,
Pavlo Lazarenko, at Kennedy Airport in New York on Friday
afternoon, said the chief spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Russell Bergeron. Both American and
Ukrainian officials had previously refused to comment on a report
from Moscow that he had been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said Lazarenko held an expired diplomatic passport and
a valid tourist visa. But he was detained after immigration
officials interviewed him and concluded that he had not come to the
country merely for a casual visit, as the rules governing visitor
visas require.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials arrested Lazarenko in December as he crossed the
Swiss border for what he said then was a meeting on legal matters.
They later charged him with laundering millions of dollars through
numbered bank accounts there.
</P>
<P>
   He left Ukraine on Wednesday, two days before the nation's
Parliament voted to strip him of the immunity that protects all
elected Ukrainian officials against criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He told Parliament in a written statement last week that he was
going to Greece for treatment of a stress-related heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether Lazarenko arrived in New York on
a flight from Greece or from some other country. His family
apparently was not traveling with him.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, all of which he denies, he made millions of
dollars in the last decade through schemes ranging from the sale of
overpriced goods to the government to a complex deal involving the
granting of monopoly franchises to natural-gas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   President Leonid Kuchma appointed Lazarenko prime minister in
mid-1996 but removed him less than a year later as rumors and news
reports of corruption began to taint his administration. Lazarenko
later took a seat in Parliament, and the two men have since become
bitter political enemies as well as opponents in this year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after Parliament withdrew Lazarenko's immunity,
Ukrainian prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of
embezzlement and misuse of government funds.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to Lazarenko next is anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   American immigration officials are reviewing the circumstances
of his attempt to enter the United States to determine whether he
is entitled to entry or should be expelled. That process,
``expedited removal,'' is supposed to be rapid but could easily be
tied up by legal challenges, particularly if he decides to seek
asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarenko has contended repeatedly that he is a victim of
political persecution by the Kuchma government and that the
criminal investigations in Switzerland and Ukraine are part of a
plot to destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States ultimately decides to expel Lazarenko, he
has a number of options. Although Ukraine could seek his return for
prosecution, it is unlikely to succeed because the United States
and Ukraine do not have an extradition treaty. He cannot be
repatriated against his will unless he is legally expelled from the
United States and no other country will agree to accept him.
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. Lazarenko also holds a Panamanian passport,
for instance, although he has denied that he has citizenship there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be presumed that if he's found to be removable,
he will be sent to Ukraine,'' Bergeron said. ``It's far too early
in the process to judge what the final outcome of this might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Switzerland do have an extradition treaty,
but it is not clear whether the Swiss either are seeking his return
or plan to. The Swiss hold $3 million in bail as insurance for
Lazarenko's return for a trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Ukraine, Lazarenko is politically unpopular, but he has
gained a sort of celebrity for his supposed wealth and his
undeniably brazen nature. He is given to expensive suits and has a
large private office studded with photographs of his visits with
world leaders. A large blowup of a handshake with President Clinton
occupies the most prominent spot.
</P>
<P>
   But going by the financial disclosure statements he filed while
prime minister, he is an ascetic, earning only about $2,600 in
1997, driving a Lada, an inexpensive Russian car, and owning no
property beyond a small walk-up apartment.

   What's on the horizon for the next 1,000 years, says W, a
magazine for fortunate fortune-tellers, is having a lot of money
and spending a lot of money. ``Years ago, when someone was a

   &UR; Carla Fendi &LR; , head of the Italian maker of luxury products,

 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Peering down from the 28th floor of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank building, which resembles nothing so much as an urban
oil rig, there is little doubt that the bank, one of the world's
richest, was built on a geyser of wealth from this former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
   But as the bank announced its 1998 earnings here Monday against
the spectacular backdrop of Victoria Harbor, one could not help
wondering: Whatever happened to the Hong Kong in Hongkong Bank?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the bank's London-based parent, HSBC
Holdings PLC, reported its full-year earnings in United States
dollars. HSBC executives said they would seek a listing on the New
York Stock Exchange later this year, in addition to the company's
listings in London and Hong Kong. Having American shares would make
it easier for HSBC to acquire a bank in the United States should it
desire to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most symbolic announcement, HSBC executives laid out
plans to market the company's far-flung holdings _ from the British
Bank of the Middle East to Marine Midland in the United States _ as
a single entity. That means, as the company announced late last
year, that the names of those holdings, including Hongkong Bank,
will all be changed to HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, analysts said, HSBC is trying to fashion a global
brand name to compete with Citibank in many world markets. A
streamlined, global HSBC is the product of a two-decade
transformation from a local Hongkong bank into the world's
fifth-largest by market value. Even amid Asia's financial crises,
HSBC has been among the world's most profitable banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group's strategy of diversifying our assets has clearly
been undertaken so that we don't have too many eggs in one
basket,'' said Keith R. Whitson, the chief executive of HSBC, in an
interview. ``I think the strategy has been vindicated by the events
of the last 18 months.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hong Kong plays a lesser role in HSBC's public image these
days, it may be because Hong Kong and Asia have gone from being the
motor that drives HSBC to a shuddering brake on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a huge increase in provisions for bad loans at
Hongkong Bank, HSBC's overall net income fell 21 percent, to $4.3
billion, in 1998. While profits rose two-tenths of 1 percent in
Britain and 11.8 percent in the United States, they plummeted 46
percent in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Hong Kong generated two-thirds of the pretax
profits of HSBC Group. In 1998, it generated just 37 percent.
Indeed, 1998 was the first year in HSBC's history that its Hong
Kong and Asian operations contributed less to overall profits than
its European operations: 38 percent versus 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results did not surprise analysts. They were, however, a
sobering reminder that Asia's financial crisis is far from over.
Although the bank said its markets in Indonesia, Thailand and South
Korea had bottomed out, it said it was still battling a rising tide
of bad loans in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent, China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian operations are the backbone of our group,'' Whitson
said. ``But I don't think anybody could have seen the dramatic
devaluations and downturns that we've experienced in this region.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last century, of course, the bank has successfully
weathered wars, revolutions and financial crises in Asia. It had
been the dominant banking power in the booming trading city of
Shanghai before the communists took control in 1949 and seized the
bank's ornate office building for the local party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And while the bank is currently playing down its Asian roots,
some analysts predict that HSBC is poised to go on a shopping spree
for distressed banks in the region. In what appears to be its first
such deal, HSBC said today that it would acquire control of South
Korea's seventh-largest bank, Seoulbank, from the Korean government
for about $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, HSBC is clearly climbing out of the Asian trough and
making itself a different company. By plunging into the American
capital markets, HSBC is ready to stake its claim as a preeminent
global bank. But first it must remake its internal culture. Long a
bastion of Britons from elite schools who presided over their Asian
outposts almost like colonial governors, HSBC is now training
specialists in growth areas like personal wealth planning and
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Although HSBC is still ruled by international officers _ a corps
of 350 generalist bankers who can hop from Brunei to Buffalo with
aplomb _ it has begun to recruit outsiders from Citibank and
McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolutionary process,'' said Roy Ramos, a banking
analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong. ``HSBC had a very
inbred culture, and it worked. But they could use new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing underscores the bank's drive for a new image more than
its decision to adopt the name HSBC worldwide. The company said it
would spend $50 million, not including advertising, to stamp its
name and red-and-white hexagon logo on 5,500 offices in 79
countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is an about-face for HSBC, which had brushed aside
past suggestions to create a uniform brand. But executives now say
the HSBC name will enable the bank to showcase its worldwide
network and broad range of products. And that will persuade
investors to place a higher value on its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to let our results speak for themselves,'' said
Christopher Langley, the executive director of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank. ``This is partly because we haven't had one single
unit that we can get behind and say, `This is HSBC,' whether you're
in Brazil, or whether you're in Malaysia, or whether you're in
upstate New York. In this day and age, you've got to make a little
noise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Retiring the names of its units is risky, though. Some _ like
Midland in Britain and Marine Midland in the United States _ have
been around for more than 150 years, and have deep roots in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers have lamented the loss of the Midland name,
which has hung from shingles in British towns since 1836. Though
less venerable than its British sister, Marine Midland built a
durable name as a consumer bank in upstate New York before HSBC
acquired it in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm don't think people in Watertown, N.Y., have the slightest
idea what HSBC stands for,'' said James Conmy, a former executive
at Marine Midland and a speechwriter for HSBC's retired chairman,
Sir William Purves.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, praise HSBC for trying to fashion a global
brand. In Hong Kong, where the switch might seem to be the most
traumatic, many people already refer to Hongkong Bank as HSBC. (The
parent company moved its headquarters to London in 1992, five years
before China took back the colony.) And the company's second major
local bank here, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., will keep its name since it
is not wholly owned by HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some analysts said, the change is overdue. ``I
think it's potentially a big help,'' said Judah Kraushaar, senior
banking analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York. ``The notion
of tapping into HSBC's brand identity and global attributes could
really help Marine Midland.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraushaar said that under HSBC, Marine Midland had never broken
out of its niche as a middle-market mortgage-lending bank.
Similarly, Midland Bank in Britain has steered a steady but
unremarkable course.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, removing Hong Kong from the Hongkong Bank may be
politically astute move. When it was a British colony, Hong Kong
was viewed as an international financial center. Since its return
to China, though, Hong Kong is seen by other Asians as more of a
Chinese city.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to have certain predispositions,'' said Eric Tai,
the head of consumer banking at HSBC, who was recruited from
Citibank. ``When you talk about perfume, you think about France.
When you talk about fashion, you think about Italy. When you talk
about banking, you don't think about Hong Kong. You think about
American banks, Swiss banks, and U.K. banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its travails, Tai said HSBC was still determined to be a
major force in consumer banking throughout Asia. It has opened
branches from Korea to Bangladesh. But in keeping with its
conservative style, it eschewed the aggressive consumer lending
that has haunted rivals like Citibank and Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
   In its agreement with the South Korean government, HSBC will buy
a 70 percent stake in Seoulbank, which has 292 branches and assets
of $24.8 billion. In addition to its 30 percent stake, the
government will receive warrants equivalent to another 19 percent
of the shares. That effectively gives it a stake of 49 percent,
which would enable it to benefit from any turnaround of the ailing
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also agreed to put an unspecified amount of
nonperforming loans in an asset management company. In what some
analysts say is a sweetheart deal for HSBC, it has the option of
transferring still more bad loans into the company for one year
after it takes over Seoulbank.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC's successful bid for Seoulbank came after it lost an
auction late last year for another Korean bank, Korea First. In
this deal, HSBC exhibited flexibility and unexpected muscle as a
deal maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We initially thought the Korean government would have more
bargaining power after it sold the first bank,'' said Chunsoo Lim,
a banking analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Seoul. ``But it
didn't work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   With a foothold in Korea, HSBC could turn next to Thailand. Both
HSBC and Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, analysts say, are in the
hunt for Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, a troubled bank which the Thai
government plans to auction to a foreign bidder.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC's decision to sell its shares in New York has prompted
speculation that the company may hope to raise capital to acquire a
major American bank. Wells Fargo is the most frequently mentioned
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is trying to match us up with somebody, it's
amazing,'' Whitson said. ``We're not about to go charging off just
for the sake of making an acquisition or a merger. We're very
focused on shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of prudence has sheltered HSBC from the Asian
typhoon. In Hong Kong alone, the volume of loans classified as
nonperforming jumped to $2.5 billion last year from $619 million in
1997. All told, HSBC took a $2.6 billion charge to cover bad or
doubtful loans last year.
</P>
<P>
   For all its woes, Hongkong Bank still occupies a lofty perch in
the commercial hierarchy. And its ties with Hong Kong sometimes
bind. As the main issuer of currency in the territory, it acts as a
quasi-central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government is also the bank's biggest shareholder,
thanks to its intervention in the stock market last summer. When
executives at HSBC first floated the idea of listing their stock in
New York last year, officials here asked them to hold off to avoid
eroding local confidence.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC's sensitivities turn up in odd places. Recently, several
economists left the bank after clashing with executives over their
reports. One economist was forced out after he refused to endorse
rosy projections for China's economy, according to two former
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in 79 countries around the world,'' Whitson said in an
explanation that sums up HSBC's credo. ``By definition, that means
that we're a guest in 78. And we believe in behaving as guests
should behave.''

ANALYSIS: BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN, SUBSTANCE AND SCHMALTZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Over the weekend, after Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee of India took his bus ride to Pakistan, leaders of
the two nations acted like members of an estranged family who are
trying to heal a rift with the balm of sweet words and impulsive
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they will have the stamina to grapple with their
deep-rooted differences remains to be seen, but at least they have
begun a slow dance of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   In chaste Hindi, Vajpayee _ a Brahmin and a poet-politician _
recited couplets from a poem he wrote to celebrate peace, while
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan stood listening nearby on
the same green lawn in Lahore. The prime ministers, who made the
fateful decision in May to test nuclear weapons, were recasting
themselves as men of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border, in the Indian state of Punjab, Chief Minister
Prakash Singh Badal awoke to find that his counterpart in Pakistan,
who is also the Pakistani prime minister's brother, had listened
when Singh gave voice to a nostalgic longing for the husky, Dumba
sheep that Pakistan's Punjab is famed for _ and sent two rams and
three ewes to his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan, the first by an Indian prime
minister in a decade, brought some substance along with the
schmaltzy gestures. The nations signed modest agreements promising
that they would seek to reduce the risk of an accidental nuclear
war, to improve the communication links between their militaries
and to continue negotiating with each other on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a watershed,'' said Ved Marwah, an analyst at the
Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ``No one would have
thought such a friendly exchange possible even a month ago. It's
part of a process, and one hopes it takes off. But it's too early
to say what will result. It's a good beginning, but that's about
all at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials, who have been pushing India and Pakistan to
keep their nuclear arsenals at the lowest possible levels, said
they were encouraged by the bus diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most promising feature is that the two sides have
agreed to sustain contacts at a high level,'' said Donna Roginski,
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministerial hugs and the ritual language of friendship
are just small steps to easing the enmity that has defined
relations between these two nations since they were ripped asunder
when the subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947,
with India predominantly Hindu and Pakistan overwhelmingly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have fought three wars against each other, two
of them over the disputed territory of Kashmir. They now have
hundreds of thousands of troops deployed along the boundary that
separates the two-thirds of Kashmir that India controls from the
one-third in Pakistani hands.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's visit is not the first attempt to repair the wounds
of Partition, as the country's sundering is called. Almost four
decades ago, India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, went
to Pakistan bearing a message of friendship and peace, as did
Nehru's grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1988, when he was prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But the cycle of heartbreak and rage has continued. On the eve
of Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, Islamic militants _ whom Indians
generally believe are backed by Pakistan _ massacred 20 Hindu
civilians in three places in Jammu, part of the Indian state of
Jammu and Kashmir, apparently in an attempt to derail the peace
efforts. In one case, they opened fire on a wedding party, killing
eight celebrants.
</P>
<P>
   In the public events over the weekend in Pakistan, Vajpayee
never spoke out directly about the massacres _ though his first
words on returning to India were to assure reporters that he had
sternly warned Sharif that the prospects for peace were dim if
innocent men, women and children continued to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian Age, an influential English-language newspaper in New
Delhi, condemned the prime minister for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Vajpayee was dining in the banquet hall of bonhomie,
there were children in Jammu who had become orphans and families
who had been wiped out for no reason other than that they had been
born Hindus,'' the paper said in an editorial Monday. ``How could
Vajpayee have forgotten to remind his hosts that such barbarism was
beyond the boundaries of civilized behavior, irrespective of the
nature of any dispute that India and Pakistan may have over
Kashmir?''
</P>
<P>
   But the editorial writers' anguished cry was the exception. More
typical was the reaction of Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of the
government-financed Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in
New Delhi. Had Vajpayee publicly excoriated Pakistan for killings
by militants who may be beyond its power to control, he might have
undermined the purpose of his visit: to build the good will that
will make future progress possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a testimony to the determination on both sides that this
didn't come in the way and that Vajpayee went ahead with his
visit,'' Bhaskar said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next round, Sharif and his wife are to visit India at a
time that has not yet been set.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of people lined up Monday, George
Washington's birthday, to visit the Washington Monument, which had
been closed since Oct. 5 while a scaffold was constructed around it
to permit workers to inspect and repair its marble skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the middle of the renovation, it is nice that they let
people in,'' said Shoshana Deitch, a tourist from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Deitch and the others who stood in line in a brisk, chilly
wind for 25 minutes were lucky that the monument was open at all,
because repairs are running a bit behind schedule. The National
Park Service is working to finish the project by the Fourth of July
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The park service will shut the monument again later this year to
begin the last phase of the work: renovations of the observation
deck at the 500-foot level and an area with a souvenir shop at 490
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Miner, an employee in the workers compensation office in
Salem, Ore., who was waiting in line as her 7-year-old son,
Matthew, looked for the mitten he had just lost (he found it in his
jacket sleeve), admired the shroud of metal and fabric around the
monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique, actually,'' Ms. Miner said. ``It looks like a
cellophane bag over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The covering was designed by the architect Michael Graves. It
has the outline of oversized marble blocks printed on it, with bold
stripes mimicking the mortar joints of the monument. It runs the
full height of the 555-foot obelisk.
</P>
<P>
   Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said
that the cost of restoration was estimated at $9.4 million, of
which the Target store chain and its corporate partners have
donated $5 million. The restoration is the most extensive since the
monument opened in 1888.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 36,000 pieces of marble,'' Kittleman said, ``and
each one will be examined for damage and repaired on the spot if
that is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for repairs is evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten so bad that water gets through the joints and into
the interior,'' Kittleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the work so far has been the replacement of the
machinery that runs the elevator, although the elevator has not
been speeded up and still takes 65 seconds to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   During the ascent and descent of the elevator, workers could be
seen restoring the state and foreign plaques that are cemented into
the interior walls. The staircase that allows the plaques to be
viewed has been closed for the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Vaandrager, a grain elevator worker from Sheldon, Iowa,
took the people elevator to the observation deck and pointed his
camera through the windows but without success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to take a picture because of the scaffolding,''
Vaandrager said, ``but we're happy just to get a chance to get up
here.''

VOLVO BREAKS OFF TALKS TO BUY SCANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Volvo AB of Sweden, Europe's second-largest truckmaker,
announced Monday that it had broken off talks to buy its rival,
Scania AB, raising speculation that it might set its sights on a
U.S. target in its quest for size and market share.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Volvo agreed to sell its car division to Ford Motor
Co. for $6.5 billion, leaving it potentially cash rich but
vulnerable to a takeover if it does not move quickly to bolster its
truck business, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo said the negotiations with Scania collapsed over the price
sought by Scania's main shareholder, Investor AB, the financial arm
of the Wallenberg family, which controls much of Swedish business.
Investor owns 46 percent of Scania's voting stock. Volvo bought a
12.85 percent stake in its rival last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nils Lundin, a spokesman for Investor, said the company was
``interested in finding the best solution for Scania'' and said the
possibilities ranged from remaining independent to agreeing to a
merger. He did not elaborate. Percy Barnevik, the chairman of
Investor, said recently that Scania was strong enough to survive
alone for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Scania slumped 10.5 kronor, or 5 percent, to 203
kronor, while shares of Volvo fell 1.5 kronor, to 215. Volvo's
American depository receipts fell 31.25 cents, to $26.50. Investor
shares rose 1.5 kronor, to 340.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish analysts said Investor had valued Scania at about 250
kronor a share. Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief executive, said Volvo
bought its stake last month thinking that ``Investor was
considering withdrawing as the principal owner and accordingly was
receptive to an offer for the entire company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Volvo wanted to insure that it could participate in the
discussion of Scania's future ownership,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Like the auto industry, Europe's heavy- and medium-truck
business faces problems of overcapacity, but analysts said there
seemed little likelihood of big savings from a Volvo-Scania deal
because of the political obstacles to layoffs at Swedish plants. A
merged Volvo-Scania would control 31 percent of Europe's
heavy-truck market, but because of the similarities between the two
companies, a deal would ``have been a case of one plus one making
one and a half,'' one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on a possible takeover target has, in part, centered
on Navistar International Corp., based in Chicago. Volvo's
heavy-duty trucks accounted for 11.5 percent of the surging U.S.
truck market in 1998, and a deal with Navistar would double that to
create the second-biggest truck builder after DaimlerChrysler AG's
Freightliner. Navistar shares rose 56.25 cents, to $38.9375.

A `TRUE' TAG TEAM: VENTURA, BUSH  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former pro-wrestler-turned-Minnesota governor Jesse
``the Body'' Ventura appears to have bonded with Texas Gov. George
W. Bush at the National Governors Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking Ventura decided to look out for the much slighter
Bush on Monday outside the White House. As Bush was talking with
reporters, Ventura wandered over to urge the Republican governor to
get on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, George, we've got places to go,'' said Ventura, in
his booming voice.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush insisted on introducing Ventura to the Texas press,
which prompted the former wrestler to recall a line spoken by John
Wayne in the movie ``True Grit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met a Texan yet who hasn't drunk dirty water from a
hoof print,'' Ventura quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has called the 6-feet 4-inch Ventura a ``breath of fresh
air.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Ventura enjoyed joshing the Texas governor, he wasn't
ready to endorse Bush for president. Ventura, who won as a Reform
Party candidate, said he would like to see Colin Powell,retired
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, run for president as an
independent candidate.

TRAPPED IN THEIR WAYS, ECONOMISTS NEAR BENCHMARK FOR INACCURATE
FORECASTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to get an embarrassed smile from any economist these days?
Just ask him about his recent forecasts. If he happened to be right
on economic growth, the forecast was almost certainly wrong on
interest rates. And if a forecast was right on inflation, it was
undoubtedly wrong on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting has never been easy and economists in the business
have been off base more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   But, still early in 1999, forecasters seem to be setting some
kind of benchmark for inaccuracy. For the fourth consecutive year,
economic seers have underestimated economic growth so markedly that
the rush to revise the original predictions has started almost as
soon as the forecasting season has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Why are forecasters so far off the mark? Although questions have
been raised for years about the breakdown of traditional
relationships in the economy _ such as that between low
unemployment and higher inflation _ one reason stands above all
others: many economists seem trapped in the model that their
education and training drilled into them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly at this point, late in the long economic upturn that
began in early 1991, they have inclinations that make them look not
just for higher inflation but for a slowdown as well. Sure, they
may eventually get it right, but only in the sense that a stopped
clock is right once in a while, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have been trained to think that when unemployment
gets down to this level, you will have inflationary pressures and
the economy will slow,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, consulting economist
to the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with a predisposition that the economy has to
slow,'' he added, ``you just have to look for what is going to make
it slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   In underestimating growth and overstating inflation, economists
appear to have made several errors. They played down the impact of
technology. They have been baffled by consumer behavior, have
struggled to explain the low savings rate and have been left agog
at the buoyancy of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   And they have made what, in hindsight, look like simple
misjudgments, such as overestimating the impact of a manufacturing
slump and underestimating the positive effects that lower commodity
prices have had on consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-cautious chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has
contributed to these misinterpretations himself. While Greenspan
has long talked about how new technologies may be lifting the
potential growth rate of the American economy, he has predicted
slowdowns that have not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Official Fed forecasts, meanwhile, have repeatedly fallen short
of actual performance. Greenspan may well be asked about the issue
when he presents his outlook for monetary policy and the economy to
Congress on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Take Greenspan's comment in September: ``It is just not credible
that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected
by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.'' No
doubt that encouraged many other smart economists to overestimate
the drag that the global financial crisis would have on the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   What is most striking is that most forecasters have still not
figured out how to overcome their past mistakes. Economists, for
example, remain far from reaching a conclusion on the question of
whether the current blend of very strong growth with declining
inflation is just a result of temporary factors, such as the plunge
in oil prices and the strength of the dollar, or a reflection of
more permanent changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you how at sea forecasters are,'' said James E.
Glassman, senior United States economist at the Chase Manhattan
Bank. He is one forecaster who has yet to revise upward his
forecast of very weak growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments, is
more blunt: ``I would urge people to pay very little attention to
the forecasts they get.'' She has raised her growth forecast once
this year.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through 1998, the consensus forecast at the beginning
of the year for real growth in the nation's gross domestic product
was, on average, 1.4 percentage points below the actual annual
growth rate, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators. And
the consensus estimate for 1999 _ 2.4 percent as of January _
already appears likely to fall short of the mark.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for economists stems from how they approach
forecasting. They generally begin by estimating growth and link the
rest of the forecast to that. Stronger growth should mean higher
inflation and higher interest rates, especially late in an economic
cycle when unemployment is low and and industry should be working
at close to full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   This relationship has produced one of the paradoxes of the
off-the-mark growth forecasts. Those on Wall Street who predicted
slow growth last year were dead wrong. But that led them to call
for falling inflation and declining interest rates. Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, is one of those who
turned out to be pretty close on figures that are more important on
Wall Street than economic growth, turned out to be pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had forecast growth correctly,'' he acknowledged
sheepishly, ``I probably would have gotten those other things
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's not trying again. On Feb. 1, Steinberg raised his
growth forecast for 1999 to a 3.4 percent annual rate from a 2.6
percent prediction in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the failure of traditional models, another factor in
the frequent pessimism is an outgrowth of practicing the dismal
science. ``Economists do tend to be gloomy,'' said Edward Yardeni,
chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, in accounting for his
own miscues as well as those of others.
</P>
<P>
   Several errors have also managed to reinforce one another. While
economists agree that an increase in consumers' wealth from a rise
in the stock market will help lift spending, there is no agreement
on how strong this so-called wealth effect is. The idea is that
consumers are willing to spend more of their income when they are
feeling good about their investments. But with the savings rate
already at or near historic lows going into 1998, it was thought
that consumers would start behaving more conservatively. Instead,
they were willing to cut their savings rate even lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no precedent for the speed or the depth of the
slowdown in the savings rate,'' said John Lipsky, the chief
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's rebound in the fall also surprised most
forecasters. ``When you are in a marketplace where it is deeply
held by the old-timers that the stock market is going to roll over
any minute, that deeply affects your thinking,'' said Stephen S.
Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He has
already revised his growth forecast upward twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board,
cites another reason. ``You don't lose your job if things turn out
better than you forecast,'' she said. ``But you can if they turn
out worse.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Ms. Fosler has been more daring _ and more
accurate _ than most economists in predicting economic growth. And
this year she remains much more optimistic than the consensus,
having recently bumped up her 1999 forecast a notch higher, to 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led Richard Peach, a research vice president at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to acknowledge that economic
forecasters have even fallen behind weather forecasters in their
ability to predict the future. ``The meteorologists,'' he said,
``have gone way beyond us.''

EXPERIMENT WITH MICE CONFIRMS EFFECT OF FOLKMAN DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Scientists said Monday they had sharply slowed
the growth of cancers in mice by injecting them with genes that
make endostatin, the powerful angiogenesis inhibitor from Dr. Judah
Folkman's lab that is nearing tests in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment raises the possibility that cancer patients could
receive weekly injections of endostatin genes, which would instruct
the patient's own cells to make the drug and secrete it into the
blood stream.
</P>
<P>
   If the method proves viable in future human tests, it might be
an ingenious way to get around the current difficulties faced by
company scientists who are attempting to make endostatin
synthetically in drug form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this approach is that it's so clean,'' said Wang
Min, a senior scientist at Gene Medicine Inc., a Houston-area
biotech company. ``You just put the endostatin gene in, and the
body makes the pure protein _ no contamination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gene _ the DNA blueprint for endostatin _ was injected into
the muscles of mice that had received transplants a week previously
of lung or kidney cancer cells. Once a week for two weeks, the mice
got the endostatin injections. Min said that the tumors in the
treated mice grew much more slowly than in untreated mice, so that
their tumors were 60 to 70 percent smaller and they had six times
fewer metastases _ cancer nodules that spread from the primary
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the tumors was not nearly as dramatic as that
obtained by Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital in
Boston, where mice given endostatin protein have had tumors shrink
to invisibility. However, Dr. James Pluda, a senior investigator
with the National Cancer Institute, said that the gene therapy
technique might be used in combination with other anti-cancer drugs
to control tumors so that patients could live a long and relatively
normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have used gene therapy to put endostatin genes
into animals' bodies to combat tumors. But in those previous
experiments, the endostatin DNA was carried into the animals' cells
with a crippled virus. In Min's research, the endostatin gene was
spliced into a simple DNA ring, which is less likely to cause
adverse reactions, he said. And he said the DNA carriers are simple
and cheap to make in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from academic laboratories, biotech companies and
large pharmaceutical corporations are attending the two-day meeting
sponsored by the Institute of International Research, which puts on
a variety of scientific conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is only one of dozens of compounds that have been
found to inhibit angiogenesis _ the growth of new blood vessels in
the body that a tumor needs to grow and survive. Blocking
angiogenesis can slow or halt the growth of tumors, or _ as in
Folkman's experiments _ even cause them to shrink away. Endostatin
and another angiogenesis inhibitor discovered in Folkman's lab,
angiostatin, are in the medical spotlight as the National Cancer
Institute and the biotech company EntreMed Inc. are working to move
those drugs into their first human tests, perhaps later this year.
</P>
<P>
   EntreMed scientists are scheduled to report on recent progress
in making large quantities of angiostatin and endostatin at
Tuesday's sessions of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what stock market investors saw as a setback for
the field, the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb said it
was halting work on the development of angiostatin under a license
from Entremed because the large protein was proving too difficult
to make in large quantities that were consistently effective.
Scientists here downplayed the importance of this setback because
there are so many other angiogenesis inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   A number of angiogenesis inhibitors that predate the discovery
of angiostatin and endostatin are in early stages of tests in human
cancer patients, but little information about the results has been
released by the companies carrying them out. Progress reports will
likely be aired later this spring at a pair of annual cancer
meetings.

BURNS, BRUINS SEEK PATH BACK TO WINNING WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He has called for reinforcements in the person of
sports psychologist Fred Neff. He has raised his voice for emphasis
during practice. He cranked up the intensity of the workout Monday
to the point where the Ristuccia Center in suburban Wilmingfton
looked like a cross between the first day of training camp, with
scuffles breaking out between veterans, and the start of the
playoffs, when everyone is focused and all business.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns is pulling out all the stops in an effort
to right his listing ship of a team, and he hopes his players will
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   There are 26 contests left in the regular season, and if the
Bruins don't play better, that will be the end of their year. As of
Monday, they were in ninth place in the Eastern Conference, 2
points out of the last playoff spot. Of their remaining games, 22
are against Eastern opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Boston ended a three-game losing streak with a 6-3 victory over
the awful Blackhawks in Chicago Sunday, but Burns's attitude was,
in a nutshell, ``big deal.'' Tuesday's opponent _ the Ottawa
Senators, whom the Bruins host at the FleetCenter _ is among the
best teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team we beat (Sunday) is not a team right now that you're
going to be able to test your (team against),'' said Burns. ``We
can feel good about the win but we can't feel that good about it.
You have to be able to beat teams in your conference and your
division to be able to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning gives us a little boost. But the Ottawa Senators
aren't the Chicago Blackhawks. They're in control, they're a
well-coached, disciplined team. They have a lot of talent and we
have to give them a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ottawa (last Thursday), we gave them a game, we came out of
there with nothing. We probably had a couple of more scoring
chances than they did, but the fact is, they scored two goals and
we scored none.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said if his team wasn't convinced by their last meeting,
they should be convinced by something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against the Flyers, who are an excellent hockey club, (the
Senators) beat the Flyers, 4-1, in their own building,'' said
Burns. ``So that tells us you'd better tie your skates and be
prepared to play a hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins appeared to break out of their offensive rut with six
goals against the lowly Hawks, but Burns didn't want to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it means diddly squat,'' he said. ``That's exactly
what it means for me. Their goaltender wasn't very good. I think
(Jocelyn) Thibault struggled. It's a big 2 points and it's all nice
and fine up on the board. Let's see how we fare against excellent
goaltending and a good defensive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's workout was one of the most spirited in recent memory.
During one set of drills, defenseman Don Sweeney and right wing Rob
DiMaio starting whaling away at each other when the contact got a
little too intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nothing,'' said DiMaio. ``It was just game-situation
stuff, three-on-three and five-on-fives, and sometimes hacks and
whacks happen and guys respond and retaliate. It was nothing, it
was just part of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe said he was thrilled to see the increase in
intensity among the team. He watched in horror Sunday as the Bruins
nearly blew a 4-0 lead, allowing the Blackhawks to pull within 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe went in for the third period, relieving Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've seen it from the bench,'' he said.
``You can see guys on the bench, their heads start to sink, the
bitching starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we were up a goal going into the third. If
you had said we'd be up a goal going into the third at the start of
the game, I think everyone would be happy, but no one was happy at
all.
</P>

   AIRREPAIR-TRAMCO (Everett, Wash.) _ Federal aviation safety
inspectors, warning of dangerously incompetent work on dozens of
jetliners, last summer tried to temporarily shut down Tramco, one
of North America's largest independent aircraft repair stations.
The chief FAA inspector assigned to the sprawling plant called the
facility, which worked on 421 aircraft last year, ``a disaster
waiting to happen.'' And in July, FAA inspectors wrote agency
lawyers that Tramco's ``violations raise significant concerns for
safety and clearly raise the potential of a catastrophic failure
leading to a crash.'' But their bosses ruled against pulling the
company's FAA license to operate.

COMMENTARY: SYNAGOGUE AND STATE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Israeli election campaign now in full swing, it's time
to ask who will influence the outcome most. Will it be Yasser,
Hafez or Ovadia?
</P>
<P>
   Ovadia? Who's Ovadia?
</P>
<P>
   Ovadia is Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party. Ten days ago, the rabbi launched a
tirade against the Israeli supreme court that could make this
election _ for the first time ever _ an election not about which
prime-ministerial candidate can be the toughest in dealing with the
hard-line Arabs, but which can be the toughest in dealing with the
ultra-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by several supreme court decisions _ including one that
outlawed blanket deferments from army service for ultra-Orthodox
youths _ Yosef denounced the supreme court judges as ``wicked ...
empty-headed and wanton evildoers'' who are ``unclean and desecrate
the Sabbath.'' Some 250,000 ultra-Orthodox took to the streets to
decry the ``tyranny'' of Israel's high court.
</P>
<P>
   While Israeli politicians might prefer that the next election be
about ``What size Israel do you want?'' the Israeli public is
focused on ``What sort of Israel do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   What brought about this shift? For many years, the
ultra-Orthodox viewed the Israeli government as alien. But over the
past two decades, as they have become dependent on government
subsidies for their institutions, the ultra-Orthodox have become
integrated into the Israeli political system, and now they want
that system to reflect more of their own Torah values.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the ultra-Orthodox were outsiders to the state,
they had no interest in a Torah state, but now that they feel that
the state is theirs, they want their kind of state,'' observes
Moshe Halbertal, a religious philosopher at the Hebrew University
and the Hartman Institute. ``But the conception of Judaism they
want to bring to that state is fundamentally anti-democratic _ it
is untempered by any of the adaptations that Judaism has gone
through in relation to modernity and political power elsewhere
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the ultra-Orthodox have learned how to operate in
Israeli democracy, they have not absorbed the underlying values of
that democracy. What really angers the ultra-Orthodox about the
supreme court is not only its decisions, but the fact that _ unlike
the Labor and Likud parties, which can be bought off in exchange
for ultra-Orthodox votes _ the high court is totally independent.
In other words, the ultra-Orthodox have learned to accept that part
of Israeli democracy that is about political horse-trading in
Parliament. The other half _ that there is a rule of secular law
above any religious laws _ they have not accepted. The
ultra-Orthodox see the supreme court as coercing them; the court
sees itself as preventing the ultra-Orthodox from coercing the rest
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But what everyone agrees is that the old status quo _ that the
ultra-Orthodox get to decide all things religious and the secular
parties get to eat pork chops at home and decide the rest _ is
breaking down. And Israel's politicians are not ready for this.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu wants to run against Yasser
Arafat. He can't run against Yosef because he needs every
ultra-Orthodox vote to get re-elected. But if he appears
indifferent to Orthodox attempts to undercut the high court it
could hurt him with some of his secular nationalist followers.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is an opportunity for the Labor party leader, Ehud
Barak, but he seems deaf to it. Barak's approach is to just attack
the ultra-Orthodox. What he should be doing is presenting himself
as someone who can build a bridge between secular and religious
Israelis. He needs to be articulating a new synagogue-state status
quo. This would be a new legal arrangement that would make clear
that the state of Israel must be a place where all streams of
Judaism _ ultra-Orthodox, modern Orthodox, Conservative and Reform
_ will feel at home, but where no one of them will be allowed to
use the state to coerce or dominate the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Barak should be offering is a new social contract that
will redefine Israel as a Jewish democratic state, where all the
different conceptions of what it means to be a Jew can debate each
other,'' said Halbertal. ``If we cannot produce such a framework,
then we are heading toward a clash the end of which no one knows.''

TEARS, AND MORE, FROM LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Monica Lewinsky does shed tears in her interview with
Barbara Walters, as countless other newsmakers and celebrities have
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But Walters maintained Monday that Lewinsky travels the full
gamut of emotions during her first television interview, reliving
her relationship with President Clinton and the year of scandal
that followed in a conversation that Walters claimed has ``a sense
of history about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is opening up two hours of prime time for the interview on
March 3, hoping for blockbuster ratings on the last day of the
``sweeps'' period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when she is emotional, and where she, I think,
is teary,'' Walters said Monday during a telephone conference with
TV writers. ``This is not a sobbing interview; this is not an
interview in which every 10 minutes she's crying. But this is very
painful material for her.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Lewinsky talk about? According to Walters, the
former White House intern describes ``her torment, her terrible
fright'' at being the center of a sex scandal that became worldwide
news, and at being the object of ``endless ridicule.'' Walters said
Lewinsky describes her past and present feelings about President
Clinton, offering ``some insights into him you may not have heard
before.'' (Walters said Lewinsky answered her question on whether
she is still in love with Clinton, but declined to say what that
answer was.) Lewinsky also gives her opinions of Hillary Clinton
and independent prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr, though again Walters
declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   And though Walters said it is ``not a prurient interview,''
Lewinsky does discuss the infamous blue dress in response to a
question that, according to Walters, was prompted by e-mailed
queries from viewers of her morning talk show, ``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand the history of the relationship really from day
one, the day of that famous thong,'' said Walters. ``You see the
president in a way that I'm not sure you have been able to see him
before, because she has not characterized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand the role of her mother; you understand how she
feels about Ken Starr,'' she added. ``And you understand what she
went through this past year more graphically. The emotions of this
past year, from the time she finds out she is on that list, are
simply staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the one-hour conference Monday, Walters treaded
carefully the thin line between hype and full disclosure. She did
say, however, that she was surprised by Lewinsky's admission that
the most painful question grand jurors asked her was why she had
become involved with married men.
</P>
<P>
   Walters conceded that she wasn't always able to keep her
incredulity at bay as the 24-year-old told the tale of her
dalliance with the president. ``There were times when I would say,
`But Monica, how could you?' '' said Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Walters's interview with Lewinsky took place on Saturday, amid
much secrecy, in the same New York studio where ``20/20'' is taped.
The two-hour interview will air March 3 from 9 to 11 p.m. as a
``special edition'' of ``20/20 Wednesday.'' ABC News president
David Westin said that, under an agreement with Lewinsky, the
interview will air only once, though he said excerpts may be used
on ABC newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   The interview had been delayed because Lewinsky's immunity
agreement with Starr prohibited her from talking publicly about her
affair with Clinton until Starr gave the green light. Even when he
did so after Clinton's impeachment trial ended in acquittal, Starr
insisted on certain conditions: that Lewinsky have an attorney
present during the interview, that she not contradict the evidence
she gave to the grand jury, that she not, in Westin's words,
``characterize the conduct'' of Starr's office. That prohibited
Walters from asking questions about last Jan. 16, the day Starr's
lawyers first questioned Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that, in her quest for a new image or
bestsellerdom, Lewinsky has chosen to tell her story first to
Walters, the one TV personality who gives her the best shot at
attaining both goals.
</P>
<P>
   A weepy, confessional interview with Walters has become
virtually de rigueur for celebrities bent on redemption or
newsmakers intent on spin control. Spilling the beans to Walters _
whose subjects include Fidel Castro, Anwar Sadat, Colin Powell, and
innumerable movie stars _ has a cachet Lewinsky could not have
achieved by accepting the offers she got from Roseanne and Oprah
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt the most important thing for the rest of her life was
to establish credibility, and she felt she could do it with ABC and
me,'' said Walters.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Walters will kick off the marketing of
Monica, an effort that will gather steam on March 4, when a book
written by Andrew Morton (with Lewinsky's cooperation) will be
published and a British TV interview of her will air. Westin said
ABC's deal with Lewinsky stipulated that the network's interview
would precede the book and the British interview.
</P>
<P>
   Walters declined to say whether she would have been interested
in an interview with Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who says
that Clinton sexually assaulted her 21 years ago, and who has
reportedly been interviewed by NBC. Westin said an interview with
Broaddrick was ``raised as a possibility'' for ABC News, but ``we
declined.'' ``It's a very difficult subject, it's inflammatory
potentially, it is more than 20 years old, and there have been
conflicting reports about it from the parties involved,'' said
Westin.
</P>
<P>
   Though she insisted the Lewinsky interview was not ``a puff
piece,'' Walters is clearly sympathetic to Lewinsky. ``She is open,
she is expressive, she is sometimes very touching,'' she said,
conceding that ``sometimes, when she describes herself, you realize
she can be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she believes the interview ``puts an exclamation
point, finally, to this year'' of scandal, though she made one
exception. ``Unless the president sits down and does the same
interview, and we'd be happy to do that,'' she said.

 &HT;    Black programming lives beyond February
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The cruelties of February are not limited to sweeps
scheduling, when the networks throw hype, specials and new episodes
against one another. February is also Black History Month, time for
television to suddenly, and somewhat ostentatiously, get on the
bus.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night for example, TBS ran Ted Turner's annual Trumpet
Awards ceremony celebrating African-American accomplishment, with
Bryant Gumbel, Jessye Norman and Smokey Robinson among those
honored. Meanwhile, another Turner channel, TNT, was premiering
``Passing Glory,'' a new movie about black-white relations starring
Andre Braugher. The local UPN affiliate reran Spike Lee's ``Malcolm
X,'' and Showtime had a new drama with Sidney Poitier, ``Free of
Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   Come March, such programming won't dwindle away to nothing, but
you're unlikley to see four such high-profile shows dedicated to
African-Americans opposite one another on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   But some shows built around African-Americans will go on, such
as ``The PJs'' (8:30 tonight on Fox) and ``The Hughleys'' (8:30
tonight on ABC).
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' is that weird Foam-ation show from Eddie Murphy, who
stars as the voice of Thurgood Stubbs, a mean ol' superintendent in
the housing project. Even after six weeks or so on the air, it
still has a startling, disorienting look along with some enjoyable
risks in its content (which also make it iffy for younger
children).
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Thurgood is suffering from high blood pressure, but not
quite high enough to qualify for an experimental drug. So he sets
about trying to raise his blood pressure, salting his fried pork
chop sandwiches more than usual and deliberately seeking out
frustration and aggravation. (The drug, when he gets it, also has
the side effect of acting like Viagra.) Joking about a middle-aged
black man's keeling over from hypertension is far from politically
correct, but ``PJs'' pulls it off by stopping just short of
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys,'' on the other hand, could use a little dash of
mean-spiritedness now and then. Stand-up comic D.L. Hughley has
some vinegar to him, but nowhere to spray it; his wife, Yvonne, and
neighbors are just so darn nice they don't deserve his rants.
</P>
<P>
   So finally, in a two-parter that concludes next week, Hughley
gets a foil who deserves to be squashed: Sherman Hemsley, guest
starring as Yvonne's dad. Twelve years ago, when Darryl and Yvonne
got married, dad almost ruined the wedding, and when the couple
plans to renew their vows in a bigger-bucks ceremony, dad comes
back to sow more discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a sour, mean little troll,'' Hughley spouts off to
Helmsley, who is. ``If the bridge fits, you should live under it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Helmsley's character and Thurgood are so similar in their nasty
bluster, you could put on a blindfold and click back and forth, and
you'd have trouble telling who's who.)

<P>
   Grades: ``PJs'': B

   INDIAN-LAWSUIT _ For nearly a century, American Indians have
been asking the federal government for a simple accounting of money
and land held in trust for them since the days of treaty signing.
On Monday, they finally got the attention of the highest levels of
government, as a federal judge held in contempt two Cabinet
secretaries who oversee Indian trust accounts. In a scathing
denunciation of the government's handling of the trust fund case,
Judge Royce Lamberth of U.S. District Court in Washington, found
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Treasury Secretary Robert
Robert Rubin in civil contempt for failing to produce records of
the trust funds. By Timothy Egan. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET

   BOX-LAILA-ALI (Los Angeles) _ Laila Ali, 21 years old and her
hands already bearing the scars from her early work in the ring,
recently asked for her father's blessing on her decision to follow
in his footsteps. Muhammad Ali, his face an expressionless mask as
the result of Parkinson's disease, dropped his head and paused.
``But I don't want you to get hurt,'' Ms. Ali said her father told
her, his voice barely above a whisper. ``Daddy, I'm not going to
get hurt,'' she said. ``I have your genetics.'' Women's
professional boxing is a sport struggling for stature. While the
number of women in its ranks have grown greatly, female
professional boxing is desperate for true stars, but also concerned

DALEY'S COURTSHIP OF BLACK VOTE IS EXPECTED TO PAY OFF IN
RE-ELECTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an astonishing turnabout from the bitter racial
divisions here a decade ago, Mayor Richard M. Daley appears poised
to win a landslide re-election victory on Tuesday with a big share
of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who won election in 1989 in the most racially polarized
vote in the city's history, is winning more black votes than his
black challenger, Rep. Bobby Rush, according to polls. Those polls
indicate Daley could win 70 percent of the total vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked assiduously to court the black community,'' said
Don Rose, a liberal political consultant here who has worked
against Daley in earlier campaigns. ``And he's done a lot of it
with classic Chicago political wiles _ deals, jobs. He's made
terrific allies.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning black support, Daley has apparently found a strategy
that has eluded many other big city leaders, including Mayor
Rudolph Guliani of New York, whose strained relations with blacks
have worsened with the recent police shooting death of an unarmed
West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, in his first successful bid for mayor, won less than 7
percent of the black vote. At the time, many black political
leaders branded him a racist, a charge that stemmed in part from
bitterness toward his father, the late Richard J. Daley, longtime
mayor and legendary boss of Chicago's fabled Democratic machine.
</P>
<P>
   In that election, one prominent black clergymen villified Daley
as ``pharoah's son,'' and many other black political leaders warned
that City Hall, which had been opened to blacks and other
minorities by Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor,
would revert to a traditional domination by white men, usually with
Irish surnames.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley was smarter than that. He started with a base of
support among the white, working-class who make up the so-called
Bungalow Belt on the Southwest and Northwest Sides, a group that
was unlikely to bolt for any black candidate. To broaden his reach,
Daley has worked from the start of his tenure to cultivate support
among blacks, white liberals, Hispanic voters and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has appointed blacks to key positions, steered
multi-million dollar developments to black neighborhoods and
cleaned up dilapidated sections that had long been neglected. He
has pushed strongly for hiring programs that would enhance racial
diversity in the police and fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered a forceful denunciation of racism and police
brutality after the beating of a young black man in 1997, a case
that angered many police officers, who contended that the man had
started the violent altercation. Daley has also won praise for
improvements in the public schools, where the student body is
mostly black.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's popularity is also riding the crest of the economic boom
that has lifted cities across the country, including Chicago, out
of their financial doldrums. New houses and condominium projects
have been sprouting from glass-strewn parking lots all over the
city, including spruced-up neighborhoods on the South Side that
have become fashionable among prosperous black professionals. A
study by the Woodstock Institute, a non-profit research group here,
found that homebuying among blacks during between 1990 and 1996
grew at a rate of more than 125 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a growing black middle class in Chicago, and they
approve of what Daley is doing,'' said Paul Green, an author of
books on Illinois politics. ``Property values are property values.
People with investments want stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption among some City Council members, including a close
ally to Daley, has not much resonated among voters in Chicago, a
place that has long been accustomed to politicians of negotiable
virtue. And none of the charges of wrongdoing have reached the
mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll published Sunday in the Chicago Tribune,
Daley was garnering 65 percent of likely voters, compared to 13
percent for Rush, with 20 percent undecided. Among black voters,
the poll showed Daley leading Rush 33 percent to 28 percent, with
the remainder undecided. Three-quarters of the voters held a
favorable opinion of Daley, while only 9 percent viewed the mayor
unfavorably. The poll has a potential margin of error of four
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the racial breakdown of Chicago, blacks account for about 42
percent of the population, with whites making up about 38 percent
and Hispanic voters about 20 percent. Chicago has elected just one
black mayor, Harold Washington, a charming, bearish man with a
charisma that set a standard black mayoral hopefuls have found
difficult to approach.
</P>
<P>
   In his longshot campaign, Rush, who had been a member of the
militant Black Panthers in the '60s, has been unable to muster
financial resources, with even most black business interests
supporting Daley.
</P>
<P>
   And with Daley refusing to debate him, Rush has run a
shoe-string campaign that has sometimes tried to win notice by
making strong statements, sentiments that have sometimes had a tone
of stridency and desperation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daley has picked up endorsements from the Chicago Defender, the
city's largest black newspaper, and from some blacks on the City
Council. One of his chief critics as he entered office 10 years
ago, Alderwoman Dorothy Tillman _ a woman once known for fiery
speeches that condemned ``plantation politics'' _ is now viewed as
something of an ally of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who died in 1976, had owed more than one of his
early elections to black support, especially in 1963, when Ben
Adamowski, ran a conservative campaign against Daley. At his peak,
the elder Daley racked up about 90 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   But he became estranged from the civil rights and anti-war
movement in the late '60s and early '70s. During his last primary
election in 1975, he carried less than half the black vote, with
the remainder going to two more liberal rivals, one of them black
and one white.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, the son has Chicago sewn up tighter than his
father ever did. About one-third of the 50 Chicago aldermen were
originally appointed by the younger Daley, people who can be
expected to be steadfastly loyal. Vociferous critics of Daley on
the City Council can be counted on one hand, with a few fingers to
spare.

PATHOLOGIST DETAILS VICTIM'S STRUGGLE IN DRAGGING death 
 
(Eds.: Jury deliberations to begin after closing arguments heard
Tuesday) 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ James Byrd Jr. struggled to the end, contorting
his body in a vain attempt to escape the intense pain as he was
being dragged to death down Huff Creek Road, a pathologist
testified Monday as prosecutors wrapped up their case against a
white supremacist accused of killing the black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Byrd was alive up to the point where he hit the culvert
and his head separated from his body,'' Dr. Tommy J. Brown told
jurors in gruesome testimony that drove some of the victim's family
from the courtroom, along with the defendant's father.
</P>
<P>
   As Byrd changed from one excruciating position to another, his
hands, elbows, heels and knees were ground to the bone, and his
penis and testicles were shredded from his body, Brown told a
hushed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very painful to him, and he was attempting to relieve
the pain by moving from side to side, swapping one portion of his
body for another as he was being dragged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's agony ended when his head slammed into the concrete
culvert, and he was torn in two. The next morning, his mangled
torso was found in the middle of the road outside the gates to a
black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   If jurors believe Brown, they could decide that John William
``Bill'' King, an ex-con from Jasper, both kidnapped and killed
Byrd by dragging him behind a pickup June 7. Both crimes must be
proved for King to be convicted of capital murder and for him to
qualify for a death sentence. His two co-defendants will be tried
later.
</P>
<P>
   King's lawyers presented only three witnesses in their one-hour
defense Monday afternoon. The jury of 11 whites and one
African-American will begin deliberating on King's guilt or
innocence following closing arguments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before resting their case Monday morning, prosecutors also
introduced more handwritten messages from King, 24, including a
note he passed to co-defendant Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr. shortly
after their arrests, bragging that they had ``made history.''
Prosecutors also showed slides of racist graffiti from King's jail
cell.
</P>
<P>
   And as the bells of the Jasper County Courthouse tolled 11 a.m.,
reverberating through the building like a death knell, lawyers for
the state ended their presentation with a dramatic, 11-minute
silent videotape, driving the trail of Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were riveted, clutching booklets containing the color
photos of Byrd's beaten, dismembered corpse. The victim's family
held hands in the front two rows of the courtroom as the video
rolled, showing mile after mile of the winding road through the
Piney Woods east of Jasper. King sat emotionless, chin in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Several quiet minutes passed before the appearance of the
culvert where Byrd's head, shoulder and right arm came off, 2.1
miles from a clearing in the woods where the 49-year-old disabled
man had been stripped and chained to the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, prosecutors produced a jailhouse note or ``kite'' that
King wrote to Brewer shortly after their arrests. The message was
intercepted and photocopied by jailers before being passed on to
Brewer through a trusty nicknamed ``Spiderman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the note, King discussed bloodstained clothing and shoes at
his apartment and explained to Brewer, a former prison buddy, that
prosecutors would have to prove that Byrd was kidnapped in order to
get a capital murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't find us guilty of kidnapping but do find us
guilty of murder, it will be a simple first degree murder, bro,''
he wrote. ``No death sentence!''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the note: ``Seriously though bro, reguardless (sic) of
the outcome of this, we have made history and shall die proudly
remembered if need be ... Gotta go. Much Aryan Love, Respect and
Honor my brother in arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The note was signed ``Seig Heil (Hail Victory), Possum.''
Possum, with the s's drawn as lightning bolts signifying Hitler's
storm troopers, was King's nickname in a racist prison gang, the
Confederate Knights of America. The nickname also was found etched
into a cigarette lighter found at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also saw slides of graffiti from King's cell at the
Jasper County Jail, in which he called a third defendant,
24-year-old Shawn Allen Berry, ``a snitch ass traitor'' for turning
them in to police. King also scratched ``White Pride'' into his
cell door, and left his signature autograph and a triangular symbol
for the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors theorize that King and Brewer, who also belonged to
the Confederate Knights of America, had planned to form a chapter
of the white supremacist organization in Jasper, which they would
call the Texas Rebel Soldiers. Byrd's brutal killing could have
been the initiation rite for the group's first new member, Berry,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   After 4 1/2 days and more than 40 prosecution witnesses, defense
lawyers C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. and Brack Jones Jr. called
prison tattoo artist John Mosley, who testified that white
prisoners in the Beto I prison at Tennessee Colony, either fought
black prisoners or gave them money and sexual favors. King and
Brewer, 31, served time in the unit for burglary from 1995-97.
Mosley is serving 10- and 15-year terms for burglary and sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said many of King's tattoos, earlier characterized as
being racist or demonic, had little meaning in prison. ``Somebody
just got them out of a tattoo magazine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination prosecutors provided a letter Mosley, known
in prison as ``Big Moe,'' wrote to King's girlfriend telling her he
``jammed'' another inmate who was going to testify against King.
The other inmate didn't testify, but Mosley denied threatening him.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Cunningham, who called himself a longtime friend of
King, said King didn't mention his Texas Rebel Soldiers, but did
use racial slurs in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Symmack of Jasper said he hired King to help him put up
metal buildings. He said King would often talk about the Aryan
race, and about the history of the group. ``He seemed to be very
smart,'' Symmack said. ``He was very educated about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Symmack said he and King parted ways when King refused to do
jobs the way he wanted him to. ``He told me to kiss his ass.''

KOSOVO PEACE TALKS HEAD TOWARD DEADLINE UNRESOLVED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _- The Kosovo peace talks at Rambouillet appeared on the
verge of collapse as both the ethnic Albanians and Serbs continued
their opposition for different reasons to an agreement solving the
crisis in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   With the three-day extension to last Saturday's deadline set to
expire Tuesday at 9 a.m. EST, there is a strong sense of deja vu
for frustrated diplomats and a world that has heard the western
powers repeatedly threaten to bomb Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic into comprise.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike last Saturday and last October, when Milosevic's
intransigence tiggered the threat of NATO bombing, it is also the
refusal of the ethnic Albanians to countenance a settlement without
a guarantee of an independence referendum that may scuttle the
six-nation Contact Group's attempt to resolve the bloodshed in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   By rejecting US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's pleas
that they accept a settlement sidesteping a referendum on their
future independence, ethnic Albanian negotiators effectively
neutralized the leverage the western allies wielded over Milosevic
to compromise on Kosovo or face NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has repeated that Serbian military targets would not be
bombed if the ethnic Albanians refused to accept the settlement
brokered by the Contact Group, which consists of the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia. These countries had
assumed that the Albanians would accept the compromise while the
Serbs would reject it.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are equally intransigent, refusing even to discuss the
Contact Group's insistence that 30,000 NATO troops be deployed in
Kosovo to enforce the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The stubborness of the ethnic Albanians was a surprise to the
Contact Group. In fact, diplomats at Rambouillet, the French town
where the talks have been held for the last 16 days, had remarked
privately that the ethnic Albanians were faring well in the deal
considering that the fighting in Kosovo has gone on only for about
a year.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) within the
ethnic Albanian delegation are reported to have fought hard against
provisions in a proposed settlement calling on them to disarm
without the guarantee of a referendum on independence after three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Because some 90 percent of the 2 million people in Kosovo are
ethnic Albanians, the KLA believes passage of such a referendum is
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomats who have supported the compromise, fashioned
largely by Christopher Hill, the US envoy to Kosovo, have concluded
that the only way to satisfy the Serbs is to leave vague the
question of Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, one European diplomat said the only chance for a
settlement was to assume that the Albanian intransigence was a
negotiating tactic that would fade shortly before the deadline.
This change would then put all of the pressure on Milosevic to drop
his opposition to a NATO peacekeeping force. But that diplomat,
like others, was doubtful that such a scenario would occur.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks at Rambouillet remained at an impasse, new fighting
broke out near Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. International
observers reported that a convoy of Serbian military vehicles came
under fire from KLA fighters. The Serbs then shelled several
villages, creating hundreds more of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to appease the Serbs at Rambouillet angered Gabrielle
Kirk McDonald, the American judge who is the president of the
Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal. At a news conference Monday, she
lashed out at reports that the proposed settlement on the table at
Rambouillet does not provide for war crimes prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are suspected of mass killings of unarmed civilians in
a scorched-earth policy aimed at ending KLA support. The most
recent massacre, at Racak last month, left 45 dead and prompted the
Contact Group to convene the peace talks at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely alarmed concerning the pace and the content of
negotiations as I understand them at Rambouillet,'' McDonald said.
``I am advised that significant language has been removed. That in
my mind is a very, very short-sighted and dangerous action. There
can be no lasting peace unless the International Criminal Tribunal
is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   According to State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin, Albright
spoke Monday by telephone with NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and officials in
Tirana, the Albanian capital. That last phone call, diplomats said,
was to persuade officials in the country with which Kosovar
Albanians share a common language and culture to impress upon them
the favorable provisions for them in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin sought to portray the Serbs as the main obstacles to a
settlement. While the ethnic Albanians ``continue to move forward
toward an agreement,'' Rubin said, ``the Serbs are not engaged
seriously on the military part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, meanwhile, appeared to relish the new spin that the
ethnic Albanians posed problems. Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic strolled the streets of Rambouillet, telling reporters
the Serbs were prepared to sign an agreement that gives autonomy to
Kosovo. Milosevic revoked that autonomy in 1989 as part of a
repressive crackdown against ethnic Albanians. That loss in large
part provoked the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright stressed that the Serbs could not accept the
political piece of the settlement without accepting the NATO troops
to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   People in Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, meanwhile, reacted to
the tension in Rambouillet with a collective yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not concerned any more. We are used to it,'' said Maria
Redic, a 21-year-old law student. ``You can't go into someone
else's playground and tell them what to do, and what not to do,''
she said as she waited for one of Belgrade's run-down trams.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily guarded U.S. embassy in Belgrade operated with a
skeleton staff Monday. Provisions have already been made to close
the embassy quickly and have another government guard it in case of
an air assault, said Chief of Mission Dick Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, who personally reported several threats received by the
U.S. embassy, said the Yugoslav police assured him U.S. diplomats
would be protected. ``We could not confirm the reports, but we took
them seriously,'' Miles said, adding that he did not feel
frightened or ``personally threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American sentiment in Belgrade is higher than ever, fueld
by assertions in the state-run media that the West -- the United
States, in particular -- is trying to punish Serbs both by taking
Kosovo away from them and by threatening them with air strikes.

CHANGE IN TASTES PUTS PRESSURE IN LEVI STRAUSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. emerged as the outfitter of the
baby boom. But now, in middle age, boomers don't buy jeans as much
anymore, and their children would sooner listen to the Beatles or
swoon over Marlon Brando than wear the brand of jeans once so
beloved by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids won't go near Levis,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, ``It's not cool to wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of youthful cachet once associated with Levis is only
part of the problem. Fashion shifts to baggier styles and the
saturation of the market with trendier and cheaper jeans also help
explain why the venerable company is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Monday San Francisco-based Levi's, whose brands include Dockers
and Slate, announced it will shut down 11 of its 22 plants in the
United States and Canada and lay off 5,900 workers, or 30 percent
of its North American work force. The cuts will leave Levi's with
14,000 employees in North America and follow the closing of 13 US
plants and elimination of 7,000 jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Levi's rivals have their denim apparel made overseas,
where labor costs are cheaper. Monday's layoffs are part of Levi's
strategy to move more of its operations overseas too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably the last major US-based apparel manufacturer
with a substantial amount of its production still in company-owned
factories in North America,'' Levi's chairman and chief executive
Robert Haas told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   According to Levi's lore, the company sold its first pairs of
jeans to miners and cowboys in the 1870s. In the fashion industry,
however, having a rich corporate heritage may be far less important
than having a brash, youthful attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's had plenty of attitude once. In the 1950s, Levi's denim
was the uniform of the rebel _ a rebel who took fashion cues from
such movie stars as Brando and James Dean. In the 1960s, the
company's jeans became the uniform of the baby boom generation, and
Levi's dominated the market.
</P>
<P>
   Teens in the 1990s want to rebel just as much as the teens of
earlier generations, but they want their own heroes _ and they want
their own jean brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levis now represent the establishment,'' said Mike Toth,
president of Toth Brand Imaging, a Concord firm that has created
ads for the such fashion brands as Tommy Hilfiger and Nautica.
``And (rap star) Snoop Doggy Dogg is today's Brando.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's problems aren't just about being trapped on the wrong
side of a fashion cycle and a generation gap; they're also about a
proliferation of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, there seemed to be only a handful of denim
brands _ Levi, Lee, and Wrangler. And when it came time to buy
jeans, the only fashion decision faced by a consumer was whether to
buy a straight-legged pair of jeans or ones flared to accommodate
cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   But today's denim consumer can select from a variety of brands
and a multitude of fashion choices.
</P>
<P>
   Now vying with older jean brands are many department-store
chains such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co., which
have their own private-label brands of denim clothing. Other
retailers ranging from J.Crew to Brooks Brothers have their own
jean lines. Generally made overseas, these brands are often much
cheaper than a pair of Levis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fashion companies such as Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and
FUBU have been avidly wooing teens and carving out niches from the
larger denim market.
</P>
<P>
   One brand, Unionbay, aims at younger teens into skate-boarding
and other extreme sports. And Gap Inc. has convinced kids that it
can be cool to wear khaki and cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   While rivals experimented with new styles, Levi stuck with the
tried and true. And while rivals looked to cut costs by using
overseas factories, Levi continued to make much of its clothing in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's recent woes are reflected in its financial results. Sales
fell to $6 billion last year, down 13 percent, and its share of the
US jeans market, estimated at just under 15 percent, has been
eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to right itself, Levi implemented big layoffs in Europe
last year and launched new ad campaigns. One taunted denim rivals:
``Our models can beat up their models.''
</P>
<P>
   Another campaign, called ``What's True,'' seeks to win over some
of the teens who now wear rival brands by stressing individualism.
In one ad, featuring a youth sporting dreadlocks and wearing a
baggy pair of Levi's jeans, the punch line is ``Conformity breeds
mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But as it attempts to shift gears, one big question remains: Can
a nearly 130-year-old company win favor with the fickle teens of
the late 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   At Teen Research Unlimited, a suburban Chicago consulting firm
that tracks teen spending patterns, the outlook for Levi's
recapturing its former coolness does not seem promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teens still own a pair of Levis,'' said Jill Kilcoyne,
the firm's research manager. ``But they wear their Levi's just
around the house. When they want to go out and make a fashion
statement, that's when they put on Tommy Hilfiger or FUBUs.''

 &HT;    Yesner appointed acting chief at Carson after death of CEO
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Carson Inc., the Savannah, Ga.-based ethnic personal
products company, faces its second leadership change in eight
months following the death of Chief Executive Gregory J. Andrews
during a business trip to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board named Malcolm Yesner, 41, acting chief
executive, pending a meeting later this week. Yesner has been
Carson's president-international and CEO of its fast-growing Carson
Holdings subsidiary, based in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected Yesner will be a candidate for the job
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, age 47 and a veteran of the personal care products
industry, joined Carson last summer from Colgate-Palmolive. He had
shuffled management and begun an effort to refocus strategy around
core products.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in a statement Monday, said he died of ``apparent
natural causes'' while in South Africa. A spokesman said Andrews
was found in his Johannesburg hotel room after he failed to keep a
breakfast appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Wasik, chairman of Carson's executive committee and
president of Morningside Capital, a major stockholder, said Andrews
``left an indelible mark on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was a man of vision who ... put together an excellent,
experienced and dedicated management team which is fully capable of
carrying out the program he put in place and which was yielding
highly tangible results,'' Wasik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed he was making strides and was really out there
working hard,'' said Baunita Greer, an analyst with Cromwell,
Miller &AMP; Greer. ``This is untimely and unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said Yesner is well regarded for the growth of the South
African unit and for a recent deal to distribute Carson products in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Carson makes such flagship products as Dark &AMP; Lovely, Magic
Shave and AfroSheen. Revenue jumped 50 percent in the third quarter
of 1998, but the company posted a $3.6 million net loss, largely on
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carson in December completed two moves that analysts said
improved its prospects. It got an $83 million loan to cover an
acquisition of Johnson Products hair care line, and it sold its
Cutex nail care unit for $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, however, Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its
rating on some of Carson's debt amid concerns that the company's
financial position may weaken. That followed a decision by Moody's
Investor Service a month earlier to maintain its debt rating
because of what it saw as brighter financial prospects since the
company reduced its debt and got the $83 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   Carson stock was unchanged Monday at $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

 &HT;    Security First lands $14 million
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Security First Technologies got $14 million
and a strong vote of confidence for its Internet financial services
software Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It announced Hewlett Packard has taken a $10 million equity
stake and that Andersen Consulting has added $4 million to the pot.
Security First comes away from the strategic alliance with more
than money. It'll also have the benefit of Hewlett Packard's sales
and marketing clout and Andersen's consulting expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted favorably to the news with Security First
Technologies closing up for the second day in a row at $51.37 1/2
up $3. Hewlett-Packard's ownership in the company ``won't be big,''
said James S. Mahan III, Security First chief executive. Mahan said
he believes Security First offers the solution for consumers who
want to do business on the Web, but needs partners like HP and
Andersen to make the idea a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Security First pioneered online banking in 1995 by launching the
world's first Internet bank. The company began life in the mid-'80s
as a marriage of two components, a banking side and a technology
side. The technology side, originally called SecureWare, grew out
of Georgia Tech's business incubator program. Security First
Network Bank was sold by the company to the Royal Bank of Canada
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan said the Andersen and HP investments will give the company
``unlimited bench strength'' to grow its business.
</P>
<P>
   HP will help Security First develop what the company calls the
``next generation'' of Internet-based financial services focusing
first on North America and eventually expanding globally. The two
companies hope to help everyone from banks to department stores
conduct financial transactions online.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting will work to help financial instutions
develop online business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Doyle, Forrester Research's director of money and
technology strategies, said Monday's deals will strengthen Security
First's position as a leading provider of financial services
software.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mutually beneficial relationship for all parties,
Doyle says, ``but Security First benefits the most. Now they have
HP's sales force marketing their product and Andersen has
Andersen's consultants inside the banks and insurance companies
helping customers make the move to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said the online financial market had plenty of room to
grow. He said of 100,000 households surveyed recently, 3.4 percent
were paying bills and transferring funds online at the beginning of
1999.''By 2003,'' he says, ``Forrester estimates 29 million U.S.
households will be banking online.''

 &HT;    EEOC set to launch mediation program
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hoping to ease its backlog of cases, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission plans to start a nationwide
mediation service to help workers and their bosses resolve disputes
and avoid costly and protracted court battles.
</P>
<P>
   The program was scheduled to be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EEOC's Alternative Dispute Resolution, charges of job
discrimination will be resolved within two months, said William
Snapp, ADR coordinator in Atlanta, which has had a pilot program on
mediation since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it takes EEOC investigators nine months to investigate
a case and at least two years to resolve the ones that end up in
court. Litigating a job bias case often costs a company and the
employee more than $100,000 between them.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation programs will be set up in all 23 EEOC district
offices by the end of the month. In fiscal 1998, 79,591 job
discrimination charges were filed with the EEOC nationwide, down
slightly from 80,680 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of retaliation charges _ when a company takes adverse
action against a worker who has filed an EEOC charge or who speaks
out against job bias _ has increased sharply over the past four
years and accounts for 24 percent of the current charges, Snapp
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cases in Atlanta mirror that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta district office, which covers all of Georgia, had
4,562 job discrimination cases filed last year _ a significantly
higher number compared with other districts, Snapp said. The most
common employment discrimination charges involved race.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having prompt mediation available, we can bring faster
justice to more people,'' Snapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's pilot ADR program mediated 150 cases last year.
Eighty-four of those cases were resolved and included nearly $1
million in monetary relief. The remaining cases are still under
investigation. In 1997, 20 of the 69 cases were resolved and more
than $250,000 was paid in settlements, Snapp said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta program will have six EEOC employees. Outside
mediators _ mostly attorneys _ will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation is the latest effort by the federal agency to address
long-standing problems of red tape and inefficiency. The agency has
been criticized for letting cases languish, sometimes for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, the federal agency has reduced by more
than half the number of pending cases. In October 1998, 52,000
cases were pending, down from 65,000 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta office has made similar reductions,'' said Snapp,
who served as the EEOC's regional attorney handling case
development and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are increasingly using mediation as a way to reduce
workplace conflicts, says Carl Deus, president of Education and
Management Solutions Inc., a suburban Atlanta-based training and
consulting firm that specializes in mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation has its roots in labor-management disputes some 60
years ago and has become widely used, from divorce courts and
custody cases to environmental issues and health care disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The use of mediation has not been without controversy. The
securities industry now requires new employees to sign agreements
to resolve job disputes through mediation instead of the courts,
according to Les Hough, director of the Usery Center for the
Workplace at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have taken mixed views on the industry's
practice,'' Hough said. ``This is a highly controversial issue. Can
one give one's rights up?''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the mediation program, call
404-562-6821.

 &HT;    `Blue' day for Levi as company closes 11 plants
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ San Francisco-based Levi Strauss said it was closing
11 plants in the United States and Canada as it tries to regroup
amid falling demand for its product. A total of about 5,900 workers
will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Following other competitors, the privately owned company said it
would shift production to less-costly plants overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Levi Strauss plants being closed are half the company's
22 plants in North America. The company said the move overseas will
enable it to spend more money on product design and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps are crucial if we are to remain competitive,''
said John Ermatinger, president of the North American division of
Levi Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Raynor, secretary-treasurer of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, or UNITE,
criticized the decision to close the plants. The company employs
6,000 union members.
</P>
<P>
   Raynor blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement between
the United States, Mexico and Canada, saying the pact has made it
easier for companies to move operations to Mexico to take advantage
of cheaper labor to increase profits. Among the companies he cited
were Ralph Lauren, Guess? and Warnaco, owner of Calvin Klein Jeans,
which recently announced plans to move some operations to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that NAFTA would send U.S. jobs to Mexico; retailers
and the apparel industry said no,'' Raynor said. ``Unfortunately,
we were right, and they were lying. North American workers
understand that without equitable trade laws, more jobs that
sustain families will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss hasn't said where it will move its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Levi Strauss, which also makes Dockers and Slates
slacks, fell 13 percent last year to $6 billion, the second year of
disappointing results for the company. Since it is privately owned,
it does not release earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will provide benefit packages to the
laid-off employees, including eight months of regular pay from the
layoff date; up to three weeks of severance pay per year of
service; extended medical coverage up to 18 months, depending on
years of service; and up to $6,000 toward training, education,
relocation, and business start-up expenses.

KOSOVO PEACE TALKS ARE NEAR COLLAPSE AFTER ETHNIC ALBANIANS RESIST
TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also KOSOVO-HARASS) 
(fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France, _ The Kosovo peace talks were on the verge
of breakdown Monday night, as five delegates from the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas refused the exhortations of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to sign an agreement and were not persuaded by a
last-ditch visit from the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spent much of Monday huddled in a small conference room
of the 14th century chateau where the talks are taking place here
trying to sell the peace agreement to the guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army _ who until the talks began two weeks ago had a
hit-and-run insurgency operation in an obscure part of southern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the little-known rebels holding the United
States at bay and undermining the Clinton administration's strategy
for a peace agreement that had been seen as disproportionately
benefiting the ethnic Albanians flabbergasted the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to agree to sign a peace settlement, the guerrillas
were preventing the United States and its allies from pressuring
the guerrillas' enemy, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia,
to agree to allow NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas also appeared likely to be responsible for
putting on hold the movement of thousands of NATO troops, including
more than 2,000 U.S. Marines. The NATO forces are preparing to
enter Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians and Serbs has been battling
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo on Monday, attacks on villages and fighting between
government troops and rebels intensified, and the agency providing
monitors for a fading cease-fire accused Serbian troops of
attacking and harassing monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' main objection to signing appeared to be the
absence of the word ``referendum'' in the political document of the
peace proposal, even though the draft calls for an international
conference to assess the ``will of the people'' at the end of the
three-year interim period. A referendum on independence has been a
rallying cry of the guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been adamantly opposed to the prospect of having
NATO-led troops in Kosovo, and NATO has threatened air strikes if
he does not agree to them.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday night the threat of air strikes appeared virtually
meaningless, and administration officials seemed almost resigned to
folding the talks at the already extended deadline of 3 p.m. on
Tuesday, French time. The European group has not said how the
collapse of peace talks would affect its commitment to keep the
cease-fire monitors in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright left the talks just before midnight on Monday without
an answer from the guerrillas. A senior Western diplomat said they
did not expect a positive one.
</P>
<P>
   Several Western diplomats said they were mortified by the
pleasure that Milosevic _ who had been postulated as the certain
adversary to any agreement _ must be reaping from the unexpected
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go to Milosevic without a yes'' from the rebels. said
a senior Western diplomat. ``We've applied all the diplomatic
tricks in the bag. If we're not there, we try to freeze it and see
where we go.''
</P>
<P>
   After Albright failed to make headway over three days of
meetings with the ethnic Albanians in the elegant chateau here, the
United States decided to call in General Clark, whose military
stature and explanation of what his NATO ground troops would do in
Kosovo was intended to impress the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   He flew from NATO headquarters in Mons, Belgium, to a military
airfield near the chateau here and spent about half an hour with
the five guerrillas late this afternoon, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter between General Clark and the guerrillas did not
go well, the diplomats said. The guerrillas returned to the chateau
to caucus with the other members of the 16-member ethnic Albanian
delegation and to give Albright, who had been left cooling her
heels, a final word during the night.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were far from confident that
the guerrillas would agree to the terms of the settlement even
though the ethnic Albanians have been calling unequivocally for a
NATO deployment as a way to stop the conflict and to protect their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a referendum is important to the rebels because it
is seen as a guarantee of separation from Serbia, of which Kosovo
is now a province. Serbia is one of two republics in Yugoslavia.
Ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But making a referendum part of the peace agreement would ensure
rejection of the peace deal by Milosevic. And a referendum is not
entirely supported by the West, which backs autonomy for Kosovo but
not independence.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have also been unhappy about the demands in the
proposed peace agreement that they disarm over a period of about
six months. They have doubts that this is in their interests, they
argue, when the Serbian police force would be allowed to keep 2,500
members in Kosovo, and the Yugoslav Army would keep 1,500 soldiers
on the borders.
</P>
<P>
   The main opponent to signing the agreement among the ethnic
Albanians was Hashim Thaci, a 29-year-old political science
graduate from a university in Switzerland, who is leader of the
political directorate of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The tall and lanky Thaci is described by Western diplomats who
have dealt with him in Kosovo as tough, enigmatic and ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   He was described by a diplomat who knows him as being
particularly anti-Serb and the only member of the ethnic Albanian
delegation who does not speak Serbian. Like several other members
of the delegation, he does not speak English, making it somewhat
more difficult for the Americans to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of his opposition to a peace agreement was
apparently heightened after he left the peace talks Friday and flew
to Slovenia to meet Adem Demaci, the spokesman for the political
wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army and a hard-liner on the question
of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Demaci refused to attend the peace talks, and diplomats
speculated he had told Thaci to remember that independence of
Kosovo was the immediate goal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   What administration officials perhaps found most frustrating was
their lack of understanding of the guerrillas, a relatively new
group that sprang on the scene last year. Thaci was variously
described Monday as ``Hamlet like'' and ``not understanding the
interests of his people.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hours trickled away on Monday, the American negotiators
desperately tried to come up with a way to get the ethnic Albanians
to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   While the guerrilla constituted only five of the 16 members in
the delegation, their opinions carried far greater weight than
those of the others, diplomats said. One member of the group here,
Ibrahim Rugova, has twice been elected president in Kosovo in
elections that are not recognized by Serbia. But he has had minimal
influence at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Americans thought that they had Thaci isolated
and that they would be able to persuade the rest of the ethnic
Albanian delegation to sign on without him. But then, Jakup
Krasniqi, another powerful member of the insurgents _ whom the
Americans thought they had successfully wooed _ wavered.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere inside the castle on Monday was described as both
chaotic and gloomy, with the chief American negotiator, Ambassador
Christopher Hill, and an assistant secretary of state, Marc
Grossman, approaching members from the Kosovo Liberation Army to
present them to Albright in the conference room.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, diplomats from four European countries and
Russia, which with the United States make up the Contact Group on
the Balkans, which sponsored the talks, waited for what one called
``Madeleine's magic'' to work. But for Albright, who has invested
large amounts of political capital in the success of the talks, the
day was particularly frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a move of final desperation, the American
negotiators appealed to the new Prime Minister of Albania, Pandeli
Majko, to try to persuade the Kosovo Liberation Army to endorse an
agreement. Majko made a public statement urging the guerrillas to
sign and said he would send his foreign minister, Paskal Milo, to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Serbian side of the peace conference, little evolved,
diplomats said. The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine,
visited the castle and talked with the Serbian President, Milan
Milutinovic, who has been designated by Milosevic as his man at the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It had been planned that once the ethnic Albanians agreed to the
peace agreement that attention would turn to Milosevic, who has
remained in Belgrade. But on Monday night any plans to visit him
with a final demand appeared to be on hold.

LEVI STRAUSS TO CLOSE HALF ITS U.S. PLANTS, LAY OFF 5,900 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Tenn., Ga., N.C., Va., Ark., Canada)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., an icon of American culture, announced
Monday that it would close half of its manufacturing plants in the
United States and Canada and lay off 5,900 employees, or 30 percent
of its North American work force.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled jeans maker, whose sales declined 13 percent last
year, to $6 billion, said the move would allow it to compete more
effectively with rivals who largely make their products overseas
and to concentrate on improving the marketing of its jeans, which
have been losing favor among younger consumers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Founded during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s, Levi
Strauss, based in San Francisco, eventually grew to be the largest
maker of blue jeans in the world. And as jeans evolved from miner's
gear into the outfit of movie star rebels and then suburban youth,
Levi's jeans became synonymous with American style.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps complacent about its brand's place in the culture, Levi
Strauss has not responded well to a wave of aggressive competition
in recent years, and its jeans have lost some of their cool. While
Levi Strauss stayed committed to its five-pocket button-fly 501
jeans, which until recently were an integral item to any high
school wardrobe, high-end designers like Ralph Lauren and Tommy
Hilfiger carved out market share with fashionable bell-bottom and
cargo-pants styles. Mid-market retailers like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
and J.C. Penney have also taken a chunk of the giant's sales by
introducing their own low-cost brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our eye off the consumer, and we weren't as nimble as
we should have been,'' said Robert Haas, the company's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company had warned employees several weeks ago that such
cutbacks were imminent. Levi Strauss offered a package of benefits
to its workers worth about $245 million, including features like
eight months' notice, three weeks of severance pay for every year
of service, and an allowance of up to $6,000 for each employee to
reimburse education and retraining costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Raynor, secretary-treasurer of the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, which represents many of the
workers at Levi Strauss plants, said, ``As benefits packages go,
this is as generous as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second round of layoffs for Levi Strauss, which
closed 11 U.S. plants in 1997 and laid off 7,400 workers. But
unlike the first round, which was intended to cut excess
production, this cut heralds an effort to ship production overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Four plants in Texas, two in Tennessee and one each in Georgia,
North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas and Ontario, Canada, will be
closed. Levi spokesman Gavin Power said they would likely be
replaced by ``a network on contract facilities'' in the United
States and in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of its competitors have long ago moved jeans
operations to Asia or Mexico where labor costs are much lower, Levi
Strauss, which posits itself as something of a corporate do-gooder,
has clung to a century-old tradition of manufacturing, at least in
part, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said the closings were a tacit acknowledgment that this
ideology wasn't practical for the current cut-throat environment.
``Certain kinds of work are not going to continue to be done in
America,'' he said. A conscientious employer can do best under
current conditions, he said, by ``not denying reality, as we tried
to do for too long, but by owning up to our obligations to the
workers who've helped us grow and trying to do the best to help
them move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levi Strauss' troubles extend beyond just managing production
costs, however. Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend
Report, explains, ``Levi is one of the best brand names in the
world, but it has lost much of its potency over the last few years.
Its core product has not changed and it is stodgy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Teenage Research Unlimited, there has been a
dramatic drop in the number of 12-to-19-year-olds who named Levi's
as a ``cool brand.'' Jill Kilcoyne, associate director of the
Illinois-based research firm, said that since the fall of 1997 only
7 percent of teens surveyed named Levi's as ``cool,'' whereas in
previous years 15 to 16 percent had. Both Tommy Hilfiger and The
Gap were more frequently bestowed with that hip moniker.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Levi Strauss brands are moribund by any means. According
to the company, which is privately owned and does not usually
release sales figures, Dockers, its casual-line of khakis, had a
record year for both sales and earnings. Slates, a brand of upscale
dress pants, also had a strong year. But the core brand, Levi's,
which accounts for some 70 percent of the business, is clearly
slumping.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said the closings would essentially allow Levi Strauss to
change to a ``marketing company,'' which would focus mostly on
shaping and maintaining brand image.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Bernard of Colton Bernard Inc., a San Francisco-based
industry analyst and consultant, argued that just announcing the
transformation from manufacturing entity to marketing entity isn't
enough. ``They need a different outlook, a different set of
rules,'' he said. ``And I haven't seen it from Levi's yet.''

<P>
   Sometimes I forget to turn off the outside light, the one in the
carport. I'll be all the way to the bedroom door when I sense the
light still on, its glow filtering through windows like a
smoldering fire.
</P>
<P>
   So I turn around and walk back to the front door and flip off
the switch, and everything disappears into darkness. I could turn
on another light to see my way but I never do, not after all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   A step or two from the door I reach out to the bookshelf on the
north wall. The tips of my fingers brush along the spines of
hardbacks, guiding me book by book, shelf by shelf, to a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   I touch the wall as I continue, fingertips reading every little
bump and groove as if they were the Braille of memory.
</P>
<P>
   This house, which we've lived in for a long time, sold after
only two days on the market, and now we have no choice but to move.
</P>
<P>
   We signed papers on a lovely place north and west of here, a
house with more room, as this one's too full of us and our
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   The hallway I walk in is the same one the girl used to lead us
down, in the dark, on Christmas morning; the same one the girl's
younger brother now leads us down, in the dark, on Christmas
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way is the door to the room that used to have bunk
beds in it, but doesn't anymore. And the room that used to be an
office, but isn't anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And the room my mother stayed in during her final visit, the one
we have on tape. She sits on the bed with her granddaughter,
laughing and talking, until she notices the camera in a son's hand
and asks, ``Is that on?''
</P>
<P>
   And he answers, ``No.'' &QL; 
THERE'S MEANING &QL; 
It's an easy home to get around in. It's been that way since the
day I returned to find the woman who usually sits at a computer,
writing newspaper articles, swinging a sledgehammer at a kitchen
wall.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in a house that meant everything to the people who
lived there, and so all the houses I've lived in mean something to
me. Even this house in Phoenix, where homeowners too often are
called transients.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever completely leaves a house.
</P>
<P>
   Houses are vaults for dreams, the walls like sponges absorbing
our stories.
</P>
<P>
   There are names painted on the old grapefruit trees in the back
yard, where the girl first practiced riding a two-wheeler hoping
grass wouldn't skin her knees.
</P>
<P>
   The brick patio in front covers a spot where shade from the
chinaberry tree wouldn't allow grass to grow. On the patio to the
south, near the picnic table, you can make out chips of white paint
on one of the bricks. It's the spot we found Maggie the cat after
she'd been hit by a car. She couldn't quite make it inside. &QL; 
SIGNS OF LIVES &QL; 
Under the carport are the oleanders that just won't die. Out front
are patches of grass that won't quite live. The writer with the
sledgehammer planted the rose bushes and lemon tree. The chalk
marks on the driveway will wash off, eventually. They always do.
</P>
<P>
   I'll drive by here after we leave. I still drive by the
apartment on 28th Street where we first brought the newborn girl.
And the small rental house near the canal in Sunnyslope where she
strolled with her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   On trips back East I visit my old neighborhood, which everyone
says has gone downhill and is too dangerous to visit. But it isn't.
Not if you've lived there and know the ghosts living in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only bricks and mortar we leave behind when we move
from one house to another, not if it's a HOME. It's more like
walking from a sunny spot and having your shadow remain, unwilling
or unable to follow you.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, what you bring to a new house isn't only
furniture and books, clothes and dishes and bicycles. It's all the
memories to come.
</P>
<P>
   I'm learning all over that it's not enough for us simply to have
a place to go when it gets dark outside. It must also be a place in
which we can find our way when the lights go off.

IN 3 RAIDS, ALLIED PLANES HIT TARGETS IN IRAQ NO-FLIGHT ZONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In three separate raids, U.S. and British warplanes
struck targets on Monday in southern and northern Iraq, hitting
communication facilities, missile sites and weapons depots in a
wide swath of territory within the ``no-flight zones,'' according
to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said all three allied attacks were prompted by Iraqi
challenges to allied air patrols of the zones, including the
intrusion of Iraqi MiG warplanes and antiaircraft fire on U.S.
jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein was also trying to
control the third day of protests by Shiite Muslims sparked by the
assassination of one of their leading clerics. Ayatollah Mohammad
Sadek al Sader and his two sons were killed last Friday, and, in
the ensuing protests, Iraqi security forces were reported to have
killed demonstrators, according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The no-flight zones were established to protect the Shiite
minority in the south, and the Kurds in the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assassination follows a period of great and widespread
repression in the South,'' said James B. Foley, deputy spokesman
for the State Department. ``Mohammad al Sader is the fourth senior
Iraqi religious leader to be assassinated in less than a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials were hesitant to draw any
connection between the punishing allied air attacks and the
strength of the Shiite demonstrations following this latest
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protests were triggered by the assassination,'' said
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. ``We need more time to know
if the Shiites have become more emboldened by the air attacks. But
it is clear that since Desert Fox, Saddam Hussein has become more
concerned about internal security.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first attack in the southern zone, U.S. F-15 fighters and
British Tornado jets struck two communications facilities and two
weapons depots near the Iraqi town of Basra, the Pentagon said. The
bombings were in response to two Iraqi MiG crossing into the
no-flight zone.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, the U.S. jets struck a second time, after the
Iraqis fired at them with antiaircraft guns, the officials said.
The allied jets hit targets near the cities of As Samawah, Ar
Rumaylah and Al Kaharm in an arc stretching from 75 miles to 300
miles southeast of Baghdad. The targets of the second attack were
more communications facilities and a surface-to-air missile site,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, U.S. aircraft dropped precision-guided bombs on
Iraqi artillery and radar sites near Mosul after being fired upon
by Iraqi artillery.
</P>
<P>
   All allied planes returned safely to their bases, the Pentagon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a busy day,'' said Lt. Col. Patrick Sevigni, a Pentagon
spokesman. ``But there's no real pattern here, it just kind of ebbs
and flows.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage wrought by this low-level war of attrition on Iraqi
air defenses has been significant, the Pentagon said. Cmdr. Tom Van
Leunen of the European command said that while it is difficult to
assess the full extent of that damage, the bombing raids over the
past two months have destroyed surface to air missile sites,
antiaircraft guns, radar and the communication facilities necessary
to tie together Iraq's integrated air defense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those losses, the Pentagon planners believe the Iraqis
will continue to challenge international patrol of the zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent weeks, the fact that we hit them one day doesn't
mean that the next day will be quiet,'' Van Leunen said.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Serbian police beat and harassed
cease-fire monitors in Kosovo, the monitoring group said on Monday
as reports arrived about attacks on villages and of fighting
between Serbian troops and ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The troops entered a cluster of ethnic Albanian villages near
Vucitrn, 18 miles northeast of the provincial capital, Pristina,
witnesses said. The troops reportedly used tanks to destroy houses
and set fire to others as soldiers and police officers smashed
windows with rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said 4,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, had
fled. The agency said five villagers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Truckloads of soldiers from the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
ethnic Albanian rebel group, also were reported in the area. The
Serbian-run Pristina Media Center said rebels attacked a Serbian
village in the area, killing one person and wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
provides 1,300 monitors to police the increasingly shaky
cease-fire, said it had lodged a strong protest with the Serbian
government.
</P>
<P>
   The group said two monitors were beaten on Sunday in northern
Kosovo, one of a number of violent incidents against its staff. The
monitors, from Lithuania and Luxembourg, were following a police
convoy in their official orange vehicle near Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   Two uniformed officers from the Interior Ministry left their bus
and asked for the monitors' identification and then ordered them
out of the car, the international organization said. When the
monitors refused, the officers punched them several times and
pulled them from their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors were operating under the rules of the cease-fire
that started in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very violent act of aggression and in complete
violation of the agreement we have with the government,' a
spokeswoman for the European group here, Beatrice Lacoste, said.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors, neither seriously hurt, were in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian officers were ``either incredibly undisciplined or
under orders,'' Ms. Lacoste said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have issued a statement condemning the increasing violence
toward our people. It is totally unacceptable and intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has not responded.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment report followed other incidents of police
harassment of foreigners over the weekend in a sign of intensified
aggression, the organization said. The attacks raise questions
about the monitors' safety, with a possibility of NATO air strikes
if peace talks, in France, fail.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors are on alert, ready to leave in eight hours if the
talks break down. For now the monitors continue working, verifying
the cease-fire and the movements of military and security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has assurances from the authorities that the
monitors will be allowed to leave. But after the last few days, few
experts expect a trouble-free evacuation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The heavy fighting of last summer has apparently been reduced by
the presence of the foreign observers. But the people of Kosovo
continue to suffer daily violence, with gunfire and shellfire by
day and stealthy killings by night. The violence has increased in
the last week.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Kosovo, a prosperous farming village, Studenace, was
turned into a ghost town on Saturday after the residents fled
fighting between government troops and rebels. The villagers said
they were frightened by bursts of gunfire and the explosions of
mortars on the edge of the village.
</P>
<P>
   A few men returned on Sunday morning to feed their cows and
chickens. But they said they would not be staying long. Bilal Sopi,
a widower, was already tramping through the mud to join his
relatives, who had taken refuge in the next village.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in a year of fighting that they have been
forced to flee a Serbian army attack, Sopi said. This time, they
hid in the basement for three hours and, then, as the shelling
intensified, joined hundreds of others fleeing on foot or on
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what started the exchange of gunfire. But it
was the heaviest fighting in the district in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accord forged in October by a special American
envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, the two sides clash almost daily. It
is evident that without NATO troops to force them apart, the
conflict could rapidly flare into full-scale war again.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, where 90 percent of the residents are ethnic Albanians,
once had a high degree of autonomy. But Slobodan Milosevic, the
Serbian leader who is now president of Yugoslavia, reimposed
Serbian rule. He sent in the troops last spring as a separatist
rebel movement began gaining headway. The resulting fighting caused
thousands of residents to flee their houses. Serbia is one of two
republics in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Serbian military columns headed by armored cars with
antiaircraft guns are almost the only traffic on the deserted main
roads that cut across and down Kosovo. Heavy weaponry is supposed
to be confined to military bases under the cease-fire. But the
Serbs have largely disregarded their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Few ethnic Albanians dare risk traveling to the towns because
that means passing through Serbian police checkpoints, and the
occasional local bus carries few passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Off the main roads, along the muddy tracks that link farming
villages, armed guerrilla fighters pack into small private cars to
move around, and they appear at ease among the residents.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main points of persistent conflict, and both are
strategic areas for the Serbian forces, Podujevo in northern Kosovo
and Suva Reka in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In both, rebel positions lie within close range of Serbian
positions, and clashes are frequent. The hostilities have denied
the Serbian authorities complete control. The areas they control
south of the capital are largely empty of people, the houses
shell-scarred and burned, and the police posts sandbagged and
heavily guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Villages in rebel territory, by contrast, are swamped with
people. Samodrazae has doubled its size with refugees from
surrounding villages, among them new arrivals from weekend fighting
in Studenace.
</P>
<P>
   No one would go back while the Serbs remained in their positions
a mile away, said Sopi, who transported 17 relatives, including six
children, on his tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example that without NATO troops there will be
no peace,'' he said. ``Look at what happened here.''

GOVERNING PARTY IN MEXICO WINS 2 STATE ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The party of President Ernesto Zedillo won
decisive victories in two state elections on Sunday, showing how
resilient it remains after dominating Mexico for seven decades and
pointing up the vulnerability of a divided opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Quintana Roo, the governing party candidate,
Joaquin Hendricks, won the governor's post with about 43 percent of
the vote, preliminary results showed. The closest contender, Gaston
Alegre of the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution,
known as the PRD, took 34 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The victories in Quintana Roo and a second state, Hidalgo, by
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, were an
indication of its enduring strength in impoverished rural areas
where many farmers depend on the government dole for health care
and agricultural assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Hidalgo, where the countryside is among the most desperately
poor regions of the country, the PRI candidate, Manuel Angel Nunez,
won by 53 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In that election the opposition paid a high price failing to
agree on a single candidate. The conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, refused to unite with the PRD, and both groups lost
ground. The PAN finished with 32 percent of the vote and the PRD
took only 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide polls show that the overall percentage of the PRI,
which has won every presidential election since the 1920s, is
declining and no longer has the favor of the majority. But it
continues to win elections, in spite of frequent accusations of
corruption, because the two major opposition parties split the
anti-government vote.

THE BODY TAKES ON THE PRESS. NO CONTEST.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, former pro wrestler,
political newcomer and emerging media star, took on the Washington
press corps on Monday. It was a body slam.
</P>
<P>
   In a luncheon speech at the National Press Club, Ventura brought
his plain-speaking, tough-guy, outsider style to the
inside-the-Beltway crowd and tweaked the political establishment at
every opportunity. The crowd loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point now with the press that when I say a
joke, I look at them and say, `That was a joke' _ so that they
understand it,'' Ventura said to the roars of a sold-out audience.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor, known as Jesse ``the Body'' Ventura in his
wrestling days, stunned political forecasters with his
come-from-behind win in a three-way race in November. The colorful
Minnesotan, a member of the Reform Party founded by Dallas
billionaire Ross Perot, has since captured the public imagination
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was in Washington for the winter meeting of the National
Governors Association. The media throng that follows his every move
was rivaled only by the equally intense swarm that follows Texas
Gov. George Bush, a front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are bonding,'' Bush said of Ventura when asked about
the ``other'' celebrity governor as the state executives' afternoon
session was about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good man,'' Bush went on. ``We had a great visit on the
bus on the way to the White House. As you know, we hammed it up for
the cameras a little bit. He's a breath of fresh air. I like him a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and Bush did not see much of each other during the
weekend, but they seem to have hit it off. After the governors
visited President Clinton at the White House yesterday, Ventura and
other state leaders filed into a waiting bus to return to their
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush tarried with reporters, prompting the waiting governors
to dispatch the imposing and still well-built Ventura to fetch the
Texan. ``Come on, George, you got places to go,'' he said, making
his way to Bush's side. Bush introduced his new friend to the Texas
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Texas press corps?'' Ventura asked. ``Well, I
haven't met a Texan yet that hasn't told me about drinking dirty
water from a hoofprint. That's John Wayne from True Grit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to Bush's relief, Ventura told the press club luncheon
that he would not run for president in 2000 but left open the
possibility of a later run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a commitment to the state of Minnesota that I wanted to
be their governor for four years. ... But 2004? Well, who knows?''
Ventura said. ``I could end up down the street here in that big
white house, or I could end up living in a hut on the beaches at
Kona,'' in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and Bush attended a dinner at the White House Sunday
night with the other governors. The Minnesotan, who has often been
critical of President Clinton, seemed overwhelmed by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased last night, my wife and I, to make our
first trip to the White House. And it was exceptional. It humbles
you. It makes you feel good you're an American,'' Ventura told the
press club audience.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to relate how he and his wife danced next to Clinton
and the first lady and the four of them later discussed Ventura's
first proclamation _ last week's Rolling Stones day, honoring the
veteran rock 'n' roll band's performance in his state. The governor
has a personal connection to the Stones _ he used to be their
bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was not so kind to lobbyists, another favorite target.
``I come with no strings attached,'' Ventura said as he motioned
with his hand over his head.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesotan, elected on a shoestring budget of $400,000,
credited his name recognition for his success but called for
campaign finance reform to help other would-be politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer the question whether someone else can do it,''
he said. ``But I think what it does tell me is that in order for
someone else to do it we need campaign finance reform and we need
it badly.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took a jab at the major political parties. ``I think I
was a wake-up call to them,'' Ventura said of the Democrats and
Republicans. ``If I am not a wake-up call to them, I think they're
going to suffer more losses.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was not going to take a leading role in
developing the Reform Party, adding: ``I have a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about more wrestlers running for office, Ventura said,
``Well, look at it this way. We've got certainly enough lawyers
there, and look what they've done. I don't think the wrestlers
could do any worse.''

 &HT;    Bush skips media corps to talk with new political friends about
plans
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The voice rumbled through the frigid air like the
engine of one of the buses parked in the White House driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on George, we got places to go,'' former pro wrestler and
current Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura growled to his new friend,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, when the latter lingered on the lawn
after a governors' meeting Monday with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Ventura, Bush and his possible presidential bid
are dominating discussion here at the National Governors'
Association meeting. But while Ventura has played to the national
media, appearing on a Sunday morning television talk show and
donning a feathered and fringed leather jacket for the cameras,
Bush has declined talk show appearances and interviews with
national reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather talk to the Texas press _ that's what my job is,''
Bush said during a discussion with Texas reporters in his hotel
suite. ``I'm more interested in fulfilling my obligations to people
in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the nation's only Reform Party governor, continued
headline-hunting Monday with a luncheon speech at the National
Press Club. He warned Democrats and Republicans that his improbable
win last November could be the harbinger of political things to
come. ``If I am not a wake-up call to them, I think they're going
to suffer more losses,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is corralled by a mob of reporters whenever he enters
or leaves a meeting, has avoided political predictions of any kind.
Of himself, he would only repeat that he is ``warming to the task''
of a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, another potential Republican White House
contender bowed out. Former California Gov. Pete Wilson, who made a
brief race for the 1996 presidential nomination, said he was
``compelled to conclude that it is just not practical to pursue a
candidacy'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson made no mention of Bush, but Sean Walsh, the
ex-governor's press aide, called the Texas governor a ``fresh,
interesting candidate on the national scene'' and said Bush's
popularity was a strong factor in Wilson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing _ not Wilson's exit, not the increasing support from
his fellow Republican governors and not polls showing him running
ahead of probable Democratic nominee Al Gore _ has moved Bush to
make any definitive statement about getting into the race.
</P>
<P>
   He remains officially undecided, but could form an exploratory
committee within weeks to begin raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behave yourself,'' he told a reporter who asked whether he was
measuring the White House windows for drapes during the meeting
with Clinton. ``I didn't take any silverware either.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bush has been talking to his fellow GOP governors,
and perhaps others, about his presidential prospects. The governor
has skipped some of the official events to meet with unidentified
people about unspecified topics _ fueling speculation that he is
talking to GOP strategists and fund-raisers about a White House
bid. On Monday afternoon, he ducked out of an education seminar for
meetings on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush coyly deflected questions about a mysterious Saturday night
dinner, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't remember,'' he replied when asked about his dining
partner or partners. Bush wouldn't even reveal where he ate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you a hint: You ever heard of a Big Mac?''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush appears to enjoy the media attention he's
gotten at the conference _ for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say that the rumors I'm hearing around here are totally
ridiculous,'' Bush said of capital speculation about youthful
indiscretions he has acknowledged but declined to catalogue. ``I
would hope that the Washington press corps would be careful about
gossip and rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also isn't enamored of the abstract policy discussions that
have dominated the official agenda here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the old four corners in basketball before the
time clock: We just keep passing the issue around but nothing gets
resolved,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   As his old Harvard business school Professor Michael Porter
droned on about ``economic cluster-building'' at one Sunday morning
seminar, Bush spent much of the time whispering with his friend
Gov. John Engler of Michigan. When Porter mentioned Engler by name,
Bush quickly clammed up, straightening in his chair like a guilty
schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   Even such policy-wonking sessions didn't offer a respite from
The Question. Engler has been talking to other GOP governors about
a Bush presidential bid, and he said Monday that ``indications are
good'' that Bush would earn the support of a majority of his GOP
colleagues if he decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you noticed today, but a couple of governors
came over in the midst of the discussion _ and they weren't telling
me to straighten my tie,'' Bush said. ``They were saying, 'What are
your plans?' and I was telling them about where I am in the
decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Clinton offered more in the way of policy
specifics. Bush said the president and the governors discussed
whether the federal government should kick in more money for the
special education programs it mandates. They also talked about the
tobacco settlements won by Texas and other states, with the
governors urging Clinton not to let the federal government take any
of that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was warning all along that the federal government may want
to get their clutches on some of the money I think ought to stay in
the state,'' Bush said. ``Now that we've got the settlement in
place, I'm strongly in favor of it staying in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Bush has made a new friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are bonding,'' he said of Ventura. ``He's a breath of
fresh air.''

TOLL-FREE NUMBER WILL HELP ENROLL CHILDREN IN HEALTH-INSURANCE
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed at an increase in the number of people
without health insurance, President Clinton will announce on
Tuesday that he is establishing a national toll-free telephone
number to enroll children in Medicaid and in a separate new health
program for people under the age of 19.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number is 877-KIDS-NOW (877-543-7669). Callers will be
automatically connected to the Medicaid agency or the health
department of the state they are calling from. They may then obtain
free or low-cost health insurance for their children. Many states
allow families to apply by mail.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Congress created the Children's Health Insurance
Program, and in December 1997, Clinton ordered a major effort to
locate and sign up millions of children who were eligible for
Medicaid. But the erosion of health insurance coverage has
continued, as poor families, the Clinton administration and state
officials have not fully exploited the potential of the two
programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the president and leaders of the National Governors'
Association will announce steps to reverse that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a Democrat who is chairman of
the association, and Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican,
said the telephone hotline could help millions of families. State
officials said they had been hiring people to answer calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says that at least 10.7 million children have
no health insurance. The White House says that half of them are
eligible for Medicaid or the new insurance program, but have not
enrolled in either program and are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has enlisted many businesses and broadcasters in
a campaign to increase enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart will put the toll-free telephone number on its shopping
bags, diaper boxes and pharmaceutical products. General Motors will
put labels with the number on child safety seats. NBC, ABC, Black
Entertainment Television and Univision, the Spanish-language
network, will run television and radio advertisements publicizing
the number. And the government will run radio spots in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in federal welfare policy, including the landmark law
that Clinton signed in August 1996, have increased the number of
poor people without health insurance, experts on health policy say.
</P>
<P>
   The number of welfare recipients has plunged 35 percent since
the law was signed. Children are often eligible for Medicaid after
they lose cash assistance, but many parents do not know that their
children may still qualify for Medicaid, and state officials do not
always assess eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan M. Stein, a lawyer at Community Legal Services in
Philadelphia, said: ``State and federal governments have failed to
carry out federal laws that mandate a continuation of Medicaid
coverage for most families leaving welfare. In Pennsylvania, tens
of thousands of parents and children should have been continued on
Medicaid, but have been erroneously terminated, without any active
intervention by the federal government.'' Federal officials said
they were looking into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Salo, a Medicaid specialist at the National Governors'
Association, said it was proving difficult for caseworkers to
reconcile the contradictory messages implicit in the 1996 welfare
law: that ``welfare is bad, everyone should stay off welfare,'' but
``Medicaid is good, everyone should stay on Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a longtime advocate for people with
mental retardation, said she was ``very concerned'' that federal
Medicaid officials had not enforced the law that guarantees
continuation of Medicaid coverage for disabled children who lost
cash assistance in the last two years. Because of inaction by the
federal government, Mrs. Shriver said, thousands of children in
Louisiana and other states have lost medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the federal government is establishing one telephone
number for its campaign to ``insure kids now,'' the eligibility
criteria vary widely from state to state. For example, information
posted on the Internet says a child may qualify for insurance under
New York's Child Health Plus program if the family has an income
under $31,980 a year. But the comparable figures are $40,950 for
Connecticut; $13,650 for Texas and Mississippi; and $27,300 in New
Jersey, Florida and California.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people without health insurance increased an
average of 1 million a year in the last decade and now exceeds 43
million, after a particularly sharp rise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   These increases occurred even though the government has an
extensive safety net intended to guarantee medical assistance for
low-income families:
</P>
<P>
   --Under federal law, if a family loses welfare because of
increased earnings from employment, the family is supposed to
remain eligible for Medicaid for six months ``without any
reapplication'' for benefits. Moreover, the state must offer
another six months of Medicaid if the family reports its income.
</P>
<P>
   --Under federal Medicaid rules, a state must ``continue to
furnish Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals until they
are found to be ineligible.'' Thus, federal courts have said, if a
family loses cash assistance, the state may not automatically end
Medicaid coverage, but must, on its own initiative, determine
whether the family might qualify for Medicaid on some other ground.
</P>
<P>
   --Under the 1996 welfare law, states must provide Medicaid to
anyone who would have qualified for welfare under the eligibility
rules in effect in July 1996. States may adopt new, more
restrictive eligibility standards for welfare, but many families
ineligible for cash assistance under those standards will be
eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data from the Census Bureau, issued in September,
shows trends that worry many health policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of children with no health insurance of any kind
increased to 15 percent in 1997, from 13.8 percent in 1995, when
many states began cutting their welfare rolls. The proportion of
poor children with no health insurance rose to 23.8 percent in
1997, from 21.4 percent in 1995.

 &HT;    Anthrax scare empties offices hit by '97 bomb
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The office building targeted with an abortion clinic
bomb two years ago got a scare Monday from an envelope that
resembled others containing anthrax hoaxes and sent to other U.S.
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at Compassionate Services called police about 10:30
a.m. Monday to report that a suspicious letter _ which remained
sealed _ had arrived at the office building.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate Services is an administrative office for Atlanta
Northside Family Planning Services, the abortion clinic bombed in
January 1997. It had received a fax bulletin last week from a
feminist group, warning of letters from ``PAACO Surgical
Instruments,'' which when opened contain threats of anthrax
exposure. At least 14 abortion clinics and Planned Parenthood
centers have received similar letters in the past week, including
one Monday in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicious letter in Sandy Springs, a suburb northeast of
Atlanta, listed ``PAACO'' as the sender. Authorities evacuated the
Sandy Springs Professional Building for nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a police car, then the fire engines. I said, `Oh, no,
what's going on now?''' said businessman Dan Katz, whose office has
been in the building for five years and is next to Compassionate
Services. ``It's such an inconvenience. It ties up your day.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hazardous material units turned the envelope over to an
FBI agent, who carried it away in a sealed clear plastic bag. It
was sent to be tested, but the FBI reported no findings.
</P>
<P>
   While employees milled about outside, the scene was a reminder
of the double bombing that occurred at the same three-story office
building Jan. 16, 1997. Some of the same police and firefighters
were there in 1997 when a second bomb exploded in the parking lot.
That bombing plot, along with the Centennial Olympic Park bombing
and others, has been tied by police to Eric Rudolph, now believed
to be on the lam in the North Carolina mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, Atlanta Northside, moved to an undisclosed location
outside Sandy Springs after the bombing, but Compassionate Services
provides administrative support.
</P>
<P>
   An anthrax hoax had the metro area on edge Feb. 4, when a letter
sent to the NBC news bureau in a Midtown office building purported
to carry the deadly bacteria.

SPORTS COLUMN: STEWART SAYS CLEMENS HAS OCTOBER BAGGAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ From the rear of a David Wells news conference
in which the only news was that Wells showed up, Dave Stewart
wasn't saying he preferred Wells on his pitching staff to Roger
Clemens. He merely wanted to point out that while Toronto now has a
proven postseason pitcher to anchor its staff, the Yankees may have
acquired, along with their five-time Cy Young Award winner, some
potential October baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Roger hasn't proved anything yet in a
postseason,'' Stewart said Monday, hiding two of the steeliest eyes
major league hitters have ever seen behind a pair of wraparound
shades. ``He hasn't been in the postseason in a while and when he
was, his teams weren't that successful. Fact is fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we blame the ace when his team gets hammered by a
superior opponent? Blame is too strong a word for what Stewart, in
his new role as the Blue Jays' assistant general manager, was
suggesting. Which was that Clemens has indisputably failed several
times to alter the playoff fate of the Boston Red Sox, to take the
ball and rise to a level that can't be measured by earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was just egotistical, but I always felt that I could
be and was the difference,'' said Stewart, a World Series winner in
Oakland and Toronto. ``Roger wanted to go someplace and be part of
something already set.''
</P>
<P>
   There is history between Stewart and Clemens, all of it, for
Clemens, ranging from annoying to depressing. A decade ago, Stewart
believed he deserved the Cy Young awards that Clemens was winning,
and turned their every matchup into Game 7. Stewart already had a
run of seven straight victories against Clemens, on Oct. 11, 1990,
a bizarre playoff afternoon in the bright sunshine of the Oakland
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Obscured somewhat in the excruciating way the Red Sox lost Game
6 of the 1986 World Series to the Mets was that Clemens didn't
exactly howl in anger over his removal with the lead, three innings
away from winning it all. Bostonians have their opinions, their
theories, but, above all, Clemens was young. It was his first
October.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he didn't have that excuse when, ahead of the
A's and Stewart by 1-0 in Game 1 of the League Championship Series,
he handed the ball without protest to, gulp, Larry Andersen. The
Red Sox promptly surrendered that game, the next two and went back
to Clemens, on three days' rest, facing Stewart again and a
four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely hyper that whole series, Clemens, a Red Sox coach
mused that day, was to the point of complete distraction. With a
run in in the second inning, his fastball not humming, Clemens
walked Willie Randolph on a 3-1 pitch that was clearly high, and
picked an argument with the umpire, Terry Cooney. They exchanged
the standard taunts, but Clemens soon after erupted with a string
of obscenities. Cooney ran him from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart will do everything but sign a sworn affidavit to the
charge that this was clearly a case of Clemens shouting, a la
Duran, ``No mas.'' ``Something happened,'' he said. ``He blew.''
Stewart called it ``one of the worst things I've seen in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the postseason ace, he said, is assuming responsibility
for all. It's the service game you can least afford to lose. You
battle. You scratch. You stick around. From the San Diego bench,
Stewart, the Padres' pitching coach, watched Wells do exactly that,
without his best pitch location, in Game 1 of the Series last year.
``He pitched deep enough into the game,'' he said. ``The cavalry
came. Once you get to the postseason, you just try to find a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want to overdo the Psychology 101 _ ``I'll let you
decide,'' he said _ but there had to be a reason why Clemens, after
choosing Toronto's free-agent cash over George Steinbrenner's two
years ago, suddenly found the now-dominant Yankees to his liking
when exercising his contractual trade demand. The Yankees were not
his childhood dream, as they were for the crestfallen Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's trying to get anyone to carry him,''
Stewart said. ``That's tough to say. But I question it, not because
I'm with the Blue Jays but because, competitively, I pitched, I won
and helped build a club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This club here is so close to winning. If I've got the
opportunity to be the difference between winning and losing, I'm
going to go for that. There's more in that for me. He's great, a
Hall of Famer, but how much more can he add to the Yankees?''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Clemens can throw his October baggage on
board, and take a smoother postseason ride.

FREE TO SPEAK, SORT OF, LEWINSKY GIVES A LONG-SOUGHT INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally unmuzzled by the independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, Monica Lewinsky gave her exclusive interview to Barbara
Walters of ABC News on Saturday, although she was not permitted to
talk about the conduct of Starr's staff members toward her, ABC
executives said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under her immunity agreement with Starr, Ms. Lewinsky had to get
his permission to speak to any journalist. Ms. Walters and David
Westin, the president of ABC News, said in a telephone news
conference on Monday that Ms. Lewinsky had gained that permission
after agreeing to certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to not talking about the conduct of the independent
counsel's office, they said, she was forbidden to contradict any of
her grand jury testimony or to discuss any potential future legal
proceedings. She was also required to have a lawyer present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said Ms. Lewinsky was not allowed to describe the
events of the night of Jan. 16 when she was first questioned, for
hours, by prosecutors and the FBI. ``However,'' Ms. Walters said,
``everything that happened that night is a matter of record now,
and is something we can talk about,'' referring to plans to weave
taped segments into the interview to fill in parts of Ms.
Lewinsky's story.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said Ms. Lewinsky had been ``very full and frank
about her emotions'' concerning the night of Jan. 16 and concerning
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The interview will be broadcast on Wednesday, March 3, from 9 to
11 p.m. ET on the program ``20/20.'' It took place at an ABC News
studio in New York, and lasted about three and a half hours,
interrupted by a lunch break. Westin said that the lawyer for Ms.
Lewinsky, Sidney Hoffman, had been on the set, ``at some distance,
but able to hear,'' and raised no objections during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said one answer from Ms. Lewinsky had surprised her.
Asked what was the toughest question she faced last year, Ms.
Lewinsky said it had come from a grand jury member who wanted to
know why she had a history of relationships with married men.

CIA PLACED SPIES AMONG WEAPON INSPECTORS IN IRAQ SOON AFTER GULF
WAR, BOOK SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 By PHILIP SHENON 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA began placing American spies among U.N.
weapons inspectors in Iraq only a year after the end of the Persian
Gulf war of 1991 and worked closely with the United Nations to
organize the inspections, a former arms inspector says.
</P>
<P>
   The former inspector, Scott Ritter, said in a new book that he
and a senior CIA official operating under an assumed name had
planned some of the largest and most complex inspections undertaken
by the United Nations and that the United Nations inspection teams
had included ``CIA paramilitary covert operatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a coup attempt against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
in June 1996 coincided with the presence of a U.N. inspection team
that included nine CIA officials. Ritter, who does not provide
documentation for all of his conclusions and who has been
criticized repeatedly by the Clinton administration, speculated in
his book that the intelligence agency might have orchestrated the
timing.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritter praised the agency's employees as ``the kind of
people you want around you in a difficult situation,'' the book,
``Endgame,'' supports the Iraqi allegation that the United Nations
inspections teams were riddled with American spies almost from the
start. Saddam has accused Ritter of being one of the chief spies,
but Ritter has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have acknowledged that the CIA gave assistance to
the United Nations inspections program and provided specialists to
work on the inspections teams. But Ritter makes clear that the
agency's involvement was far more extensive _ and began earlier _
than previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   The book, scheduled for publication in April, is harshly
critical of the Clinton administration and especially of Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright. She is depicted as having fought
strenuously last year to have Ritter removed from leading an arms
inspection team because he was considered too aggressive in dealing
with the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has dismissed Ritter's criticism in the past, insisting
that he ``doesn't have a clue'' about American policy toward Iraq.
The CIA and the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, or
Unscom, which is responsible for the inspection teams, said they
had no immediate comment on the book.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which demanded only last week that
Ritter turn over a copy of the book for a security review before
publication, would not comment Monday on whether it was considering
legal action to block distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ritter provides a detailed description of his work
for the United Nations, which began in 1991 and ended last summer
when he resigned in part in protest over what he described as the
Clinton administration's meddling in the work of the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In repeated interviews since his resignation, Ritter has alleged
that the administration hindered the arms inspections out of fear
of direct confrontations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter says in the book that the CIA became actively involved in
inspections in 1992, the year after the United Nations began
weapons inspections in the search for evidence of chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he says that he and a senior CIA official _
identified in the book by a pseudonym, Moe Dobbs _ worked closely
together ``to plan the operational and intelligence support for the
largest and most complex inspections ever undertaken by Unscom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that beginning in the spring of 1992, ``Dobbs and
his men provided seasoned personnel who could operate vehicles,
organize logistics, run communications _ simply put, the kind of
people you want around you in a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency played its largest role, he said, in an inspection in
June 1996, when nine ``CIA paramilitary covert operators'' were
placed on a team seeking to inspect compounds maintained by the
elite Iraqi Republican Guards. The compounds were believed to be
hiding evidence of Iraq's programs to build chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis tried to block the inspection, resulting in a
standoff that lasted several days and brought swift condemnation of
Iraq by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, Iraqi dissidents made a coup attempt against
Saddam. The coup failed, and Ritter said he later became suspicious
of the timing of the coup attempt and of the presence of an Unscom
inspection team that included several of the agency's employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no proof of Dobbs' involvement, but there was a
strong set of coincidences,'' he said. ``The inspection was
directed almost exclusively at Special Republican Guard sites; the
coup plotters were from some of the same units were were trying to
inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   While working for the United Nations, Ritter, a former Marine
intelligence officer, was paid by the Defense Department; he was
considered to be on loan to Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reminded Ritter of his responsibilities, and we just
leave it at that,'' said David Rigby, a spokesman for the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, the Pentagon agency that had Ritter under
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has argued that under his contract, Ritter is
required to submit the book for a security review if it contains
any information, classified or unclassified, about his work for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter and his lawyer have said that the Pentagon's demand is an
effort to intimidate him into silence and that the contract cannot
be enforced since it expired last year.

FROM BOSNIA TO KOSOVO, CLARK IS THE POINT MAN FOR PEACE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Gen. Wesley K. Clark became NATO's supreme allied
commander in Europe in 1997, well after the alliance had begun the
biggest military operation of its 50-year history, but it was not
the war with invading Soviet forces that NATO was designed to deter
or fight. Instead, it was a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   He is a West Point graduate _ first in his class _ and a Rhodes
scholar from Arkansas like his commander in chief, President
Clinton. And Clark, 54, could soon be presiding over another NATO
peacekeeping mission in the Balkans, in the overwhelmingly
ethnically Albanian Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he flew to a French air base near Rambouillet, where
negotiations on a settlement between Kosovo's ethnic Albanians and
the government are nearing a climax, to explain to both sides what
the peacekeepers would do.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he was called on to go to Belgrade to explain
something else to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, in
which Serbia is one of two republics. He told Milosevic what NATO
could do to his military installations, using the more than 400
aircraft it has ready to strike, if he refuses to accept an accord,
including provisions for the NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   And he was prepared to explain to the Kosovo Albanians that if
they agree to settle for autonomy instead of the independence for
which the rebels have been fighting, 28,000 peacekeepers will try
to make sure they get the chance to make autonomy work without fear
of Serbian attack.
</P>
<P>
   Clark knows something about tense military-civilian standoffs,
going back to the days of his youth in Little Rock, Ark., when the
Eisenhower administration sent in the National Guard to enforce
desegregation. He honed his own persuasive powers at Oxford
University, where he studied politics, economics and philosophy,
and at the National War College.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Gertrude Kingston of Brooklyn, N.Y.
They have one son, Wesley, who lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has the broad shoulders of the swimmer that he is, and
stands out in a crowd because of his intense energy, expressed in a
deep command voice with only the trace of an Arkansas accent.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Holbrooke, the American diplomat who worked closely
with Clark to produce the accord on Bosnia in 1995, wrote in his
book, ``To End a War'' (Random House, 1998), ``Clark's boyish
demeanor and charm masked, but only slightly, his extraordinary
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark himself wrote the part of the Bosnia peace agreement that
provided for the peacekeeping force there. It gives the commander
``authority, without interference or permission of any party, to do
all that the commander judges necessary and proper, including the
use of military force.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke later criticized American military leaders in Bosnia
for not using that authority to protect civilians and to arrest
people indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by coincidence or not, NATO arrested the first such
suspect just as Clark took over as supreme allied commander in
1997. But the biggest names on The Hague's most-wanted list, the
Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, are
still at larg.
</P>
<P>
   Clark warns that time is running out in Bosnia. With the clock
ticking, he is using his authority to try to help as many displaced
Bosnian refugees as possible get back to the homes they were forced
to flee or driven out of when ethnic tensions flared into open
fighting in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown impatience with the lack of progress by the Muslim,
Serb, and Croat communities in Bosnia in carrying out the peace
accord's provisions for allowing refugees and displaced persons to
return to their homes in the areas they control.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees in Geneva,
only 550,000 of the 2 million people driven out of their homes by
ethnic cleansing and fighting went back in the first three years of
peace in Bosnia. Of the 1 million who would find themselves
outnumbered by members of other ethnic groups if they returned, the
agency reported, only 60,000 had gone back home so far.
</P>
<P>
   Flying into the divided Bosnian city of Mostar recently, Clark
urged military commanders and civilian officials in the region to
work as fast as possible to make sure that as many of the expected
50,000 returning refugees in the area were able to reoccupy their
homes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People whose lives have been disrupted for seven years deserve
to finally get to go home,'' he said. ``Our goal is that after this
year, it will no longer be possible for those who support
ethnically separate communities to believe that they can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   To local reporters gathered at the still-sandbagged airport
runway in Mostar, he said that any new peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo would not mean any less effort in Bosnia this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep doing our job in Bosnia,'' he said. ``It's
a different country, it's a different problem, and there will be
different troops for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's own judgment of his performance in Bosnia seems to
depend on whether more displaced people are able to return home
this year. He told international civilian authorities on his trip
to Mostar that his troops would give them all the support they
could to get refugees flowing back this spring. The aim, he said,
was to create so much momentum by March that the process would be
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   But how many peacekeepers will remain in Bosnia next year is
uncertain. The United States is currently reducing its contingent
in the force from 6,900 to 6,200, down from about 20,000 three
years ago, and France and Britain would be hard-pressed to maintain
the several thousand each they now have in Bosnia and send 6,000
and 8,000 troops, respectively, to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, an officer commanding armored vehicles who got his first
combat experience in Vietnam, is acutely aware that the military
can only provide the security that the civilian authorities need to
make real peace and to build political institutions. The military
cannot do that by itself, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Clark commands NATO's military operations from his headquarters
near Mons, Belgium, as well as the activities of all 100,000
American troops based in Europe as commander in chief of the United
States European Command. His headquarters for that operation is
near Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In that job, he points out to visiting American civilians, he is
already in charge of some American combat missions _ the hazardous
flights over northern Iraq from air bases in Turkey.

<P>
   BOSTON _ 3Com Corp. says it will acquire NBX Corp., an Andover
developer of telephone systems that run on local area networks, for
$90 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will enable 2 1/2-year-old NBX to expand the marketing
and sales of its systems with 3Com's extensive product distribution
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Since it allows voice and data to be transmitted through the
same wires, the NBX system can significantly reduce companies'
costs by eliminating the need for separate telephone and computer
system lines.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at 3Com say the market for local area network
telephone systems is rapidly expanding. ``The local area network
telephone market space is growing 80 percent a year and will
generate sales of $5 billion by 2003 and our acquistion of NBX gets
us a market leader,'' said Edgar Masri, senior vice president and
general manager of 3Com's enterprise business unit based in
Southborough.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement represents 3Com's first acquisition in
Massachusetts in nearly three years. The company acquired Chipcom
Inc. of Southborough and several other companies in Greater Boston
over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Masri said 3Com does not expect to lay off any of NBX's 87
employees, although some may be offered jobs at the company's new
East Coast headquarters in Marlborough, which will be formally
opened next month. 3Com currently employs more than 1,000 people in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   NBX, which received $16.5 million from four venture capital
funds, will become part of 3Com's enterprise business unit. Daniel
Massiello, who joined the fledgling company in February 1997 as
president and chief executive will now report to Masri.
</P>
<P>
   NBX has sold more than 100 telephone systems, which have an
average price of $12,000, since November. The company's products
compete against others by Lucent Technologies Inc. and Northern
Telecom Ltd., said Edward Wadbrook, NBX vice president of product
management.
</P>
<P>
   Wadbrook said that NBX had been seeking a corporate partner to
distribute its telephone systems, which operate by sending packets
of digitized voice and data over local area networks and Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was announced after the close of the stock
market.

RUSSIA AGREES TO ROLL BACK SALES OF STEEL TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced an agreement
with Russia on Monday to strictly control Moscow's surging exports
of steel to the United States, an effort to balance the bitter
complaints of American steelmakers with Washington's efforts to
keep from worsening Russia's economic slide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Russia has agreed to roll back its sales of
steel to the United States to the amount it shipped in 1996 and the
first half of 1997, before the collapse of the country's currency
led to a surge of shipments. Steel production accounts for 7
percent of Russia's gross national product, and it is a huge source
of scarce hard currency for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to respond to the steel industry's concerns
without bringing Russia to its knees,'' Commerce Secretary William
Daley said at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the agreement left American steel companies and
steelworkers dissatisfied, and some in Congress are threatening to
press legislation that would virtually cut off steel imports
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, seeking to act ahead of Congress, the Commerce
Department ruled that steel from Japan and Brazil had been
``dumped'' in the American market _ sold at prices well below the
cost of production _ and announced that it would impose huge
tariffs against imports of hot-rolled steel from both countries.
The Department also concluded that Russian makers had dumped their
steel, but penalities were not announced because negotiations over
the agreement announced Monday were already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing Russia's share of the American steel market is not
easy. By the end of last year foreign producers accounted for about
30 percent of all steel sold in the United States, up from about 20
percent the previous year. Russia accounted for about a third of
all the hot-rolled steel that surged into the American market last
year, but the Commerce Department says there are no reliable
estimates of how much of the market it commanded for other steel
products.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiating the agreement, Washington held most of the cards.
Russia's alternative was the imposition of the kind of tariffs
applied to Japan and Brazil, tariffs so steep that it would
essentially stop all the shipments. Instead, those shipments will
be reduced by about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments from Russia of hot-rolled steel will come down to
levels that existed prior to 1996. Sixteen other types of steel
will be limited to levels in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agreements deliver on the administration's commitment to
respond vigorously to the surge in imports that has threatened the
livelihoods of communities and workers around the nation,'' Daley
said. But it also responds to the concerns of Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, who has been involved in the International Monetary
Fund's negotiations over resuming aid to Russia, and of the
National Security Council, which fears that a further economic
breakdown in Moscow could further destabilize the government of the
ailing President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a legitimate concern about taking Russia to its
knees,'' Daley said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., complained that the Commerce
Department agreement will still permit the importation of too much
low-priced steel. Bethlehem Steel Corp. said the industry might
seek relief in federal court if the administration implements the
Russian accord. But the bigger threat to the administration's plans
is a bill now circulating in the House that would cap the amount of
foreign steel permitted into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's accord is exactly the kind of agreement that, in other
contexts, the administration has denounced as an interference with
market forces. For example, it sets an annual quota for hot-rolled
steel _ 750,000 metric tons, or slightly more than 20 percent of
the amount imported last year _ and sets minimum prices for the
steel. It also imposes a six-month moratorium on all imports of
hot-rolled steel, to work through a glut in the market.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Commerce said it would not impose penalty tariffs on
hot-rolled steel. Those could have ranged up to 218 percent.

TEXAS SUSPECT, 20, HAS ALIBI IN WIG SHOP SLAYING, ATTORNEY SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Filed in ``a'' and ``i'' categories) 
 
By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The attorney for a 20-year-old Texas man indicted in
the death of a wig shop employee claims his client is a victim of
mistaken identity and was playing football with friends when the
fatal stabbing occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Dror Haim Goldberg was indicted Wednesday in the Nov. 27 death
of Manuela Silverio, 54, at Wigs by Andre in Houston. The shop's
owners _ Roland Ingrando, 67, and his wife, Roberta, 55 _ were also
stabbed but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin said Monday that he believes his
client may not know he is wanted in the slaying. He said family
members indicated Goldberg had been planning a backpacking trip to
the Middle East, perhaps in the Sinai Desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Goldberg) was very upset, at first, that he was arrested and
accused of what is apparently a case of misidentification,''
DeGuerin said. ``He was so upset that he didn't want to go to
school this semester and I assume he wanted to continue with his
plans to go backpacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was studying hotel management at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's divorced parents issued a statement Monday asserting
they are not hiding their son and that he has not fled to Israel,
where his Israeli citizenship can protect him from extradition.
Goldberg's father is an obstetrician/gynecologist, and his mother,
Michele Goldberg, is an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin said Goldberg's parents are attempting to locate their
son because they want him to surrender to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin, who was hired by the Goldberg family the day after the
slaying, said Goldberg became a suspect after a license plate
number taken at the scene led investigators to a Lincoln Navigator
sports utility vehicle registered to a woman living with Goldberg's
father.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin said he believes the witness may have been mistaken in
taking down the license plate number. He said Goldberg was playing
football with friends at the time of the killing and that his
friends told this to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal,
however, dismissed the alibi claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Rosenthal said. ``He's got an alibi for later
but not for the relevant time when the murder occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said DeGuerin refused to let Goldberg testify before
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Since Goldberg's indictment, his parents have declined to
discuss their son's case. In a one-page statement Monday,
Goldberg's parents answered allegations raised by Silverio's
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silverio family has asked if we are hiding Dror Goldberg
from the authorities. We are not. Two months ago the police
questioned Dror for over six hours and then released him. They
never asked to see him again. They never asked him to remain in
Houston,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silverio Family has asked if Dror is in Israel. He is not.
The Israeli authorities have already told the police that Dror is
not in Israel. The police have chosen to keep this fact a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yvonne Palmer and Yvette Menendez, Silverio's
daughters, distributed leaflets asking the Goldbergs why their son
was in Israel and offered a $10,000 reward to anyone with
information that will lead to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like the Police Department has dropped the ball
or that the District Attorney's office hadn't done something they
should have. It's just unfortunate how our system is run,'' said
Brendan Gowing, the Silverio family attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was detained by police the night of the slaying,
questioned, gave a statement and was placed in a lineup before
eventually being released.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goldberg remained a suspect in the slaying, he was not
questioned again by police, who maintain they kept him under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Vice Consul Modi Ephraim released a statement Monday
confirming that Goldberg holds an Israeli citizenship, as does his
father. Under Israeli law, Israeli citizens are not extradited if
wanted on criminal charges elsewhere. Instead, they are tried for
the crime in an Israeli court.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to our police representative at the Embassy of
Israel in Washington, D.C., Dror Goldberg is not presently in
Israel,'' Ephraim said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goldberg's family claims their son is not in Israel,
Goldberg was known to have returned from Israel shortly before the
slaying and returned to Israel about a week after the killing with
his grandparents, who live in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin said Goldberg spent about three weeks with his
grandfather, who has a heart condition, in Israel. Authorities
believe Goldberg returned to Israel in late January. DeGuerin said
Goldberg's grandparents do not know where their grandson went.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know his current whereabouts,'' said Homicide Capt.
R.W. Holland. ``We're basically throwing a wide net and looking for
him anywhere that the evidence leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he skipped the country. We really don't know
where he is.''

TREASURER TAKES STEPS AMID `HEIR FINDER' SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Moving to contain a growing financial scandal uncovered
in her office just weeks after assuming her new post, Treasurer
Shannon P. O'Brien ordered Monday a major overhaul of
Massachusetts' multimillion-dollar cash accounts.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that a New Hampshire ``heir finder,'' Martin
Robbins, pleaded not guilty to bilking $6.5 million from the
Treasury's Unclaimed Check Fund, O'Brien said she was taking action
to prevent check forging and was filing legislation capping at 10
percent the unlimited finder fees bounty hunters can now charge for
uniting rightful owners with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a three-person task force comprised of O'Brien, State
Auditor Joseph DeNucci and Comptroller Martin Benison will look for
other ways to ensure that the alleged embezzlement, aided by
20-year Treasury worker John Trischitta, never happens again.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has assigned nearly a dozen State
Police troopers and office investigators attached to the criminal
division to work on the growing scandal. Officials said they are
making a thorough search of the circumstances under which millions
of dollars worth of checks had been issued from the Unclaimed
Checks Fund during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are poring over the documents to determine if
Trischitta may have engaged in schemes with other heir finders.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who was arraigned Monday, allegedly conspired with
Trischitta to divert the unclaimed funds into an escrow account at
BankBoston in November. A bank employee reportedly grew suspicious
about Robbins when he tried to withdraw the money on Feb. 10 and
tipped off Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as O'Brien reiterated her criticisms of lax controls she
inherited at the Treasury, her predecessor, Joseph D. Malone,
defended his eight-year management of the office during a news
conference in his Waltham home.
</P>
<P>
   Malone called the alleged scam a failure of ``people, not
policy,'' and said that public and private auditors repeatedly had
given the department a clean bill of fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation is far from over, O'Brien did say that
the only person who may be fired at this point is Trischitta, 47,
who is on paid leave after being released on $10,000 cash bail
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta has worked in the Unclaimed Check Fund for much of
his 20-year career at the Treasurer's office. The Fund is
responsible for finding individuals or companies that are due
checks or reimbursement from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for
services rendered to the state. Generally the fund holds the money
for a year before it is turned over to the Abandoned Property
division, which is also within the Treasurer's office, and is
responsible for finding the rightful heirs of bank accounts, stock
funds and other assets held by banks, brokerage firms, and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to former officials of the Treasurer's office, the
Unclaimed Checks Fund has not been supervised to the same extent as
the Abandoned Property division. Trischittta, in fact, was the sole
full-time management employee of the Unclaimed Checks Fund office,
while the Abandoned Property division had about 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that increasing pressure from heir finders, who were
seeking access to the unclaimed check list through Freedom of
Information requests, prompted the department to revise its
policies last summer. In exchange for access to the list, Malone
said, the heir hunters were required to provide a notarized power
of attorney from the person or company seeking the unclaimed money.
</P>
<P>
   Although Malone described this change as a tightening of the
restrictions, O'Brien Monday said that ``the impact may have been
to weaken the regulations.'' Among other things, the heir finders
would not be bound by a 10 percent cap on commissions they could
receive for finding owners of property listed in the state's
Abandoned Property Division.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, some of the heir finders turned their attention to
the Unclaimed Checks Fund, which operated far more loosely and was
far more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported Monday that a small group of heir finders met
with top Malone officials including Deputy Treasurer Thomas
Trimarco last May and persuaded the Treasurer's office to make a
fundamental change on behalf of the heir finders. Trimarco denied
Monday that he attended the meeting but said that other Malone
officials had met with one heir finder and her attorney to help
streamline the fund's procedures for issuing checks. Trimarco said
that one change required that heir finders show that they represent
potential beneficiaries through a formal power of attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Robbins apparently forged the name of a former
officer of the Cambridge Economic Development Corp. last year on a
power of attorney document that he submitted to Trischittta to
facilitate the issuance of the fraudulent checks.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators, who intend to bring this case to a grand
jury, are now scrutinizing the process of how money was released
from the fund and say they are not focusing on any one individual.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Monday, a scruffy Robbins pleaded not guilty
in Boston Municipal Court to charges of uttering and larceny. Judge
Herbert H. Hershfang, citing the seriousness of the charges that
could send Robbins to prison for 25 years, set bail at $50,000
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Carol Starkey told Hershfang
investigators found Robbins had a total of $7 million in his
BankBoston account when it was frozen earlier this month, the bulk
of which was the $6.5 million Robbins and his co-defendant,
Trischitta, are accused of stealing from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Starkey said Robbins, a frequent traveller with real estate
holdings and a time share condominium in Aruba, was in the process
of setting up ``heir finder'' businesses in New York and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Starkey said Robbins, of Lincoln, N.H., worked with Trischitta
to divert $6.5 million from the state's Unclaimed Checks Fund into
the escrow account that Robbins controlled. Trischitta was paid
$50,000 and promised a third of any other money Robbins recovered.
Starkey said Robbins submitted a forged power of attorney on behalf
of the Cambridge Economic Development Corp. to get the $6.5 million
released to him.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins' attorney, Albert F. Cullen 3d, said his client
tried to return the money to the state on Feb. 11 when he became
concerned about the validity of his claim to it. Cullen said
Robbins had obtained the power of attorney from a man he identified
only as DeGregorio whom Cullen said ``purported to be the treasurer
of this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commonwealth now says that Mr. DeGregorio did not sign''
the power of attorney, Cullen said. ``We'll just have to wait for
the facts'' to come out during the criminal process.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasurer Michael Travaglini said investigators still do
not know who the $6.5 million rightfully belongs to, although the
check was believed to be for the Economic Development Industrial
Corp., an agency now controlled by the Boston Redevelopment
Authority. A BRA spokeswoman says they do not believe they are owed
any state money.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that two officials -- Trischitta and a supervisor --
would have been needed to authorize the $5.3 million and $1.2
million checks sent to Robbins' escrow account. However, Malone
acknowledged, Trischitta might have simply told Robert Foley, his
department head, or Foley's deputy Amelia Viscomi, that he had the
necessary assurances to authorize the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy was two sets of eyeballs, two people agreeing on
it,'' Malone said. ``And whether it's Ms. Viscomi or Mr. Foley,
they should have said, when they saw that, `Before we hand this $5
million check over, let's make sure this is a valid claim.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One telephone call to the Cambridge Economic Development Corp.,
which has been defunct since 1986, would have blocked the alleged
scam, Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Travaglini said Monday that capping finders fees will help make
the fund less attractive to unscrupulous individuals who try to
manipulate the system.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, in Washington attending the National
Governor's Conference, said he was ``stunned'' to hear about the
problems in the Treasurer's office and said he supports efforts to
institute tighter controls.

GOVERNORS ASK CLINTON TO STAY AWAY FROM TOBACCO SETTLEMENT MONEY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican and Democratic governors told President
Clinton on Monday that they would work with him to improve
education and make politics more civil, but they also asked him to
keep his hands off the settlement money they have wrested from
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply don't want the federal government telling us how to
use our money'' or itself spending that money, Gov. Thomas Carper,
D-Del., who is chairman of the National Governors' Association,
told the president at the White House on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argues that the federal government is
entitled to some of the settlement as reimbursement for its share
of Medicaid costs attributable to smokers' illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton assured the governors, gathered here for their winter
meeting, that he would not insist on a cut for the federal
government provided they spent, in four related areas, the amount
on which Washington would otherwise insist: improving public
health, reducing teen-age smoking, benefiting children in
additional ways, and assisting tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But in his budget proposal, Clinton assumes that the federal
government will get $18.9 billion from the tobacco settlement to
spend for its own purposes from 2001 to 2004. That money is not
dedicated to any specific programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, reached in November, 46 states are to
receive $206 billion from the tobacco industry over 25 years as
compensation for their share of Medicaid costs due to
tobacco-related illnesses. That money is in addition to settlements
of $40 billion or so reached earlier by the four other states:
Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is state money,'' Michael Leavitt, the Republican
governor of Utah, told Clinton. ``The federal government was
invited to participate'' in the suits that led to the settlements,
``but declined. We sought as states only costs related to state
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said that by law
the federal government was required to recoup a share of the money.
``We can work toward waiving that requirement if the money is put
toward the appropriate uses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carper, Leavitt struck a cooperative tone, over all. Many
of the governors here have bemoaned as lost time the lengthy
impeachment investigation and trial of Clinton. ``We as governors
join with you and others to call for a return of civility to
Washington,'' Leavitt said. ``We believe it's time to move forward
with an agenda that will move not only the capital but also our
states forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The two governors made their remarks in speeches in the East
Room of the White House on Monday morning, before they and their
peers sat down for more than an hour of private round-table
discussion with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In politely differing on Monday over the federal role in
education, the president and the governors demonstrated how
different Washington can look from the White House and a
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In his own public remarks before the discussion, Clinton urged
the governors to support his bill to attach strings to the $15
billion the federal government spends yearly on public education.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for that money, Clinton would demand that school
districts turn around or shut failing schools, enforce discipline
codes, produce report cards on schools, check teacher competence
and end the practice known as ``social promotion,'' passing
children to the next grade regardless of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The president was careful to note that many governors, including
Republicans, had made such changes. ``We did not dream up these
ideas in Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that some people might feel the federal
government should be giving states more flexibility rather than
demanding more accountability. But he said he was doing both.
</P>
<P>
   Some governors, however, suggested that Clinton was talking more
about accountability than flexibility. ``We believe that linking
federal investment to specific local programs is unhelpful,''
Leavitt said. He said the federal government should invest ``as a
limited partner, not as the managing partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Carper said the governors were forming a bipartisan task force
to consider Clinton's education proposal. He said that they hoped
to find a consensus ``between those who simply want to be more
prescriptive with federal aid and those who simply want to turn
federal aid over to block grants directly to school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think we can find some middle ground,'' he said.

TWO CABINET SECRETARIES HELD IN CONTEMPT OVER PROBLEMS IN INDIAN
TRUST ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly a century, American Indians have been asking the
federal government for a simple accounting of money and land held
in trust for them since the days of treaty signing. On Monday, they
got the attention of the highest levels of government, as a federal
judge held in contempt two cabinet secretaries who oversee Indian
trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial order was a jolt in a lawsuit over billions of
dollars in money and land held in trust for as many as 500,000
Indians. The accounts date to the 1880s, when the government tried
to break up the tribal land ownership system and awarded individual
allotments of 80 to 160 acres per Indian. These lands were then
managed by the government, usually leased out to gas, oil or timber
companies. As with many trusts, the income is passed on to the
descendants of the original recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are trying to force the government to set up a
proper accounting system for the trust funds and to repay
beneficiaries who may have lost up to $10 billion in the last
century. The accounts have been woefully mismanaged, tribal members
say, and do not comply with even the basic standards of private
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say records of nearly
century-old oil, gas or timber leases have disappeared, in many
cases, making it impossible to keep track of who is owed what. But
tribal members say more than time and bureaucratic incompetence are
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., forcefully agreed, saying in his contempt order
that government officials had deliberately delayed turning over the
documents and then lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing denunciation of the government's handling of the
trust fund case, Lamberth found Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
Treasury Secretary Robert Robert Rubin and Assistant Secretary of
the Interior Kevin Gover in civil contempt for failing to produce
records of the trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``engaged in a shocking pattern of deception of
the court,'' the judge said. ``I have never seen more egregious
misconduct by the federal government,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt order carries no personal penalties and is largely
an indictment of the departments that oversee Indian trust funds,
not necessarily the secretaries themselves. But the judge warned
that further delays could lead to criminal contempt citations of
both Rubin and Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, the government must pay the plaintiffs' legal
fees and other expenses resulting from the officials' delay.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt order is viewed by people on both sides as a fire
alarm in a case that has been slowly smoldering since it was filed
in 1996. It is scheduled to go to trial in May. Legal historians
say it is the first time two cabinet officers have been held in
contempt simultaneously. Next week, two Senate committees will hold
a joint hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of justice for the victims who
have had years and years of abuse at the hands of the United States
government,'' said Eloise Cobell, a member of the Blackfoot nation,
who is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   She said the standard of money management for Indians by the
government has never approached that of non-Indians. ``The
government regulates national banks to the highest standards,'' Ms.
Cobel said. ``And yet when it comes to Indian money, look at what
they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says that it inherited an epic
accounting mess and that it has done more than any previous
administration to correct the problem. The president has requested
$150 million for the next fiscal year to set up adequate
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, administration officials were apologetic. ``We deeply
regret the mistakes that we made in this case,'' officials from the
departments of Interior, Treasury and Justice said in a joint
statement. Earlier, they apologized to the court for their
inability to produce legal and trust documents.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt says the Interior Department has reorganized two-thirds
of the account files, putting a management system in place that is
closer to that of commercial banks. But he says major problems
remain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government estimates that the accounts generate
about $300 million a year. But it has no idea precisely how many
properties, leases, contracts and investments are in the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say many checks are lost or sitting in files
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The money is vital to some Indians who depend on it for their
basic income. In the past, people have lost their land or homes
through foreclosure because the trust fund checks never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a national bank had handled a trust fund the way the
Department of Interior has handled Indian trust funds, the bank
would have been closed and the people running it would be in
jail,'' Ms. Cobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cobel, who lives on the Blackfoot reservation in Montana, is
one of five people in the lawsuit whose cases are specifically
cited. Indians have been trying to find the records of her family
trust and four others as a way to show a specific pattern of
neglect by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The records have been misplaced, lost to time or _ in the case
of a document center in Albuquerque, N.M. _ contaminated with rat
feces that could contain the deadly hantavirus, government
officials say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The government has been ducking their trust fund
responsibility for decades,'' said John Echohawk, director of the
Native American Rights Fund, which is backing the lawsuit. ``It
goes to show how egregious their management has been that they
couldn't even find records for five people and then lied to the
court about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth sided with the tribal members throughout his 76-page
order. ``Justice has not been done to these Indian beneficiaries,''
he wrote. ``The court cannot tolerate any more empty promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian trust accounts have been particularly embarrassing to
Babbitt, who came into office vowing to reform some of the ways
that his department oversees affairs in Indian country.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they have had a hard time tracking down
some of the descendants who are beneficiaries of the trusts, an
explanation dismissed by Indians who have been fighting for basic
accountability.

STOCKS SOAR ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks soared Monday as investors grew more confident
that interest rates would remain steady and that Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, would not suggest otherwise
during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, merger activity remained strong, implying that
dealmakers find attractive situations despite generally high stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many recent sessions that have been marked by big swings,
all the major stock gauges marched steadily higher to finish the
day with gains of more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 32.92 points,
or 2.66 percent, to 1,272.14, stood within a hair of record
territory. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been stuck
in a fairly narrow range for almost two months, was less than 1
percent from its high after a gain of 212.73 points, its biggest
since Jan. 6, to 9,552.68, a rise of 2.28 percent. The Dow's record
close was 9,643.32 on Jan. 8. And the Nasdaq composite index rose
58.41 points, or 2.56 percent, to 2,342.01.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said they were encouraged by the resilience of most
stocks to the recent steep slide in technology issues, which along
with the drug and financial sectors were among Monday's
pacesetters. IBM and Hewlett-Packard made the biggest contributions
to the Dow, accounting for nearly 50 points of its surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a concern that when the air came out of a
high-flying sector like tech it would bring down everything else,''
said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``Well, the Nasdaq corrected and it didn't bring the
rest of the market down. If you start to see breadth improve, then
you could see the market move toward 10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese efforts to contain rising interest rates there seemed
to be taking hold, some analysts said, suggesting less pressure for
moving capital out of markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that U.S. rates won't go higher,'' said John
Manley Jr., senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who is scheduled to make semiannual appearances
before Congress this week to discuss the economy and the Fed's
monetary intentions, is expected to indicate a steady policy on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   While American growth is rapid _ unnervingly so for some _
inflation remains tame and various foreign economies are thought
too fragile to risk tightening credit here.

PANEL WILL MONITOR PLAN FOR THE EVERGLADES

<TEXT>
<P>
   After meeting with scientists who have criticized a projected
$8-billion plan to restore the Florida Everglades to ecological
health, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Monday in Washington
announced the establishment of an independent scientific panel to
evaluate the plan as it evolves.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's members, yet to be appointed, will be expected to
serve for three or four years and ``will be individuals who are not
personally involved in South Florida research and monitoring
activities,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists who met with Babbitt said the action satisfied
their basic aim, to insure that the plan was subjected to scrutiny
by experts not involved in formulating it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart L. Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee,
has criticized the plan, which is to be submitted to Congress for
approval in July, on the ground that it does not go far enough
toward re-establishing the natural, north-to-south flow of shallow
water that historically controlled the character and ecological
health of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Pimm and other ecologists wanted an
independent review to determine the degree to which the Everglades
might realistically be restored, given all the alterations to the
South Florida landscape in the last century.

THURMOND SEEKS TO BLOCK LABELS HINTING AT WINE'S BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that may foreshadow a bitter struggle
over government policies on alcohol, Sen. Strom Thurmond introduced
legislation on Monday that would bar ``health messages'' on wine
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, said he wanted to reverse
the ``erroneous and irresponsible'' action of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which on Feb. 5 approved two new
bottle labels requested by the wine industry that encourage
consumers to learn about the benefits of drinking wine.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation proposed by Thurmond would also transfer
authority over labeling to the Department of Health and Human
Services from the Treasury Department, and would raise taxes on
wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I do not favor increased taxes,'' Thurmond said,
``but in this era of shrinking budgets, the only way in which we
will be able to finance adequate, impartial and trustworthy
research into alcohol-induced diseases such as hypertension, breast
cancer and birth defects is to generate a new revenue flow that
will be used specifically for investigating such killers.''
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, the president and chief executive of the Wine
Institute, a trade association, said the wine industry would fight
Thurmond's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can argue the merits if it comes to that,'' De Luca said,
asserting that an objective reading of the dietary guidelines
published by the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services would show that there were health benefits as well as
drawbacks to drinking wine.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond's proposals are sure to face big hurdles because the
wine industry is well financed and capable of mounting a formidable
campaign against legislation it does not like. On the other hand,
Thurmond, as the senator with the most seniority, has considerable
influence. Another powerful senator, Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., also
spoke unsuccessfully against allowing the kind of labels approved
on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wine industry had long sought permission to attach
promotional labels to bottles, the label texts approved by the
alcohol bureau, a division of the Treasury Department, are neutral
in tone.
</P>
<P>
   They invite people to consult the dietary guidelines, which warn
of the dangers of alcohol but also cite evidence that moderate
drinking may lower the risk of heart disease. The guidelines also
note that alcohol has been used ``to enhance the enjoyment of
meals'' throughout history.

TURKEY AND GREECE TRADE WORDS OVER KURD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey and Greece traded harsh words Monday
as the crisis over a captured Kurdish guerrilla commander further
soured already tense relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish commander, Abdullah Ocalan, whose fighters have been
waging war against the Turkish army for 14 years, was seized by
Turkish commandos last Monday night in Kenya, where he had been
living clandestinely under the protection of Greek diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey said Greek leaders ``must
be made to explain to the international community how they came to
support a terrorist murderer who has killed thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greece should be added to the list of countries that support
terrorism and harbor terrorists,'' Demirel said in a television
interview Monday on a visit to the Philippines. ``A country like
that can only be described as an outlaw state. If Greece continues
its illegal behavior, we reserve the right given to us by
international law to take the necessary measures for legitimate
self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirel made his statement a day after Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said his government would ask the European Union to review
Greece's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the European Union to seriously examine the case of
one of its members, which has violently opposed the organization's
charter, commitments and obligations,'' Cem said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Turkey was also considering issuing a complaint against
Greece at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece
asserted that Turkey was trying to turn Greece into a scapegoat for
its Kurdish problem and urged Turkey to solve the problem quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, I fear spiraling into further destabilization, further
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Greek Foreign Ministry, Dimitris Reppas,
asserted that Turkey was ``trying to plot against Greece with
imprecise statements and tall tales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey is inventing an external enemy to distract the
international community from the fundamental problem of
acknowledging and respecting the human rights of the Kurdish
people,'' Reppas said. ``It is presumptuous of Turkey to make
accusations when it illegally occupies half of Cyprus and
systematically violates legal and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Luxembourg Monday, European Union foreign
ministers issued a statement saying that the union took ``note of
the assurances of the Turkish government that Abdullah Ocalan will
have a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It expects this to mean fair and correct treatment and an open
trial according to the rule of law before an independent court,
with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international
observers admitted to his trial,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have said they will not permit observers from
foreign organizations to attend Ocalan's trial. They have also
indicated that he is most likely to be tried by a ``state security
court,'' a special tribunal presided over by a panel of judges that
includes a military officer.
</P>
<P>
   The European Court of Human Rights has described those courts as
neither fair nor independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish Bar Association urged Monday that Parliament be
called into session from a recess to amend the law that governs
such tribunals by eliminating the military judges. The lawyers'
group said such a change was necessary ``to prevent the verdict
from being subject to any disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish newspaper with close ties to the military, Hurriyet,
published what it said were statements that Ocalan has given to
interrogators. The newspaper reported that Ocalan had said had
Greece supported his group for years, provided it with missiles and
other weapons and trained its fighters at camps on Greek soil.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ocalan have not been allowed to visit him at his
island prison, and it was not possible to verify his reported
statements or to determine the conditions under which they were
made. Greek leaders have in the past denied allegations that their
government aided Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In Diyarbakir, center of the Kurdish region of Turkey, some
shopkeepers reportedly shut their doors in response to an appeal by
a group that supports Ocalan's rebels. The group called for a
three-day business strike in leaflets that warned, ``Those not
joining the protest will be punished.''
</P>
<P>

   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said he hoped the effect of the
Ocalan affair in Greece, where it has cost three Cabinet ministers
their jobs, would sober Greek leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political turmoil that has recently erupted in Greece has
shown that involvement with terrorism against Turkey is bound to
have a boomerang effect,'' Ecevit said. ``I hope that Greek
politicians will come to realize that dialogue with Turkey would be
a much safer way of addressing common problems than supporting
terrorism.''

   AIRREPAIR-TRAMCO (Everett, Wash.) _ Federal aviation safety
inspectors, warning of dangerously incompetent work on dozens of
jetliners, last summer tried to temporarily shut down Tramco, one
of North America's largest independent aircraft repair stations.
The chief FAA inspector assigned to the sprawling plant called the
facility, which worked on 421 aircraft last year, ``a disaster
waiting to happen.'' And in July, FAA inspectors wrote agency
lawyers that Tramco's ``violations raise significant concerns for
safety and clearly raise the potential of a catastrophic failure
leading to a crash.'' But their bosses ruled against pulling the
company's FAA license to operate.

REGULATORS REJECT OLIVETTI'S BID FOR TELECOM ITALIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The $60 billion bid by Olivetti SpA, the No. 2 Italian
phone company, for its big domestic rival, Telecom Italia SpA, met
a serious setback on Monday, when Italian stock market regulators
ruled the bid inadmissible.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the regulators said Olivetti's bid, which was
hastily approved by the Olivetti board Saturday, was contingent on
the sale of Olivetti assets and lacked clear deadlines, thus
failing to meet requirements set by Italian takeover law.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti contested the ruling on Monday night and announced that
it would move ahead with its bid for Telecom. In a statement,
Olivetti said its bid contained ``all the necessary characteristics
to produce the desired effects.'' Olivetti said it had been forced
to make an early decision because of market rumors. The company's
determination seemed to indicate that serious legal wrangling lay
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Olivetti's declaration, for the moment the ruling
appeared to allow Telecom time to take measures that would sharply
raise the price of Olivetti's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom's chairman, Franco Bernabe, was set to meet with union
leaders on Wednesday and with Telecom's board on Thursday to
propose sweeping plans to overhaul the former state phone monopoly,
plans that would include a buyout of shares in Telecom's mobile
phone unit that it does not now own, people close to the company
said. The unit, Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, now has a market
value of almost $50 billion. Telecom now holds a 60 percent share
in TIM, and by increasing that share, it would raise the market
value of the parent company, thus increasing the price Olivetti
would have to pay to take it over.
</P>
<P>
   Also under consideration would be Telecom's divestiture of such
noncore activities as phone equipment manufacturing, real estate
and an insurance subsidiary, the same people said.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom has moved quickly since Saturday, when it was confronted
with Olivetti's hostile bid, to engage investment bank advisers
that included Credit Suisse First Boston, Lazard Freres, J.P.
Morgan and the Italian investment bank Banca IMI SpA. The steps
planned by Bernabe are expected to include overtures to British
Telecom and AT&AMP;T to include Telecom Italia in strategic alliances,
with possible equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, stock market investors had given the
Olivetti bid a black eye, sending Olivetti's share price down more
than 7 percent, after the company announced its board would meet
Wednesday to approve a capital increase to finance the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's bid also appeared to lose ground in Italian
government circles, as the negative market reaction and details of
the bid, involving cash, stocks and bonds, sank in.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema of Italy,
who appeared last week to favor the Olivetti bid, said the
government, which holds a decisive ``golden share'' in Telecom,
would remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   But the most serious blow came from the stock market regulator,
CONSOB, which had been under pressure to decide on the validity of
the Olivetti bid.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom's board had rejected the bid on Saturday as ``full of
holes,'' and hence null, and demanded a ruling on its validity.
</P>
<P>
   In trading before the CONSOB decision Monday, Telecom's ordinary
share price soared 11 percent, then fell back in later trading,
buoyed by market perceptions that Telecom would fight back.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, CONSOB said Olivetti had made its takeover bid
contingent on the sale of its mobile and fixed-line phone units,
Omnitel Pronto Italia and Infostrada, to its phone business
partner, the German giant Mannesmann AG, and that it had failed to
provide exact deadlines for its bid _ both shortcomings, CONSOB
ruled, that rendered the bid invalid under Italian law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For its part, Olivetti moved Monday to secure almost 98 percent
of Tecnost SpA, the gaming machine unit it said it would use to
start the bid, sending Tecnost shares soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti made its name as a nimble manufacturer of typewriters.
Acquired from the founding Olivetti family by the flamboyant
investor Carlo De Benedetti, it reinvented itself as a computer
company. Under its present chairman, Roberto Colaninno, who also
engineered the takeover bid for Telecom, the company transformed
itself again as a provider of mobile and fixed-line phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Even before CONSOB's decision, Olivetti appeared to be running
into serious market resistance to its proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said institutional investors shied from the Olivetti
bid, which involves raising about $50 billion through debt and
asset sales, because it would make Telecom cash-poor at a time when
phone companies need deep pockets to finance investment. One German
analyst said Monday that the price Mannesmann was offering for
Olivetti's mobile and fixed-line systems suggested that Olivetti
itself was overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that other objections to the Olivetti bid were
that the price Olivetti offered for Telecom ordinary shares, about
10 euros a share, or $11, was too low. ``They would be getting the
company on the cheap,'' said Douglas White, telecommunications
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA began placing American spies among U.N.
weapons inspectors in Iraq only a year after the end of the Persian
Gulf war of 1991 and worked closely with the United Nations to
organize the inspections, a former arms inspector says.
</P>
<P>
   The former inspector, Scott Ritter, said in a new book that he
and a senior CIA official operating under an assumed name had
planned some of the largest and most complex inspections undertaken
by the United Nations and that the United Nations inspection teams
had included ``CIA paramilitary covert operatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a coup attempt against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
in June 1996 coincided with the presence of a U.N. inspection team
that included nine CIA officials. Ritter, who does not provide
documentation for all of his conclusions and who has been
criticized repeatedly by the Clinton administration, speculated in
his book that the intelligence agency might have orchestrated the
timing.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritter praised the agency's employees as ``the kind of
people you want around you in a difficult situation,'' the book,
``Endgame,'' supports the Iraqi allegation that the United Nations
inspections teams were riddled with American spies almost from the
start. Saddam has accused Ritter of being one of the chief spies,
but Ritter has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have acknowledged that the CIA gave assistance to
the United Nations inspections program and provided specialists to
work on the inspections teams. But Ritter makes clear that the
agency's involvement was far more extensive _ and began earlier _
than previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   The book, scheduled for publication in April &UR;  &LR; by Simon &AMP;
Schuster, is harshly critical of the Clinton administration and
especially of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She is
depicted as having fought strenuously last year to have Ritter
removed from leading an arms inspection team because he was
considered too aggressive in dealing with the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has dismissed Ritter's criticism in the past, insisting
that he ``doesn't have a clue'' about American policy toward Iraq.
The CIA and the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, or
Unscom, which is responsible for the inspection teams, said they
had no immediate comment on the book. Galley proofs of the book
were obtained on condition that the source not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which demanded only last week that
Ritter turn over a copy of the book for a security review before
publication, would not comment Monday on whether it was considering
legal action to block distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ritter provides a detailed description of his work
for the United Nations, which began in 1991 and ended last summer
when he resigned in part in protest over what he described as the
Clinton administration's meddling in the work of the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In repeated interviews since his resignation, Ritter has alleged
that the administration hindered the arms inspections out of fear
of direct confrontations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter says in the book that the CIA became actively involved in
inspections in 1992, the year after the United Nations began
weapons inspections in the search for evidence of chemical and
biological weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he says that he and a senior CIA official _
identified in the book by a pseudonym, Moe Dobbs _ worked closely
together ``to plan the operational and intelligence support for the
largest and most complex inspections ever undertaken by Unscom.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said that beginning in the spring of 1992, ``Dobbs and
his men provided seasoned personnel who could operate vehicles,
organize logistics, run communications _ simply put, the kind of
people you want around you in a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency played its largest role, he said, in an inspection in
June 1996, when nine ``CIA paramilitary covert operators'' were
placed on a team seeking to inspect compounds maintained by the
elite Iraqi Republican Guards. The compounds were believed to be
hiding evidence of Iraq's programs to build chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis tried to block the inspection, resulting in a
standoff that lasted several days and brought swift condemnation of
Iraq by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, Iraqi dissidents made a coup attempt against
Saddam. The coup failed, and Ritter said he later became suspicious
of the timing of the coup attempt and of the presence of an Unscom
inspection team that included several of the agency's employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no proof of Dobbs' involvement, but there was a
strong set of coincidences,'' he said. ``The inspection was
directed almost exclusively at Special Republican Guard sites; the
coup plotters were from some of the same units we were trying to
inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   While working for the United Nations, Ritter, a former Marine
intelligence officer, was paid by the Defense Department; he was
considered to be on loan to Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reminded Ritter of his responsibilities, and we just
leave it at that,'' said David Rigby, a spokesman for the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, the Pentagon agency that had Ritter under
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has argued that under his contract, Ritter is
required to submit the book for a security review if it contains
any information, classified or unclassified, about his work for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter and his lawyer have said that the Pentagon's demand is an
effort to intimidate him into silence and that the contract cannot
be enforced since it expired last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, Idaho _ When Sally Maughan steps into a large
fenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear cubs pay her
the ultimate compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me like a bear,'' said Ms. Maughan, who can lumber
about in pretty convincing fashion. ``When I come in the door,
they're thinking that way. They'll take a swat at me. They'll grab
my shirt sleeve like it's the scruff of another bear.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the whole point, for Ms. Maughan is doing all she
can to get these bears back into the wild this spring. Idaho
wildlife officials call her ``the bear lady,'' and for the last 10
years she has been the volunteer in charge of an unusual program
intended to return orphaned cubs to the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Left on their own after their mothers are killed, usually in an
illegal hunt or sometimes by a passing truck on a remote highway,
young bears will almost surely die, because they cannot forage or
otherwise fend for themselves in the first months of life. Some are
brought to Ms. Maughan so young that she has to bottle-feed them
every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``She basically teaches them how to be bears,'' explained Kris
Van Cleave, a spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Maughan, a 52-year-old travel agent, has returned 37
black-bear cubs to wilderness areas across Idaho and in the Blue
Mountains of Oregon, and wildlife officials in charge of the
releases say follow-up observations and checks of radio tags
indicate that nearly all have done just fine.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the greatest testament to her success, only one of
the bears has shown an inclination to wander back to areas of human
habitation like campgrounds in search of food. (That bear was
ultimately deemed a ``nuisance bear'' and sent away to a university
research project.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sally's very good at what she does,'' said Jeff Rohlman, a
regional wildlife manager for the Fish and Game Department. ``She's
good at minimizing contact, at keeping the cubs somewhat leery of
humans, and that's exactly what you want to do with these bears.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Maughan, the process is something of a conundrum, since
even as she devotes so many hours to the cubs and develops an
obvious affection for them, the last thing she would ever want to
do is treat them like pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the point at all,'' she said. ``If you get too
emotionally attached, you'll wind up defeating everything you're
working towards. A bear wants to be free. A bear needs to be
free.''
</P>
<P>
   What she feels when watching the bears successfully scamper off
into the wild is a bit akin to the intensely mixed emotions, the
pride and the sadness, that many parents experience when their
children head off to college. In fact, ``bear cubs go through
comparable stages of development to children,'' Ms. Maughan said,
``except that it happens over a period of months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the age of 8 weeks or so, the cubs are bawling infants, in
need of a lot of nurturing, closeness, security, food and sleep.
After that, ``they begin about a month of the terrible 2's,'' she
said, when ``they need supervision, they throw their own version of
temper tantrums, they want what they want when they want it.''
</P>
<P>
   By about six months, the teen-age stage has arrived. ``They get
a bit wild and reckless,'' she said. ``They don't use good
judgment, and seem to feel invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, at last, as they near the point of their release,
``you can breathe a sigh of relief,'' Ms. Maughan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's almost like having a college student around,'' she
said. ``They take an interest in their surroundings and start to
investigate and really try to figure out what makes everything
tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she cannot be exactly sure of all those equivalents,
she said with a laugh, since she herself never reared any children.
``I never wanted to have kids,'' said Ms. Maughan, who never
married, either. ``I'm really not a people person. Let's just say
I'm more of a bear person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maughan lives in this Boise suburb with her 85-year-old
mother, also named Sally, 18 cats (at last count), 2 coyotes
(Pouncer, 10, and Sparkle, 8, who have successfully acted as foster
parents to several orphaned pups in a program that returns coyotes
to the wild as well) and a good 75 or so stray ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just been this way ever since she was a little girl,''
her mother said. ``She'd come home from school, and there'd be four
or five dogs following her.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Ms. Maughan has spent as much as $6,000 of her
own money on the bears, who have a voracious appetite for a diet
that includes dog food, fish, fruit (especially apples and frozen
grapes), carrots, acorns, bees, wasps and, she said, ``an
occasional mouse who tries to join the picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maughan has never been injured by any of her bears. The
closest she ever came was when one of the cubs, nicknamed Griz,
grew agitated one day and gave her, well, a real bearhug. But he
eventually let go, and she was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has she had any problem with her neighbors in this
once-rural locale that is now growing like many outlying areas
around Western cities, with suburban-style housing springing up
around her. ``No problems, no complaints, no citations,'' said the
Garden City planning and zoning administrator, Craig Eckles.
</P>
<P>
   When they leave her, the bears weigh between 60 and 100 pounds;
full grown, females average about 250 pounds, while males can be
anywhere from 300 to 500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Every orphaned bear that is rescued and makes it back to the
wild is a bear that in the past would have either died in the wild
or most likely been put to death if found by wildlife officials.
While black bears are common in many states, and while the North
American population is not considered to be endangered, animal
experts say Ms. Maughan's work should be applied to bear species
around the world that are. Her nonprofit foundation recently
received a $6,000 grant from the World Society for the Protection
of Animals, based in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a global basis, there's no one doing what she's doing as
well as she's doing it,'' said Chris Morgan, a bear specialist with
the society. ``There's a lot to learn from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Wertz, regional wildlife habitat biologist with the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife, who has brought cubs to Ms.
Maughan, said: ``As far as we're concerned, she's a godsend. You
know, there just aren't a lot of people out there you can call on
to take in a bear.''

   JASPER, Texas _ James Byrd Jr. squirmed and struggled, ``alive
and conscious'' as a pickup dragged him shirtless more than two
miles over an asphalt road, a pathologist said on Monday in some of
the hardest-hitting testimony of the John William King trial.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 49, did not die until his head, shoulder and right arm
were ripped from his torso when he was slammed into a concrete
drain culvert, Dr. Tommy J. Brown told jurors in the capital murder
trial of the first of three white defendants accused of killing
Byrd. The torso was dropped near a small black church a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``While being dragged, Mr. Byrd was conscious and in pain.''
Brown testified. Several of Byrd's relatives and King's father left
the courtroom to avoid hearing the gruesome evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaumont pathologist's testimony was crucial to the capital
murder case against King by showing that Byrd was killed June 7
during the commission of another felony _ kidnapping. This required
the prosecution to establish the victim was being restrained before
he was killed. The other two defendants, Shawn Berry and Lawrence
Russell Brewer, will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   Through testimony and evidence, District Attorney Guy James Gray
attempted to show that the trio, while sipping beer and smoking
cigarettes, beat Byrd, sprayed his face black with paint, removed
his shirt and pulled his pants down to his ankles, which were then
shackled to a pickup bumper with a logging chain.
</P>
<P>
   Gray contended that King had hoped to reap notoriety from a
black man's sensational kidnap-slaying to jump start a hate group
he planned to formally launch on July 4, 1998, in the small East
Texas timber town.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's graphic testimony went unchallenged by defense
attorneys, who later began their case without an opening statement
and rested after presenting just three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After closing arguments Tuesday morning, jurors will be
sequestered until they reach a verdict, District Judge Joe Bob
Golden said. If the 11 whites and one black find King guilty, the
punishment phase of the trial will begin, to determine if he would
be sentenced to death or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion that Mr. Byrd was alive up until the point he
hit the culvert,'' Brown said as jurors leafed through grisly
autopsy photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The pathologist said reddish-brown areas of numerous wounds
indicated they were incurred while Byrd's heart still pumped and
blood still circulated.
</P>
<P>
   Various body parts, including knees, an elbow and ribs, were
``ground down'' to the bone, apparently as Byrd struggled to shift
his body when pain became too great in one spot, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been very tired, very worn out, trying to keep
the pain from being so severe,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The first defense witness was King's prison tattoo artist, John
Moseley, who is serving a 10-year and a 15-year term for burglary
and sexual assault. Moseley said the numerous Nazi and Ku Klux Klan
symbols he etched on King's body were not racist and were meant to
help the 5-foot-7 inmate look tough enough to protect himself in a
cell block that was 75 percent African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, King would have had to fight, pay protection money or
``do sexual favors for blacks,'' said Moseley.
</P>
<P>
   But the inmate's credibility was damaged when Assistant U.S.
Attorney John Stevens, who is assisting local prosecutors, produced
a letter from Moseley to King's girlfriend, Kylie Greeney. It
indicated Moseley would go to great lengths to help King, and
boasted that he had stopped another inmate from testifying for the
prosecution through intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defense witnesses did little more than say that King's
racism was never overt in public.
</P>
<P>
   From his attorneys' brief presentation, it appeared that King
may have undermined his own defense through his prodigious writing,
which was published in newspapers or intercepted by jailers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defense witnesses was asked to corroborate King's
contention that Byrd was killed by Berry over a steroid drug deal,
and that King and Berry were at home when the crime occurred.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario was contradicted by an FBI forensic expert who
said King's DNA was found at the crime scene on a cigarette butt.
</P>
<P>
   And the prosecution's weakest evidence, a fleck of Byrd's blood
on a sandal owned by King, was strengthened by the defendant. No
witness had recalled seeing King wearing the sandal before the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Jailer Mo Johnson testified that a prisoner trusty nicknamed
``Spider,'' acting as a clandestine messenger, handed over a note
from King to Brewer written in July. In it, King acknowledged he
had found a ``dark brown substance'' on his sandal. The letter also
alerted authorities to Byrd's blood on Berry's clothes, which
investigators had initially overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously though,'' King's letter to Brewer concluded,
``regardless of the outcome of this, we have made history and shall
die proudly remembered if need be... Much Aryan Love, Respect and
Honor my brother in arms... SEIG HEIL.''

LATEST WORD FROM WELLS, A YANKEE NO MORE, IS UNPRINTABLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ David Wells began a news conference to trumpet
his arrival with the Toronto Blue Jays by admonishing one newspaper
and two television stations with a forceful expletive for visiting
his house after he had been traded from the Yankees last Thursday.
Two officials from the Blue Jays cringed. It would have been more a
stunning display if the words spilled out of the mouth of someone
other than the wacky Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells has always described himself as a rebel who does what
he wants to do, so Monday he basically did what he wanted to do.
Wells playfully acted as if he were about to lose control of the
steering wheel of his sport utility vehicle and almost clip
reporters when he eased into the Englebert Complex on Monday
morning. He laughed and lifted his middle finger at photographers
as he gave a blood sample a few hours later. Different team, same
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting the brilliant red cap and bright blue pitching jacket
of the Jays, Wells, the man who adored the simple pinstripes of the
Yankees, looked garish sitting behind a table inside an interview
tent. Before Wells criticized members of the news media, he pulled
out the microphone jack from one of the stations that had offended
him. Then the pitcher who David Cone had called ``beyond
depressed'' tried to convince everyone the healing process has
started. Started, not ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a childhood dream for me wanting to be a Yankee,''
Wells said. ``Getting the opportunity, it's a tough situation to
leave. Trades are trades. I have no say so. I have to move on. I
can let things go. It was tough, but life goes. I think Toronto got
the better of the deal, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Wells. The Yankees grabbed a future Hall of Famer in
Roger Clemens for Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush, and they are
happy. Wells, who scooted from Tampa to Miami to find solace and
play golf after the trade, tried to talk tough and appear happy.
But it was easy to see and hear the disappointment in his eyes and
in his voice and realize this is a player who will miss being a
Yankee and miss being a New Yorker. ``I could understand David
being upset,'' Lloyd said. ``He  &UR; was &LR;  New York last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cone said that Wells' emotions had gravitated from
``shock to anger'' when the two spoke on Sunday night, Wells was
careful not to criticize anyone affiliated with the Yankees. Not
yet, anyway. Wells would never criticize George Steinbrenner, but
he said the owner had told him that General Manager Brian Cashman
made the trade. Wells has squabbled with Manager Joe Torre, so
either one of them could become verbal targets for the 35-year-old
pitcher in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the enemy,'' said Wells, speaking of the Yankees. ``My
feelings I had there, they're my heart, mind and soul. I had a
great time. It was fun while it lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he hoped that the Jays and the Yankees battle for the
American League pennant and that he secured his third World Series
ring. He said he was not bothered that he did not have a no-trade
clause and reiterated that he wanted to face Clemens whenever
Toronto opposes New York so he can ``do my magic'' at Yankee
Stadium. That matchup could happen since Gord Ash, Toronto's
general manager, repeated that he has no plan to trade Wells
because the Jays believe they can reach the postseason. ``There's
been a lot of conversations, a lot of rumors about the Blue Jays
moving David along,'' said Ash, whose club released Wells in 1993.
``That's not something we're going to do. That's not something
we're contemplating.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, every time Wells, the new Jay, claimed to be over the
Yankees, he would slip and say something that proved he was not. It
was such an emotionally wrenching deal that it took Wells four days
to even discuss it. Monday, Wells praised the Yankees the way a fan
from the bleachers would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to leave that group we had,'' Wells said. ``I
loved every one of those guys. They were my brothers. When you get
close and you feel comfortable and, all of a sudden, there's a
change, obviously, you need a few days to get over it. I can move
on. I can forgive and forget. Forgive and forget, I think will take
a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But Wells followed those slightly angry words by saying
of the Yankees: ``Everything over there was grand. It was awesome.
But I've got to move on and try to make things as comfortable and
as admirable as it was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Cone, Wells said he has not spoken to any other
Yankees since he was traded. Wells was definitely more popular with
the fans that he called ``very crazy'' than he was in the Yankee
clubhouse. With Clemens, a five-time Cy Young Award winner, taking
Wells' spot, Wells will miss the Yankees more than they miss him.
It was a splendid ride for Wells, but it ended abruptly and Wells
must digest that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I was very depressed,'' Wells said. ``I love New York.
They made me feel welcome. They made me proud to be there. I wanted
to be there. It's just something that's a shock when you've been
traded. I didn't expect to go anywhere.''

ADMINISTRATION REJECTS SALE OF AMERICAN SATELLITE TO CHINESE-LED
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Swayed by criticisms that commercial satellite
deals with China could threaten national security, the Clinton
administration decided on Monday to reject the sale of a $450
million satellite to a consortium with close ties to the Chinese
government, senior administration officials said. The decision cast
considerable doubt on the future of high technology sales useful to
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision reverses the years-long policy in
the United States of promoting commercial satellite deals with
China. It had long championed the transactions to help China make
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several months, the administration has faced a
barrage of investigations and a growing stack of official reports
that have called the commercial satellite sales a threat to
American security and a great boon to China's military capability.
The findings have indicated that the program of satellite sales
might have given the Chinese the scientific expertise to improve
their missile-launching capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Disapproval of the satellite deal is likely to be another
sensitive issue raised next week when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visits China. With Chinese-American relations eroding over
other issues like human rights and trade, Beijing could interpret
the disapproval as a fundamental retreat from Washington's
commitment to expanded economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the Defense and State Departments
objected to allowing China to launch the satellite. Overruling the
Commerce Department, which had favored the sale, the State and
Defense officials concluded that the technology to place the
satellite in orbit would help the Chinese military make its
intercontinental ballistic missile fleet more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also feared that that Chinese military would
benefit, both commercially and technologically, by controlling the
satellite once it was in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involves a Hughes Space and Communications satellite
designed to set up a mobile telephone network over much of Asia,
reaching from China to Indonesia, and then across the Indian Ocean
as far as Pakistan. The Commerce Department is expected to formally
notify Hughes of its ``intent to deny'' in the next few days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement on Monday night that made no
reference to a decision, but reiterated that the satellite deal
``can be used as a model for how we can protect national security
while launching satellites overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively revokes President Clinton's quiet
approval of the sale two and a half years ago. At the time,
Clinton's aides assured him it would not contribute to Chinese
military capabilities. The State Department and the Defense
Department concurred with the decision, but had not thoroughly
vetted the military links of the Singapore-based consortium, which
was the official buyer of the satellite. Top officials of the
consortium included top military officers of the People's
Liberation Army, who also served in posts with the China Satellite
Launch and Tracking Control Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes officials had sought an expedited review, and pressured
the administration to approve the deal, according to government
documents provided later to congressional investigators. A change
in the satellite's design forced the company to apply for a revised
license, and a raft of subsequent investigations into China's
efforts to obtain American technology helped prompt the
administration to reverse its position.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a time that relations between the United
States and China are eroding on many fronts, from human rights to
economic interchanges. A senior administration official, speaking
on the condition that he not be identified, said on Monday that
``we are heading into a very rough patch,'' and speculated that the
decision Monday could make it ``very difficult'' to approve other
satellite sales to China in the near future, though none are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The official also speculated that the Chinese would likely move
quickly to obtain a similar satellite from Europe, in part to drive
home their ability to circumvent American restrictions and reward
non-American competitors. However, it appears unlikely that China
could acquire technology as sophisticated as that offered by
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to visit Beijing next week in connection
with a visit to Washington in April by China's prime minister, Zhou
Rongji. Zhou is widely regarded as China's economic czar, and
administration officials believed until recently that his visit
would be preceded by intense negotiations to secure China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, a move Beijing and Washington
have long sought.
</P>
<P>
   But with China's economy slowing and unemployment riots breaking
out around the country, Zhou appears less eager to strike a deal
that would require him to open China's markets rapidly. The
cancellation of the satellite deal could easily be interpreted in
Beijing as a fundamental retreat from Washington's commitment to
expanded economic relations with China, and could also diminish the
chances of any broad trade agreement. Such an agreement would
ultimately require approval by Congress, and administration
officials say that in the current atmosphere, that would be
difficult to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the satellite deal would be approved has
diminished for months. On Monday morning, The Financial Times of
London reported that it is ``on the verge of being rejected.'' By
later Monday, the Commerce Department had received the last of the
votes from four other agencies with a voice in the deal, and
concluded that its position in favor of the sale had been
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Electronics or the Commerce Department could
theoretically appeal the denial of the four export licenses
involved in the deal, but administration officials said that as a
practical matter they thought it was unlikely any reconsideration
would change the outcome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At a high level interagency meeting on Feb. 11, the Pentagon
said it was troubled by the involvement of the Chinese military in
the regional satellite system, called Asia-Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's concerns at the meeting included
questions about Hughes' dealings in recent years with China, the
official added. One troubling episode involved a 1995 tutorial on
rocket launching given by Hughes engineers to Chinese scientists,
now the subject of a criminal inquiry. Another involved the
company's hiring of the son of the Chinese general who oversees his
country's military satellite programs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent findings of a select House committee also figured in
the decision to deny the Hughes deal, officials said. The panel,
headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Conn., criticized Hughes'
dealings with China and recommended that the sdministration
strengthen export controls. The administration supports most of the
committee's findings, though it disagrees with the committee's
recommendation to strengthen the Pentagon's role in approving
licenses for the export of equipment that could have military
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is completing a similar
report, which officials said is likely to also harshly criticize
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hughes told the government that it faced
potentially large losses if the license was denied, including $100
million in unrecoverable costs and a possible penalty if the
government did not approve a license by Feb. 15, according to an
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the company's questioned deals with China, its
chairman was C. Michael Armstrong, who also served as head of
Clinton's export advisory council, a group of private-sector
executives and labor leaders who advice the administration on trade
policy. Armstrong now heads AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   His successor at Hughes, Michael T. Smith, wrote Albright last
December that Hughes ``will adopt new policies and procedures for
the export of technology and equipment,'' including a ``new
internal export compliance program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughes of today is a very different company than it was
even a year ago,'' Smith said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The license for the satellite deal was handled by the Commerce
Department, which must consult and win the consent of other
government departments involved in satellite exports. Next month,
as a result of legislation passed by Congress last year and
opposed, but signed, by Clinton, the State Department will once
again take on the lead role for a wider range of satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Deparment will no longer have a vote in licensing
reviews for many of the most sophisticated products, which will be
considered part of the State Department's ``munitions list,'' a
list of the nation's most sensitive military-related technologies.

PATTERNS: FALL SHOWS HANG ON IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fashion industry and New Yorkers may think that
with the shows ending last Friday, they have put the fall 1999
collections behind them. Not so fast. What was initially to have
been a few stragglers showing in April has turned into a full-blown
fashion event, organized for the most part by South of Seventh.
</P>
<P>
   South of Seventh, which began last season as a breakaway group
of small downtown design houses sponsored by the SoHo and TriBeCa
Partnerships, said it hopes that 31 designers will participate in
the event, from April 7 through 9. By Monday, 28 had been signed
up, said Vicki Ross, the organizer of South of Seventh.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three show sites, two at the Puck Building and one
nearby at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. An exhibition area will also
be provided for accessories and beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beene heads the list of designers showing, a king among
plebeians.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blass will show in April, too, probably in his showroom or
at Le Cirque 2000, Yvonne Miller, his spokeswoman, said Monday. But
she said he had not finally chosen a place or date.
</P>
<P>
   Beene has always been supportive of young, up-and-coming talent.
Among the other designers expected to show over the three days are
Robert Danes, William Calvert and Todd Thomas and more experienced
hands like Joan Vass and Neil Bieff.
</P>
<P>
   Designers will pay $1,000 to $3,000 to participate, compared
with the $6,000 to $25,000 it takes to show under the Seventh on
Sixth tents in Bryant Park. ``These shows are so expensive,'' Ms.
Ross said. ``I see why Seventh on Sixth has to charge what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, the last day of South of Seventh, two group shows
will open to the public at $25 to $500 a ticket. Part of the
expense of South of Seventh is being defrayed by those shows, and
part by sponsors like New York magazine; Alu, an Italian display
company, and the SoHo and TriBeCa Partnerships. Any extra funds
that are raised will go to the two community partnerships, social
services organizations that help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   A SHIRT MODELS A MODEL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russell Simmons has made his name as a businessman, but who knew
he was also a romantic? His latest venture combines both instincts.
He has turned the attractive image of his new wife, Kimora Lee
Simmons, a model who graced runways last week, into a print for a
new line of camp shirts at his Phat Farm fashion company.
</P>
<P>
   The oversize shirts, which arrived in his SoHo store this month
and cost $65, feature photo images of Mrs. Lee Simmons' face and
body in muted colors. Simmons was uncharacteristically speechless
when asked about the print. He's not sure why he did it, he said,
adding, after some thought, ``It's a conversational print.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Mrs. Lee Simmons think of her husband's homage to
her _ or exploitation, if you're a cynic. ``I think it's sweet,''
she said. ``I'm glad it sells, and I'm waiting on a check, which
I'll never get, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't know that there's underwear, too,'' Simmons said.
That arrives in May.
</P>
<P>
   THE MUSEUM'S NEW CLOTHES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
wanted to step back and assess all it had collected in the last 10
years, it decided that the best way was to mount an exhibition
around that theme. The result, ``Our New Clothes: Acquisitions of
the 1990s,'' opens April 6 and runs through Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our New Clothes'' will include old ones, too. The emphasis is
on styles the museum has acquired in the last decade, not styles
designed in the last decade. There is room for some confusion. As
Richard Martin, the Costume Institute's curator, explained, a
creamy white frock from the rococo period in the 18th century will
stand side by side with a 20th-century white Gucci gown with steel
belt designed by Tom Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Designs by Martin Margiela, Ann Demeulemeester, Giorgio Armani,
Giorgio Sant'Angelo, Todd Oldham, Rei Kawakubo and several dozen
more will also be on display. An ``American Heroes'' theme will
focus on Geoffrey Beene, Calvin Klein and the late Sant'Angelo, who
was discovered and championed by Diana Vreeland, a predecessor of
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The museum came by its Kawakubo sample by way of Barneys New
York, which is sponsoring this show, its first major fashion
exhibition. Recalling an encounter with Jason Weisenfeld, vice
president for publicity at Barneys, Martin said: ``Two years ago at
a Barneys Warehouse sale, I had a bag of goodies including a Comme

`Don't go to the checkout. Let me take that from you.'

to the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, more than 100 garments, will cover women's and
men's clothing with a couple of children's pieces.

   The institute has not had an exhibition of recent acquisitions
since the 1940's, Martin said. ``We have textbook examples of the
history of fashion,'' he said. ``We want to show that we are ready
to write about the history of fashion. It proves the value of a
museum collection.''

A PAVILION WHERE HARMONY LIVES: SELLARS' TAKE ON A CLASSIC  CROSSES
CULTURAL LINES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Please don't call it ``a Chinese opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peony Pavilion,'' in the production that opens March 5 at
Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley, is ``an American avant-garde opera,''
in the words of its composer, Tan Dun.
</P>
<P>
   Director Peter Sellars picks up the thought and, being Sellars,
runs with it. ``You're watching the future of Chinese culture,
which is being made outside China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peony Pavilion'' is having its American premiere in Berkeley
after performances last year in Vienna and Paris. For many, the Cal
Performances presentation promises to be the music-theater event of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of ``Peony Pavilion'' is the intermingling dreams of
a pair of ``star-crossed'' young lovers _ the reference to
Shakespeare is deliberate. A privileged 16-year-old girl dreams of
her ideal lover and after her death by starvation _ starved for
love in the midst of plenty _ the lover, a poor scholar,
hallucinates her ghost and restores her to life. ``It's three
nights of making love to a ghost,'' Sellars says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece could not have been done in China,'' he says, and
by that he means created there today. ``This big question of
tradition/innovation, of generations looking for expression, is
very difficult to arrive at in China.''
</P>
<P>
   He does want, nonetheless, to take this production there for the
millennium, where he hopes it will be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming is a big thing with Sellars. He hugs complete
strangers upon meeting them. It is bright-eyed friendliness on his
part, but it also seems to be a matter of conviction. Sellars would
like to welcome everyone in the world into the tent of
intercultural collaboration _ but they have to want to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can no longer discuss culture in nationalistic terms,'' he
says. ``This goes way beyond a sense of national identity or
flag-waving. The world is so complicated and so interestingly
interdependent and interwoven that it's world culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peony Pavilion'' is in Mandarin and English. It is spoken,
sung and danced by different performers representing the same
characters. It is in two parts. The first could loosely be called
traditional, the second anything but. It uses video but no
traditional Chinese costumes. It is also very erotic. Sellars calls
it ``just a luscious, beautiful, romantic evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on a classic Chinese text, this production was inspired
by, and is built around, Madame Hua Wenyi, a former Shanghai opera
star who now lives in Los Angeles, where she is a neighbor of
Sellars'. Small world.
</P>
<P>
   The music was written by Tan, who was born in Hunan and now
lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hua's role is doubled by Lauren Tom, a Chicago-born actress
(``The Joy Luck Club'') of Chinese descent, and by Shanghai soprano
Ying Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration is a key to Sellars' work. While the Metropolitan
Opera is a cultural institution built by immigrants, he says, ``I'm
very interested in a generation of immigrants that now is changing
American culture. Here's Tan Dun living in the United States
writing music that has to be characterized as American music.
Here's Madame Hua no longer in China but having to find a language
with which to communicate across the generations with a Chinese
American actress who does not speak Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both Chinese and they're from completely different
universes. This performance is the story of them finding a way in
which both of their lives include each other in their future. And
so it becomes American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, Tan Dun and Hua would never have met. They are
working different sides of the street _ Tan Dun in this avant-garde
direction, Hua representing the tradition. So the future of Chinese
culture becomes an urgent discussion for them to have in
performance _ but not in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellars calls this ``an extraordinary cultural crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, they would not meet because their worlds would not
touch. Whereas in America, everything's available, everything could
happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellars, beaded and braceleted, has become a familiar figure on
the University of California at Berkeley campus. ``I Was Looking at
the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky,'' his collaboration with
composer John Adams and poet June Jordan, was seen there in 1995,
and he has been teaching a class this semester.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Sellars, who is on the cusp of 40, lives
in Los Angeles. He went there originally to run the Los Angeles
Festival and stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Los Angeles. It's so important for my work. It's the
future of America being played out in the streets every day. I
admire New York. I lived there for years, but to me it's like
Paris. It's nostalgic, how things used to be. Los Angeles is the
edge. It's the city that erupted in flames a few years ago. It's
the city where what is happening is really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives there by himself. ``You know, at the moment it's fine.
I'm a very social being, and every day I'm in the room with
extraordinary people at a level of very intense emotional
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also important to have a little space in my life. My life
is very intensely engaged with people all over the world. I'm on
the road half the year. I think that's part of my nature. Certain
people have a nomadic streak. That is the nature of the work and
always has been. It's not exactly about settling, but it comes from
something that is unsettled but looking for another way to
understand what home might be.''

NEW YORK POLICE SEIZE CARS IN DRUNKEN-DRIVING CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kicking off a new crackdown on drunken driving in New
York City, police officers seized the cars of three drivers late
Sunday and Monday _ including one from a Staten Island librarian
who had no prior arrests and another from a 57-year-old Queens man
who had a long record of driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures came as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani hinted at how tough
the crackdown might be, saying that even those ultimately acquitted
of drunken driving in criminal court could still face the prospect
of losing their cars through proceedings in civil courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say somebody is acquitted, and it's one of those
acquittals in which the person was guilty, but there is just not
quite enough evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the mayor said.
``That might be a situation in which the car would still be
forfeited.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians promised legal challenges to the new policy,
which is considered among the strictest against drunken driving in
the nation. But the first round of seizures suggested that the city
would not shy away from confiscating the cars of drivers whose
blood-alcohol level was at or above the legal limit, and gave an
early glimpse of what drivers in the city could expect.
</P>
<P>
   In one case that was held up by prosecutors as a model of how
the program could work, police arrested and seized the car of
Francisco Almonte of Corona, Queens, who had been arrested eight
times for drunken driving and was on probation for his last
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   After Almonte, 57, was involved in an accident on Sunday night,
a Breathalyzer test indicated that his blood-alcohol level was
0.19, almost double the legal limit of 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, police arrested 28-year-old Pavel Grinberg of
Staten Island on charges that he was driving while intoxicated,
after officers saw him swerving and following other cars at close
range. A test showed his blood-alcohol level at 0.11, slightly
above the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Monday, a visibly shaken Grinberg pleaded not
guilty to the charges against him. A Polish immigrant who works in
a public library in Manhattan, he had never been arrested for
drunken driving, and his lawyer, Anthony Chinquee, said the charges
put Grinberg's job and immigration status at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is terrified,'' Chinquee said of his client after the
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The last car seized, a 1984 Honda, belonged to another Queens
man, Winston Rambharack, who was arrested at 4:05 a.m. Monday.
Police said that Rambharack, 26, was driving erratically along
Sutphin Boulevard, and that a Breathalyzer test showed his
blood-alcohol level to be 0.21, more than twice the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite questions about the severity of the crackdown, the mayor
was already finding some critical support for it. Thomas Gulotta,
the Nassau County, N.Y., executive, said Monday that he planned to
authorize police to seize the vehicles of drunken drivers and sell
them if the driver was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not permit innocent victims to continue to die at the
hands of reckless and irresponsible drunk drivers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Howarth of Mothers Against Drunk Driving expressed support
for the effort, saying, ``We encourage states to explore new ways
like this to get drunk drivers off the road.''
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old Brooklyn man, Juan Valez, was arrested for drunken
driving at about 4 a.m. Monday, but the car he was driving, a 1986
Cadillac, was not seized because it did not belong to him. Police
said they also would not seize cars rented for short periods, but
that they would confiscate cars that were leased.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups said litigation to challenge the seizures
is ``inevitable.'' Norman Siegel, executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, called the crackdown ``excessive,'' and
criticized the mayor for instituting a policy that he said would
pit police officers against New Yorkers just as the city was
grappling with the death of Amadou Diallo, who was killed two weeks
ago in a fusillade of police gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   About 21 other states have similar policies that allow police to
seize the cars of people suspected of drunken driving, and a study
in California has shown that such procedures reduce recidivism
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But most other states do not confiscate cars until after at
least two arrests for drunken driving. New York City's policy
allows for no second chances.

   The subject gets him going again: ``So much of our period is
characterized by exile. We're dealing with a culture of exile in
such a serious way now. You know the leading Chinese artists cannot
do their work in China, the leading African artists cannot do their
work in Africa, the leading Arab artists cannot do their work in
the Arab world. You're dealing with a situation of such extreme
censorship in most parts of the world, so that many of the greatest
artists cannot practice their art in their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peony Pavilion'' uses a translation of the long Ming Dynasty
poetic drama by Cyril Birch, a retired UC Berkeley professor of
East Asian languages. Sellars loves the fact that the original text
by Tang Xianzu dates from 1598 and the world premiere of the
current production in Vienna was in 1998 _ exactly 400 years later.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional Chinese opera based on the same text is still
performed _ and a Shanghai production was canceled by the Chinese
government before it reached New York last year _ but that is not
what will be seen in Berkeley. ``Half of the evening involves some
of the traditional scenes as you would see them performed in China
but revised by Tan Dun and me,'' Sellars says.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is never seen in Chinese opera but will be here
is the depiction of sex onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, why not?'' Sellars says. ``It's one of the reasons
theater exists.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not think lovers of traditional Chinese opera will be
upset by the new version. ``I think they'll be thrilled,'' he says.
``The piece itself is such a profound image of harmony, I think
people who see it will feel it is not so much an act of aggression
as an act of healing and reconciliation. This production is very
much created within the lines of traditional Chinese thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellars regards Tang's original poem for ``Peony Pavilion'' as
``tremendously political,'' in addition to being a tender love
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about the aspirations of a younger generation. The past
is not accepted by this pair of young lovers. There is this
tremendous sense of a student movement, asking real questions of
their country: What can we do in our lifetime to create the world
that we envision in our dreams? What it means to pursue the dream
is very potent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang and Shakespeare ``were on the planet'' in the same era and,
like a Shakespearean play, ``Peony Pavilion'' can be treated ``as a
romance or a quite profound metaphysical exploration of the soul
and body, of life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   The production that will be seen in Berkeley ``has changed a
lot'' since Vienna, and it will continue to change, because that is
the way Sellars works. He expects it to change more before it tours
Australia and Asia in, he hopes, 2000. He has his sights set on
Taiwan, Singapore, possibly Hong Kong, and ``our great dream is
that it would be in Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   He met Shanghai's Hua when she was in Los Angeles for the
festival in 1989, when she gave a series of performances including
scenes from the classic ``Peony Pavilion.'' She decided to stay,
and they began exploring the material together and bringing in
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Sellars calls Hua a ``charismatic performer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows what it is to be a major star,'' he says, ``and she
behaves accordingly. She'll let you know if something is not
acceptable. At the same time, her impatience with doing the same
old thing is intense. If she thinks something is boring, she'll
just say, `This is boring. I'm tired of doing this. Let's do
something better.' Which is really shocking, coming from the
tradition-bearer. She herself says, `This part of the tradition is
boring.'''

<P>
   No one is better than Calvin Klein at seizing the moment, which
in New York, at least, means a certain expensive simplicity, a
certain standard of grooming, and a certain fanatical eye for the
differences between, say, felted wool and plain old wool. It's all
very precise, like engraving the Manhattan skyline on the head of a
pin, and Klein, whose show effectively closed the New York fall
season last Friday, proved with sleek sportswear that he's still in
the groove.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? This is 1999, hardly a year to preserve the status
quo with conscientious minimalism _ black and white monochromes of
perfectly styled glamour, which, when considered next to the
looming vitality of the millennium, look like Oreo crumbs scattered
on a long white banquet table.
</P>
<P>
   Klein may have felt embarrassed by the millennium hype, and so
confined himself to a few choice words in his program notes, like
``uniforms'' and ``modern utility,'' to convey the future. But that
just means that Klein and Donna Karan, who also showed Friday,
arrived at utilitarianism on schedule _just when Rudi Gernreich,
the late fashion futurist from California, predicted it would
happen some 25 swinging years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, only a handful of designers last week stepped forward
to deal with the millennium, and the emotions associated with it,
in a bold, imaginative way. One thinks of Helmut Lang, mixing the
romantic militarism of Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance,'' written
at the turn of this century, with a ferocious montage of molded
leather trousers, shag fleece vests and coats the color of the
flaming orange space suits in ``Armageddon.'' A couple of people
actually said they got chills watching the show, although that
probably had more to do with the imperial strains of Elgar. Lang
said he got the idea for the music from ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just pushed the presentation to another level, basically,''
he explained. ``But there's only one millennium, so you might as
well go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   One also thinks of Daryl Kerrigan, whose militant urbanism now
places her in fashion's vanguard, and, to a lesser extent, of Marc
Jacobs, John Bartlett and Stephen Sprouse, who went straight to
NASA for his futuristic, 3-D tableaux, as if to say: ``Mars? But of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the more fatalistic Y2K predictions _ chaos, months of
civil unrest, computers going berserk _ it's probably not
surprising that many American designers seemed to hunker down in a
survivalist's mode. Everywhere there were images of fashion ready
for a long siege: padded coats and fuzzy blanket wraps that could
be converted into sleeping rolls, Velcro-tab-front trousers and
jackets for quick convenience, jungle fatigues at Claude Sabbah,
fur trapper boots at Patrick Robinson, sleeves that could be
instantly left by the side of a road with a tug of a zipper.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Kors' homage to the western style of Slim Hawks and
Gary Cooper suggested, unwittingly, a case of misguided optimism.
Kors' stretch cashmere riding coats, wool jeans and sable pullovers
certainly looked very sporty and chic. But mention the American
West, and suddenly the mind fills with a thoroughly different image
of the prairie _ not the socialite's paradise at all. More like
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   NASA or Waco, Waco or NASA? Which way is the modern fashion
seeker to go?
</P>
<P>
   Klein, understandably perhaps, chose the path of least
resistance: through the safe middle. In a collection that was
predominantly black and cream, with touches of camel, henna and
almond, Klein expertly ticked off the themes of the season. There
were sleek, boot-legged trousers in felted stretch wool; tidy
trench coats and fencing jackets cut with military sharpness;
mock-turtleneck shells and jersey tops, some lacquered for shiny
contrast. A black jacket in waxed calf, for instance, zippered over
a wet-looking black jersey T-shirt, and came with a pair of black
felted trousers. For evening, Klein stayed the course with
side-draped skirts in papery black radzmire, layered chiffon slip
dresses and some black wool dresses with long, lacquered leather
strands that could be gathered into a nice whip.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is one designer who understands that while the pace of
fashion has accelerated, through globalization and slick marketing,
the changes themselves are actually marginal. It's the difference
between black nylon and black felt. Which is exactly why this sort
of fashion _ discreet, invisible, manicured to within an inch of a
smooth surface _ can rarely gather forward momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It is generally taken as a bad sign when editors in the front
row stop writing, although, in Ms. Karan's case, the idle Mont
Blancs didn't necessarily spell trouble. Her collection was a
mostly black-and-cream series of a blanket cashmere coat and a
sleeveless blanket dress in blanket double-faced cashmere, which
adds up to ditto. Her silhouette was similar to that of a jacket
tied around the waist and left to hang in asymmetric points.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes were obviously very comfortable, with woolen ponchos
and body jerseys, and the models, whose lips were painted a deeper
red in the center, as if they had just sucked on peppermints,
seemed to enjoy rolling around in Ms. Karan's plush new stretch
cashmere sweaters. But as a collection, it was too much a Zenlike
meditation on a single idea.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other shows that rounded out the week, Robinson's
collection of homespun-looking dresses in cherry jersey and royal
blue corduroy, as well as jackets with funnel sleeves stuffed with
fleece at the cuffs, had a heavy drop-out's quality. It didn't help
that the models wore furry slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Nye's first runway collection was something of a
no-brainer: classic pea coats for men and women, gray flannel
suits, white military twill jeans and some standout woolen
sweaters. Nye, a former assistant to Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and
Carolina Herrera (who was in the front row with her husband,
Reinaldo) neatly finessed the gender issue, though one wonders
about his sailor jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who trooped around town last week, from high-rise
showrooms and fashion tents to arty dives on the Lower East Side,
knows that fashion's influence comes increasingly from the fringes.
It is obscure and often highly personal, like Bartlett's hardy
fleece coats and gently worn, almost dog-chewed felt skirts, which
owed their inspiration to the small-town portraits of the
photographer Mike Disfarmer.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn Smith's collection, entitled ``Angel's Gone Nuts,''
perfectly captured the helter-skelter bravura of fashion without
rules, while the design team of Sonja Rubin and Kip Chapelle caught
the downtown taste for plain skirts and sculptural handknit
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing trends to come along is the new
bohemianism _ ``this whole generation of travelers,'' as Anna Sui
said. She picked up on the idea when she noticed two of the models,
Stella Tennant and Kirsten Owen, reading ``The Beach,'' the cult
novel by Alex Garland. Ms. Sui worked the theme into her
folk-music-inspired collection _ and knew she was onto something
when the models wanted to take home her fur trekker boots. ``We had
the hardest time holding onto the boots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, one comes back to Helmut Lang _ to the way
the models darted out like dragonflies, to the creepy brilliance of
his vision, to the music (organized by Frederic Sanchez) that
somehow lifted the whole thing above the banality of fashion. After
the show, one editor said, ``I liked the clothes, but I don't know
the woman in them.'' Lang would probably regard that as a high
compliment. You can't see the future, only imagine it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Lang doesn't go in for a lot of heavy analysis. What he
liked about his coats, which the models wore dangling down their
backs from shoulder straps, was that they were utilitarian, but
also a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frames you,'' he said. ``It gives you a kind of wings.''

COMPOSER TAN PUT NEW LIFE INTO `PAVILION'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (with MUSIC-PEONY-SFCHRON)

   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Tan Dun wrote the music for ``Peony
Pavilion'' in an amazing three weeks _ ``just like Rossini and
Mozart,'' says director Peter Sellars.
</P>
<P>
   For the two parts of Sellars' production, Tan ``adapted the
traditional music'' from the Kun opera _ and, interestingly, from
Monteverdi _ and composed two hours of new music, including a
ritual shaman ceremony. He describes the emotional content as
``deep longing and sorrowful beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no identifiable composer for traditional Chinese opera
in the sense that Verdi is the composer of ``Il Trovatore.'' Often
the music is based on standard or folk melodies from the different
regions _ Peking Opera and Cantonese Opera represent those regions,
and Kun Opera is from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone says they are presenting the original `Peony
Pavilion,''' Tan said in a telephone interview from his home in New
York, ``there is no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular sections are still being performed today. The
complete opera does not exist, but the play does.''
</P>
<P>
   Tan composed a symphony for the celebration of the handover of
Hong Kong to China in 1997, but he says that piece was
``nonnational'' and not intended to promote the interests of either
the Chinese or the British. ``It was written for world culture, not
just for the handover,'' he says, ``and is the only piece written
for the 1997 festival that has had a life beyond it.'' There are
performances scheduled for Vienna, Jerusalem and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who is in his early 40s, will appear at the San Francisco
Symphony's ``Mavericks'' concert during the Stravinsky festival in
June. He said he wants to present himself there ``as a music
maker'' and not as ``an academic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there working with the San Francisco Symphony either
as an improvisational soloist or maybe conducting something to
discover the fresh music-making way.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after
winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all,
in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone
who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for
her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie. The white and silver racer-back
gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms. Jolie has to
offer that it seemed she had already been dipped in water.
</P>
<P>
   Awards shows like the Golden Globes, which took place last
month, have become a huge influence on fashion, previewing what
designers are likely to put on runways and stimulating sales. Ms.
Jolie's dress, by Randolph Duke, turned up in his show last Friday.
The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine
Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace
gowns he presented last week for fall. And the black and white
outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long
trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999
are a demure bunch. There was plenty of beauty worthy of the
Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance
for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit
heart palpitations. This design approach suited the moment well,
for with a few exceptions, it was a sexless season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that celibate fashion is bad. It's just different. Tommy
Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with
wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent
of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret. He gives
enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely
this side of Kmart oblivion. To the sounds of a live rock band,
Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection,
the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway
together.
</P>
<P>
   His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew,
especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white
stitching. The collection was further elevated by terrific fur
vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and
wool fit for a biker princess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of
creativity. There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her
inspirational mother lode. It was war. She masterfully rolled the
concept into her funky street-wear esthetic, with parachute nylon
jackets over slim pants, holey sweaters and shorts over trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective
utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats
or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
</P>
<P>
   That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising
given that Ms. Kerrigan hails from Ireland, where an awareness of
violence is never far from mind. Whether it was Ireland or the
millennium that drove her, the results were masterly.
</P>
<P>
   The pretty, festive clothes of the many designers who showed
evening wear in the last days of the shows, which ended Friday,
balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms. Kerrigan. In
his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short
excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded
chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla
frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt. Beaded
tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black
velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row
Hall was playing to. If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to
make an entrance, it lacked impact. If you were Dawn Mello, the
president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and
elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to
bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
</P>
<P>
   Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if
earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear. Ms. Wang offered
gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm
fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have
pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms. Wang handily paired
skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the
collection with a very American spirit. A wonderful impact of the
American shows' going first on the international calendar (London,
Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers
plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
Wang's show and at Duke's. It was uplifting to see Duke back on the
runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer. In
the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband,
Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _
off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing
them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all,
debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian
models was regrettable. Making race a part of an esthetic
unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be
left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of
the season, as has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of
view without typecasting. Fresh and original, Ms. Tam incorporated
futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly
dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual
icons embroidered onto T-shirts. Ms. Tam had her false starts, but
she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Ms. Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual,
turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection. Turbid colors
like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over
wide-leg trousers. Yohji Yamamoto makes this awkward asexual
proportion look easy. Ms. Feng shows us that, clearly, it is not.

BIOTECHNOLOGY TREATY STALLS AS U.S. AND DEVELOPING NATIONS QUARREL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Negotiations to forge a global
biotechnology safety treaty have hit a stalemate here over sharp
disagreements between the United States and most developing
countries, raising the prospect that the talks could fail.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which have been under way for more than a week, are
to end on Tuesday, and it is not unusual in such negotiations for
breakthroughs to occur at the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   But several days of intense negotiations have failed to make
much headway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol is very ill and in the hospital,'' Rafe
Pomerance, the deputy assistant secretary of state for environment
and development, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Biosafety Protocol, as it is called, would regulate the
shipment between countries of organisms that have been altered by
genetic engineering. The talks are an outgrowth of the Convention
on Biological Diversity reached at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is aimed at reducing the risk of harmful ecological
effects from introducing genes from different species into plants,
animals or microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest split is over whether agricultural commodities, such
as genetically altered wheat or soy beans, should be subject to the
most important requirement of the protocol, which is that an
exporter receive permission in advance from the importing nation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, worried that tens of billions of dollars in
annual farm exports would get tied up in red tape or blocked
completely, maintains that commodities meant to be eaten or
processed should not be covered since they do not enter the
environment. From 25 percent to 45 percent of major crops grown in
the United States are now genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   But developing countries say that commodities should be included
because they contain seeds that can be planted or can accidentally
escape into the environment. They also say there could be health
risks from eating genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, where there is much more concern about
genetically modified food than in the United States, also wants
commodities included. The United States is allied with five other
agricultural exporters _ Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile and
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   The latest draft of the treaty excludes agricultural commodities
from the advanced approval requirements. But the developing nations
want to include a provision that would allow individual countries,
using the protocol, to require such advanced approval for
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations are also unhappy that other things have been
excluded from the protocol. The latest draft has an exemption for
pharmaceuticals, and one aimed at organisms used in scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   Another category exempted is products made from genetically
altered organisms, which could include everything from corn flakes
made from genetically engineered corn or blue jeans made from
genetically modified cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to negotiate a biosafety protocol,'' said
Sateeaved Seebaluck, a delegate from Mauritius. ``It would seem
that trade has taken over and what we have is something more
resembling a biotrade protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   While such exclusions are victories for the United States, there
are other aspects of the draft that the United States and its
allies and the food and biotechnology industries believe would
severely hamper exports and technology development.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the working group drawing up the treaty rammed
approval of the draft through Monday. But many of the members
immediately condemned the process and the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The draft now must be approved by the end of Tuesday by the
parties to the 1992 biodiversity convention. But rough going is
expected. The protocol must also be ratified by at least 50 nations
to take effect.

NEW YORK TIMES TO INVEST $15 MILLION IN THESTREET.COM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. said on Monday that it had
agreed to invest $15 million in cash and services in TheStreet.com,
an online provider of investment news and financial information, in
exchange for a minority equity stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. also said it was ``currently discussing
opportunities for strategic alliances with TheStreet.com.'' Michael
Golden, a vice chairman of the Times Co., has been nominated to
serve on TheStreet.com's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a year, TheStreet.com has raised $50 million in
financing, including the Times investment. It was founded in 1996
by James J. Cramer, the financial columnist, and Martin Peretz,
editor in chief and chairman of The New Republic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com, which offers a broad mix of news and commentary
on investment and trading-related topics, has about 37,000
subscribers. Cramer also manages a hedge fund, writes frequent
articles about his trading experiences and is the Web site's
marquee contributor _ he also writes for several publications,
including Time and GQ magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been growing on Wall Street that TheStreet.com,
which recently struck two deals to license its name for stock
indexes that track Internet companies, is preparing for a public
offering of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, Bloomberg Business News reported that Kevin W.
English, chairman and chief executive of TheStreet.com, said that a
1999 public offering ``is a strong possibility, depending on market
conditions and other variables.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet stock offerings has been red hot, with
most new issues jumping sharply on their first day of trading. In
fact, TheStreet.com and Cramer held an investment roundtable on
Friday about the outlook for Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, English declined to comment on a possible public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Russell T. Lewis, chief executive and president of the Times
Co., said the deal held promise for the Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just two years, TheStreet.com has rapidly grown into one of
the most influential financial information sites on the Web,
attracting some of the country's most affluent and market-savvy
Internet users,'' Lewis said in a statement. ``As a result,
TheStreet.com is a good strategic fit with our own customer base,
which needs timely and quality information to make informed
investment decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Carparelli, a spokeswoman for the Times Co., said that the
type of services to be provided to TheStreet.com had not yet been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   One media consultant said advertising was the most likely
service. ``Any time one of the traditional media companies has
invested in one of the Internet companies, what the Internet guys
want is marketing support,'' said Bill Bass, a analyst at Forrester
Research Inc., a media research company. ``There may be some
editorial ties,'' he said, or some form of promotion in which The
Times urges readers to view TheStreet.com's Web site. The Times Co.
said the editorial relationship, if any, had not yet been defined.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com charges a fee for access to most of its Web site,
while access to The New York Times Web site is free.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Times deal brings together two longtime friends, Cramer and
Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media
Co., the unit of the Times Co. that operates its Web site. The two
attended Springfield Township High School in Pennsylvania in the
early 1970s, and Cramer once told The Associated Press they were
close friends in school.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com has been aggressively raising money, an activity
that is frequently a prelude to an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   In January, it received $25 million from a group led by Oak
Investment Partners, a venture capital firm with $1.6 billion in
investments. Also participating in the group were Bowman Capital
Management of San Mateo, Calif.; Waller-Sutton Media Partners, a
New York private equity fund that invests in the media,
communications and entertainment industries; Henry R. Kravis, the
financier, and Optimix Private Equity Fund.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, TheStreet.com also received additional financing
from Flatiron Partners, Chase Capital Partners and Softbank
Technology Ventures, which combined had put $10 million into the
company back in May 1998. Other early investors, Constellation
Ventures, Pequot Capital Management, Cramer and Peretz, also bought
additional shares in January.

 &HT;    Second strong showing gives Wohlers optimism
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Mark Wohlers turned a good day into a
trend on Monday by pitching his second strong batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three days, after a wobbly beginning in
spring training, Wohlers consistently was on target with his
fastball. He did not throw batting practice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If today was any indication, he'd be ready for Opening Day,''
manager Bobby Cox said. ``That's the best I've seen Mark throw in a
year and a halfreally since the middle of the (1997) season. ... I
thought today was just excellent. He looked like any other pitcher
today. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers said he knows he's on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not where I want to be,'' he said, ``but from
where I've come from, I'm very pleased and quite optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers said he was glad the coaching staff decided to allow him
to pitch against live hitting from the start of spring training. It
has given him the chance to face his fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked off the mound and ran to the outfield to get my
shoes to run, I remember smiling when I ran out there,'' Wohlers
said. ``It felt good. It's been a while since I walked off the
mound and actually felt pretty good. But at the same time, I want
to have the same approach _ that's what I'm supposed to do. Let's
not jump for joy and do cartwheels because I threw some strikes in
batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   HUBBARD STARTS OVER
</P>
<P>
   Back in the major leagues for the first time since he retired as
a player in 1989, Braves first base coach Glenn Hubbard has had
much more on his mind than his move from coaching in the minor
leagues. Hubbard's Stone Mountain house burned in December, and he
has spent the time since then trying to put his life back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough deal waking up the next day and what you had on
the night before is what you have left,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the fire, Hubbard's oldest son Jeremy, 19, had a
snowboarding accident and tore his spleen. Another son, Daniel, 14,
broke an arm while rollerblading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the toughest spring I've ever had,'' Hubbard said.
``I felt bad about coming down here because (the settlement) wasn't
finished yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, his wife and their three sons had to do inventories of
all their belongings, listing when and where they got all their
clothes, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubbards are living in a rental house four miles from the
remains of their home. It will take at least seven months for
construction workers to destroy the remains of his house and
rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard has learned that he was responsible for starting the
fire. He had discarded almost two-day-old ashes from his fireplace
into a container on his back deck, and that's where the fire
started. Luckily for the Hubbards, no one was home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The fire investigator) told me, `I've never seen a house fire
that bad without loss of life,''' Hubbard said. ``You have to look
at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the record, the fireplace in the new house will be a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting gas logs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   THEN THERE WERE EIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Braves agreed to terms with minor-league second baseman
Marty Malloy on Monday, bringing the number of players signed on
the 40-man roster to 32. Those yet to be signed are Andruw Jones,
Kevin Millwood, Kerry Lightenberg, Bruce Chen, Odalis Perez, George
Lombard, Damian Moss and Randall Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ON DECK
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the day for the Braves position players to report to
camp. Those yet to show include Ryan Klesko, Andruw Jones, Gerald
Williams, Ozzie Guillen and Danny Bautista. The Braves will begin
their full-squad workouts today.

 &HT;    Martin's lawyers seek delay, own trial
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lawyers for Falcons wide receiver Tony Martin filed a
motion in federal court Monday asking to delay until next year his
trial on five charges of money laundering and one charge of
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 33, was indicted last month in connection with his
relationship with Ricky Brownlee, a twice-convicted drug trafficker
who is charged again. The trial tentatively is scheduled to begin
May 3.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Miami, attorneys
Howard Srebnick and Roy Black also asked judge Kevin Michael Moore
to ``sever Tony Martin from his co-defendant,'' so that the two
would be tried separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martin) is not charged with any drug-trafficking activity,''
Srebnick said. ``It doesn't make sense for him to sit through a
trafficking trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Srebnick and Black also asked the court to postpone Martin's
trial, hoping for a ruling before Martin's March 8 arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have requested January of next year. That would permit
(Martin's) uninterrupted employment,'' Srebnick said. ``Also ... we
have other clients, obligations to other judges and other courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons owe Martin a $400,000 roster bonus March 1 _ next
Monday _ and might seek to delay that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   FALCONS LOSE ANOTHER
</P>
<P>
   Reserve defensive end Antonio Edwards, who had 17 total tackles
in his only season as a Falcon, became the third unrestricted free
agent to depart Monday. He agreed to a two-year, $1.3 million
contract with Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Moultrie native turned down a little more money from
Atlanta, which has now lost both reserve defensive ends.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, former defensive end John Burrough signed with
Minnesota, and reserve safety Devin Bush signed with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have eight more unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   PR CHIEF QUITS
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Taylor, the easy-going director of public relations for
the Falcons, resigned Monday after 12 years with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 49, did not say he was forced to leave, but he often
felt left out of the loop by the front office.
</P>
<P>
   It was not uncommon for reporters to approach him seeking
details on organizational moves before he knew of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we talked about for a few weeks,'' Taylor said.
``I'll try to stay in Atlanta. It's time to move on. These days,
the PR guys don't seem to move up.

U.S. ATTACKS MICROSOFT OFFICIAL ON NETSCAPE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft executive responsible for dealing
with Netscape Communications Corp. testified Monday that he did not
regard Netscape as a competitor in June 1995. But the government
presented e-mail written at the time in which the witness himself
and other Microsoft's executives portrayed Netscape as a
potentially dangerous rival.
</P>
<P>
   The point is crucial because that meeting between Microsoft and
Netscape is a key episode in the government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   With document after document supplementing his acerbic
cross-examination, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial
lawyer in the case against Microsoft Corp., proceeded Monday with
perhaps the most sweeping attack on the credibility of a witness
since the trial began last October.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he tried to point to contradictions between
what Daniel Rosen, the witness, was saying Monday and what he and
other Microsoft executives had written and said in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Boies certainly felt he succeeded. He abruptly cut off his
cross-examination in the afternoon as Rosen repeatedly seemed
evasive on the stand, interrupting Rosen in mid-sentence and
telling the judge, ``I have no further questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Boies explained his tactic on the courthouse steps.
``I thought the points about the witness' credibility had been
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that Rosen was simply trying to be precise
about highly detailed discussions of software technology and
strategy. And Rosen testified that his belief that Netscape did not
intend to compete with Microsoft was based on what Netscape
executives told him then.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen led a team from Microsoft that met with Netscape
executives on June 21, 1995, when the government contends that
Microsoft threatened Netscape and made an illegal offer to divide
the Internet browser market between them.
</P>
<P>
   After Netscape declined the deal, the government says, Microsoft
embarked on a campaign to crush Netscape, the early leader in the
browser market, and stifle competition. Microsoft replies that
those allegations are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of
what occurred at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen testified that at the time he saw Netscape as a potential
partner rather than a bitter rival. Microsoft, he added, was trying
to persuade Netscape to adopt the underlying Internet technology it
was building into its Windows 95 operating system, and then to
build software products on top of Microsoft's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on May 15, 1995, more than a month before the disputed June
meeting, Rosen wrote an e-mail titled ``Internet Direction'' in
which he described the threat that Internet software posed to
Microsoft's control of the basic technology of personal computer
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft currently controls the base and evolution of the
desktop platform,'' Rosen wrote. ``The threat of another company
(Netscape has been mentioned by many) to use their Internet World
Wide Web browser as an evolution base could threaten a considerable
portion of Microsoft's future revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, Boies asked, ``Did you believe that at the time you
wrote it?''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen replied, ``No sir.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft executive added that his memo was a draft
document, which he said he had never sent, and that it represented
mostly a summary of thinking within Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies pointed out that the e-mail bore the heading, ``Sent:
Monday, May 15, 1995, 12:48 a.m.'' Rosen replied that the time in
the heading represented when he saved the e-mail on his personal
computer and did not necessarily indicate that it had been sent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the afternoon, Boies presented a Microsoft document list
showing that the government obtained Rosen's e-mail from Ben
Slivka, a Microsoft executive who was listed among the intended
recipients of the Rosen message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that refresh your memory?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Rosen replied, ``at the least, I sent it to Slivka.''
But he added that he still did not believe that he sent the
unfinished draft to senior Microsoft executives listed as
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same memo, Rosen wrote that Microsoft should try to
``strike a close relationship with Netscape'' and that Microsoft's
goal should be to ``wrest leadership of the client evolution from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this passage, Rosen said that ``by wrest, I mean
take.'' But he said again that this referred to underlying Internet
software and did not imply trying to push Netscape out of parts of
the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Holding to his testimony that he did not regard Netscape as a
rival in June 1995, Rosen said that a strategy document written by
William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, in May 1995 was simply
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' which was widely
circulated within Microsoft, Gates called Netscape a ``new
competitor `born' on the Internet'' and said Netscape's strategy
was to ``commoditize the underlying operating system'' _ a direct
threat to Microsoft's lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Gates document, Rosen said, ``I recall when
reading this I thought that Bill was probably wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said that the government's
efforts Monday did not show contradictions in Rosen's testimony or
that Microsoft was engaged in revisionist history to suit its
defense. Instead, he said, the testimony and documents merely
demonstrated that in 1995 there was ``some disagreement within
Microsoft about whether Netscape would be a competitor or not.''

 &HT;    Lehman rusty but ready in Match Play
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Say this for Tom Lehman. He hasn't come to
the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship overprepared or
golfed out. Following right shoulder surgery Nov. 30, Lehman hasn't
competed in an actual tournament since the Tour Championship at
East Lake in Atlanta Nov. 1. His last event of any kind was the
Skins Game Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a first-round match in the $5 million event Wednesday
against Scott Verplank, Lehman admits to some rust on his game, but
desires no medical slack. He is swinging the golf club without pain
for the first time since July 15, when he injured the shoulder
while playing with his kids at an amusement park on the eve of the
British Open. The surgery repaired a separation in the shoulder and
chopped off three-fourths of an inch from his clavicle to improve
his range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder's completely healed,'' said Lehman. ``It's just a
matter of getting my strength back. I get a little tired out at the
end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances Lehman, who has played on two Ryder
Cup and two Presidents Cup teams, would be among the top contenders
for this debut event of the World Golf Championships. But while a
question mark, there was never a question that he would attend the
inaugural WGC event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is the one that everyone wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   COURSE MADE FOR WOODS
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price would agree with those who, for all practical
purposes, automatically place Tiger Woods into the quarterfinals.
``For somebody who hits the ball as long as he does, this course is
right up his street,'' said Price. ``He can reach all the par 5s.
Normal hitters can maybe reach two of them.'' . . . The 32
first-round matches begin Wednesday at 10:20 a.m. EST. . . . No. 64
Nick Faldo, who plays No. 1 Woods in a first-round match, got
typically testy with reporters Monday while waiting to hit off the
10th tee, citing the approaching ``vultures.

 &HT;    Mitchell tiring of turmoil
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ World-class sprinter Dennis Mitchell says some friends
and family have turned on him after he flunked a drug test, since
overturned by the U.S. track and field federation. His legal
defense alone cost in ``the six digits,'' and now he is unable to
earn even a dime from product endorsements and sponsors. Meet
promoters and competitors alike greet him with a wary eye.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the middle of a world summit on doping in sports
earlier this month, Mitchell's controversial case was held up for
ridicule, as everyone from Olympic drug czar Prince Alexandre de
Merode to Olympic gold medalist and British parliamentarian
Sebastian Coe ripped into what had been widely published as his
defense: engaging in sex and drinking beer the night before an
unannounced visit from a drug tester.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 100-meter bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics,
said he is under his attorney's orders not to discuss his defense,
except to say it is more complicated than reports have indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to really grow up. If it (the sex and alcohol
defense) was that easy to beat a doping case, then there would be
no deterrent for using drugs,'' he said. ``There is a lot more to
it, of course. When my case was heard by USA Track and Field, it
was obvious to everyone in that room that I did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, head of the U.S. track federation, refused to
discuss the evidence and expressed concern that details of
Mitchell's case had been leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Having been cleared by USATF in December, Mitchell has competed
this indoor season. He ranks among the top names, along with
Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond, entered in the 60 meters this
weekend in the U.S. Indoor Track and Field Championships at the
Georgia Dome. But the legal wrangling has come at a heavy price,
and it's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   The international track federation ultimately determines whether
athletes are cleared in drug cases. Officials met with Mitchell's
attorney two weeks ago, but the decision _ either accepting the
U.S. federation's innocent verdict or sending his case to
arbitration _ might not be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case involving American female distance running icon
Mary Slaney remains unresolved almost three years after a positive
test at the 1996 Olympic Trials in Atlanta. Like Slaney, Mitchell's
test was flagged because of elevated testosterone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's level of testosterone to epitestosterone, two natural
hormones, was above the allowable 6-to-1 ratio. The controversial
test, designed to detect performance-enhancing substances, has been
constantly under challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge distraction,'' said Mitchell, a former
University of Florida star who still trains in Gainesville. ``You
go from being a very highly respected athlete to being accused of
something you had never thought would be a part of your life. It's
like being on death row and being innocent of something that's
almost impossible to prove you're innocent of. The moment this
thing made it into the press, I lost everything _ my income, my
endorsements. My entire life is track and field.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the turmoil has hindered his training and his
confidence, which was apparent in his sixth-place finish Friday
night in the Adidas D.C. Invitational. As he walked off the track,
his mother, Lenora, came out of the stands to offer a consoling
hug. This week, he'll spend time with his sister Denise, an Atlanta
teacher. Those two relatives have supported him. Others have not,
he said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has devastated him,'' Lenora Mitchell said. ``Dennis has
always prided himself on justice. He likes to be in control, and
here he's in a situation that is in someone else's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is assumed that track athletes dabble with drugs on
occasion, the news of Mitchell's alleged involvement came as a
surprise to the track community. He has been outspoken against drug
use and has served as president of the USATF athletes advisory
committee. He had not been, in his words, one of the ``bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell learned during a July 8 phone call from Masback that
his testosterone levels had shown to be high and that he would be
given a hearing to explain why. The news came just after he had
competed in the U.S. outdoor championships _ where he pulled up
with leg cramps _ and before the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely stunned,'' he said. ``At that time, it was
probably the worst news that I could ever have heard .''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he is confident the international federation will
rule in his favor. If they don't, he is prepared to fight the case
through appeals. But he also said the case has tired him and left
him to ponder his future. He hasn't bothered commuting to North
Carolina to work with his coach, Trevor Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 32, and I only want two more years in the sport,''
Mitchell said. ``If I have to go through this arbitration process
(should the international body fail to accept the U.S. federation's
ruling), looking at past examples, it's going to take two years. I
might have to make a decision whether I want to compete or not.''

TWO CABINET SECRETARIES HELD IN CONTEMPT OVER PROBLEMS IN INDIAN
TRUST ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: Subs 2d graf to insert ``citing official deceit.'' Subs
12th, 19th and 20th grafs to correct spelling of plaintiff's name
to ``Cobell'' sted ``Cobel.'') (fe) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly a century, American Indians have been asking the
federal government for a simple accounting of money and land held
in trust for them since the days of treaty signing. On Monday, they
got the attention of the highest levels of government, as a federal
judge held in contempt two cabinet secretaries who oversee Indian
trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial order, citing official deceit, was a jolt in a
lawsuit over billions of dollars in money and land held in trust
for as many as 500,000 Indians. The accounts date to the 1880s,
when the government tried to break up the tribal land ownership
system and awarded individual allotments of 80 to 160 acres per
Indian. These lands were then managed by the government, usually
leased out to gas, oil or timber companies. As with many trusts,
the income is passed on to the descendants of the original
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are trying to force the government to set up a
proper accounting system for the trust funds and to repay
beneficiaries who may have lost up to $10 billion in the last
century. The accounts have been woefully mismanaged, tribal members
say, and do not comply with even the basic standards of private
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say records of nearly
century-old oil, gas or timber leases have disappeared, in many
cases, making it impossible to keep track of who is owed what. But
tribal members say more than time and bureaucratic incompetence are
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., forcefully agreed, saying in his contempt order
that government officials had deliberately delayed turning over the
documents and then lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing denunciation of the government's handling of the
trust fund case, Lamberth found Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
Treasury Secretary Robert Robert Rubin and Assistant Secretary of
the Interior Kevin Gover in civil contempt for failing to produce
records of the trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``engaged in a shocking pattern of deception of
the court,'' the judge said. ``I have never seen more egregious
misconduct by the federal government,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt order carries no personal penalties and is largely
an indictment of the departments that oversee Indian trust funds,
not necessarily the secretaries themselves. But the judge warned
that further delays could lead to criminal contempt citations of
both Rubin and Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the order, the government must pay the plaintiffs' legal
fees and other expenses resulting from the officials' delay.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt order is viewed by people on both sides as a fire
alarm in a case that has been slowly smoldering since it was filed
in 1996. It is scheduled to go to trial in May. Legal historians
say it is the first time two cabinet officers have been held in
contempt simultaneously. Next week, two Senate committees will hold
a joint hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of justice for the victims who
have had years and years of abuse at the hands of the United States
government,'' said Eloise Cobell, a member of the Blackfoot nation,
who is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   She said the standard of money management for Indians by the
government has never approached that of non-Indians. ``The
government regulates national banks to the highest standards,'' Ms.
Cobell said. ``And yet when it comes to Indian money, look at what
they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says that it inherited an epic
accounting mess and that it has done more than any previous
administration to correct the problem. The president has requested
$150 million for the next fiscal year to set up adequate
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, administration officials were apologetic. ``We deeply
regret the mistakes that we made in this case,'' officials from the
departments of Interior, Treasury and Justice said in a joint
statement. Earlier, they apologized to the court for their
inability to produce legal and trust documents.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt says the Interior Department has reorganized two-thirds
of the account files, putting a management system in place that is
closer to that of commercial banks. But he says major problems
remain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government estimates that the accounts generate
about $300 million a year. But it has no idea precisely how many
properties, leases, contracts and investments are in the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say many checks are lost or sitting in files
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The money is vital to some Indians who depend on it for their
basic income. In the past, people have lost their land or homes
through foreclosure because the trust fund checks never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a national bank had handled a trust fund the way the
Department of Interior has handled Indian trust funds, the bank
would have been closed and the people running it would be in
jail,'' Ms. Cobell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cobell, who lives on the Blackfoot reservation in Montana,
is one of five people in the lawsuit whose cases are specifically
cited. Indians have been trying to find the records of her family
trust and four others as a way to show a specific pattern of
neglect by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The records have been misplaced, lost to time or _ in the case
of a document center in Albuquerque, N.M. _ contaminated with rat
feces that could contain the deadly hantavirus, government
officials say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The government has been ducking their trust fund
responsibility for decades,'' said John Echohawk, director of the
Native American Rights Fund, which is backing the lawsuit. ``It
goes to show how egregious their management has been that they
couldn't even find records for five people and then lied to the
court about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth sided with the tribal members throughout his 76-page
order. ``Justice has not been done to these Indian beneficiaries,''
he wrote. ``The court cannot tolerate any more empty promises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian trust accounts have been particularly embarrassing to
Babbitt, who came into office vowing to reform some of the ways
that his department oversees affairs in Indian country.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they have had a hard time tracking down
some of the descendants who are beneficiaries of the trusts, an
explanation dismissed by Indians who have been fighting for basic
accountability.

 &UR; SDGE  &LR; - With nearly all of its debts paid off, San Diego's electric
utility says it will cut electric rates by 15 percent in July _
nearly two years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by San Diego Gas and Electric Co. may nudge
other big utilities, chiefly Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and
Southern California Edison, to get their debts retired more
quickly. By Rebecca Smith
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STREET &LR;  - Will investors go for a second cup of Diedrich
Coffee?
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine coffee house chain plans on holding a secondary stock
offering to help pay for its $35 million buyout of Castroville's
Coffee People, according to documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. By columnist Mark Veverka
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; MONEY PACKAGE &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; DAYTRADER -  &LR; They've been lampooned for their eccentricity in Garry
Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   They've been rebuked for their high-risk investment tactics by
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   They've been reviled by the Wall Street establishment for
roiling the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   They're the Internet day traders _ perhaps hundreds of thousands
of them nationwide _ stubborn individualists who have rejected
9-to-5 jobs, choosing instead to indulge in fast-paced, in-and-out
securities trading from their homes. By Arthur M. Louis
</P>
<P>
   &UR; With: PROFILE1 &LR;  _ In his previous incarnation, San Mateo day
trader Tom Weeden worked for a firm specializing in fancy,
multicolor printing for graphic artists.
</P>
<P>
   That's how he learned about a company that had come out with a
digital printing press.
</P>
<P>
   He bought 100 shares, made a profit and decided that the stock
market was much more interesting than his printing job. ``I decided
that trading stocks was something I would really like to do, and I
became quite a student of the market.'' By Arthur M. Louis
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROFILE2 _  &LR; Avery Neal _ the alias of a publicity-shy,
40-year-old tile contractor _ went from assets in ``the middle five
figures'' to ``well into six figures'' in a few years by buying
stocks whose prices were battered to historic lows or those that
were making ``breakouts'' on the myriad charts that cover
practically every wall of his Alameda home. By Arthur M. Louis
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROFILE3 &LR;  _ Shari Smith, 51, co-owner with her husband of a
tool-making company, started trading from her home in San Carlos
more than a year ago with $200,000 in savings. Now she has
$530,000, thanks largely to an uncanny ability to predict price
moves in Nasdaq stocks by staring at the ticker tape on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONEYBAG -  &LR; Question: I'm a 13-year-old girl who received a
$10,000 gift from my grandmother. I'm thinking of investing the
money in a combination of stock ($6,000), an IRA account consisting
of either Vanguard or Merrill Lynch stock mutual funds ($2,000) and
a bank certificate of deposit ($2,000). The stock I have in mind is
my father's company, which is not yet publicly traded, but he says
it has a great future. Does this sound like a good plan? Columnist
Arthur M. Louis has the answer.

 It's All in the Charts  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Avery Neal _ the alias of a publicity-shy, 40-year-old tile
contractor _ went from assets in ``the middle five figures'' to
``well into six figures'' in a few years by buying stocks whose
prices were battered to historic lows or those that were making
``breakouts'' on the myriad charts that cover practically every
wall of his Alameda home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look for stocks breaking out to new highs,'' says Neal, a
profane, excitable ex-New Yorker. ``Or reversals _ stocks that have
hit their lows and are starting to bounce back. I judge companies
strictly by their charts. I know nothing about business, but I can
detect reversals in psychology. My house is a f_ mess. Newspapers
and charts everywhere. You wouldn't think a 40-year-old guy would
live like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal prefers stocks with small capitalizations, mainly _ though
not exclusively _ ``cutting-edge'' high-technology companies, whose
prices tend to move faster than other stocks. ``You can get a 25
percent move in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if the 25 percent move doesn't materialize, he often
will bail out of a stock after it has moved only a fraction of a
point. ``I consider myself like a mosquito on the ass of an
elephant,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of the big dudes who sways the markets. I bought
Shaman Pharmaceuticals at 30 cents and sold it at 46 cents. I don't
give a crap where it is now. You've gotta get out before everybody
else does. On Wall Street, bulls and bears are fed, but pigs are
slaughtered. If I make or lose 1,000 bucks on something, that's the
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he moves in and out quickly, he makes ``only a few
trades a day.'' After buying a stock, he will enter a stop-loss
order (an order to sell if a stock falls to a certain price)
slightly below the purchase price _ ``so I don't lose too much if
the stock moves against me. I can never understand people I hear
moaning about how their AOL stock fell to 146 after they bought it
at 170. Why would they still own it?''
</P>
<P>
   He makes all his decisions on his own. ``If you listen to
anybody else _ and that includes brokers _ you're just gonna lose
money because they don't know s_.''

 San Diego's Early Electric Rate Cut May Set Example  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
With nearly all of its debts paid off, San Diego's electric utility
says it will cut electric rates by 15 percent in July _ nearly two
years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by San Diego Gas and Electric Co. may nudge
other big utilities, chiefly Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and
Southern California Edison, to get their debts retired more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this announcement by SDG&AMP;E puts pressure on others,''
said Kevin Smith, spokesman for the California Manufacturers
Association in Sacramento. ``We'd like to see an early retirement
of utility debts everywhere so rates can fall throughout the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of PG&AMP;E and Edison have said they will need much
more time to pay down their debts than the San Diego utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as far along in our cost recovery as SDG&AMP;E,'' said
Mark Huffman, a PG&AMP;E attorney. ``We don't have an exact forecast
but there's no way it'll happen this summer for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's deregulation law, utilities have been allowed
to keep rates high during a transition period and use surplus funds
to pay off debts that were shouldered under the old regulatory
regime. Utilities have until March 31, 2002, to collect the extra
money, unless they get debts paid down sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Once the collection period ends, rates must fall to a level
based on utility operating costs. For PG&AMP;E, that should mean at
least a 20 percent rate cut for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Guiles, president of SDG&AMP;E, said his firm is ending the
freeze early because it's paid off $2 billion worth of debts,
thanks to high prices fetched, at auction, for electricity as well
as power plants.
</P>
<P>
   It auctioned its Encina Power Plant and 18 smaller generating
units for $356 million last year. At four times book value, it was
one of the highest prices obtained in any power plant divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   The utility also profited from being last in line to sell its
plants, giving it a very unusual opportunity to sell power from
unsold plants into an electricity auction last summer when prices
hit a high of $9,999 per megawatt as compared with normal prices of
a few dollars per megawatt.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E's situation is quite different from San Diego's. How soon
PG&AMP;E ends the freeze rests on two things: the wholesale price of
electricity that it procures for customers and the sum it fetches
for its huge hydroelectric generating system that's now for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The more it must pay for wholesale power bought from the
California Power Exchange, the less money it has left for debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if wholesale electricity prices run 1.5 cents per
kilowatt hour, PG&AMP;E figures it can pay off debts and end the freeze
in 2001. If it must pay 2.5 cents per kilowatt, it figures it will
need an extra nine months to pay down its debts.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SDGE23 (13826 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In 1998, PG&AMP;E paid an average of 3.3 cents per kilowatt for
wholesale electricity obtained from the state's new power auction.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet for an early end to the freeze is a high valuation
on the hydroelectric system it wants to divest.
</P>
<P>
   If PG&AMP;E can get a hefty profit from that deal, all those dollars
would be used to slash debt.
</P>
<P>
   So far, PG&AMP;E projections have assigned a value of $1.6 billion
to its hydro assets. That's straight book value and few outside the
utility expect the system to sell for so little.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has said it hopes to transfer the system to a sister
company and credit the proceeds from that transaction against its
debts. Consumer advocates have said this means there's a huge
incentive for the utility to sell the system at a low-ball price.
</P>
<P>
   That would do two things. It would save the sister company money
and allow PG&AMP;E to perpetuate the freeze, presumably capturing more
dollars for the parent company, PG&AMP;E Corp.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E attorney Huffman said the utility did not submit
projections to the PUC showing different yields from the hydro
divestiture. ``We didn't want to prejudice the hydro proceeding,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a similar situation, Edison submitted a matrix showing
the freeze for its customers could end six to nine months sooner if
its hydroelectric system sells for two times book value _ roughly
$800 million _ instead of book value.
</P>
<P>
   At three times book value or $1.2 billion, the freeze for Edison
customers would end a full 15 months sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the freeze ends is a function of the market price of
power and asset valuations,'' said Edison senior vice president
John Fielder. ``The end of next year is the earliest we could
envision it ending, though.''
</P>
<P>
   One thorny issue must be settled before San Diego's freeze ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although SDG&AMP;E wants to end the freeze this summer, it is
apprehensive about doing so just when power prices hit their peak.
It's possible that volatile prices could eat up the 15 percent
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The utility is proposing a gradual end to the freeze, basically
by averaging power prices during a nine-month period.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates are skeptical. ``It sounds to me like
they don't want people to understand what deregulation was right
away,'' said Nettie Hoge, executive director of the consumer group
The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``It can mean volatile
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks the PUC should make sure that, if there is rate
averaging, consumers aren't charged extra for it.

 Risky Business of Day Trading  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
They've been lampooned for their eccentricity in Garry Trudeau's
``Doonesbury'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   They've been rebuked for their high-risk investment tactics by
the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   They've been reviled by the Wall Street establishment for
roiling the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   They're the Internet day traders _ perhaps hundreds of thousands
of them nationwide _ stubborn individualists who have rejected
9-to-5 jobs, choosing instead to indulge in fast-paced, in-and-out
securities trading from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although day trading _ which now accounts for a phenomenal 25
percent of the volume on Nasdaq _ is a great source of commissions
for online brokers,  &LR;   &LR; it is causing other people in the investment
community a lot of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some warn that it could lead to the kind of speculative excesses
that often precede a calamitous stock-market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chief executive of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent, recently deplored the
``extreme'' volatility on Nasdaq, fueled by day trading. He
complained that it has ``disrupted the ability of market-makers to
communicate with investors in a timely manner,'' and he warned that
Nasdaq's administrators might have to bust in from time to time and
suspend trading in exceptionally volatile issues.
</P>
<P>
   To most investors, weaned on the notion that stocks are bought
to be held _ not passed around like marbles or baseball cards _
what the day traders do seems almost un-American.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt recently summed it up in a long,
cautionary statement about the perils of Internet trading:
``Investment should be for the long run, not for minutes or
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt may have a point.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet day traders quickly fall by the wayside, experts
say. They don't have any special knack for picking stocks or other
securities, or they don't study the market hard enough. And because
they trade so heavily, their funds get eaten up by short-term
capital gains taxes, &UR;  &LR; commissions and market-makers' ``spreads'' _
the difference between the price at which a stock is bought and
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a professional's game with a very painful
learning curve,'' says James Lee, president of the Electronic
Traders Association and co-owner of Momentum Trading, a brokerage
firm specializing in day trading. ``Most people can expect to lose
a lot of money, at least at first.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DAYTRADE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But some Internet day traders have done quite well _ grinding out
a living by chasing short-term price moves. They seem to have an
almost supernatural feel for the market, or a lot of luck, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent the stuff I see in the media about how all these
idiots just throw money at Internet stocks and get rich,'' says
James De Porre of Anna Maria Island, Fla., who claims to have made
millions in profits from day trading over the past four years and
serves as a guru to thousands of other traders through his Shark
Attack Web site on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long run,'' he says, ``you need a strategy and you
need to work at it.'' He himself makes 30 trades a day, but he
insists: ``This isn't gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading used to be confined to a tiny segment of the
investment community _ probably no more than 5,000 people
nationwide _ who carried on their activities at the offices of a
dozen or so specialized brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   These day-trading firms, with a total of 80 offices nationwide,
provide their customers with work spaces, computers, software and
data links that allow them to trade on Nasdaq and other markets. In
return, the brokers receive a commission for each of the many
trades their customers transact each day.
</P>
<P>
   But the advent of extremely powerful personal computers, the
proliferation of bargain-rate online brokerage firms, and the
greatly increased volume and sophistication of research and data
available to PC users has shifted much of the day-trading activity
into the dens, bedrooms and living rooms of the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   With a good computer and an outlay of perhaps $250 per month, an
investor can obtain enough up-to-the-minute market information _
real-time price quotes, news alerts, charts and tables that
constantly update _ to make Internet day trading a plausible
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus the enticement of being your own boss and working
from home in bathrobe and slippers, is motivation enough for many
traders.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that day trading isn't hard work.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be your run-of-the-mill, 9-to-5 job, but it does
occupy every weekday, major holidays excepted, from 6:30 a.m.
Pacific time, when the markets open, until 1 p.m. or later, when
they shut down.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not necessarily all: The more-earnest day traders
spend the rest of their waking hours preparing for the next trading
session.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DAYTRADE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  During the time the market is open, the day trader must
concentrate on the action full time. Bathroom breaks and trips to
the refrigerator can be fraught with peril.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it takes to pour a can of soda, a heavily margined
futures position or a flyer on a wildly swinging Internet stock can
go to blazes, wiping out a big chunk of a trader's bankroll.

DEVELOPER SEEKS BUYERS FOR NEW ENGLAND MALL EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD KINDLEBERGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Developer Stephen R. Karp is moving to sell the
shopping mall empire he built into New England's largest over the
past 25 years, industry sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Karp, chairman of New England Development, is said to be in
separate discussions with the nation's two biggest publicly traded
mall owners, Simon Property Group Inc. of Indianapolis and General
Growth Properties Inc. of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One industry observer estimated a sale would bring $1.6 billion
to $2 billion. ``There won't be a bigger transaction around here
that takes place this year,'' he said. Karp could not be reached.
Spokesmen for Simon and General Growth declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The move to sell his properties comes as Karp explores new
development ventures in other arenas, including a proposed
hotel-retail complex on the South Boston waterfront and a possible
role as a partner with the Boston Red Sox in developing a
replacement for Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted sale follows by 15 months the collapse of a bid to
merge Karp's mall with those of the Richard E. Jacobs Group of
Cleveland and then take the combined company public. An earlier
attempt at a three-way merger was broken up when 12 malls run by
the third would-be partner, the O'Connor Group of New York, were
bought for a higher price by Simon, a real estate investment trust,
or REIT.
</P>
<P>
   Karp has a reputation for developing high-quality shopping
centers. His portfolio has almost 20, including the CambridgeSide
Galleria and The Atrium at Chestnut Hill in Boston. Karp is said to
have developed more malls than anyone else in the Northeast, if not
the nation, during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Karp and Jeremiah O'Connor, chairman of the O'Connor
Group, combined their mall management businesses under the name
WellsPark Group. That business continued after their failed attempt
to merge the ownership of their malls with that of the Jacobs
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Fred S. Carr, whose Penobscot Group research firm follows REITs,
said this might be a good time for Karp to sell. He said mall
prices are fairly strong and there is concern about future growth.
``There's a lot of rumbling out in the world about Internet sales
chewing into most retail venues,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, who had not heard of Karp's talks with Simon and
General Growth, questioned whether those companies would be good
candidates to purchase the Karp malls. ``Simon has too much debt,''
he said, while General Growth has been more interested in older
malls in need of work. ``Karp's reputation is that his assets are
very good and very professionally run,'' Carr said, adding he
thought that ``a fair observation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sources said the buyer would probably structure the
transaction as a joint venture with a pension fund. By raising
equity for the purchase at the property level, he said, it would
not show up on the balance sheet. As for Karp, the source said,
accepting payment in partnership shares in the acquiring REIT would
allow him to defer paying tax on the capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, with a market capitalization of $4.1 billion, is the
largest retail REIT. General Growth is second, at $1.9 billion.

 Portrait of a Day Trader  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In his previous incarnation, San Mateo day trader Tom Weeden worked
for a firm specializing in fancy, multicolor printing for graphic
artists.
</P>
<P>
   That's how he learned about a company that had come out with a
digital printing press.
</P>
<P>
   He bought 100 shares, made a profit and decided that the stock
market was much more interesting than his printing job. ``I decided
that trading stocks was something I would really like to do, and I
became quite a student of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he quit his job and started day-trading at home
full time, with a $20,000 bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   He ran it up to a million dollars buying Iomega stock, much of
it with borrowed money, then lost most of his bundle when the disk
drive-maker's stock tanked.
</P>
<P>
   His investment funds still total ``in the six figures,'' and he
uses them to earn a middle-class living _ $30,000 to $60,000 in
profits annually _ mainly by trading futures contracts on the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   An easygoing, soft-spoken fellow, Weeden appears to be one of
the more patient and disciplined day traders. He wakes up at 4:30
a.m. on market days, goes over notes he took on the previous day's
action, boots up the computer in his immaculately neat trading room
and flicks on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   He sits transfixed before his computer screen throughout the
day, watching every price blip in the leading Nasdaq stocks,
checking the ratio of advances and declines on the New York Stock
Exchange, and following the chart line of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index as it updates at three-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for what he calls ``set-ups'' _ chart patterns that
tell him the S&AMP;P is about to make a big price move up or down.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't devised any charting theories of his own, but instead
follows those spelled out in the countless books on technical
market analysis.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WEEDEN23 (53834 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  When something interesting catches his eye, he will exclaim
``Gosh darn!'' and pull his chair closer to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   If he thinks that the market is going way up, he buys S&AMP;P
futures contracts. If it seems to be headed steeply down, he sells
futures.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't act unless he is ``at least 99 percent certain,''
so he typically makes no more than three in-and-out trades per day,
and sometimes none at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a crazed trader,'' he says. ``There's an awful lot of
studying behind my trades.''
</P>
<P>
   While many other day traders buy and sell far more often and
frenetically, Weeden says he is content to go after a limited
number of strong plays, which might net him several hundred dollars
each. Three of those in a day add up to a lot more than most
printers earn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the S&AMP;P futures, Weeden also buys stocks, but he
tends to hold them for the long term _ which by his definition is
one to three weeks. Among his recent holdings were AT&AMP;T, Compaq
Computer, Home Depot and Qwest Communications.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the market closes, Weeden has been awake for nearly
nine stressful hours.
</P>
<P>
   The closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange is his signal to
take a nap. By 4:30 p.m., he is back at work, updating his records
and scanning charts. He goes to sleep again at 9.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As every Wall Street firm struggles to figure out how
to play the Internet, an advantage may lie with those that, like a
fresh recruit to a midnight poker game, have yet to put their chips
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike it chief rivals, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. has never been a
retail brokerage firm, meaning that it does not have an army of
brokers selling stock to the public. Only a year ago, Goldman was
seen as lagging so far behind Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Merrill Lynch in the lucrative retail business that it risked
becoming a niche player in financial markets. The Internet could
change all that.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is now actively studying ways to become a retail broker
using the Internet, people close to the firm said. One way would be
to work out a joint venture with an online brokerage firm, possibly
FMR's Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab or E(STAR)Trade. Another
way would be to create its own online brokerage offering.
</P>
<P>
   But the people close to the firm dismissed as highly unlikely
the possibility that Goldman would buy E(STAR)Trade or another
publicly traded online leader, saying that sky-high stock market
valuations of Internet companies rule out a purchase of that kind.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy discussions are taking place as Goldman itself
prepares to go public, reviving a plan that was shelved last
September amid world financial market turmoil. Unless the U.S.
stock market undergoes a serious correction, Goldman will likely
issue shares as early as late April, people at Goldman said
privately.
</P>
<P>
   Going public and developing a strategy for the Internet are seen
as separate but related activities, Goldman executives said. One
said the firm intends to have a clear Internet strategy in place
when it begins marketing shares to investors, especially given the
intense enthusiasm displayed by investors for Internet-related
stocks in recent weeks. Also, Goldman could use its stock as a
currency to make acquisitions or enter alliances after going
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are going to ask about the Internet,'' said one
person familiar with Goldman's strategy discussions. ``You can't
hem and haw and say you're thinking about it. They will want to
know exactly what you're doing and you want to be able to tell
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is not the first Wall Street firm that takes the
Internet seriously. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber,
three leading brokerage firms with big retail operations, have all
offered some Internet services for their customers. But Goldman's
situation is intriguing to many in the industry precisely because
the firm does not have a major retail operation _ and can thus
change its strategy and enter a new business without spending
heavily to build up a traditional network of retail brokers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several Goldman executives spoke with evident relish
about the delicate task facing Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.
Those two rivals must balance the interests of their thousands of
retail brokers, most of them paid through commissions earned when
they trade stocks for their clients, with the growing promise of
Internet trading that largely eliminates the role of the
traditional broker. Goldman calls this a ``channel conflict,'' and
says it provides firms without a significant number of retail
brokers a chance to challenge established competitors head on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warfare used to be who had the biggest infantry,'' said the
person familiar with Goldman's strategy talks. ``You had to feed
and clothe those guys and they died for you on the front lines. Now
you don't need to be in the infantry business at all. We have smart
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Tortora, Goldman's head of global technology, and Larry
Buchalter, managing director in the firm's fixed-income division,
are heading a new committee to study the matter. The committee met
for the first time only a week ago and it seems unlikely to reach a
recommendation immediately, people familiar with the situation
said. The existence of the committee was first reported by The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has already dipped its toes in Internet waters. It has
reserved blocks of shares of companies it underwrites for
distribution to retail investors through E(STAR)Trade, a leader
among the dozens of existing online trading firms. Both Goldman and
E(STAR)Trade are also partners in an electronic stock trading
network called Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   E(STAR)Trade's share price rose $8.4375, or 20 percent, to
$48.56.25, in trading Monday on speculation that it would seal a
fresh alliance with Goldman. Shares in other online brokerages also
rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   But while people close to Goldman do not rule out new links to
E(STAR)Trade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., they downplayed their
relationship with the company. E(STAR)Trade has over-emphasized
ties with Goldman in press releases, one Goldman executive said.
The executive said such releases might have given the impression
that Goldman had chosen E(STAR)Trade as its main online partner, an
impression he said was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Goldman is still debating how to best deploy
one of its potential online aces: its stock research. Goldman has
talked with both Fidelity and Schwab as well as E(STAR)Trade about
distributing Goldman research. Some in the firm think Goldman
should retain sole rights to its research as a key way to attract
clients to a proprietary online trading system that Goldman could
establish independently.

   The Stars of Technology Sweeps Month
</P>
<P>
   By Jon Swartz
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   February is sweeps month in the television industry, when the
major networks scramble to come up with the most sensational and
titillating programs to increase ratings and, consequently, improve
their advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle applies to the Internet in late January and
early February, when scores of startups trot out their wares at a
string of computer trade shows, with names like Internet Showcase
and Demo 99 in hopes of gaining the attention of investors and the
press.
</P>
<P>
   A few stand out, however, because of the impact they are likely
to have on the average surfer. They include:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Qubit Technology  &LR; (www.qubit.net).  &LR; This two-pound information
appliance for Web browsing and e-mail is the size of a small
laptop. And it's wireless. Company officials are in the process of
looking for manufacturing and content partners. No price has been
set.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; AtBackup &LR;  ( &LR; www.atbackup.com &LR; ). Software allows traveling
business users to retrieve information from their personal
computers from anywhere on the Internet. &UR;  &LR; For $99 a year, the
service can be invaluable in the event of a computer crash.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Hypercosm &LR;  ( &LR; www.hypercosm3d.com &LR; ). Eye-popping software lets
Web developers and graphics artists create and display lush 3-D
images on the Internet. Pricing has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Jump Networks &LR;  ( &LR; www.jump.com &LR; ). This free Web-based calendar,
address book and e-mail service allows users to store schedules and
contact information on their personal-digital assistants and
personal-information management software programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; ActiveTouch &LR;  ( &LR; www.activetouch.com &LR; ). Software enables
employees scattered around the world to easily meet and share
documents over the Web. The WebEx Meeting Center requires only a
browser and a telephone. It starts at $4.95 per meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe one of these products will strike it rich, and
we'll have our next Yahoo or Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early year conferences are an invaluable environment for
investors and young companies to strike up relationships. They set
the tone for the rest of the year,'' said Chris Shipley, editor of
DemoLetter, the San Mateo computer newsletter that organized Demo
99 this month in Indian Wells (Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   DEPARTMENT OF WEIRDNESS: High tech and fast food aren't a
contradiction in terms as you might think. Taco Bell Corp. last
week named Kenneth Kraemer, a computer-science professor at the
University of California at Irvine's Graduate School of Management,
to a $500,000 endowed chair in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Before you scoff at the notion of mixing computer chips with
tortilla chips, Kraemer calls Taco Bell ``an early innovator'' that
has automated its operations for drive-through orders and its
internal companywide Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If true, is a cross-promotional deal between McDonald's Big Mac
and Apple Computer's Macintosh far behind?
</P>
<P>
   AN EXPENSIVE HAM SANDWICH: Speaking of computers and food,
Tabloid News ( &LR; www.tabloid.net &LR; ), an Oakland Internet news service,
has sued the Richards Group, a Dallas advertising agency, for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Flabbergasted Tabloid.net officials say an animated talking ham
sandwich logo that first appeared on their news site in 1997 was
pilfered and reused in a $20 million marketing campaign for the
Florida Department of Citrus last fall. You may remember the
Florida orange growers as the folks who previously paid Anita
Bryant to be their spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed February 8 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, alleges that the leftover sandwich _ featured in a
Tabloid.net news series _ reappeared in the orange juice ads.
Tabloid.net officials, who say they have computer records proving
that ad agency employees repeatedly visited its Web site, are
seeking a share of any profits made from the use of the ham
sandwich, as well as licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a strange thing the Internet is when a potentially
precedent-setting copyright case involves a dispute over a talking
ham sandwich that gives advice,'' noted Ken Layne, Tabloid.net
co-founder and editor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NETFILES () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Dick Murray, a principal at the Richards Group, said the company
has not been served with the suit and denied it stole the sandwich
idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Call this a hunch (or just a bad pun), but it sounds as if
someone is going to have their lunch eaten in the pursuit of bread.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE: It seems too good to be true _ and it
probably is.
</P>
<P>
   One Stop Communications ( &LR; www.shopss.com &LR; ), a New York online
shopping mall, says it is giving away Apple Computer's popular iMac
_ valued at $1,200 _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure to read the fine print: By the time you have
fulfilled your obligations to get one of the space-age Internet
computers, you'll have spent at least $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much One Stop wants in assorted charges to qualify
for a free iMac. For instance, you must agree to spend at least
$100 per month for three years on merchandise offered by a handful
of virtual stores, including auctioneer eBay's antiques page and an
FTD online floral shop, listed under One Stop's site. As of last
Friday, however, the site was experiencing technical glitches and
none of the mall's participants were accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also must use One Stop as their Internet service
provider, at $19.95 a month &UR;  &LR; indefinitely. The charge is waived in
any month when a subscriber spends more than $200 at the online
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this as well: According to Wired Digital, One Stop CEO
Israel Rosenfeld pitched a similar offer last summer through a
different company. Consumers were obligated to buy at least $100 of
online goods each month to receive free ISDN access. But that firm,
AcTVnet, quickly filed for bankruptcy, leaving customers out at
least $100.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer beware? How about buyer retreat!
</P>
<P>
   DOH!: A pair of astute readers point out that we've overlooked
the ideal actor to portray Oracle chief Larry Ellison in our
suggested movie about a deadly sailboat race in Australia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Silver _ the Tony Award-winning thespian who recently joined
the cast of the NBC sitcom ``Veronica's Closet'' _ is the ideal
choice for the roguish software billionaire. The bearded New York
native looks and acts like Larry. If you need further proof, catch
his role as attorney Alan Dershowitz in the film ``Reversal of
Fortune.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

has gone digital at  &LR; www.citylights.com &LR; . Brush up on Dada,
surrealism and Beat Generation scions Jack Kerouac and Lawrence

 Case Study _ A Look at Mr. America Online
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chronicle Staff Writer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The man who would be online king calmly leans back into a hotel
lobby sofa and politely explains how America Online became an
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   Without raising his voice or wagging an I-told-you-so finger,
AOL chief executive Steve Case clinically and succinctly describes
how AOL stuck to its long-held plan and proved a legion of
techno-snobs wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy has always been crystal clear,'' Case said.
``Consumers want a central location where they can find good
content. And they want someone to make it easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has the sheen of an overnight success, but in fact, Case's
willpower and years of persistance are what propelled it to the top
of the Internet heap.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, its revenues topped $2.6 billion, making it the most
profitable online company. The Dulles, Va., firm's market value is
nearly $75 billion, dwarfing Ford Motor Co. and vaulting Case into
the Parthenon of high-tech superstars. His stock holdings are
valued at more than $1 billion, based on AOL's stock price of
$160.38. And technology experts have anointed Case as the most
serious challenger to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' mantle as high
tech's 800-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is a triumph of Steve Case's marketing skills,'' said Dave
Cassel, editor of AOL Watch, a Berkeley Web site. ``They have
flourished despite a series of technical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  What is all the more remarkable is that the shy, unassuming
Case has engineered a dramatic turnaround _ from a company in
constant crisis just two years ago to a dominant player that has
some whispering the ``M'' word.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's enormous clout allows it to charge retailers and
advertisers steep prices for space on its sites, sparking
speculation that antitrust investigators might consider it a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the one thing the world needs the least: another
giant, powerful and synergistic information hydra,'' online
essayist Jon Katz wrote following AOL's announcement that it would
buy Netscape. ``We don't finally have some competition for
Microsoft. We just have another Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory that rankles the normally stoic Case, who was in
San Francisco last week for whirlwind meetings and a speech at the
Commonwealth Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we were irrelevant, and now we're too powerful,''
Case said in what amounts to trash talking for him. ``I find that
argument silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything remotely monopolistic,'' he continued.
``We have a little over half of the online audience, and there are
plenty of competitors _ ranging from 5,000 (Internet service
providers) and startups to big-momma companies like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
and Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   With 16 million paying subscribers, AOL reaches as many homes as
cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., and it adds about 12,000
users a day. On weeknights during prime time, the number of people
plugged into AOL peaks at 1 million, outdrawing CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, users spend an average of 55 minutes a day
logged on to AOL, compared with 14 minutes in 1996. All told, more
than half of the nation's cybersurfers use AOL in some capacity _
either by subscribing to the service or by visiting its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for Case, 40, who got his start developing
toppings at Pizza Hut before joining Control Video Corp., AOL's
predecessor, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many credit him with bringing the Net to the masses. Want
proof? The chirpy message with which it greets subscribers was the
title of the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan hit movie ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This company pioneered the model of content and access: You
spend $22 (a month) to get specific information,'' said Jim
Balderston, an analyst at Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``A
lot of companies would kill to have anyone pay for their service.
This is a media powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9,000-person company &UR;  &LR; has snapped up rival CompuServe Corp.,
whacked Prodigy's online service, fended off Microsoft and AT&AMP;T and
is on the verge of completing a $4.2 billion acquisition of
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's most recent deals showcase its caginess about where the
market is headed and what consumers want. It purchased cutting-edge
technologies that offer instant messages with sound over the Net
and soon will make the Internet available on TV sets. AOL also
reportedly is in discussions to buy a piece of eBay, the popular
San Jose online auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, hardly anyone would have expected AOL to
be at the forefront of the Internet. It has weathered hostile
takeover bids from Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, several technical meltdowns
of its online service in 1996 and 1997, and persistent sniping from
the online elite who dismiss it as ``the McDonald's of
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   While others engaged in strategy du jour, AOL remained steady
and plowed ahead with the same game plan. For more than a decade,
Case has focused on building an audience by offering an easy-to-use
Internet service for the rest of us. AOL is not so much the
McDonald's of cyberspace as the Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Case is ``like a metronome,'' says an executive at a rival
company, who asked not to be identified. ``He stuck to his guns,
and now he's one of the most powerful people in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has become a bellwether indicator for the
Internet market, climbing more than sixfold last year, and should
continue its ascent on a wave of Wall Street lust for Net stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming its new blue-chip status, AOL has joined the
prestigious Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index this year, displacing
Venator, formerly Woolworth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the digerati, the Internet's elite crowd that
pooh-poohed AOL for catering to the masses, have dropped or toned
down their disdain after concluding that Silicon Valley companies
did not pay enough attention to what the average consumer wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were wrong about AOL,'' Marc Andreessen, the
Netscape co-founder who recently became AOL chief technology
officer, said recently. ``They gave the public what it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AOL22 (47684 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  AOL has mastered the technique of capturing _ and retaining _ the
``eyeballs'' of consumers by using a variety of chat rooms, instant
messages, e-mail and online shopping sites. Users of its
proprietary network and AOL.com site spend an average of 246
minutes a month on AOL, tops among online services, according to
MediaMetrix in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL could get even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   According to Case, about 25 percent of American homes _ or 60
million people _ are connected to the Internet, and their numbers
are growing fast. Seven years ago this month, when AOL went public,
only 3 percent of the country was wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in the second or third inning. It's still early,''
Case said. ``Three-fourths of the public doesn't have an Internet
connection, and we can't assume that they're going to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make things easier for those folks,'' he said.
``There is plenty of work to be done.''

 Cisco's CTO Is a Powerful Woman in a Field Dominated by Men  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It was the early 1980s and Judy Estrin, a 27-year-old entrepreneur
who had recently started her own company, was called for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks to go before her networking company, Bridge
Communications, showed off its first product, Estrin was desperate
to avoid serving as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the judge and said I have a company that's about to
demonstrate its first product, I'm the vice president of
engineering and I have to be there,'' Estrin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge laughed, telling Estrin she was much too young to be
vice president of anything. But he liked the story, he said, and he
let her off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's laughing at Judy Estrin anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She sold Bridge to 3Com Corp. for $235 million in stock in 1987,
and Estrin, along with her husband and co-founder, went on to start
two other highly successful technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is the chief technology officer of Cisco Systems, an
$8.5 billion company in San Jose whose networking equipment
dominates much of the Internet. She joined Cisco in March after
being heavily courted by chief executive John Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me three years to convince Judy to join our board and
the Cisco team, and the reason I recruited her so diligently is
that I knew her personality and talent would be a great long-term
fit for us,'' Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrin is now a major player at a company whose equipment is as
crucial to today's PCs as Windows software and Intel chips. She
sits on the boards of several high-profile companies, including
Walt Disney Co., Sun Microsystems and Federal Express, and was
recently named one of the top 50 women in business by Fortune
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Her meteoric rise has taken place in an industry dominated by
men, where few women have powerful roles. While lots of women work
in high tech, they tend to be in marketing or public relations.
Estrin, 45, is one of the few female chief technology officers of a
major Silicon Valley company _ a role that combines management
expertise with engineering savvy.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell Estrin that her achievements are anything other
than the norm. Her life has been driven by a desire to develop and
apply technology, and she has never let youth or gender stand in
her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents had three daughters,'' said Estrin, who was the
middle child. ``Growing up, there was never a question about
whether or not women had a career or could do something
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question was how successful they could be. Because
Estrin was surrounded by people who were blazing new trails, the
answer seemed predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Israel at a time when her parents were leading
the team to build the first computer in the Middle East. Her
father, an electrical engineer, started the computer science
program at UCLA, and her mother, a biomedical engineer, was among
the select few women to teach a scientific subject at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as an undergraduate student at UCLA, Estrin watched
as the school installed the first Arpanet node _ the beginnings of
today's Internet. And she did her master's work at Stanford
University with Vint Cerf, considered the father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She took the lessons she learned from these groundbreaking
events and quickly applied them to her career.
</P>
<P>
   After selling Bridge to 3Com in 1987, she and her husband,
William Carrico, started Network Computing Devices, a Mountain View
company that made computer systems. The company went public four
years later, and in 1995, they founded Precept Software, a
multimedia networking software company in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ESTRIN22 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Three years later, they sold Precept to Cisco for $84 million,
and both joined the networking giant as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Estrin oversees a $1 billion research and development
budget, evaluates Cisco's acquisitions and drives the technology
vision and strategy of one of the top companies in the industry.
Her husband is senior vice president of small and medium business
at Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Estrin has taken the CTO reins at a time when the networking
industry is undergoing massive change. Cisco is attempting to
capitalize on the demand from service providers, such as telephone
companies, for a single, seamless network for voice, video and
data.
</P>
<P>
   The company is moving aggressively onto the turf of players like
Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom, which have been selling
to the AT&AMP;Ts and Pacific Bells of the world for years. It also
faces competition from 3Com and a slew of foreign
telecommunications equipment providers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fierce battle, and Estrin admits there is only room for
two or three winners, but she's confident in her ability to drive
Cisco to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know and work with her say if anyone is prepared for
the battle, it's the energetic and focused Estrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy is simply an incredibly capable person who's pragmatic
and oriented toward results,'' says Cerf, her former professor, who
remains a friend and self-described admirer. ``She has grown
dramatically in the scope of what she's able to do. She's gone
beyond engineering to understand businesses and how businesses
work, which makes her a valuable commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerf, who studied engineering under Estrin's father at UCLA and
has known her since she was 12, said he often asks her for advice
about his own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to her with some ideas when she was at NCD
... her first reaction was to figure out what the cost impact would
be, something I had not been worrying about,'' Cerf said. ``She's
quick to comprehend the gestalt of the ideas and all the
ramifications and come back with conclusions and helpful
suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ability to understand new concepts and flesh out solutions
is something that will prepare Estrin for battle. She's been CTO at
Cisco for less than a year and already faces massive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest hurdles, she said, are getting high-speed
Internet access to the home and improving the service quality of
Internet-based networks. Estrin wants phone calls placed over the
Internet to be as reliable as those made over traditional phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   It's something the entire industry is focusing on, Estrin said,
and it's one reason she and her husband decided to sell Precept to
Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networking industry has changed, and that's typical of a
maturing industry,'' Estrin said. ``Early on, you make the biggest
impact in a startup. But in a mature industry, critical mass is
important. Small companies without critical mass cannot solve the
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   She is excited about the changes underfoot and the part that
Cisco will play in the new world of networking. But her favorite
aspect, she said, is seeing how technology affects people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like technology for technology's sake. I love applying
technology to solve problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude and outlook is what prompted Chambers to recruit
Estrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley, people value results, experience and the
ability to make a difference,'' Chambers said. ``Judy has always
been involved with leading-edge technology and has clearly
established herself as one of the Valley's key leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrin said she's gotten to this point in her career by not
making a big deal out of herself. As the mother of an 8-year-old
son, Estrin doesn't have much time for self-aggrandizing, but
still, she said she doesn't spend her days trying to prove herself
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ESTRIN22 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Estrin said that attitude has also helped her succeed in a
male-dominated industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just assume I'm as good as they are and that I don't have
anything to prove,'' Estrin said. ``I think that's made it
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has also helped her get to this point, she said.
Carrico, who was CEO of Precept for two years, moved to the
chairman role after Estrin said she wanted to try running the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always just worked together as a team,'' Estrin said.
``I've mellowed him out and he's made me tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   The circuitous path that's led Estrin to where she is today is
something she could never have predicted, she said. So she doesn't
try to guess where she might be in two or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who needs to be doing what I love
doing,'' she said. ``When I look out on the horizon, I know
whatever I'm doing in five years, I'll need to be making an impact,
enjoying it and learning.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   February is sweeps month in the television industry, when the
major networks scramble to come up with the most sensational and
titillating programs to increase ratings and, consequently, improve
their advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle applies to the Internet in late January and
early February, when scores of startups trot out their wares at a
string of computer trade shows, with names like Internet Showcase
and Demo 99 in hopes of gaining the attention of investors and the
press.
</P>
<P>
   A few stand out, however, because of the impact they are likely
to have on the average surfer. They include:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Qubit Technology  &LR; (www.qubit.net).  &LR; This two-pound information
appliance for Web browsing and e-mail is the size of a small
laptop. And it's wireless. Company officials are in the process of
looking for manufacturing and content partners. No price has been
set.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; AtBackup &LR;  ( &LR; www.atbackup.com &LR; ). Software allows traveling
business users to retrieve information from their personal
computers from anywhere on the Internet. &UR;  &LR; For $99 a year, the
service can be invaluable in the event of a computer crash.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Hypercosm &LR;  ( &LR; www.hypercosm3d.com &LR; ). Eye-popping software lets
Web developers and graphics artists create and display lush 3-D
images on the Internet. Pricing has yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Jump Networks &LR;  ( &LR; www.jump.com &LR; ). This free Web-based calendar,
address book and e-mail service allows users to store schedules and
contact information on their personal-digital assistants and
personal-information management software programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; ActiveTouch &LR;  ( &LR; www.activetouch.com &LR; ). Software enables
employees scattered around the world to easily meet and share
documents over the Web. The WebEx Meeting Center requires only a
browser and a telephone. It starts at $4.95 per meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe one of these products will strike it rich, and
we'll have our next Yahoo or Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early year conferences are an invaluable environment for
investors and young companies to strike up relationships. They set
the tone for the rest of the year,'' said Chris Shipley, editor of
DemoLetter, the San Mateo computer newsletter that organized Demo
99 this month in Indian Wells (Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   DEPARTMENT OF WEIRDNESS: High tech and fast food aren't a
contradiction in terms as you might think. Taco Bell Corp. last
week named Kenneth Kraemer, a computer-science professor at the
University of California at Irvine's Graduate School of Management,
to a $500,000 endowed chair in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Before you scoff at the notion of mixing computer chips with
tortilla chips, Kraemer calls Taco Bell ``an early innovator'' that
has automated its operations for drive-through orders and its
internal companywide Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If true, is a cross-promotional deal between McDonald's Big Mac
and Apple Computer's Macintosh far behind?
</P>
<P>
   AN EXPENSIVE HAM SANDWICH: Speaking of computers and food,
Tabloid News ( &LR; www.tabloid.net &LR; ), an Oakland Internet news service,
has sued the Richards Group, a Dallas advertising agency, for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Flabbergasted Tabloid.net officials say an animated talking ham
sandwich logo that first appeared on their news site in 1997 was
pilfered and reused in a $20 million marketing campaign for the
Florida Department of Citrus last fall. You may remember the
Florida orange growers as the folks who previously paid Anita
Bryant to be their spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed February 8 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, alleges that the leftover sandwich _ featured in a
Tabloid.net news series _ reappeared in the orange juice ads.
Tabloid.net officials, who say they have computer records proving
that ad agency employees repeatedly visited its Web site, are
seeking a share of any profits made from the use of the ham
sandwich, as well as licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a strange thing the Internet is when a potentially
precedent-setting copyright case involves a dispute over a talking
ham sandwich that gives advice,'' noted Ken Layne, Tabloid.net
co-founder and editor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of NETFILES () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Dick Murray, a principal at the Richards Group, said the company
has not been served with the suit and denied it stole the sandwich
idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Call this a hunch (or just a bad pun), but it sounds as if
someone is going to have their lunch eaten in the pursuit of bread.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING IN LIFE IS FREE: It seems too good to be true _ and it
probably is.
</P>
<P>
   One Stop Communications ( &LR; www.shopss.com &LR; ), a New York online
shopping mall, says it is giving away Apple Computer's popular iMac
_ valued at $1,200 _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure to read the fine print: By the time you have
fulfilled your obligations to get one of the space-age Internet
computers, you'll have spent at least $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much One Stop wants in assorted charges to qualify
for a free iMac. For instance, you must agree to spend at least
$100 per month for three years on merchandise offered by a handful
of virtual stores, including auctioneer eBay's antiques page and an
FTD online floral shop, listed under One Stop's site. As of last
Friday, however, the site was experiencing technical glitches and
none of the mall's participants were accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also must use One Stop as their Internet service
provider, at $19.95 a month &UR;  &LR; indefinitely. The charge is waived in
any month when a subscriber spends more than $200 at the online
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this as well: According to Wired Digital, One Stop CEO
Israel Rosenfeld pitched a similar offer last summer through a
different company. Consumers were obligated to buy at least $100 of
online goods each month to receive free ISDN access. But that firm,
AcTVnet, quickly filed for bankruptcy, leaving customers out at
least $100.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer beware? How about buyer retreat!
</P>
<P>
   DOH!: A pair of astute readers point out that we've overlooked
the ideal actor to portray Oracle chief Larry Ellison in our
suggested movie about a deadly sailboat race in Australia last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Silver _ the Tony Award-winning thespian who recently joined
the cast of the NBC sitcom ``Veronica's Closet'' _ is the ideal
choice for the roguish software billionaire. The bearded New York
native looks and acts like Larry. If you need further proof, catch
his role as attorney Alan Dershowitz in the film ``Reversal of
Fortune.''

 Case Study _ A Look at Mr. America Online  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The man who would be online king calmly leans back into a hotel
lobby sofa and politely explains how America Online became an
American icon.
</P>
<P>
   Without raising his voice or wagging an I-told-you-so finger,
AOL chief executive Steve Case clinically and succinctly describes
how AOL stuck to its long-held plan and proved a legion of
techno-snobs wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy has always been crystal clear,'' Case said.
``Consumers want a central location where they can find good
content. And they want someone to make it easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL has the sheen of an overnight success, but in fact, Case's
willpower and years of persistance are what propelled it to the top
of the Internet heap.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, its revenues topped $2.6 billion, making it the most
profitable online company. The Dulles, Va., firm's market value is
nearly $75 billion, dwarfing Ford Motor Co. and vaulting Case into
the Parthenon of high-tech superstars. His stock holdings are
valued at more than $1 billion, based on AOL's stock price of
$160.38. And technology experts have anointed Case as the most
serious challenger to Microsoft CEO Bill Gates' mantle as high
tech's 800-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is a triumph of Steve Case's marketing skills,'' said Dave
Cassel, editor of AOL Watch, a Berkeley Web site. ``They have
flourished despite a series of technical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  What is all the more remarkable is that the shy, unassuming
Case has engineered a dramatic turnaround _ from a company in
constant crisis just two years ago to a dominant player that has
some whispering the ``M'' word.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's enormous clout allows it to charge retailers and
advertisers steep prices for space on its sites, sparking
speculation that antitrust investigators might consider it a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the one thing the world needs the least: another
giant, powerful and synergistic information hydra,'' online
essayist Jon Katz wrote following AOL's announcement that it would
buy Netscape. ``We don't finally have some competition for
Microsoft. We just have another Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a theory that rankles the normally stoic Case, who was in
San Francisco last week for whirlwind meetings and a speech at the
Commonwealth Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, we were irrelevant, and now we're too powerful,''
Case said in what amounts to trash talking for him. ``I find that
argument silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything remotely monopolistic,'' he continued.
``We have a little over half of the online audience, and there are
plenty of competitors _ ranging from 5,000 (Internet service
providers) and startups to big-momma companies like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
and Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   With 16 million paying subscribers, AOL reaches as many homes as
cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., and it adds about 12,000
users a day. On weeknights during prime time, the number of people
plugged into AOL peaks at 1 million, outdrawing CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, users spend an average of 55 minutes a day
logged on to AOL, compared with 14 minutes in 1996. All told, more
than half of the nation's cybersurfers use AOL in some capacity _
either by subscribing to the service or by visiting its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for Case, 40, who got his start developing
toppings at Pizza Hut before joining Control Video Corp., AOL's
predecessor, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many credit him with bringing the Net to the masses. Want
proof? The chirpy message with which it greets subscribers was the
title of the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan hit movie ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This company pioneered the model of content and access: You
spend $22 (a month) to get specific information,'' said Jim
Balderston, an analyst at Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``A
lot of companies would kill to have anyone pay for their service.
This is a media powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9,000-person company &UR;  &LR; has snapped up rival CompuServe Corp.,
whacked Prodigy's online service, fended off Microsoft and AT&AMP;T and
is on the verge of completing a $4.2 billion acquisition of
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's most recent deals showcase its caginess about where the
market is headed and what consumers want. It purchased cutting-edge
technologies that offer instant messages with sound over the Net
and soon will make the Internet available on TV sets. AOL also
reportedly is in discussions to buy a piece of eBay, the popular
San Jose online auction company.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, hardly anyone would have expected AOL to
be at the forefront of the Internet. It has weathered hostile
takeover bids from Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, several technical meltdowns
of its online service in 1996 and 1997, and persistent sniping from
the online elite who dismiss it as ``the McDonald's of
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   While others engaged in strategy du jour, AOL remained steady
and plowed ahead with the same game plan. For more than a decade,
Case has focused on building an audience by offering an easy-to-use
Internet service for the rest of us. AOL is not so much the
McDonald's of cyberspace as the Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Case is ``like a metronome,'' says an executive at a rival
company, who asked not to be identified. ``He stuck to his guns,
and now he's one of the most powerful people in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has become a bellwether indicator for the
Internet market, climbing more than sixfold last year, and should
continue its ascent on a wave of Wall Street lust for Net stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming its new blue-chip status, AOL has joined the
prestigious Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index this year, displacing
Venator, formerly Woolworth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the digerati, the Internet's elite crowd that
pooh-poohed AOL for catering to the masses, have dropped or toned
down their disdain after concluding that Silicon Valley companies
did not pay enough attention to what the average consumer wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were wrong about AOL,'' Marc Andreessen, the
Netscape co-founder who recently became AOL chief technology
officer, said recently. ``They gave the public what it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AOL22 (47684 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  AOL has mastered the technique of capturing _ and retaining _ the
``eyeballs'' of consumers by using a variety of chat rooms, instant
messages, e-mail and online shopping sites. Users of its
proprietary network and AOL.com site spend an average of 246
minutes a month on AOL, tops among online services, according to
MediaMetrix in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And AOL could get even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   According to Case, about 25 percent of American homes _ or 60
million people _ are connected to the Internet, and their numbers
are growing fast. Seven years ago this month, when AOL went public,
only 3 percent of the country was wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in the second or third inning. It's still early,''
Case said. ``Three-fourths of the public doesn't have an Internet
connection, and we can't assume that they're going to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make things easier for those folks,'' he said.
``There is plenty of work to be done.''

DOMINION'S $6.3-BILLION DEAL FOR GAS UTILITY MARKS TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Pa., Calif., Colo., Texas, Okla., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominion Resources Inc. announced on Monday that it would
acquire the Consolidated Natural Gas Co. in a stock transaction
valued at $6.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Dominion Resources, a major electric utility based
in Richmond, Va. and Consolidated Natural Gas, a large natural gas
company based in Pittsburgh, Pa., said combining the companies
would allow them to serve smaller customers.
</P>
<P>
   And in another example of the trend toward combining utilities
and natural gas companies, the Sempra Energy Co., a large utility
in Southern California, announced Monday that it had agreed to
acquire KN Energy Inc., a large natural gas pipeline and storage
company based in Lakewood, Colo., for $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal, the Southern Union Co., a natural gas utility
in Texas, said that it had offered $1.84 billion in cash and
assumed debt for the Southwest Gas Corp., which sells natural gas
to 1.2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and California. The
offer tops a $1.73 billion bid made in December by Oneok Inc., a
gas company based in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest said that its board had told its management to begin
negotiating with Southern Union, which is based in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Southwest closed at $28.375, up $1.75, while shares of
Southern Union closed at $19.75, up $1.8125. Shares of Oneok closed
at $27.375, up 43.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   As the utility industry is deregulated, companies have sought to
strengthen their competitive positions by taking over natural gas
companies so that they can offer a package of electricity and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Sempra Energy, which is based in San Diego, was formed last year
through the merger of the Enova Corp., an electric utility in San
Diego, and the gas company Pacific Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deregulation of the natural gas industry took place
earlier than that of the electric utility industry in many states,
gas companies have developed the experience and the staff to
survive in a more competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Capps, the president, chairman and chief executive of
Dominion, said that was a major reason for the acquisition of
Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania has allowed its customers to choose their natural
gas supplier for several years and recently gave them a choice of
suppliers for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Davidson Jr., the chairman of Consolidated, said in an
interview Monday that the utility had 310,000 customers for natural
gas in Pennsylvania's deregulated market, but had attracted only
22,000 customers for electricity. He said Consolidated would have
new sources of electricity and a larger customer base by combining
with Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Capps said that there were 10.3 million customers for natural
gas and 17.5 million customers for electricity in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia and that the
combined company would concentrate marketing in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a lot more residential customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a departure from the strategy of most utilities,
which have gone after large industrial customers where the returns
are expected to be greater. Even though many states on the East
Coast are deregulating and allowing customers to choose their
supplier of power, few marketers have made a major effort to sell
electricity to residential and small commercial customers because
it has been difficult to earn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller customers have seen their rates decrease mostly through
savings mandated by legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has really been successful with small customers,'' said
Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear, Stearns. ``It will take
time and a lot of persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Consolidated shareholders will each get
1.52 shares of Dominion Resources stock, valuing the transaction at
$64.22 a share, based on Friday's closing price. Dominion Resources
is also assuming Consolidated's debt of $2.15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Dominion Resources closed at $40, down $2.25, and
shares of Consolidated closed at $55.1875, down $1.0625, in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement with Sempra, shareholders of KN
Energy will get $25 a share in cash for each share, or 1.115 share
of Sempra's stock. Based on the close of Sempra's stock on Friday,
the stock offer translates to $24.88 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sempra closed at $21.5625, down 75 cents, and shares
of KN Energy closed at $21.625, 12.5 cents higher, in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

TREASURER TO SEEK LOTTERY TICKET AUDIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Already faced with a $6.5 million theft in her office,
Massachusetts Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien is also grappling with
evidence of wrongdoing at the State Lottery, where investigators
have found evidence of a potential black market in tickets and a
$13 million debt owed by ticket vendors, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sources familiar with the investigation,
O'Brien plans to contact a major auditing firm to review the
Lottery's books and operations following initial findings by
investigators working for State Auditor Joseph DeNucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes there's a big problem down there,'' said one
source close to O'Brien, who just completed her first month in
office and is facing, with the missing $6.5 million, one of the
biggest thefts in state history.
</P>
<P>
   One of O'Brien's first acts as treasurer was to remove Beth
Lindstrom, former treasurer Joseph Malone's lottery executive
director, and hire Edward Lashman as an interim director. Lashman
is a former top state official in the Dukakis administration and
has a reputation as a tough trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The problems at the lottery, which generates $3.2 billion in
sales each year, came to light during O'Brien's transition into the
office when DeNucci's auditors briefed her on some initial findings
of an ongoing investigation. Since then, a source said, O'Brien has
focused intently on the agency and its problems.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions of wrongdoing are occuring just as Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly, tipped off by BankBoston over a
suspicious transaction, last week began prosecuting the theft of
$6.5 million from the treasurer's cash management division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This operation like any other multibillion industry should be
reviewed annually with an independent audit,'' O'Brien said in a
statement released by her office. ``With that money at stake, we
need to be absolutely certain that appropriate financial controls
are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Robson, O'Brien's spokesman, said the lottery will be
contracting shortly with a major auditing firm to review the
lottery's books. The results of that audit, along with DeNucci's
report, will determine what course O'Brien will take.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the state treasurer has yet to go public with the
initial findings for fear that it would shake the public's
confidence in the state lottery, an enormous cash cow for the state
and a major source of local aid to municipalities. The lottery
generates $750 million in funds that the state sends to cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
   The sources familar with the investigation said Monday that
DeNucci is preparing a report that shows that the 8,000 private
vendors that sell lottery tickets owe the agency about $13 million,
a debt that has nearly doubled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The question has been raised as to why the lottery has not
pressed those vendors for the money. Some lottery officials have
told O'Brien's aides that the agency had wanted to give a break to
the vendors, many of whom are operating small businesses on a tight
budget.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators are concerned that, in fact, not all the
tickets that were billed to the vendors were sent out.
Investigators are trying to determine if lottery employees may have
used the tickets for private gain.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that some of the attempts to collect the $13
million stopped short when the vendors were able to demonstrate
that they never received the tickets that were recorded as having
been printed and sent to them.
</P>
<P>
   Lashman said he is not aware of any reports of a black market
for lottery tickets. ``This is the first I have heard of it, but I
am happy to look into it,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lashman also said he is reviewing the $13 million that vendors
owe the lottery to determine whether it is a serious problem facing
the agency. He said the lottery is also owed another $2 million
from vendors that is not collectable because they have gone out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be sure we will have the type of controls that
prevents any losses of funds that in the end go to prize winners
and to cities and town,'' he said.

 Diedrich Coffee Hopes Investors Are Thirsty for Second Serving  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Will investors go for a second cup of Diedrich Coffee?
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine coffee house chain plans on holding a secondary stock
offering to help pay for its $35 million buyout of Castroville's
Coffee People, according to documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Diedrich's plan to buy Coffee People hinges directly
upon the success of such a stock offering. Without it, Diedrich
won't have the money to do the deal, and any buyout agreement will
evaporate like the foam atop a double cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, Street Smarts spotlighted little-known
Diedrich's bid for Coffee People, citing it as a reason to talk
about the company's strong potential as a turnaround candidate. The
acquisition announcement was one of the first bold strokes by
Diedrich Chairman John Martin, the former head of Taco Bell, since
he had taken the helm of Diedrich more than a year ago. Martin,
incidentally, has invested about $1 million of his own cash in the
once-beleaguered coffee chain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed takeover, Coffee People shareholders would
get $10.8 million in cash, proceeds from a bank loan, and 1.7
million shares of Diedrich stock.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they would get another $14.3 million in cash from the net
proceeds of the stock offering, which Diedrich plans to hold before
the buyout closes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how events are expected to unfold. Diedrich and Coffee
People hope to nail down their definitive acquisition agreement
(they currently have just a letter of intent) by March 5. About
three weeks after the agreement is reached, Diedrich will file its
prospectus for the secondary offering. And if the offering flies,
both companies hope to close the buyout before the end of summer.
Thus far, Diedrich has yet to choose an underwriter for the
offering. However, San Francisco's First Securities Van Kasper is
presumably in the running. It is the only investment bank with a
financial analyst that provides research on Diedrich. The analyst,
Eric Wold, who has a buy on the stock, would not comment on an
offering.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET23 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  According to a registration statement filed with the SEC,
Diedrich hopes to sell about 1.5 million shares at about $6 a
share. The current float, or number of shares that are publicly
traded, is 4.1 million. The stock has risen about $1.50 on the
buyout news and has been trading above $6 a share since then.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Diedrich, whose stock trades over the counter, isn't
for the faint of heart. While Chairman John Martin and Chief
Executive Officer Tim Ryan have demonstrated the ability to build a
national fast-food chain, there are no guarantees that they can
duplicate that magic.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, after some diligent observations by readers of
Street Smarts, it was discovered that some of the explosive growth
of Taco Bell under Martin and Ryan wasn't clearly represented. The
two men saw the number of full-scale restaurants at Taco Bell grow
from 1,500 to about 7,000 during their 13-year tenure. An earlier
press release cited that they grew the concept to ``25,000
outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   While not inaccurate, that total included joint ventures with
gasoline stations and reduced-scale ``express'' outlets on college
campuses. The number also included point-of-sale displays in
grocery stores where Taco Bell packaged products are sold, says
Diedrich Chief Financial Officer Ann Wride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, judging by the high interest in Diedrich stock by Street
Smarts readers, it is prudent to remind investors that Diedrich is
a turnaround play. Remember: This company has posted losses in
three of its past five fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET23 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  However, as mentioned in the earlier column, Diedrich shows
promise. It's worth watching Martin and Co. over the next several
months.

 What to Do If You're 13 And Have $10,000  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a 13-year-old girl who received a $10,000 gift from
my grandmother. I'm thinking of investing the money in a
combination of stock ($6,000), an IRA account consisting of either
Vanguard or Merrill Lynch stock mutual funds ($2,000) and a bank
certificate of deposit ($2,000). The stock I have in mind is my
father's company, which is not yet publicly traded, but he says it
has a great future. Does this sound like a good plan?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I can't say for sure because I don't know anything
about your father's company. It's not surprising that he speaks
well of it, but it's my understanding (and experience) that
adolescent girls aren't shy about challenging their parents. Make
him prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, maybe I'm being too skeptical. Nowadays, any privately
held company seems to be a good investment _ provided it plans to
go public. If you can get in at a bargain price before the initial
public offering, you might be able to retire before age 20.
</P>
<P>
   The investment in stock mutual funds seems appropriate for a
young person. In the long run, a diversified portfolio of stocks is
likely to outperform most other types of investment. However, bear
in mind that you must have some earned income to contribute to an
IRA. Your maximum contribution each year is $2,000 or the amount
you earn, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   As for the certificate of deposit, it certainly is safe enough.
But the current 4 percent or 5 percent annual return from CDs is
piddling. I don't know why you would want to limit yourself this
way unless you think you will need to spend that portion of your
money in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   IRA Withdrawals
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an Individual Retirement Account with about $14,000 in
it. I am not yet 59-1/2 years old, but I would like to withdraw all
the money. My situation is complicated by the fact that I am living
and working outside the United States and will not have any
reportable income this year except for investment income. Will I be
allowed to offset the tax on my IRA withdrawal with deductions and
exemptions? (I am married, filing jointly with my wife.) Also, will
I incur the 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal from my IRA?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Last question first: Yes, you will have to pay the 10
percent penalty _ $1,400 in your case _ because you haven't yet
reached age 59-1/2. That is unless you are withdrawing the money to
pay for education expenses, in which case there is no penalty. The
same holds true for the first $10,000 you withdraw to purchase a
first home.
</P>
<P>
   You also will have to pay regular income tax on whichever
portion of the $14,000 in your IRA constitutes taxable income. If
this is a deductible IRA, then all the money in the account is
taxable. If it is a nondeductible IRA, then only your investment
gains are taxable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  However, you should be able to offset most or all of the taxable
amount with deductions and exemptions. You and your wife are
entitled to a total of $5,500 in exemptions for 1999, and an
additional $2,750 for each dependent child. You also can take a
joint standard deduction of $7,200 _ or you may be able to top that
if you itemize deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Your question breezes past the interesting fact that income you
may be earning abroad is exempt from income tax. This wasn't always
true, but it is now _ provided you have been abroad for at least a
year. The foreign earned-income exclusion for 1999 is $74,000 _
meaning that up to that amount of salary and self-employment income
is exempt from U.S. income taxes. You do have to report the income
_ on Form 2555 _ but that is just a formality (or nuisance,
depending on your point of view). Your investment income remains
taxable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Options vs. Restricted
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you please explain the difference between restricted
stock and stock options, and also the difference between vested and
unvested stock options?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Although you don't say so, your question seems to imply
that you are in a position to profit if your employer's stock
performs well. Perhaps you have a choice between options and
restricted stock?
</P>
<P>
   Restricted stock is a gift from your employer of a specified
number of shares. However, you can't take possession and sell the
stock until you satisfy certain conditions. Normally, you only have
to remain with your employer for a stated number of years. This
type of compensation most often is used to retain valuable
employees who might otherwise jump to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options give you the right to buy a stated number of
shares at a fixed price before a fixed date _ usually 10 years
after the options are granted. They can become valuable if the
stock shoots up, but they also can expire worthless if they fall
below the grant price and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Your employer may require you to wait a certain period of time
before the options become vested _ that is, before you are entitled
to buy the stock and pocket any profits.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a choice between restricted stock and options, you
should ask yourself how high (or low) you expect your company's
stock to go in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   If you expect the stock to go down, then it's no contest: Take
the restricted stock because, unlike the options, it will be worth
something when you finally get your mitts on it.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the stock will go up, that will be favorable
whether your take restricted stock or options. There is no pat
answer as to which will be better.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MONEYBAG () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  You will have to do the arithmetic, taking into account just how
far you think the stock can rise over various periods of time. You
also must consider the number of restricted shares involved and the
number of options. Make the choice that will leave you holding the
most money.

FEDERALIZING LOCAL CRIMES BAD POLICY, BAR TASK FORCE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When a Black man in Texas was dragged to his death
last year behind a pickup truck, the call went out for a federal
law against such vicious hate crimes even though state prosecutors
had already charged three White men with capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a task force of the American Bar Association cited
that case as an example of a ``misguided, unnecessary and even
harmful'' trend in Congress to federalize crimes that have long
been handled by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's member on the 17-person task force said broadened
federal criminal jurisdiction ``is an unfortunate usurpation of the
traditional authority of states in our federal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Ehrlich of the state Court of Appeals said the
problem ``could undermine the state courts and lead to a sense of
local impotence in the face of federal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich, a former federal prosecutor, cited President Clinton's
call for a federal law against drunken driving as an example of a
politically expedient get-tough mentality in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federalization trend has far-reaching consequences,'' said
the panel, headed by former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strains the constitutional view that local crime is, with
rare exception, a matter for the states to attack,'' the task force
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a phenomenon capable of altering the careful
decentralization of criminal law authority that has worked well in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force cited political grandstanding as a principal
source of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not considered politically wise to vote against crime
legislation,'' even if it is not necessary, the panel concluded.
They quoted a legal scholar's contention that such efforts are
``symbolic gestures to appease the public rather than actual
attempts to reduce crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force report noted that Congress has weighed in over
the past several years by making such crimes as carjacking and
drive-by shootings federal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The recent congressional effort continued a trend that began in
the 1970s. The task force reported that more than 40 percent of the
federal criminal laws enacted since the Civil War were adopted
after 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The surge is continuing. Over the past two years, senators and
representatives sponsored nearly a thousand bills dealing with
criminal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of federal legislation has produced little federal
prosecution. There were no drive-by shooting or domestic violence
cases in federal courts, for example, despite the public outcry
that included such crimes in the 1994 crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   That inactivity led the task force to conclude: ``Increased
federalization is rarely, if ever, likely to have any appreciable
effect on the categories of violent crime that most concern
Americans, because in practice federal criminal law enforcement can
only reach a small percent of such activity.'' &QL;

 Using Women's Intuition  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Shari Smith, 51, co-owner with her husband of a tool-making
company, started trading from her home in San Carlos more than a
year ago with $200,000 in savings. Now she has $530,000, thanks
largely to an uncanny ability to predict price moves in Nasdaq
stocks by staring at the ticker tape on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   She got hooked on Internet trading after talking to some women
friends who already were doing it. Women, she says, are
particularly suited for this kind of investing because they are
``intuitive and visual.''
</P>
<P>
   She used to work full time in the family business, but her
trading has proved more lucrative. Her only previous investment
experience was with mutual funds, ``but I made very little money.''
</P>
<P>
   Her market day actually starts in the evening. ``It's the best
time to place your trades, when the market isn't open and you
aren't emotionally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   She bases her choices on the previous session's price action.
She follows 20 or 30 stocks at a time _ ``primarily technology,
they're more volatile; AOL and AtHome are good trading stocks'' _
watching the prices scroll across the bottom of the TV screen on
CNBC. Then her intuition takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a feel for the direction of a stock, whether I can get
it at a low price in the opening hour the next day. After that,
there is generally a bounce up in the morning. I often buy and sell
a stock before the end of the first hour of trading. A long-term
hold for me is three or four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is as intense as Tom Weeden, the San Mateo day trader, is
easygoing. She bristled at a suggestion that luck could have
contributed to her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trading rules are very strict,'' she says. ``Hold your
winners; cut your losses. There's no exception. You have to be
unemotional about it. I used stop-loss orders a lot last year, when
the market was going down in the summer. (A stop-loss orders a
broker to sell a stock if it falls to a specified price. It is
designed to protect a profit or limit a loss.)
</P>
<P>
   She concludes: ``There's a lot of opportunity out there if
people are willing to study and learn the rules.''

CAMERA COMPANIES PROJECT DIGITAL FUTURE, BUT NOT TOO SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One of the ironies of the movie industry is that
while movies feature more and more digital wizardry, the actual
projection machines being used to show the movies at local theaters
hasn't changed much in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st century, however, that'll change. Exactly how movie
projectors will change _ and how that will change Hollywood and the
companies that supply the behind-the-scenes product _ is open for
debate. A very heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   Prototypes of digital projectors _ one by Texas Instruments and
the other by Hughes-JVC _ have been demonstrated that promise to
give long-lasting movies that equal the quality of pristine film
prints to theaters willing to pay the hefty price.
</P>
<P>
   The potential impact of a change like that on some of
Hollywood's leading businesses is staggering. Multimillion-dollar
companies that employ thousands of people in the region will have
to switch over to the new technology as early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps not, others contend. Some Wall Street analysts warn
the new projector technology has two major drawbacks that could
eventually be fatal _ the massive installation costs and the
difficulty in getting Hollywood studios and theater chains to agree
on which format will eventually be adopted, digital projectors or
an enhanced 35 mm projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this could be war,'' said Ron Jarvis, president
of the six-plant Technicolor Worldwide Film Division, in response
to a recent promotional blitz for digital projectors. ``We believe
35 mm film is here to stay for a long time. I personally believe
the quality of image from digital projectors is not as good as film
and should not be wished upon the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also believe the digital projectors are far, far
away from reaching multiplexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be at least five to 10 years before digital
projectors are used,'' said Michael Legg of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeffrey Thomison of Hilliard Lyons agreed, noting that
the digital systems will cost as much as $140,000 compared with
$20,000 for a conventional projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many obstacles to overcome and that makes it more
long-term than a lot of people realize,'' he said. ``It's not going
to happen next month or next year.''
</P>
<P>
   If digital movies caught on, it could be a massive blow to a
pair of well-known players within the exhibition industry _ North
Hollywood-based Technicolor Worldwide Film and Hollywood-based
Deluxe Laboratories, the top suppliers of prints to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis insists Technicolor, a division of British media
conglomerate Carlton Communications, has not been standing still
amid the growing expectation for digital projectors. For example,
it is relaunching its dye-transfer process, using a
photo-mechanical system rather than a photo-chemical one, leading
to major improvements in color quality and durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've completed building two monstrous production machines in
North Hollywood and we plan to process millions of feet this
year,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Jarvis said, Technicolor will demonstrate in April
further advances that will cut costs and reduce the risk of piracy.
``We're doing this with the idea that other technologies are out
there,'' he added. ``We don't think that film has been developed to
its fullest extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Those technologies also are likely to be used at Technicolor's
DVD plant in Camarillo, Calif., Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Legg asserted that the current quality of the digital images on
a large screen falls short of matching the sharpness and color of
conventional 35 mm prints shown on a projector at the rate of 24
frames per second. ``It's not there yet, in my opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appeared to be unfazed Monday by the prospect of a
digital takeover suggested by a New York Times story. Stock of
Ballantyne of Omaha Inc., which has 65 percent of the domestic
market for movie projectors, took a slight hit by falling 31.25
cents to $8.375 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantyne, which has maintained the position that conventional
machines will remain the dominant technology for at least a decade,
has a bright future,Legg said. ``Ballantyne will be a part of
digital projectors if that becomes mainstream technology,'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Thomison agreed, saying, ``Ballantyne has the dominant brand,
reputation and relationships. I think people are mistaken when they
think digital technology will crush Ballantyne, because I think it
will actually benefit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Panavision Inc., the leading maker of conventional motion
picture cameras, also could see profound changes if digital
technology catches on, even though movies would still be shot and
edited on 35 mm then transformed to digital format. But Panavision
has already been introducing digital products that, among other
things, allow directors to include optical effects on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Stock of Panavision was unchanged Monday at $10.3125 while
American Depository Receipts of Carlton rose $2.375 to $50.75. &QL;

VINEGAR BEND MIZELL, 68, PITCHER AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilmer (Vinegar Bend) Mizell, a fastballing left-hander with a
well-publicized country-boy image who pitched for nine seasons in
the National League, then served as a congressman from North
Carolina and an official in the Ford and Reagan administrations,
collapsed and died Sunday while visiting family members in
Kerrville, Texas. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mizell, who lived in Midway, N.C., had sustained a heart attack
last October, but the cause of death was not immediately
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Although he went on to serve three terms in Congress, Mizell had
long been viewed as a rustic innocent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he made his debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in
1952, he had established himself in the tradition of Southern
ballplayers known for small-town roots: pitchers Clyde (Pea Ridge)
Day of Pea Ridge, Ark., and Bill Voiselle, who wore No. 96 for his
hometown of Ninety-Six, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mizell was born and reared in Leakesville, Miss., but gained his
sobriquet playing baseball in nearby Vinegar Bend, Ala., population
50.
</P>
<P>
   His rural origins became the stuff of promotional fare.
</P>
<P>
   When he pitched for the Winston-Salem, N.C., minor league team,
he rode around the field one night on a mule and then sang country
music over the public-address system. ``I walked behind more mules
than I walked batters _ and that's saying a lot,'' he said of his
farm-boy days.
</P>
<P>
   While he was pitching for Houston of the Texas League in 1951,
management staged a Vinegar Bend Night, flying in 32 people
supposedly representing the town's entire adult population. Mizell
later noted that Vinegar Bend was so small, some guests ``must've
come from the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-3-inch, 205-pounder, Mizell was a power pitcher,
striking out 319 batters in 414 innings during his first two major
league seasons. But he was hampered by wildness and an inability to
hold runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   He made the National League all-star team in 1959 when he was
13-10 with the Cardinals, then helped the Pirates win a World
Series championship in 1960, going 13-5 after being traded by St.
Louis in May. Mizell was sent to the expansion Mets in 1962, and
after going 0-2 with them, retired with a career record of 90-88
and an earned run average of 3.85.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Groat, the Pirate shortstop, recalled how ``as a
ballplayer, he wasn't political _ players didn't really talk
politics.'' Billy Johnson, a Cardinal third baseman, once remarked
how Mizell ``was a tall, good ol' country boy, so quiet that you
would never know he would go on to become a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mizell did just that. After working as an executive with
Pepsi-Cola, he served on the Board of County Commissioners of
Davidson County, N.C., in the mid-1960s, then was elected to
Congress as a Republican in 1968 from a district centered in
Winston-Salem. Serving three terms, he was a staunch defender of
his home state's tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mizell flashed his old form as a pitcher in the annual
congressional baseball game. He once struck out seven Democrats in
a row, prompting the opposing manager to announce, ``If this guy
throws one more pitch, we walk off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   After he lost a bid for a fourth term, Mizell was named by
President Gerald Ford as assistant secretary of commerce for
economic development in March 1975. He served 14 months, then made
an unsuccessful attempt to win back his congressional seat.
President Reagan appointed Mizell in 1982 as assistant secretary of
agriculture for governmental and public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Ruth; two sons, David, of
High Point, N.C., and Curtis, of Vinegar Bend; a brother, Danny, of
Midway; and four grandchildren. His first wife, Nancy, died
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Political foes were not the only ones to discover Mizell was no
rube.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lane, the Cardinals' general manager, once told of the
time he called Mizell in to negotiate his 1956 contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a typical Ozark Ike type,'' Lane recalled.
``Vinegar told me how he had turned most of his earnings over to
his family to put them on their feet, how he had bought his brother
a truck, and now that he was married and expecting his first child,
he thought it was time to get something for himself. I never got a
chance to open up my mouth again for the next half-hour. He signed
for more than I had intended to give.''

SECURITAS OF SWEDEN TO ACQUIRE PINKERTON'S IN $384-MILLION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinkerton's Inc., the detective and security company that has
struggled to keep up as the security problems of its big
multinational clients have become global, said on Monday that it
had agreed to be acquired by Securitas AB of Sweden for $384
million.
</P>
<P>
   The rich premium _ at $29 a share, the offer was 72 percent
above Pinkerton's closing price of $16.88 last Friday _ underscored
the value of a famous name in the low-margin security business.
Pinkerton's, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif., was
founded in 1850 by Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant who had
become Chicago's first detective.
</P>
<P>
   Securitas, which has built itself into a European powerhouse in
the highly fragmented industry through acquisitions, expects to use
Pinkerton's to leap to prominence in the United States, too, and to
pursue more business from huge multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will have sales of about $3.5 billion, 114,000
employees in Europe, the Americas and Asia, and about 5 percent of
the global security market.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas W. Wathen, Pinkerton's chairman and its largest
shareholder with a 30.6 percent stake, has already agreed to sell
his shares to Securitas.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pinkerton's jumped $11.6875, or 69.3 percent, to
$28.5625 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. An even
stronger indication of investor enthusiasm was apparent in Sweden,
where Securitas' shares jumped 15 percent, or 18.5 kronor ($2.31),
to 139.5 kronor, in trading on the Stockholm Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton's derives just under 90 percent of its revenue from
guard services these days, although it also sells alarms and
provides security consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The company initially specialized in investigating train
robberies, but it quickly gained renown for uncovering a plot to
assassinate Abraham Lincoln in 1861 when he was president-elect.
Its ``We Never Sleep'' slogan and its trademark, an open left eye
that gave birth to the term private eye, have been fixtures on the
business landscape ever since.

JOHNSON FOCUSES ON INFIELD, BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ With full squad workouts set to begin
Wednesday, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's focus will
turn to on-field priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area I'll be working mostly with is my expertise, the
infield play,'' Johnson said. ``You'll see me working on different
scenarios there, and in the bullpen, leading up to (closer Jeff)
Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   The infield of Eric Karros at first, Eric Young at second, Mark
Grudzielanek at shortstop and Adrian Beltre at third will provide
runs but is only average on defense. Grudzielanek, however, spent
much of the offseason working on his defense and Beltre, though a
rookie, is touted as a strong fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going in with Gold Glovers?'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``No, but these guys are talented, athletic guys
that have a lot of pride and work hard, and I think they'll get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure a competitive spring training in the bullpen, with
decisions made late in camp as to who will fill what role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to have multiple set-up guys,'' Johnson said. ``The
most critical area of a ballgame is always the sixth, seventh,
eighth. The better people I have to go in the sixth, seventh and
eighth, the better your ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The real competition could be for the left-hander's role. With
one left-handed starter, Carlos Perez, Johnson said the ideal
situation is to have two lefty relievers. Greg Cadaret and Chris
Haney are the early favorites, but Pedro Borbon, coming off arm
surgery, and Jeff Kubenka, who was 1-0 with a 0.96 ERA in six games
for the Dodgers last season, also figure into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson thinks the bench, the backup outfield and catching
positions and the starting rotation will work themselves out before
the club returns to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A weighty issue: With the first day of full workouts being
Wednesday, many of the position players will arrive today. Expected
in that group is Raul Mondesi, who the Dodgers are eager to see.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Mondesi weighs approximately 240 _ 20 pounds over
his playing weight _ which could be an opportunity for fourth
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see him when he shows. We'll wait and see what we've
got,'' Malone said. ``Hollandsworth could earn a lot more playing
time than he is anticipating at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's shape: Shaw remains in Washington Court House, Ohio,
waiting for his wife, Julie, to give berth to their third child.
But don't think the Dodgers are fretting about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw two simulated innings (Saturday),'' Malone said. ``He
threw 65 to 80 pitches. We know Jeff Shaw's a hard worker. I'm not
worried about it. I'm sure he's in tremendous shape.''

AMERICA WEST-UNITED DEAL WON'T FLY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT AND DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ America West Airlines answered the billion-dollar
question about its future Monday by saying no to a merger with
another airline.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``antitrust, regulatory and employee issues,'' America
West Chairman Bill Franke ended weeks of speculation, saying the
airline's board of directors had unanimously concluded it should
remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, had
expressed interest in buying the airline to bolster United's West
Coast operations and add planes to its growing hub at Dulles
International Airport in Washington. UAL reportedly made a bid for
America West last week.
</P>
<P>
   Franke said America West is no longer considering bids by United
or any other airline.
</P>
<P>
   His comments drew cheers from a crowd of employees gathered
Monday outside the company's downtown Tempe offices.
</P>
<P>
   United had little to say about America West's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're disappointed at this announcement by America West,
we will continue to run our company in the best interest of
employees, shareholders and the communities we serve,'' the
Chicago-based carrier said in a memo to employees late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Andy Plews declined to comment on whether
United would raise the cash offer it reportedly made for America
West last week.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its initial announcement a month ago that it was
interested in America West, United has not commented on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had pegged America West's takeover value at between $23
and $30 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about a deal surfaced Jan. 20 when America West and
United disclosed that merger talks were underway. No dollar figure
was ever revealed, but analysts said it could have been as high as
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from reporters, Franke bristled at
suggestions that America West had hung a for sale sign on the
company. He called that speculation ``total B.S. promoted by the
local press and others.''
</P>
<P>
   As a public company, America West had a responsibility to
shareholders to consider the ``expressions of interest'' from other
carriers, Franke said, adding that there were no formal offers made
by United or any other carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't comment on who did or who didn't or what the
circumstances were,'' Franke said, citing confidentiality
agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the news conference he said: ``There was no deal
that we were entertaining. There were no negotiations we were
having.''
</P>
<P>
   Had a formal offer been made, America West would have been
required by law to disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Pressnell of Chandler, who was traveling on an America West
flight Monday, said he's glad the merger talks are off because it
would have meant higher air fares for Phoenix-area travelers.
Observers feared United would cut Phoenix routes and move some of
America West's planes to other hubs.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger talks now scuttled, Franke said America West
will continue to expand with its hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have significant strategic opportunities,''
Franke said. ``We have positioned the airline with a low-cost
structure, a flexible fleet plan, a strong balance sheet, growing
hubs and committed employees. We are confident about the company's
future as an independent airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Franke has said that the airline has 28 new planes coming into
its fleet over the next three years and will add 100 flights per
day out of Sky Harbor International Airport. It currently has 214
daily departures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this airline has a very strong future in front of it
and you'll continue to see us grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some employees cheered the announcement, others were
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, president of the Association of Flight
Attendants Council 66, said the employees and flying public would
be better off if United took over America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope United Airlines isn't scared off that easily in its
attempt to purchase America West,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An end to the current merger speculation comes as America West
is embroiled in a labor dispute with flight attendants. Contract
talks have broken off and a 30-day cooling off period expires at
midnight March 20 EST. After that, the flight attendants are free
to strike and they plan to engage in intermittent unannounced
strikes if a settlement isn't reached.
</P>
<P>
   America West has said it will consider shutting down operations
entirely in the event of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots union Chairman Donald Steinman encouraged America West to
``focus on reaching a fair and equitable resolution in the flight
attendants' contract negotiations'' now that merger talks are over.
</P>
<P>
   Two flight attendants at Sky Harbor International Airport who
declined to be identified said they had hoped for a merger because
it might have improved pay and morale, which are at rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If United came in, it might improve the way management feels
about employees,'' one said. ``They just think we're here to push
peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   An America West pilot, who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said he thinks that eventually America West will be
swallowed up by another carrier because it can't compete against
the major carriers at its present size.
</P>
<P>
   Airline policy prohibits employees from speaking with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Airline observers suggested that United's interest in America
West was a response to American Airlines' acquisition of Reno Air
and an alliance with Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Justice Department scrutiny of an America West deal was
seen as a major hurdle because United, the nation's largest
carrier, would have solidified its domination of the Western market
by acquiring No. 9 America West.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines' right of first refusal also was viewed as
a major stumbling block to an alliance. Continental was interested
in protecting its alliance with America West.
</P>
<P>
   America West made the announcement that merger talks were over
after the stock market closed Monday, but some investors obviously
got wind of the company's plans to stay independent. On a day when
airline stocks and the market in general were up, America West's
stock fell $1.38, to $21.38 in extremely heavy trading. United's
stock rose $2.50, to $62.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect America West's stock to fall again today as
investors who bought the stock on speculation of a sale bail out.
The stock was trading in the $16 to $18 range before merger
speculation drove up the price a month ago. &QL;

 PCBs IN HUDSON STRIPED BASS AT SAFE LEVELS, N.Y. STATE SAYS 
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time in two decades, New York state
environmental scientists have found that chemical contamination in
striped bass from the lower reaches of the Hudson River has dropped
to levels deemed safe to eat by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a study completed last week, staff scientists with the
Environmental Conservation Department concluded that the drop was
large enough for state officials to consider ending a 23-year-old
ban on commercial netting of the fish, a state law that has nearly
eliminated a centuries-old traditional springtime harvest of
stripers and shad along the river banks.
</P>
<P>
   Any change would take at least a couple of years, but commercial
fishermen were delighted by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals in question are PCBs _ polychlorinated biphenyls _
which were legally released into the river for three decades from
General Electric factories north of Troy before they were banned in
1977 as a probable cause of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The study, of samples taken in the spring of 1997, showed that
PCBs in fillets from striped bass captured in the lower river
(where fresh water becomes salt water, typically around Catskill)
averaged 1.06 parts per million, about half the federal limit of 2
parts per million. Only 3.3 percent of the samples exceeded the
limit, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the PCB level in stripers was almost 3 parts per
million; by 1994, it was down to 2 parts per million. Tests of 1998
samples will not be completed until April.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Sloan, a biologist for the Environmental Conservation
Department and an author of the study, emphasized that PCB levels
were below the Federal limit only in fish taken south of
Poughkeepsie. Although the level in stripers from the river near
Albany also dropped, it was not low enough to bring them under the
federal limit, he said. He added that other species did not show a
similar decline.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass are less prone to absorb PCBs than other river fish
because they spend part of each year at sea, he said. Shad have
little exposure to PCBs because they only come to the Hudson to
spawn. Other fish that live in the river _ largemouth bass,
catfish, eels _ tend to have higher PCB levels and remain above the
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said the results should prompt state officials to consider
ending the law banning commercial netting of stripers.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCB concentrations in striped bass have reached the point
where continued limitations on the commercial fishery due solely to
PCBs are not justified,'' the study concluded. ``At least for this
species, the monitoring vigil over the last 25 years is starting to
bear testimony to the fact that if a natural system stops being
insulted, conditions will start to shift favorably.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gabrielson, a commercial fishermen who has netted shad
for 58 years near his home in Nyack, said, ``I've been waiting 23
years to hear something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Any decision on reopening the commercial striped bass fishery in
the Hudson would be preceded by public hearings and would involve a
multistate commission that sets limits for how many fish may be
taken in each state along the Atlantic Coast, said Gerry Barnhart,
the director of fish, wildlife and marine resources for New York's
Environmental Conservation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The PCB study was not expected to change state and federal
efforts to force General Electric to clean up the river banks and
bottom downstream of its two factories, at Fort Edward and Hudson
Falls, which released the PCBs while making transformers and other
electrical equipment.

ADMINISTRATION REJECTS SALE OF AMERICAN SATELLITE TO CHINESE-LED
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 19th graf to correct identification of Rep.Christopher Cox.
He is from California, not Connecticut.) (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Swayed by criticisms that commercial satellite
deals with China could threaten national security, the Clinton
administration decided on Monday to reject the sale of a $450
million satellite to a consortium with close ties to the Chinese
government, senior administration officials said. The decision cast
considerable doubt on the future of high technology sales useful to
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision reverses the years-long policy in
the United States of promoting commercial satellite deals with
China. It had long championed the transactions to help China make
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several months, the administration has faced a
barrage of investigations and a growing stack of official reports
that have called the commercial satellite sales a threat to
American security and a great boon to China's military capability.
The findings have indicated that the program of satellite sales
might have given the Chinese the scientific expertise to improve
their missile-launching capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Disapproval of the satellite deal is likely to be another
sensitive issue raised next week when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visits China. With Chinese-American relations eroding over
other issues like human rights and trade, Beijing could interpret
the disapproval as a fundamental retreat from Washington's
commitment to expanded economic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the Defense and State Departments
objected to allowing China to launch the satellite. Overruling the
Commerce Department, which had favored the sale, the State and
Defense officials concluded that the technology to place the
satellite in orbit would help the Chinese military make its
intercontinental ballistic missile fleet more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also feared that that Chinese military would
benefit, both commercially and technologically, by controlling the
satellite once it was in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involves a Hughes Space and Communications satellite
designed to set up a mobile telephone network over much of Asia,
reaching from China to Indonesia, and then across the Indian Ocean
as far as Pakistan. The Commerce Department is expected to formally
notify Hughes of its ``intent to deny'' in the next few days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement on Monday night that made no
reference to a decision, but reiterated that the satellite deal
``can be used as a model for how we can protect national security
while launching satellites overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively revokes President Clinton's quiet
approval of the sale two and a half years ago. At the time,
Clinton's aides assured him it would not contribute to Chinese
military capabilities. The State Department and the Defense
Department concurred with the decision, but had not thoroughly
vetted the military links of the Singapore-based consortium, which
was the official buyer of the satellite. Top officials of the
consortium included top military officers of the People's
Liberation Army, who also served in posts with the China Satellite
Launch and Tracking Control Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes officials had sought an expedited review, and pressured
the administration to approve the deal, according to government
documents provided later to congressional investigators. A change
in the satellite's design forced the company to apply for a revised
license, and a raft of subsequent investigations into China's
efforts to obtain American technology helped prompt the
administration to reverse its position.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a time that relations between the United
States and China are eroding on many fronts, from human rights to
economic interchanges. A senior administration official, speaking
on the condition that he not be identified, said on Monday that
``we are heading into a very rough patch,'' and speculated that the
decision Monday could make it ``very difficult'' to approve other
satellite sales to China in the near future, though none are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The official also speculated that the Chinese would likely move
quickly to obtain a similar satellite from Europe, in part to drive
home their ability to circumvent American restrictions and reward
non-American competitors. However, it appears unlikely that China
could acquire technology as sophisticated as that offered by
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to visit Beijing next week in connection
with a visit to Washington in April by China's prime minister, Zhou
Rongji. Zhou is widely regarded as China's economic czar, and
administration officials believed until recently that his visit
would be preceded by intense negotiations to secure China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, a move Beijing and Washington
have long sought.
</P>
<P>
   But with China's economy slowing and unemployment riots breaking
out around the country, Zhou appears less eager to strike a deal
that would require him to open China's markets rapidly. The
cancellation of the satellite deal could easily be interpreted in
Beijing as a fundamental retreat from Washington's commitment to
expanded economic relations with China, and could also diminish the
chances of any broad trade agreement. Such an agreement would
ultimately require approval by Congress, and administration
officials say that in the current atmosphere, that would be
difficult to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the satellite deal would be approved has
diminished for months. On Monday morning, The Financial Times of
London reported that it is ``on the verge of being rejected.'' By
later Monday, the Commerce Department had received the last of the
votes from four other agencies with a voice in the deal, and
concluded that its position in favor of the sale had been
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Electronics or the Commerce Department could
theoretically appeal the denial of the four export licenses
involved in the deal, but administration officials said that as a
practical matter they thought it was unlikely any reconsideration
would change the outcome.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At a high level interagency meeting on Feb. 11, the Pentagon
said it was troubled by the involvement of the Chinese military in
the regional satellite system, called Asia-Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's concerns at the meeting included
questions about Hughes' dealings in recent years with China, the
official added. One troubling episode involved a 1995 tutorial on
rocket launching given by Hughes engineers to Chinese scientists,
now the subject of a criminal inquiry. Another involved the
company's hiring of the son of the Chinese general who oversees his
country's military satellite programs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent findings of a select House committee also figured in
the decision to deny the Hughes deal, officials said. The panel,
headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., criticized Hughes'
dealings with China and recommended that the sdministration
strengthen export controls. The administration supports most of the
committee's findings, though it disagrees with the committee's
recommendation to strengthen the Pentagon's role in approving
licenses for the export of equipment that could have military
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is completing a similar
report, which officials said is likely to also harshly criticize
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hughes told the government that it faced
potentially large losses if the license was denied, including $100
million in unrecoverable costs and a possible penalty if the
government did not approve a license by Feb. 15, according to an
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the company's questioned deals with China, its
chairman was C. Michael Armstrong, who also served as head of
Clinton's export advisory council, a group of private-sector
executives and labor leaders who advice the administration on trade
policy. Armstrong now heads AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   His successor at Hughes, Michael T. Smith, wrote Albright last
December that Hughes ``will adopt new policies and procedures for
the export of technology and equipment,'' including a ``new
internal export compliance program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughes of today is a very different company than it was
even a year ago,'' Smith said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The license for the satellite deal was handled by the Commerce
Department, which must consult and win the consent of other
government departments involved in satellite exports. Next month,
as a result of legislation passed by Congress last year and
opposed, but signed, by Clinton, the State Department will once
again take on the lead role for a wider range of satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Deparment will no longer have a vote in licensing
reviews for many of the most sophisticated products, which will be
considered part of the State Department's ``munitions list,'' a
list of the nation's most sensitive military-related technologies.

BANKS WANT PIECE OF OLIVETTI-TELECOM ITALIA DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With OLIVETTI-TELECOM) 
(mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it Wall Street's version of ``piling on'' in a football
game.
</P>
<P>
   But almost every investment bank was scrambling to get a piece
of the action in Olivetti SpA's hostile offer for the
telecommunications giant Telecom Italia SpA last weekend. Eleven
European and U.S. banks have lined up to represent various parties
in the transaction, which suffered a setback Monday when Italian
regulators said Olivetti's bid was not admissible.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over Telecom Italia is reminiscent of Kohlberg Kravis
&AMP; Roberts' bid for RJR Nabisco in 1988, the decade's defining
hostile takeover. But this time, the investment banks representing
Olivetti have a personal stake in seeing the bid succeed because
the deal represents their shot at breaking into the European market
and attracting attention. ``These things are a lot like casting a
Broadway play,'' said one investment banker who asked not be
identified. ``There are lead actors, supporting players, the chorus
and bit parts. Right now there is a mighty struggle for every
banker to find a role.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the list of banks involved is so confusing that a chart
is needed to track the dealmakers. Olivetti has been working with
bankers since last November _ including Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and Lehman Brothers, both of which have been vying for a
place as the mastermind behind the bid, said people close to the
companies. ``This looks like a feeding frenzy,'' said Samuel Hayes,
a professor of finance at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   But that strategy could backfire. One concern, said people close
to the companies, is that the high profile of the bankers in this
deal could attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, something Olivetti does not want. The commission has no
jurisdiction over the offer because it is not open to U.S.
investors, but it could try to get involved because the bulk of the
bond buyers would most likely be U.S. institutions.
</P>
<P>
   That would slow the takeover process by as much as six months.
Olivetti is also being advised by Mediobanco SpA and Chase
Manhattan Bank; Germany's Mannesmann AG, Olivetti's phone business
partner, has retained Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia is believed to have a team of four banks in
place. Most of those bankers _ Credit Suisse First Boston, IMI
Banca SpA, Lazard Brothers &AMP; Co. and J.P. Morgan _ have long-term
relationships with Italia and more of a presence in Europe than the
Olivetti team. That, said one analyst, could give them an edge over
their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be left out, a team of bankers from Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter's London and Italian offices was in Rome Monday meeting with
government officials. That would leave Goldman, Sachs; Salomon
Smith Barney, and Bear, Stearns to represent other companies that
are interested in Telecom Italia, such as British Telecom or a U.S.
concern, like Bell Atlantic, said people close to the companies.

   After Mitch, Overtures From Central America &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Honduras and Belize have announced that they are open and eager
for tourist business. Although Hurricane Mitch visited the area at
the end of October, its impact on the tourist infrastructure was
less severe than on other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Diving, for instance, a major attraction in both countries, is
reported to be in full swing, with many island piers in Honduras
rebuilt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran Ministry of Tourism in Tegucigalpa said early this
month that the last two of the major island resorts that suffered
damage had reopened Feb. 1: Posada del Sol on Guanaja, where the
hurricane hovered for 39 hours with winds up to 273 miles an hour,
and Anthony's Key on nearby Roatan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Posada del Sol reconstructed its buildings and piers. Anthony's
Key completed new cabins on stilts that were described as having
the same rustic appeal as before the storm, but with some
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayman Bay Club, the other major resort on Guanaja, reopened
in December; Linda Fouke, a spokeswoman, said that dive boats were
taking divers out three times a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belize was only slightly damaged, but assumptions that it was
devastated by the storm, which was estimated to have left 10,000
dead in Honduras and Nicaragua, have reduced tourism. Experts say
that the storm cleansed the reefs that divers love. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Change of Patina At the King David Hotel &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Return visitors to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, one of the
best known in the Middle East, are probably doing a double take
these days. The hotel they thought they knew probably seems vaguely
different upon entering the lobby because of a recently completed
three-year interior renovation by the architect Adam D. Tihany in
conjunction with Lea Mahler of Jerusalem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tihany, noted for designing restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 and
Remi in New York, said he tried to ``keep the perception of the
six-story King David while changing the patina,'' by sticking to
the original scale and colors of the hotel. The same blue, white
and gold decor and the marble floor predominate.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of change should grab hold in the rooms, which were
reconfigured and redecorated. The number of rooms was reduced to
237, from 255, of which 37 are suites, an increase of 13. They
include 4 duplexes. Each room has new furniture and lighting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most obvious change is the moving of La Regence, the
restaurant destroyed in 1946 by a bomb placed by Menachem Begin's
guerrillas, to a central spot under the terrace facing the Old
City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doubles at the King David, 23 King David Street, Jerusalem
94101, start at $306, including breakfast. Suites cost $685 to
$2,013 a night. Reservations: (972-2) 620-8888, fax (972-2)

   Indonesian Batik On View in Washington &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Batik, the distinctively patterned fabric of Indonesia, is the
focus of an exhibition at the Textile Museum in Washington through
April 25. ``Fabric of Enchantment: Batik from the North Coast of
Java'' features about 50 pieces of cloth with designs that reflect
influences from the early 19th century through World War II and the
early days of Indonesian independence during the 1950s,
supplemented by historical photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art and is drawn from its collections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Batik is the term used for a process of making patterns on a
fabric that involves covering parts of the cloth with a
dye-resistant substance, usually wax, as well as the material
decorated by the process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cities and ports on the northern coast of the island of
Java, important stopping points on the East-West trade routes,
developed batik with styles that blended Chinese, European,
Javanese and Indian influences, with rich details, fanciful motifs,
luxurious flowers and an unusual range of colors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Textile Museum, 2320 S Street, N.W., is open Monday to
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free,
but a contribution of $5 is suggested for nonmembers. Information:

   Pop Music Palace For England &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new National Center for Popular Music is scheduled to open
Monday in Sheffield in northern England, 165 miles from London.
Sheffield is the home of the well-known pop music groups Pulp and
Def Leppard (it was also made famous in the 1988 film ``The Full
Monty''). The center was created to inform visitors about the
history and impact of pop music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The building, which was designed by Branson Coates Architecture,
a British firm, consists of four large stainless steel drums, each
with 32,300 square feet of space for permanent exhibitions, and
houses a space for temporary shows, cafe, bar and shop. The opening
exhibition focuses on albums or music that have most influenced the
lives of celebrities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The permanent exhibitions are housed in each of the four drums.
``Perspectives'' celebrates the music's diversity and its
influences. Themes include the power of love songs, the importance
of dance, and popular music's relationship with social change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Music'' examines how popular music is created, recorded
and distributed; visitors can play an instrument, mix a record,
design a record sleeve or present a radio show.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Turning Points,'' four 10-minute, large-scale films are
shown across three screens reflecting the global impact of popular
music. A huge glass World Wall allows visitors to listen to sounds
from around the world. And data bases provide information about 800
significant artists and groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth drum, ``Soundscapes,'' features a 200-seat auditorium
where ``ambisonic'' sound will use 16 speakers in two rings of 8,
moving sounds around the auditorium, as opposed to merely from the
side and rear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Popular Music, Paternoster Row,
Sheffield, will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission to
exhibition areas through timed tickets costs $12 on weekends and
every day in July and August, $9.75 all other times.
</P>
<P>
   Lower rates for children, students and families. It is estimated
that two and a half hours are needed to see the whole center. Call
(44-114) 296-2626. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England and Philadelhia Flowers Shows &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The days are getting longer, and in just a few weeks the
pioneering flowers _ crocuses, hyacinths and daffodils _ will be
out for all to see. If that is too long a wait, the New England
Flower Show and the Philadelphia Flower Show offer resplendent
sneak previews next month, bringing designers, horticulturists and
amateur enthusiasts together for two of the largest flower shows in
the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With more than 40 fully landscaped gardens, 600 competitors,
hourly lectures and 250 retail vendors, the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society's 128th New England Flower Show, ``Artistry
in the Garden,'' will take place March 13 to 21 at the Bayside
Exposition Center, 200 Mount Vernon Street, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits will include a garden built around the sculpture of Ron
Rudnicki, a New England sculptor and landscape artist, and
vignettes starring topiary renditions of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin
Bunny. Lecture topics include building stone walls, growing bonsai
and making potpourri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily except Sundays, when they
are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $14 on weekdays and $16 on
weekends, $5 ages 4 to 12, and $12 for seniors. Children under four
are free. Information: (617) 536-9280. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the Philadelphia Flower Show, to be presented by
the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society from March 7 to 14, is
``Design on Nature ... the Art of Gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten acres of exhibition space will include re-creations of
well-known gardens. There will be 60 landscaped displays, including
a tribute to the Rockefeller gardens at Kykuit on the Hudson River
and the National Historic Site of Cliveden in Pennsylvania, where
the battle of Germantown took place in 1777. Activities include
hourly lectures, twice-daily cooking presentations and daily
afternoon tea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hours for the Philadelphia Flower Show, at the Pennsylvania
Convention Center on 12th and Arch Streets, are Monday to Friday 10
a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Saturday 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Sunday 8 a.m. to 6
p.m. Admission: $18 weekends and $16 weekdays, ages 2 to 12 $8 at
all times. Afternoon tea: $20 a person. Information: (215)

ADVERTISING: GETTING A FAIR SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Clinton administration is pressing Madison Avenue
to voluntarily adopt a code to insure that media outlets and
agencies owned by members of minority groups get what is deemed
their fair share of consideration when advertising dollars are
spent _ or run the risk of federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's efforts, representing an intensification of
interest from Washington in the issue, were outlined at a meeting
Monday at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in midtown Manhattan sponsored
by the American Advertising Federation. The federation is a
coalition that represents national agencies, advertisers and media
companies as well as local advertising associations in 207 cities
and in student chapters at 248 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the federation, based in Washington, are among the
leaders searching for ways to increase diversity in an industry
that still displays an overwhelmingly white face to the consuming
public, even as the racial and ethnic backgrounds of the intended
audiences for sales pitches grow more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has expressed a preference for the industry
to adopt voluntary self-regulation, as has been its policy on
policing Internet advertising. But if progress is judged to be
lagging, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Justice
may step in _ or Congress could pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is growing with minority wealth, yet there's
very little specifically directed to multicultural audiences,''
Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the federation, said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for opportunities to forge new understandings
about the value of the minority market,'' he added, ``and how to
reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation is reorganizing its board, Snyder said, to create
a permanent standing task force dedicated to diversity and
multicultural advertising. That group will be headed by Thomas
Burrell, chairman of Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, and
Edward Erhardt, vice president and publisher in New York of
Advertising Age, owned by Crain Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes a month after the Federal Communications
Commission released a study concluding that advertising revenue per
listener for radio stations with black and Spanish-speaking
audiences _ many of them having black and Hispanic owners _ lagged
behind revenue for mainstream stations, even in markets where the
nonmajority stations drew higher ratings. But the study did not
specify why that occurs; the commission has called for additional
research on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   That study was cited frequently at a colloquium on Jan. 18
sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton and several industry
organizations, which was aimed at pressing Madison Avenue to devote
more resources and attention to multicultural consumers and media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity of voices and views is a pillar of our democracy,''
said Vice President Al Gore, who addressed the federation's meeting
by satellite from Washington. ``That is why we must insure that our
airwaves provide opportunity for all Americans and both reflect and
respect the full diversity of the country they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the formation of a federal interagency working
group to examine current advertising practices and their effect on
media outlets and agencies owned by minorities. The task force will
be composed of representatives of the Justice Department, the FCC,
the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the
Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex problem,'' William Kennard, chairman of the
FCC, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``lots of powerful anecdotal evidence'' that some
advertisers and agencies buying commercial time ``are operating on
misinformed stereotypes and cruel judgments about minorities and
what they buy,'' he added. ``And some advertisers are just not
focusing on getting quality research to understand minority
demographics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Kennard said, ``the advertising industry has been very
receptive'' to the initial attempts to address those issues, adding
that ``we're starting to coalesce around some concrete next
steps.''
</P>
<P>
   One such step he identified would be the voluntary code of
conduct to be followed in buying advertising time and space in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   The general principles that Kennard offered as a starting point
for formulating a code included using accurate data to gauge
consumer purchasing patterns, insuring fair access to information
and promoting fair competition for advertising dollars ``among a
wide range of media outlets.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he thought that self-regulation was far more
preferable to government intervention because ``it would be more
efficiently handled, better done by the industry.'' The federation
is one participant in the longtime industry self-regulatory
processes for adjudicating disputes about advertisements and
children's advertising, along with the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the
Association of National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the agency association also disdains government
regulation, that organization considers a code ``neither feasible
nor helpful,'' according to a memo sent to members on Feb. 4 by O.
Burtch Drake, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC report is right on at least two points,'' the memo
stated. ``Minority radio broadcasters are getting less revenue per
listener and the issue needs more study to determine why.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over ``advertiser and agency bias against the
minority media has recently become a political issue,'' according
to the memo, a copy of which was provided by the agency
association, ``threatening to damage the reputation of the
advertising industry in general and the media buying practices of
advertising agencies in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus far, the dialogue has been cordial and productive,'' the
memo continued. ``However, it is important that advertising agency
and media management put these matters high on their `must solve'
list'' _ along with clients, because ``progress on these issues
must involve advertisers as well as their agency partners.''

RODMAN CIRCUS COMES TO TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to the usual nose and ear rings, goofy hat, weird
clothes, bizarre necklace, toadying entourage and fawning female
admirer this time it was actually his wife, Carmen Electra Dennis
Rodman Monday pulled a new trick from his freak show repertoire of
sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   Tears.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, Rodman, reacting to being accused of selfishness by
the media at a late morning press conference at the Planet
Hollywood in Beverly Hills, actually began to weep in what was
either a sincere display of emotion or a contrived bit of
play-acting calculated to boost his cinematic career.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what the reaction of Jerry West was several hundred
miles away in Las Vegas he was there on a scouting expedition but
it wouldn't have surprised me if West, too, began crying when
Rodman announced it was a certainty he would be signing with the
Lakers Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The executive vice president of basketball operations for the
Lakers wants Rodman to join his team about as much as he wants
Shaquille O'Neal to miss free throws, but he has no choice in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Del Harris, who probably also broke out in tears
when it became painfully clear that he soon will be coaching the
tattoo-covered, kaleidoscopic-hairstyled, party-crazed,
gambling-addicted, rebounding-obsessed oddity who's sort of a
hybrid between Howard Stern and Hulk Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only person I know rejoicing in the Laker
organization at the thought of Dennis Rodman actually becoming a
part of it is none other than Jerry Buss, the only person who
really counts.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mr. Buss happens to own the team.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the driving inspiration being the signing of Rodman,
a seven-time NBA rebounding champion who's been on five
title-winning teams, including the past three seasons with the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Buss, a drinker, gambler and notorious skirt chaser in his own
right, admits part of the reason he's so enamored with Rodman is
that he relates so well to him.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who saw the two fun-loving men downing kamikazes last
Friday evening after the Laker-San Antonio match at the Forum could
understand Buss' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the second time in two years, Buss has chosen to
ignore the advice of West, who understandably views the 37-year-old
Rodman as an annoying nuisance capable of disrupting a young Laker
team with his well-chronicled shenanigans that are a part of his
persona.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that early last season West had a trade worked
out with the Sacramento Kings, wherein the Lakers would have
received the All-Star guard, Mitch Richmond, for Eddie Jones only
for Buss to nix the transaction in what, in retrospect, was a
terrible miscalculation by Buss.
</P>
<P>
   There is also speculation among Laker insiders that West would
have liked to have made a coaching change in the off-season, but
once again Buss disagreed with West and prevented him from dumping
Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in their 20-year working relationship when
Jerry Buss always ultimately deferred to West's opinion, as he did
in 1986 when Buss was set to trade James Worthy to the Dallas
Mavericks for Mark Aguirre and the drafting rights to Roy Tarpley
only to pull the deal off the table when West threatened to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West won't threaten to resign over Buss' latest personnel
brainstorm West just last summer signed a four year, $16-million
contract extension but it's not a coincidence that he's been
keeping discreetly out of view during Buss' passionate pursuit of
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   He's not happy about it, and even Dennis Rodman himself admits
he's not sure he will be warmly welcomed by the Laker players when
he starts performing for the team, which might be as soon as
Thursday against the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I discover I'm not wanted, I'll leave,'' said Rodman. ``I
think I can help this team. I have the experience of playing on
winning teams. This team needs a guy who can get rebounds, and I'm
that guy. But if I'm not wanted, I'll leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman was quintessential Dennis Rodman during the
30-minute session, in which there were almost as many members of
the tabloid press present as there were of the mainstream press.
</P>
<P>
   He told of a sexual act performed on him by his pint-sized wife,
much to the laughter of the crowd, as cameras whirred and sound
bites faced FCC monitoring. Not to be out-done, Carmen Electra
stepped up to the podium and said Rodman had performed the same act
on her, which also drew guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha, ha.
</P>
<P>
   Real funny.
</P>
<P>
   Real, nice, role model stuff, more fodder for the deviancy down
of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman argued with sportswriters who had the temerity to ask why
he would call a press conference if he hadn't yet signed his name
on a Laker contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make a big spectacle out of all this,'' he
said with a straight face, at least as straight as a guy can keep
it with rings sticking out of both nostrils. ``Can you imagine what
kind of zoo it would be if we held a press conference before a
Laker game?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman kept insisting he wasn't playing for the salary-cap
restricted money that Jerry Buss plans to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be making only $495,000,'' he said. ``And after
taxes, it'll be about $200,000. I'm playing for the people. I'm
playing because I'm bored and need something to do. I'm playing
because I feel I can help the Lakers win a world title.''
</P>
<P>
   The tears began streaming down Rodman's eyes that were covered
by sunglasses after a lady newscaster accused him of being selfish
for dragging out the negotiations with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say I've been selfish?'' he asked rhetorically, as
he was being consoled by his sister and his newest Hollywood agent
stooge. ``I'm giving $150,000 of my salary this year to charity.
I've given more than $4 million to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on for a few more emotional moments and then, as if on
cue, his tears suddenly disappeared and he and his hangers-on made
a briskly theatrical exit.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if Dennis Rodman was honestly upset, or if he was
auditioning to play Madonna's boyfriend in a remake of ``Love
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   All I know is that Dennis Rodman is one whacked-out character
who's going to create a lot of chaos with the Lakers, and perhaps
grab a few rebounds, too.
</P>
<P>
   And I also know that Jerry Buss and Jerry West, once so in tune
with each other when the Lakers were the most envied franchise in
the NBA, no longer are on the same wave length as the Lakers move
into dangerous terrain with the coming of Dennis Rodman.

ADVANCES TREAT CANCER OF THE CERVIX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Patients with advanced cervical cancer who are treated
with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may increase their
chances of survival by as much as 50 percent, according to studies
by a local hospital and four others around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are considered so significant that the National
Cancer Institute, which sponsored the studies, on Monday issued a
``clinical announcement'' urging cancer specialists to consider
adding chemotherapy to radiation in the treatment of advanced
cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first fundamental advance in the treatment of
cervical cancer in more than 40 years,'' said Dr. Mitchell Morris,
the oncologist who directed the Houston study at the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have the data, it is vital to make chemotherapy a
part of standard care for women with advanced cervical cancer.
Every day that we wait to make it a part of treatment fewer women
have the opportunity to benefit,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with
cervical cancer annually, one-third of whom die because present
treatments have been ineffective against advanced forms of the
disease, Morris told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When diagnosed early, the prognosis is generally good for women
with cervical cancer. But the outlook for patients with advanced
cervical cancer _ normally treated with radical surgery or
radiation alone _ has been less hopeful if the cancer spreads,
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a patient experiences symptoms _ abnormal bleeding,
a discharge or pelvic pain _ the tumor may be quite large.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year survival rate for women with advanced cervical
cancer is 58 percent for those who receive the traditional
radiation-only therapy, compared with 73 percent for women who
receive radiation and chemotherapy simultaneously, according to the
Houston study.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston study followed patients from two to eight years _
195 women were given chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and 193
women were given radiation alone.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the women on the combination therapy received
radiation five days a week, chemotherapy with the drugs cisplatin
and 5-flourouracil and radioactive implants that remain within the
body for 48 hours at a time. The therapy regimen lasted about eight
to 8 1/2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The study revealed that the disease-free survival rates were 66
percent &UR;  &LR; for patients who were given both chemotherapy and
radiation and 40 percent for those receiving only radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the chemo-radiation combination may work because the
chemotherapy drugs are ``sensitizers'' that increase the
sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation, making them easier to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   The chemotherapy drugs also might wipe out cancer deposits too
small to detect at the time of treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Williams was a 47-year-old mother with three children at
home when she became the second patient to enter the study in 1990.
She said she was scared to undergo chemotherapy because of the side
effects, but experienced little nausea and minimal hair loss.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer-free for eight years, Williams now believes that the
combination therapy was a miracle cure.
</P>
<P>
   But while she and fellow patient Lizzet Escoto hope others will
follow their treatment, they warned against skipping annual Pap
smears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let other things get in the way,'' Williams advised.
</P>
<P>
   Escoto, 39, said she had not had a Pap smear in years and
experienced heavy bleeding for five months before visiting a
doctor. ``I thought I was going through menopause,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of widespread screening, the incidence of cervical
cancer has dropped in the United States by half since the 1970s.
The Pap smear test is 90 percent effective in detecting the
disease, even before symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   But in countries where screening is inadequate, the death rate
is high. Morris said most of the cancer deaths among Mexican women
are attributed to cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the National Cancer Institute funded five studies aimed
at studying the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. The studies
were conducted primarily at M.D. Anderson, Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis, New York University and the State
University of New York Health Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on three of the studies will be published in the April
15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine; they also have
been posted on the Journal's Web site (www.nejm.org).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Eifel, who also worked on the Houston study, said
researchers are testing similar combinations on cancers of the head
and neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major milestone in the treatment of this disease,''
Morris said. ``The use of chemo-radiation for women with cervical
cancer will have a tremendous impact and save thousands of lives
every year.''

 &HT;    Words of Jasper killing suspect speak loudly, despite refusal to
testify
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The white supremacist accused of dragging a
black man to death chose not to testify in his trial, but jurors
heard his words anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made history and shall die proudly remembered if need
be,'' John William ``Bill'' King boasted in a jailhouse letter
after his arrest for the shocking death of James Byrd Jr. last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter read in court Monday, King said his sandals
probably were stained with the black man's blood. But, he wrote,
``We'll know how to handle those things by the time we go to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   King's lawyers handled things by putting on a defense that
lasted just under an hour and included only three witnesses _ one
foul-mouthed convict and two acquaintances who acknowledged King
has a strong disliking for black people.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will begin deliberations today in a murder that has
jolted America. King, 24, faces the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Even though King did not take the witness stand, his words
reverberated through the Jasper County courtroom during the
weeklong trial. King spoke loud and clear through his prolific
writings _ letters to friends and newspapers, dogma about white
supremacy, poetry, and, even, graffiti found scratched on the metal
door of his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   King's writings, introduced as evidence by prosecutors, espouse
survival of the Aryan race, white pride, death to race traitors,
and Ku Klux Klan principles.
</P>
<P>
   After King's self-incriminating jailhouse letter was given to
the jury Monday, Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray
called the document ``pretty close to a confession.''
</P>
<P>
   The last horrifying moments of Byrd's life were reviewed in
graphic detail Monday, prompting the murder victim's eldest
daughter to leave the courtroom. Other family members wiped their
eyes, and the murder defendant's father left the courtroom
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 silent minutes, the jury and 17 rows of courtroom
spectators were transported via movie screen to the long, winding
road where Byrd was dragged behind a pickup truck until he was
beheaded. Prosecutors played a videotape shot from a police car
that drove down the rural Jasper road marked with dozens of orange
circles where Byrd's personal items and body parts were found. The
last scene showed the stained spot in the road where Byrd's
shredded torso was dumped.
</P>
<P>
   One woman on the jury removed her glasses and wiped her eyes
with a tissue during the video. The somber mood was enhanced by the
darkened courtroom; the wood shutters had been drawn and cardboard
had been placed over some of the stained-glass windows for the
screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment today,'' said Clara Taylor, one of Byrd's sisters,
who sat with a stunned look on her face for several minutes after
the film was over and the judge declared a 20-minute recess.
</P>
<P>
   Before watching the video, the jury of 11 whites and one
African-American was told by a forensic pathologist that Byrd was
alive when he was dragged down the rural blacktop. The timing of
Byrd's death is crucial for prosecutors because they must prove
Byrd was kidnapped before he was killed in order to win a capital
murder conviction against King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my opinion that, while being dragged, Mr. Byrd was
conscious and attempting to relieve the pain and injuries that he
was receiving,'' said Dr. Tommy Brown of Port Arthur, who performed
the autopsy on Byrd last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd struggled to stay on his elbows and shift from side to side
until his body slammed into a concrete drain pipe opening, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was alive when the head, the right arm and shoulder were
separated'' from the torso by the collision with the culvert, Brown
said. ``He had blood pressure and had a heartbeat at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pathologist testified, each member of the jury followed
along with a notebook of 14 color photographs of Byrd's battered
body.
</P>
<P>
   King showed no emotion Monday except for a brief smile exchanged
with the first defense witness, a tattoo artist in state prison who
winked at King as he sat down in the witness box.
</P>
<P>
   John ``Big Moe'' Mosley, who is serving time for burglary and
sexual assault, gave King some of the tattoos that cover much of
his body. He said King got tattooed to send a message that he would
fight to protect himself from black inmates who preyed on white
prisoners of small stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't fight, you got to give them your momma's money
and give them sexual favors,'' Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   The other defense witnesses, a friend and a former employer,
said King did not use racial slurs in public, display racial
animosity on the job or try to recruit them into a gang. But the
friend, Gilbert Cunningham, told the FBI earlier that King was a
proud white supremacist. The former employer, Dennis Symmack, who
hired King for construction work, acknowledged under
cross-examination that King was intensely bitter toward blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys have tried to portray King as a young man
whose attitudes toward blacks changed dramatically in prison, where
he felt vulnerable as a 5-foot 7-inch, 140-pound white man.
</P>
<P>
   King turned to the Knights of the White Confederacy gang in
prison as a defense, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors contend King is a hate-filled racist and planned
an attack on a black person as a high-profile feat to gain
credibility for a white supremacy gang he was forming in Jasper
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his arrest in Byrd's killing, King did not stop
promoting racism, evidence introduced Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
   Law officers found that King had scratched some graffiti in his
Jasper jail cell: a KKK symbol, the words ``White Pride,'' and a
message for his friend whose pickup allegedly was used in Byrd's
dragging death: ``Shawn Berry is a ... traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry initially cooperated with law enforcement officials. He
told them he stood by in fear while King and Brewer beat Byrd and
chained him to the pickup and began dragging him. Authorities say
Berry lied, however, and allege he was an active participant in
Byrd's murder.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES ACQUIRES SUNDSTRAND
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Technologies Corp., makers of Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet
engines, announced the $4 billion acquistion Monday of the
Sundstrand Corp., a maker of internal systems for airplanes, in a
deal that would enable United Technologies to provide airplane
makers with a broader array of aeronautics wares to buy. The deal
continues a consolidation wave sweeping the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   The half-cash, half-stock deal would give Sundstrand
shareholders a minimum of $70 a share, or a 21 percent premium
above Sundstrand's closing price of $58 a share on Friday. Monday,
Sundstand's shares rose $10.25 to close at $68.25. The deal would
give Sundstrand shareholders $35 in cash and a 0.279 share of
United Technologies stock.
</P>
<P>
   United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., would also assume
around $400 million in Sundstrand debt. Under terms of the deal,
Sundstrand, located in Rockville, Ill., would be folded into United
Technologies' Hamilton Standard division and renamed Hamilton
Sundstrand. United Technologies, with $25.7 billion in sales, makes
everything from Otis elevators to Carrier air conditioners to
Sikorsky helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrand, with $2 billion in sales, is also a diversified
manufacturer, but derives about 60 percent of its business from
supplying a variety of equipment to airplane makers like the Boeing
Co. and Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal makes a lot of sense and means that there will be
few planes that go off the ground that United Technologies won't be
able to supply with engineers and component parts,'' said David
Leibowitz, an analyst with Burnham &AMP; Co. ``And this isn't just
Boeing, but private aircraft on up. It means they will be able to
sell equipment and engines to virtually anything that takes off
into the skies.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said
the Sundstrand acquisition would help improve the operation of
United Technologies' Hamilton Standard subsidiary, which he
described as a ``poor performer.'' That subsidiary makes such
things as propellers and environmental systems for aircraft. ``The
combination with similar types of products will enable United
Technologies to give a more systematic approach to customers, it
should help eliminate about 3 to 5 percent of costs between the two
companies and improve margins,'' said Mr. Nisbet. In making jet
engines, United Technology's competes directly with Rolls Royce and
General Electric. ``This will bring a lot more products in the
aerospace and industrial area for United Technologies to get
into,'' said Nisbet.
</P>
<P>
   George David , the chief executive of United Technologies, said,
``This acquisition reinforces our long-stated strategy of
augmenting UTC's world class aerospace and commercial franchises.''
Robert Jenkins, Sundstrand's chief executive, will become the chief
executive of the Hamilton Sundstrand Aerospace division.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rapidly changing nature of our industry, we firmly
believe that United Technologies is an excellent strategic fit for
Sundstrand,'' said Jenkins. ``We have a highly similar culture and
operating philosophy.'' Sundstrand makes electrical, mechanical and
power systems for commercial aircraft including the Boeing 737, the
Airbus A320 and A340 and such general aircraft as the Gulfstream V.
United Technologies rose $1.0625 Monday to $126.50.

NBA IS NOW THE LEAGUE THAT CAN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vin Baker, the Seattle SuperSonics' all-star forward and a 62
percent free-throw shooter, missed his first 18 attempts this
season. After the 19th shot rattled round the rim and in during the
seventh game of the season, Baker felt he had rid himself of an
enormous burden.
</P>
<P>
   That a National Basketball Association player would be delighted
at making the easiest shot in the game may seem ridiculous to most
fans, but it is becoming the way of life in the post-lockout NBA,
the league that can't shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   Overall scoring has been declining each season in the 1990s, but
new marks for offensive futility are being set in this shortened
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're not scoring a bunch of points, are we?'' said a
deadpan Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice president for
basketball operations. ``Wait a month or so to gauge where we
really are. It's still early.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Thorn, who was in charge of implementing four rule
changes before the 1997-98 season that were aimed at improving the
overall quality of play (read: kick-starting stagnant offenses),
has to be concerned after two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are averaging 90.9 points a game, down from 95.6 last
season. Ten teams are averaging fewer than 90 points, and only one
_ the Sacramento Kings _ is averaging more than 100. What is more,
three teams last week set regular-season franchise scoring lows,
including one of the NBA's best passing teams, the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Pistons set franchise lows twice recently, scoring
69 points in a loss to the New York Knicks and then 64 on Sunday in
a loss to San Antonio. And the Philadelphia 76ers, featuring the
electrifying guard Allen Iverson, could not reach 70 points in
back-to-back games last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the problem more evident than at Madison Square
Garden, where the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls _ the NBA's two
lowest-scoring teams _ got together for an Eastern Conference
scrum. The Knicks won a horrendous display of basketball, 79-63,
holding the Bulls to a franchise-tying low.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time in nine games that New York had held an
opponent to fewer than 70 points. Since the inception of the shot
clock in 1954, the Knicks had accomplished that feat four times
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   Either there is some incredible defense being played or NBA
players have suddenly become more proficient at chipping paint off
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the long layoff, which leads to lack of skills and
conditioning and the compressed schedule, which means more
fatigue,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Also, too, the fact
that defense is always ahead of offense in every sport has an
effect. I think scoring will pick up. It's just a matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit seems to be the labor dispute, which forced the
league and the players union to cram 50 games into 89 days _ and
three games into three nights on some occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The abbreviated two-week training camp coupled with major roster
changes have added to the poor quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   Nettlesome injuries, too, have plagued the league, with prolific
scorers like Charles Barkley and Glen Rice sidelined for at least
another few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's 71-56 loss to Seattle last Tuesday was clearly the result
of a tired and sore team unable to put the ball in the basket.
Coming off an overtime victory at home the night before, the
veteran Jazz traveled to Seattle for its fourth game in six nights
without the banged-up starting guard Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was one of several players who showed up to training camp
15 pounds overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are indicative of chemistry problems; fans can hardly
make out who the new-look Bulls are without a program.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are simply shooting worse than they were last season, too.
Field-goal percentage is down nearly 3 percentage points over all,
from 45 percent last season to 42.6 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the trend in the league _ notwithstanding that this
season is an aberration _ is that there are fewer and fewer shots,
and fewer and fewer points scored,'' Thorn said. ``I think it says
a lot about the caliber of defenses. There aren't many teams that
get shots off in the early part of the shot clock. Teams are
usually running patterns that take between 16, 17 and 24 seconds.
Consequently, there aren't as many shots taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a possession game,'' Thorn added. ``Coaches are
caught up in not wanting turnovers: `Don't push it up the floor.
Get the best shot you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy does not totally agree, contending that teams want to
run more but they simply cannot. Two years ago, he was also a harsh
critic of new rules, saying at the time, ``Unfortunately in the NBA
at this point, we're trying to make up rules to hide deficiencies
of players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how hard it is to score in a halfcourt offense, and
they'd like to get easy baskets,'' he said Monday. ``But people are
putting two and three players back in transition. The good teams
aren't going to let you run the ball consistently. They're going to
get back and make you play halfcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, players and league officials agree that improved
defense has helped kill the free-flowing offenses that once
proliferated the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you could walk the ball up the court and throw
it into the post,'' Thorn said. ``Not anymore. Whatever you want to
say about players today, teams are better defensively.'' &QL;

A LATIN BLOC ASKS U.S. AND EUROPE TO EASE TRADE BARRIERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ With recession and the steep fall in
the Brazilian currency straining their domestic industries, leaders
of Mercosur, the Brazilian-led South American customs union,
pledged Monday to coordinate their countries' economic policies and
called upon Europe and the United States to lower trade barriers to
agricultural imports from South America.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the first meeting of the Mercosur-European Union
Business Forum here on Sunday night, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso of Brazil said that Mercosur would not pull back from its
goal of regional integration. As recessions are already under way
or threatening in several Mercosur countries, the group seems to be
turning its sights to outside markets, becoming more a trading bloc
than the customs union it has been until now. In addition to
Brazil, Mercosur includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with
Chile and Bolivia as associate members _ nations in a region called
the Southern Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot expect an inexhaustible readiness on the part of
developing countries to lower their industrial tariffs while
barriers remain high'' to the entry of our products, Cardoso told
the gathering of European and South American executives. ``This
discrimination is unjust and must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke after meeting with his Mercosur partners here in what
had been billed as the first talks between the heads of government
since the Brazilian currency, the real, was devalued in January.
But President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, citing a respiratory
infection, did not appear, sending Foreign Minister Guido di Tella
in his place.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of European and Latin American executives had been
scheduled long before the Brazilian economy hit its deepest
troubles, marked by a 60 percent slide in its currency, to 1.96
reais to the dollar from 1.22, and interest rates above 40 percent.
But the difficulties that have hit the region full force appeared
to shape the meeting's agenda and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's travails have sent tremors through the trading group.
Argentina is struggling to maintain the value of its peso, which is
linked to the dollar, though its manufacturers fear that a flood of
cheap Brazilian imports will cripple its industries. So far,
two-party agreements have kept some Brazilian producers from
inundating Argentina and other Mercosur nations. But such restraint
has also increased the pressure to reach markets outside the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Jorge, a spokesman for Volkswagen do BrasilVolkswagen,
said the company had reduced exports to Argentina, where auto
production has already fallen 50 percent. But with 13 factories in
Brazil struggling against falling domestic demand, he said, it will
focus on larger markets in Mexico, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the Argentine market is not the fundamental question
for Brazilian companies,'' said Jorge, who is also vice president
of the Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo. ``We have to gain
other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso said that from 1990 to 1996, European Union exports to
Mercosur countries nearly quadrupled, to $23 billion from $6
billion, while Mercosur's sales to Europe rose only 25 percent, to
$18 billion from $14.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said that technical and health barriers were increasingly
hindering access to Europe and the United States for South American
farm products. ``In many of these requirements, a disguised
protectionism can be perceived,'' Cardoso said. He also complained
that industrial nations shower agribusinesses in their countries
with more than $160 billion in subsidies, making it hard for
developing countries to compete in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States bars some farm products from Brazil. Newcastle
disease keeps out chickens, while foot-and-mouth disease has
excluded fresh and frozen beef. Brazilian officials say they have
wiped out hoof-and-mouth disease in three states, but the
Department of Agriculture has not certified the states as free of
the cattle disease, a United States Embassy spokesman said. Brazil
exports frozen orange juice concentrate to the United States,
paying a tariff around 8 cents a quart.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Donizetti Beraldo, chief of the foreign trade department
at the Brazilian National Federation of Agriculture, said the
European Union and the United States bought roughly 55 percent of
Brazil's $20 billion a year in farm exports but that such trade
could double if quotas were relaxed and domestic subsidies removed.

   Ending four weeks of speculation that it might be bought by
United Airlines or a larger rival, America West Airlines said
Monday that it had called off talks with other airlines and was
committed to going it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors unanimously concluded that America
West's shareholders, employees and the communities we operate in
will be better served by a growing, profitable and independent
company,'' William Franke, chairman and chief executive of America
West Holdings, the airline's parent, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the airline's headquarters in Tempe, Ariz., cheered
when they heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as America West, the country's
ninth-largest airline, was considering an offer from United, the
world's largest carrier. That turned out to be the only credible
bid after Delta Air Lines and American Airlines backed away from
buying it, according to several executives at the airlines who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But a United deal had numerous stumbling blocks. It hinged on
the approval of the unions representing United's pilots and
mechanics, each of which owns substantial stakes in the parent UAL
Corp. No deal could have been consummated unless at least one of
the unions' two representatives on UAL's board of directors
approved.
</P>
<P>
   United and America West would have also faced strong opposition
in Washington, where the Justice Department's antitrust division
has taken a hard line on airline consolidation, as have several
influential lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Continental Airlines, which has a lucrative partnership
with America West and a right of first refusal to buy stock
representing 49 percent of shareholders' voting rights, would have
also tried to derail a deal with United.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business it is extremely difficult to find a
transaction that isn't highly conditioned,'' Franke said in an
interview Monday. ``At least for the foreseeable future, the odds
are overwhelming that the company will pursue an independent
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   With about $2 billion in revenue, America West serves 100 cities
from hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. Though it was
profitable last year, it has not enjoyed the same financial success
as other airlines and it has been plagued by operational mishaps
and poor relations with its labor unions. The company and its
flight attendants are currently in a 30-day cooling-off period
mandated by federal mediators before the flight attendants are
permitted to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Franke said that with its low cost structure and strong balance
sheet, America West had a bright future. Now that the airline was
off the block he was eager to negotiate a contract with the flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   America West made its announcement after the close of the stock
market Monday. Its stock was down $1.375 a share, closing at
$21.375, while UAL shares rose $2.50 to close at $62.

DRIVING AT AGE 70 AND OVER  
 BUGS IN THE CARIBBEAN  
 BARGING IN BELGIUM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL FREIREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)My wife and I are in our early 70s and are planning
a trip to Ireland and Wales. A friend cautioned us about
restrictions that some car rental companies have on providing cars
for septuagenarians. Are we likely to be refused because of our
age? _ Stanley Myers, Blue Hill, Maine.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Because age restrictions vary from one company to another,
there is a chance you could be rejected. To avoid having a monkey
wrench thrown into your plans at the last minute, it's best to tell
your car rental company, travel agent or broker before you leave
your age, especially since limits in the same company may differ.
The reason for the age restriction, the car rental companies say,
is a limit set by insurers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, listed alphabetically, are the policies of major car
rental companies and brokers. Brokers use cars provided by several
companies and can direct you to a company that will accept a driver
your age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AutoEurope, (800) 223-5555. The suppliers in Ireland are Hertz,
with an upper age limit of 79, and Europcar, which has a maximum of
75. (The limit for Hertz cars is, indeed, higher than if rented
directly from Hertz.) In Wales the suppliers are Europcar, which
has a limit of 69, and Avis, which has no limit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avis, (800) 331-1212. In Ireland, drivers from 66 to 74 years
old can rent the company's less expensive cars, from, say, a Nissan
Micro to a midsize automatic like a Toyota Carina; age 74 is the
maximum. In Wales, there is no age restriction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budget, (800) 527-0700, has corporate and licensee owners, all
under the name Budget, with varying age limits. In Ireland, the
maximum ranges from 75 to 80 and in Wales from 65 to 70. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hertz, (800) 654-3131. In Ireland, the maximum is 74. In Wales,
there is no limit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kemwel Holiday, a broker, uses two suppliers in Ireland:
Eurodollar, with a maximum of 70, and Sixt, with a maximum of 75.
In Wales, the cars come from National/Alamo, which has a maximum of
80.
</P>
<P>
   Thrifty, (800) 367-2277. In Ireland and Wales, the oldest a
driver can be is 70. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Because we were being eaten alive by bugs, my
husband and I stopped going to Guadeloupe after a January vacation
about 15 years ago. My husband was intensely allergic, and none of
the usual bug repellents seemed to have any effect. Are there new,
more effective repellents? Or are there other islands where we
would encounter no bug problems? _ Carolyn W. Sanger, Potomac,
Md.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, the high season in the Caribbean, generally from
around December to mid-March or so, is when one is least likely to
encounter bugs. And the problem is hardly limited to Guadeloupe
since the same species of bugs are common throughout the coastal
tropics of the Western Hemisphere, according to Dr. Paul Reiter,
chief of the entymology section of the dengue branch of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in San Juan, P.R.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, there may have been very good reasons you
encountered bugs, which, broadly speaking, includes biting flies.
One is that you were probably out when the bugs do their most
intense biting _ starting 30 to 45 minutes after sunset and
continuing for 30 to 45 minutes. ``At that time, it's best to have
your rum and Coke in a screened place,'' Reiter suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, he said, is that you had the bad luck to be
vacationing after a heavy rainfall and high tides. That is when
some of the most voracious offenders breed in salt marshes and
mangrove swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps smell may also have played a role. Scientists have
found that mosquitoes are attracted to some people by such things
as carbon dioxide and lactic acid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reiter, who has lived in Puerto Rico for a dozen years, offers
these suggestions: Stay out of the way at the wrong time of day;
wear a long-sleeved shirt, which he concedes may be unrealistic for
people on vacation in a warm climate, and apply a repellent
containing DEET, which is widely regarded as the most effective
repellent and which has been used for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As helpful as DEET is, remember that perspiration and swimming
diminish its effectiveness. DEET is available in varying
concentrations. Ten to 35 percent _ with 10 percent being the
maximum for children _ usually suffices. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like information about river or barge
cruising on a trip to include Bruges and to end in Brussels. I read
that a barge called the Rembrandt might offer such a trip. _ G.K.
Bellis, The Woodlands, Texas.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. A number of companies offer the basic barge trip aboard the
Rembrandt, which carries 18 to 20 passengers, plus transportation
to and from Brussels. At least one has a more inclusive package.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stops are Bruges, for a visit to the market square,
the Basilica of the Holy Blood (parts of which date from the 12th
and 15th centuries) and the Memling Museum; Oudenaarde, to see
14th-century tapestries; Ghent, to see the St. Bavo Cathedral and
``The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb'' by Jan and Hubert van Eyck,
and Antwerp, to visit the diamond center and the Rubens House.
Crossing into the Netherlands, the barge stops at the fortress town
of Willemstad; Gouda, for visits to St. John's Cathedral and a
cheese shop, and Terneuzen.
</P>
<P>
   Note that dates of availability may change and that the
itinerary runs from Bruges to Terneuzen and sometimes the reverse.
Brussels is about an hour's drive from Bruges and about 90 minutes
from Terneuzen.
</P>
<P>
   A package that includes two nights in Brussels at the start plus
a half-day tour of Brussels led by an expert is available from IST
Cultural Tours, 225 West 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10122; (800)
833-2111 or (212) 563-1202. In addition, the expert provides
commentary, from a historical or architectural perspective, on the
day of arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The cost between May 30 and Aug. 1 is $1,575, based on double
occupancy. This price and the one below include all meals aboard
the barge and all admissions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies offering the barge component, at $1,690 a
person, for double occupancy, are these: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 65023;
(800) 323-7308 or (630) 954-2944. &QL;

FLIERS' AWARDS: SOME NEW MATH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few big new developments make this a good time to look again
at some of the loyalty programs in the world of travel. Perhaps I
should have looked sooner; the report on my United Mileage Plus
program for December noted that 4,842 miles had expired with the
old year.
</P>
<P>
   People who scatter their travel among airlines and hotels based
on convenience and price often suffer these setbacks. But some new
programs involve miles or points that are evergreen or permit
earning miles for one line while flying another. These may get us
bits-and-pieces people back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   A major new frequent guest program was announced by Starwood
Hotels and Resorts. If Starwood is not a household word, this is
because it is a real estate investment trust, with headquarters in
White Plains, N.Y., and with no hotel bearing its own name. It owns
Sheraton and Westin and other midpriced and upscale hotels and
resorts: Four Points, Caesars and W hotels, as well as the Luxury
Collection, which includes the St. Regis brand. Starwood is now
promoting, reshuffling and renaming many of the 650 hotels it has
recently acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sternlicht, chairman of Starwood, said the Preferred Guest
program was designed to be easy to understand. Points are awarded
for all money spent in participating properties _ 550 of the 650.
(The program excludes some properties the trust has taken over
bearing other brand names _ Marriott, for example _ that have
competing programs.)
</P>
<P>
   New members get two points for every dollar spent. After 10
stays in a year, the member gets three points for every dollar. And
it goes up from there.
</P>
<P>
   Points do not expire with age if the member stays in a
participating hotel once a year. There are no blackout dates and no
capacity controls, Sternlicht said: a hotel will give its last
available room to someone using points.
</P>
<P>
   The Starwood program is not for budget travelers. Hoyt H.
Harper, the company's vice president for marketing programs, said
that a weekend hotel night at the ``mid-scale'' Four Points in Fort
Walton Beach, Fla., would require 2,000 points; during the week,
3,000. On the high end, the Princeville Hotel on Kauai, Hawaii,
would cost 10,000 points a night, weekday or weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The program has links to 21 airlines. Points transfer at one
point to one mile on Air France, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines,
Alitalia, American, America West, Ansett Australia, Asiana,
Canadian, Cathay Pacific, Continental, Delta, Eva Air, Japan
Airlines, KLM, Northwest, Qantas, Saudi Arabian, Thai Airways,
United and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Those who reserve at any hotel in the program can ask to sign up
when the reservation is made. Information is also available on the
Web site: www.preferredguest.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, five airlines linked their marketing programs:
American, British Airways, Canadian, Cathay Pacific and Qantas
Airways. Travelers flying on most flights on any of these airlines
can earn points through the program, called One World, on any other
line, and can also redeem points interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   Because of variations in names for elite levels of the lines'
programs, One World is establishing its own categories, emerald,
sapphire and ruby, which will be indicated on the cards. This will
enable employees to know what privileges a member of another line's
plan is entitled to. The cards will be jointly marked for the
particular airline program and One World.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is one catch: direct trans-Atlantic flights on British
Airways and American Airlines are not interchangeable for accruing
points or spending them. These two lines have been pressing
regulators for a separate, closer alliance; meantime, a spokesman
said, they are prevented by government rules from exchanging
mileage across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The pooling of frequent flier awards was pioneered by the Star
Alliance, set up in 1997 by United, Lufthansa, Air Canada,
Scandinavian and Thai Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The individual airlines maintain their separate rules on mileage
expiration and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Other two-way alliances have been set up, with varying rules.
Northwest and Continental linked their programs last year, and as
of March 1, miles from one line may be used to get a ticket on the
other, although they cannot be pooled.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, both airlines have turned back the clock a little,
offering round-trip domestic tickets for 20,000 miles in the low
season, September to May, instead of the 25,000 miles needed in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, in January, also set up a 20,000-mile award for
travel within the United States and Canada in the low season, in
this case between Sept. 15 and the end of February. The line added
two hitches at the same time: Saturday-night stays will be required
for domestic or Canadian trips on reservations made after March 31
and on trips after Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January 2000, the Dividend Miles will expire within
three calendar years if the member does not fly on US Airways in
that period. Miles earned before then will not expire.
</P>
<P>
   Will the increase in alliances and the lowering of some mileage
levels make the pressure for reward seats worse than it already is?
Randy Petersen, editor of the magazine Inside Flyer, says
redemptions were up 20 percent last year, the biggest increase on
record: Nothing above a 9 percent rise had been seen before, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen said the growth was probably related more to the
booming economy than to increasing friendliness on the part of the
airlines. In 1999, he sees a moderate rise in difficulty in getting
certain award trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some trips, there will never be enough seats,'' he said.
``Tel Aviv is the toughest of all. Call at two minutes past
midnight a year in advance, and the seats went to people who called
at one minute past.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Express Membership Rewards program, formerly
Membership Miles, added some new partners this month, mostly
stores. Points may be exchanged for purchases or gift certificates
at Borders Books, Avis Rent a Car, Cathay Pacific Airways,
Samsonite stores, the Sharper Image and Foot Locker, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines where American Express Membership Rewards points
may be used to obtain tickets, or to ``top off'' a balance too
small for a ticket or an upgrade, are Delta, US Airways,
Continental, Southwest, TWA, Hawaiian, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay
Pacific, Korean Air, Aeromexico, El Al, Sabena and Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Membership Rewards is the double dip: If you charge
an airline ticket on the American Express card, you get the reward
points and also the miles when you fly the trip. These points do
not expire, but the downside comes if you fail to pay your American
Express bill on time: your Membership Rewards points are docked for
that month. However, a phone call to (800) 297-3276 and a payment
of $15 will restore a month's lost points.

8 ARE ARRESTED IN CITY HALL PROTEST ON POLICE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eight protesters were arrested near City Hall Monday
when they chained themselves together to block traffic on lower
Broadway during an angry demonstration over the police shooting of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were the first to be arrested at a demonstration
over the shooting, which has made rallies against police brutality
nearly a daily rite. Four officers killed Diallo, an unarmed
22-year-old street peddler from Guinea, in a barrage of 41 bullets
on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting ``stop killer cops,'' the demonstrators separated from
a larger rally of several hundred people and lay down on Broadway,
just outside the City Hall fences, their bodies chained together at
the arms.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on Broadway was blocked for about 15 minutes until
police officers stepped forward to move the demonstrators. The
crowd chanted, ``We're watching you,'' as officers carried the
demonstrators to a nearby police van.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators _ six women and two men _ were later charged
with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers who addressed the crowd from a flatbed truck
parked on the sidewalk denounced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who they
said had set a tone that tolerates police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has consistently defended his record on police
misconduct and has presented statistics that show fatal shootings
by the police last year were the lowest in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the eight people who chained themselves together,''
said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor, ``it was a
peaceful, relatively uneventful and small event, so there is
nothing for the mayor to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   As the demonstrators gathered, a Bronx grand jury began its
second week of hearing evidence in the shooting, which occurred in
the vestibule of Diallo's Bronx apartment building. The officers
involved, who were searching for a rapist, have told lawyers that
they mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun when they
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been complicated by the fact that although many in
the neighborhood heard the shots and witnessed their aftermath, no
one so far has come forward who says he or she saw the original
encounter between the police officers and Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of shots and Diallo's unblemished record have
combined to make the shooting a central event for people who
believe that the police routinely disregard the civil rights of
black and Hispanic residents. Diallo was black, and the four
officers are white.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Applewhite, a 58-year-old hospital worker who attended
the City Hall rally, said she had never been to a demonstration
before but felt it was important to add her voice to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this guy put his hand in his pocket to get his keys and he
got killed, what does that mean for the rest of us?'' she asked.

LIGHTNING IS PERFECT FOR WHAT AILS DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ In a slump? Need a lift? For the New Jersey
Devils, the Tampa Bay Lightning showed up on their schedule just in
time.
</P>
<P>
   With left wing Brian Rolston scoring two goals, the Devils broke
a two-game losing streak Monday night and improved the National
Hockey League's best road record with a 3-2 victory over hapless
Tampa Bay in the half-empty Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, just the Devils' fifth in the last 11 games, left
them at 32-20-7 over all and 19-8-1 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had to work much harder for this victory than they
did in last Wednesday's 7-1 demoralization of Tampa Bay, but the
result was the same. The Lightning dropped to 12-41-5, the league's
worst record.
</P>
<P>
   The losers have one victory and one tie to show for their last
13 games, and are now 1-74-7 when trailing after two periods, which
they did Mon night.
</P>
<P>
   A banner commemorating the Lightning's one-game NHL
regular-season attendance record _ 27,227 in 1993 _ hangs from the
Ice Palace rafters, reflecting what used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 3,000 were on hand when Monday night's game started, and
attendance eventually was announced at 8,802 _ the team's
fourth-lowest crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the Devils took a workmanlike approach
and kept enough pressure on to create cracks in Tampa Bay's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Martin Brodeur salvaged what looked for a while like a
game he would rather forget. He allowed two cheap goals, but played
like the all-star he is in the third period, when Tampa Bay
answered the crowd's pleas with spots of impassioned play.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur stopped 26 shots in raising his season's record to
26-17-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils opened the scoring 17 minutes 10 seconds into the
game with their 40th power-play goal of the season. Rolston took a
pass from Bobby Holik on the right side, promptly took the puck to
the middle as if looking to pass, then suddenly whirled and shot.
It was his 16th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning tied the score just 1:44 later on an embarrassing
moment for Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Andrei Skopintsev shot into a crowd from 35 feet, and
center Vincent Lecavalier was given credit for redirecting it,
though video replays seemed inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The slow-moving puck squibbed between Brodeur's legs as he
flailed at it.
</P>
<P>
   Lecavalier further frustrated Brodeur and the Devils 2:20 into
the second period. Devils defenseman Kevin Dean went behind the net
to retrieve a loose puck and shovel it to Brodeur, who swung and
missed on a clearing attempt. Lecavalier was there gleefully to
seize a rare shot at a vacant net.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils drew even at 14:29 of the period and needed just 37
seconds more to recapture the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Lyle Odelein managed to tie the score after receiving
a pass to the middle from left wing Patrick Elias. Odelein quickly
lifted a 12-footer over a pile of fallen players that were blocking
goalie Derek Wilkinson's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the Devils were applying pressure again, and
Rolston gained control of the puck on the right side near the
crease. Wilkinson hadn't moved to shut off Rolston's angle.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston made him pay with a rising shot in the net's right
corner.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for the Devils to hang on, and to be able to
savor Tuesday, when most of the players are planning to play golf
and bask in the sun. &QL;

NEW YORK POLICE SEIZE CARS IN DRUNKEN-DRIVING CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add four grafs to end of original text. No other

 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kicking off a new crackdown on drunken driving in New
York City, police officers seized the cars of three drivers late
Sunday and Monday _ including one from a Staten Island librarian
who had no prior arrests and another from a 57-year-old Queens man
who had a long record of driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures came as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani hinted at how tough
the crackdown might be, saying that even those ultimately acquitted
of drunken driving in criminal court could still face the prospect
of losing their cars through proceedings in civil courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say somebody is acquitted, and it's one of those
acquittals in which the person was guilty, but there is just not
quite enough evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the mayor said.
``That might be a situation in which the car would still be
forfeited.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians promised legal challenges to the new policy,
which is considered among the strictest against drunken driving in
the nation. But the first round of seizures suggested that the city
would not shy away from confiscating the cars of drivers whose
blood-alcohol level was at or above the legal limit, and gave an
early glimpse of what drivers in the city could expect.
</P>
<P>
   In one case that was held up by prosecutors as a model of how
the program could work, police arrested and seized the car of
Francisco Almonte of Corona, Queens, who had been arrested eight
times for drunken driving and was on probation for his last
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   After Almonte, 57, was involved in an accident on Sunday night,
a Breathalyzer test indicated that his blood-alcohol level was
0.19, almost double the legal limit of 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, police arrested 28-year-old Pavel Grinberg of
Staten Island on charges that he was driving while intoxicated,
after officers saw him swerving and following other cars at close
range. A test showed his blood-alcohol level at 0.11, slightly
above the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment Monday, a visibly shaken Grinberg pleaded not
guilty to the charges against him. A Polish immigrant who works in
a public library in Manhattan, he had never been arrested for
drunken driving, and his lawyer, Anthony Chinquee, said the charges
put Grinberg's job and immigration status at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is terrified,'' Chinquee said of his client after the
arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The last car seized, a 1984 Honda, belonged to another Queens
man, Winston Rambharack, who was arrested at 4:05 a.m. Monday.
Police said that Rambharack, 26, was driving erratically along
Sutphin Boulevard, and that a Breathalyzer test showed his
blood-alcohol level to be 0.21, more than twice the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite questions about the severity of the crackdown, the mayor
was already finding some critical support for it. Thomas Gulotta,
the Nassau County, N.Y., executive, said Monday that he planned to
authorize police to seize the vehicles of drunken drivers and sell
them if the driver was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not permit innocent victims to continue to die at the
hands of reckless and irresponsible drunk drivers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Howarth of Mothers Against Drunk Driving expressed support
for the effort, saying, ``We encourage states to explore new ways
like this to get drunk drivers off the road.''
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old Brooklyn man, Juan Valez, was arrested for drunken
driving at about 4 a.m. Monday, but the car he was driving, a 1986
Cadillac, was not seized because it did not belong to him. Police
said they also would not seize cars rented for short periods, but
that they would confiscate cars that were leased.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups said litigation to challenge the seizures
is ``inevitable.'' Norman Siegel, executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, called the crackdown ``excessive,'' and
criticized the mayor for instituting a policy that he said would
pit police officers against New Yorkers just as the city was
grappling with the death of Amadou Diallo, who was killed two weeks
ago in a fusillade of police gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   About 21 other states have similar policies that allow police to
seize the cars of people suspected of drunken driving, and a study
in California has shown that such procedures reduce recidivism
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But most other states do not confiscate cars until after at
least two arrests for drunken driving. New York City's policy
allows for no second chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police should not be in the business of acting as judge,
jury and used car dealer,'' Siegel said, ``which is what happens
when they start seizing cars based on nothing more than
suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, however, seemed undeterred. ``Whatever side of this
debate you are on, there is a very simple way to stay out of this
problem,'' he said at a news conference Monday. ``Do not drink and
get behind the wheel of a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about what would happen to the cars of
people who were acquitted of drunken driving in criminal court,
Giuliani said city officials could pursue the seizure in civil
court. He and Michael Hess, a lawyer for the city, likened the
strategy to that used against O.J. Simpson after his acquittal in
the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury in the civil case obviously thought O.J. Simpson was
responsible, and awarded $33 million to the Goldman family, even
though O.J. had not been convicted criminally beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' Hess said. ``That's the kind of thing that could happen
here.''

UCLA FREE THROWS ARE COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins aren't bad free-throw shooters.
</P>
<P>
   They are historically bad free-throw shooters.
</P>
<P>
   If their current pace holds _ 58.8 percent, last in the
Pacific-10 _ they'll become the first UCLA team in 50 years to
shoot worse than 60 percent from the line.
</P>
<P>
   They miss short, they miss long, they miss right and they miss
left. They shoot rim-rattlers, backboard breakers and air balls.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting 56.5 percent in conference play and haven't
shot better than 65 percent in a game since Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Their best player, guard Baron Davis, has attempted 39 more free
throws than anyone else and is shooting 59.7 percent _ the only
weakness in his string of stellar performances.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's greatest fear is that poor foul shooting will cost it an
NCAA Tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Bruins lost to Oregon State and Stanford in part
because they made a combined 19 of 37 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   It nearly cost them last week against USC, when they made 12 of
26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we went to shoot a free throw, there was a murmur or a
buzz in the crowd,'' assistant coach Steve Spencer said. ``There
isn't a great free throw shooter on this team. We tell them they
need to tinker and adjust because what they're doing isn't
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, who coordinates UCLA's individual workouts, is
frustrated by the foul shooting but has no answer. Some players
have concentration problems, perhaps the result of inexperience.
Others have flaws in their technique. Each situation is different,
and there's only one remedy: practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins shoot 200-250 free throws per day, but so far it
hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good free-throw shooters practice a lot,'' Spencer said.
``They find a rhythm they're comfortable with and replicate until
it becomes muscle memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are repeating some bad habits. (To correct them),
they have to take themselves out of their comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Where they stand: Based on recent power ratings _ 22nd in
Sagarin, 19th in the RPI _ the Bruins probably are dangling between
a No. 4 and 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   They have four games left, against the Washington and Arizona
schools. Four wins likely would vault them into the third-seed
territory. Three wins, and they hold ground. But two losses _ to
Washington and at Arizona, for instance _ may bump them to a No. 6
seed.

`IRON DIRK' GRAHAM RELIEVED OF DUTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was just last week that Chicago Blackhawks coach
Dirk Graham and star forward Tony Amonte engaged in an
expletive-laced blowup during a practice, after which Graham
insisted the whole thing had been some sort of bizarre piece of
performance art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was set up,'' said Graham, upset that day at a newspaper
story suggesting Amonte and Graham (who calls himself ``Iron
Dirk'') could not coexist.
</P>
<P>
   When Amonte was told that Graham had claimed their argument was
staged, he replied, ``If that's what he said, then that's what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Graham was fired, 59 games into his first season, and
replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Lorne Molleken. The
move came at a time when the Blackhawks are at a low point in their
lengthy history, 19 games below .500 for the first time in 42
years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Graham's alleged performance, it began during a drill
when he yelled at Amonte, ``It's the same (expletive) thing that
happened last night and it led to a (expletive) scoring chance (for
Vancouver). How many (expletive) times do I have to (expletive)
tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   Amonte responded, ``For (expletive) sake. Let me create some
(expletive) offense.''
</P>
<P>
   This was at the heart of the matter. Graham wanted his players _
all of them _ to play dump-and-chase hockey. That wasn't Amonte's
game, but Graham was rigid.
</P>
<P>
   There was a night in San Jose when Graham benched Amonte for 15
minutes, and he recently had curtailed his star forward's
power-play time, as well. The morning of the blowup, a columnist in
the Chicago Sun-Times suggested the Blackhawks trade Amonte if
Graham wouldn't let him play his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responsibility is not to Tony Amonte to see he gets 30 or
40 goals,'' Graham responded. ``My responsibility is to this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what had been apparent for some time became
unavoidable: Graham had lost the ear of his players, especially his
best one. Monday, he paid for that with his job.
</P>
<P>
   Them's fightin' words: The Coyotes spent most of last week's 5-1
loss to the Mighty Ducks in Phoenix seeking to avenge Ruslan
Salei's unpenalized stick artistry, which left Mike Stapleton with
a 27-stitch cut early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said the Coyotes took themselves out
of the game by focusing on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   That was not what Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Schoenfeld said. ``Then maybe we're not
finished getting even, even if it costs us another game.''
</P>
<P>
   He then stormed into his office, only to reappear in an instant
to shout, ``Unlike them, we're in a position where we can waste a
few points.''
</P>
<P>
   Using his head: Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock took a puck off the
head during a recent game when he was struck by a clearing pass by
the Stars' Mike Keane. It took 16 stitches to close Hitchcock's
wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he knows what it feels like to be a hockey player,'' Stars
center Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded playoffs? For all those who believe 16 teams in the
playoffs isn't enough, consider Edmonton Oilers general manager
Glen Sather your hero.
</P>
<P>
   Sather said he believes the Stanley Cup playoffs should be
increased from 16 teams to 20, with the top seeds in each
conference receiving a first-round bye. Sather also said the first
round should be best-of-five rather than best-of-seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league's expanded (to 30 teams in two years), but we
haven't expanded the playoff picture,'' Sather said. ``I think it
would help Canadian teams, and there are only six of us, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, three of the teams (Calgary, Vancouver and
Montreal) are out, and (the Oilers) are hanging on. And secondly,
hockey goes to a different level in the playoffs. How many bad
playoff games in round one? Hardly any. Lots of upsets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather's motivation most likely is economic, because postseason
games bring teams badly needed additional revenue. His proposal is
not being studied by the NHL, at least at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a lousy idea, it'll go away,'' Sather said. ``I don't
think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   And the assist goes to ...: Wayne Gretzky had five assists in
the Rangers' victory at Nashville last week, prompting Predators
captain Tom Fitzgerald to say, ``We were just brain dead in our own
end. If you are brain dead against Wayne Gretzky, I mean, he can
set my 4-year-old son up to score if you leave him alone.''

STAR HOUNDS HIT HIGH NOTES FOR SHOT AT COMMERCIAL FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a lot like ``Star Search,'' except some of
the contestants tried to eat the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   And all of the contestants were naked.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner got a chance to appear in a flea commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 1999 Search for North America's Best Singing Pet,
which started its 10-stop tour Monday with a preliminary round in
Pershing Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us so much love and attention, it's nice to give
them some attention back,'' said Heide Karp-Briggs, a professional
clown who sang along with her dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Karp-Briggs' chorale, Moondoggie and Noe, bounded on stage with
all the pent-up energy of a shaken-up can of Pepsi. Her third dog,
Phoebe, had an ``attitude problem'' Monday and sulked off-stage
while the others performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the Shannen Doherty of our dog pack,'' Karp-Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Moondoggie, Noe and eight other canine crooners from Southern
California sang their little hearts out, while their owners made
punny comments about ``pawditions'' and ``fleanominal
purrformances.''
</P>
<P>
   Finalists will be flown to New York in September to compete for
a recording studio session and a chance to appear in an Advantage
flea control advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the 25-foot inflatable flea at one end of the stage
(plus the two guys in brown flea costumes roaming through the
crowd), and Monday's event had all the class of a Hollywood awards
show.
</P>
<P>
   Red carpets. Spotlights. Complimentary food (doggie treats) and
water at a sprawling catering table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll sing along to anything,'' said Steve Kirchner, whose dog
Bijou yelped enthusiastically as Ted Nugent's ``Cat-Scratch Fever''
played. ``As long as I turn it up loud, he'll start going.''
</P>
<P>
   While several dogs opted to embarrass their masters with silence
once they reached the spotlight, others produced sounds that
resembled everything from a 747 airplane lifting off to a humpback
whale.
</P>
<P>
   And this is one contest where size clearly doesn't matter. Last
year's winner, Pumpkin, is a 2-pound, 10-ounce ``opera-singing''
poodle.
</P>
<P>
   While the search has left Los Angeles, cat and dog owners have
until Aug. 6 to send a VHS tape and entry form to contest
organizers at 200 East Randolph Drive, 63rd Floor, Chicago, IL
60601.
</P>
<P>
   Entry forms can be picked up at selected veterinary clinics and
animal hospitals.

ON BAR STOOLS, GIULIANI PLAN IS SCORNED
</HEADLINE>
   (With BC-DRUNK-DRIVERS, BC-DRUNK-POLICY)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The regulars at Montero Bar in Brooklyn Heights say
they do not usually drive before or after they take their drinks.
Joseph and Tony call a car service, while the bartenders, Carol and
Linda, always walk home. They all condemn drunken driving, but
Monday they reserved their fiercest condemnation for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm walking, they can't give me a ticket if I'm drunk, can
they?'' asked Carol, who like everyone else would provide only her
first name.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing a 5 p.m. Budweiser and dragging on a Marlboro, Tony
sarcastically answered: ``Walking after drinking. It's the next
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Montero to more upscale pubs on Manhattan's Upper East
Side and watering holes in Queens, the mayor's new policy of
seizing vehicles from people arrested for drunken driving was
greeted with scorn and contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani calls the plan a tough measure to reduce traffic
fatalities, but people on bar stools across the city called it a
punishment exceeding the crime and portrayed it as an erosion of
civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of them profiling and targeting people in minority
neighborhoods,'' said Lyne Mosby, 55, a painter from Queens. Mosby,
who is black, had driven to Don Romeo's in Kew Gardens, though he
was not drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People work too hard to get their cars to have them taken
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender at Don Romeo's, Chyna Reynoso, 24, spoke for many
when she said: ``I don't believe they should be taking someone's
property away. If they feel like someone is intoxicated, let them
spend 30 days in jail. If they were caught a second time, then I
would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has described the campaign as a tough, unambiguous
plan, but several people predicted unforeseen complexities and
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   At Last Exit Bar and Lounge, a trendy nightspot in the Cobble
Hill section of Brooklyn, John Waters and Arthur Ballard sipped
French martinis and noted that a person who owned a Jaguar would
suffer a greater financial loss than someone who owned a Ford
Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Bennington, 41, a financial manager who lives in Manhattan,
said he had become more cautious about drinking and driving since
he was arrested for drunken driving eight years ago in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he sipped on a beer at O'Flanagan's Ale House on
Manhattan's East Side. he he criticized the Giuliani plan on legal
and practical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seizing property without a trial, that sounds
unconstitutional,'' he said. ``A lot of people's cars are used to
earn a living. I think it will be detrimental for business in the
city as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, at Mo's Caribbean Bar and Grill, Chuck Frissora,
48, a road builder visiting from Sudbury, Mass., conceded that he
did occasionally drive after a drink or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' he said of the city's crackdown. ``It's
certainly not a democratic punishment. I think you need to be
responsible, but the government taking away your car is
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Frissora decried the confiscation measure as ``another bit of
erosion in our foundation of personal freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm convicted of a crime, I'll pay the penalty. But taking
my possessions on the spot is an abuse of power. If they put up
roadblocks, I would never come to Manhattan again and would take my
tourist dollars elsewhere,'' he said.

PERROT VOWS TO CONQUER CANCER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By W.H. STICKNEY JR. 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kim Perrot, a 5-foot-5-inch pillar of strength on the
basketball court during the Houston Comets' two WNBA championship
seasons, cried frequently Monday as she talked of being diagnosed
with lung and brain cancer and discussed the difficult fight now
confronting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tough moment for me,'' Perrot said. ``But I've
always had to battle. And this is just another battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past month, Perrot has been subjected to
numerous tests at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston to determine
the cause of periodic headaches and weakness in her arms. On
Friday, she was informed of the results: Cancer that began in her
lungs had spread to her brain.
</P>
<P>
   As she talked of her ordeal Monday, Perrot sat with two of the
Comets' team doctors, two of the three cancer specialists in whose
hands her future rests and Comets coach Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the news conference at the Westside Tennis Club,
Perrot clutched the hand of Chancellor, who over the past two years
has gone from a coach she once despised to a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe with all my heart and faith in God that I will
overcome this,'' she said. ``And my goal is to be back on the
basketball court at 110 percent, doing what I've been doing for the
last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have said it's too early to offer a complete prognosis.
But Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chief of neurosurgery at M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center, said the lung cancer, alveolar adenocarcinoma that
was classified as advanced, is the biggest long-term worry.
</P>
<P>
   The brain tumors _ one golf-ball-size tumor and a few smaller
ones _ offer the most immediate threat, however.
</P>
<P>
   Sawaya said the smaller tumors ``are of no immediate concern
right now ... The larger one is best treated if removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the golf-ball-size tumor did not originate in the brain,
Sawaya said there is a high probability it can be removed and not
grow back. It is on the left side, immediately beneath the brain's
surface and near the motor cortex that controls power to the
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   During surgery expected to last about four hours Wednesday,
doctors will use critical mapping, which measures function on the
surface of the brain, to determine which part of the brain to cut
through to remove the tumor without causing paralysis. Two weeks of
radiation will follow the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer in the lungs is more of an unknown. But doctors said
there is no reason to think Perrot won't respond to treatment _
about six months of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Sawaya said it is hard to imagine Perrot playing competitively
this season. But he admitted he was hesitant to say that, because
chemotherapy treatment is hard to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Taylor Wharton, special assistant to the president of M.D.
Anderson and an oncologist, said Perrot probably began to
experience symptoms associated with the lung cancer last fall.
Although lung cancer is most often associated with heavy smokers,
Wharton said Perrot ``is a nonsmoker and a nondrinker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lifestyle has nothing to do with it,'' Wharton said. ``It's
just a low-frequency, random event. And unfortunately, it caught up
with one of our star athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot said she gains comfort from living in Houston, where
facilities and personnel such as those at M.D. Anderson are readily
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to me to even think this would happen to me,''
she said. ``But I've accepted it. I've dealt with it, and the last
weeks that I have been meeting with the doctors at M.D. Anderson
have really made me feel confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust that they are the best and will take real good care of
me. So it is an asset to be in a city where they have the best
doctors in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said he has no doubt Perrot will overcome her
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of how tough she is,'' he said, ``she's going to
fight this, and she'll be back playing one day. I just don't see
this as being a battle she can't win. She's small; she's overcome
that on the basketball court. She's just won every battle you can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lamb, starting center for the Comets during their repeat
season as champions of the Women's National Basketball Association,
said Perrot's teammates were all shocked upon hearing of her
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so ironic and so tragic,'' said Lamb. ``She is the most
health-conscious on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I like to say that this disease has just barked upon the
wrong tree. Kim is relentless against her foes. I have no doubt she
will attack this in the same manner, the same fashion, all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Perrot, ``I just want to thank all my fans, my family and
friends for their support. And just know that I'm going to get
through this.''

DOES RODMAN HAVE OUR ATTENTION YET?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERY HILLS, Calif. _ ``Bad As I Wanna Be'' is the title of
Dennis Rodman's autobiography. As for the working title of his
life, it's clearly ``Sad As I Wanna Be.''
</P>
<P>
   There's so much about Rodman that's ambiguous; his drive, his
dress, his dreams. But on Monday one thing stood out like the radio
reporter who showed up in drag for the press conference Rodman
called to announce his intentions to play for the Los Angeles
Lakers this season:
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the nose studs and the retro duds is a lost soul
screaming for help.
</P>
<P>
   I sincerely hope he gets it with the Lakers, which will be his
fourth team in seven years. Some stability would be a welcomed
start for someone who has been a rudderless hull of a human being
since being abandoned by his father and forsaken by his peers as a
young child.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a trained psychologist to see that affirmation _
or at the very least, attention _ is what Rodman is after. Judging
by Monday's mob scene in Beverly Hills _ the commotion caused by
the swarm of European honey bees a block away paled in comparison _
and the volume of voice mail I received recently for daring to say
the Lakers would be stupid to sign him, Rodman's most basic need
will be met in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it?
</P>
<P>
   The fans will fill the Forum to behold the agility and brawn and
grace of the NBA's Baryshnikov, which will make Lakers owner Jerry
Buss happy. And Shaquille O'Neal's recent rash of flubbed
two-footers suggests there will be plenty of rebound opportunities
for Rodman, which will make all the paying customers happy.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated yet again Monday, Rodman is always good for
an outrageous quote or 20, which will make media types happy.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodman's heads-up play and hustle will tilt the rebounding,
steals and turnover numbers in the Lakers' favor most nights and
elevate them to championship-contending status, which will make NBC
and the NBA happy.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Rodman and this novel question: Does anybody really
care if he's happy?
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA's seven-time defending rebounding champion is, he
sure had a strange way of showing it Monday. Standing next to his
beautiful wife, contemplating the next move in his glamorous life,
Rodman went from contemptuous to crushed at the drop of a few
pointed questions from the people in the overflow crowd who weren't
there as acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike in the dictionary, there was no trace of contentment
in between.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up 30 minutes late _ on-the-dot for those on RST
(Rodman Standard Time) _ and posed for photos with his bride Carmen
Electra (the last time I can remember hearing that many shutters
click at once, newly turned pro Tiger Woods was proclaiming,
``Hello, world.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rodman proceeded to bury his news of the day much like he has
his insecurities, beneath layers of frivolity. He talked about
wanting to play for the Lakers but having no desire to hold the
hands of kids, a seeming contradiction to anyone who has been
around Shaq and 20-year-old Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He talked a good game about his current physical condition and
his league-wide popularity. Finally, 10 minutes into the press
conference, Rodman deigned to answer the question on everybody's
lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to sign (with the Lakers) tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, man cannot live on club-hopping alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bored,'' Rodman said. ``I'm tired of not doing anything. I
want to entertain the people. I always give the people what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman does so many outrageous things to draw attention that his
smaller gestures sometimes go unnoticed. He paid for the funeral of
James Byrd Jr., the African-American who was dragged to his death
in an apparent hate crime in Texas. And he said he plans to donate
$100,000 of his Lakers salary, once the formality of signing an
actual contract is completed, to 10 charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``And still,'' Rodman said, his voice cracking and tears
trickling down his left cheek, ``I can never win. No matter what I
do, I'm still not going to win with you people. No matter what I do
for this league and the game of basketball, I'll never win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's emotions at that moment were raw and real, and in his
pathos the truth was revealed: For all the attention he seeks, the
love he really craves is his own.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to squint too hard to see that Rodman is filled
with self-loathing. If the studs in his nose and his chin and the
tattoos covering his body aren't clues, there was the aside he made
when explaining Electra's role in his decision to return to the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman said the actress, whom he wed in November, has been
``real good to me.'' He went on to express amazement that she'd
stand by a guy like him ``through thick and thin.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rodman can't see his redeeming qualities as a person,
independent of his celebrity stature, let's hope Lakers executive
director Jerry West can.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Lakers sign Rodman, whether or not West wants him in
the Lakers family becomes immaterial. He'll be their 37-year-old
foster child and even if Rodman won't admit it, he's desperately
seeking direction.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to provide it, when you think about it, than someone
as steady and cerebral as West?
</P>
<P>
   Rodman can help the Lakers, there's no question of that. He
wasn't being modest, just matter-of-fact, when he stated, ``I don't
have an ego. I'm not going to be the vocal point of the team. (In
Chicago) I was just the guy that (did the dirty work), pretty
much.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there are much bigger egos already on the Lakers
and no bigger heart than the one Rodman wears on his singlet during
games. With him on the floor, there's no chance of the Lakers
having ``a tendency to look into space in the fourth quarter'' as
Rodman perceptively pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is, will the Lakers be good for Rodman? It
sure looks like he could use help and I'm not talking about down
low in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best therapy for the troubled power forward is being
part of something bigger than himself. The Lakers had better hope
so. Because if they sign Rodman and then let him continue his
downward spiral as a person, even as he's helping take them to
greater heights as a player, no championship banner will cover up
the hole where a conscience used to be.

   BEARS-RETURN (Garden City, Idaho) _ When Sally Maughan steps
into a large fenced area in her backyard here, eight orphan bear
cubs pay her the ultimate compliment. ``They treat me like a

fashion. ``When I come in the door, they're thinking that way.
They'll take a swat at me. They'll grab my shirt sleeve like it's
the scruff of another bear.'' And that is the whole point, for Ms.
Maughan is doing all she can to get these bears back into the wild
this spring. Idaho wildlife officials call her ``the bear lady,''
and for the last 10 years she has been the volunteer in charge of
an unusual program intended to return orphaned cubs to the
wilderness. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

the result of Parkinson's disease, dropped his head and paused.
``But I don't want you to get hurt,'' Ms. Ali said her father told
her, his voice barely above a whisper. ``Daddy, I'm not going to
get hurt,'' she said. ``I have your genetics.'' Women's
professional boxing is a sport struggling for stature. While the
number of women in its ranks have grown greatly, female
professional boxing is desperate for true stars, but also concerned
that it not be turned into just a curious sideshow. And so the
prospect of Laila Ali, a woman with a marketable name and no proven
skills, turning pro has infused the sport with a sense of both

ADMINISTRATION REJECTS SALE OF AMERICAN SATELLITE TO CHINESE-LED
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS grafs 2-3 to recast, specify that future satellite sales
are in doubt, expand on why administration supported
transactions.) 
 (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Swayed by criticisms that commercial satellite
deals with China could threaten national security, the Clinton
administration decided on Monday to reject the sale of a $450
million satellite to a consortium with close ties to the Chinese
government, senior officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision casts considerable doubt on the future of satellite
sales to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision reverses the policy in effect for
several years of promoting commercial satellite deals with China.
The United States championed the transactions to help American
business and exports and to help China make technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several months, the administration has faced a
barrage of investigations and a growing stack of official reports
that have called the commercial satellite sales and associated
expertise a threat to American security and a great boon to China's
military capability. The findings have indicated that the program
of satellite sales might have given the Chinese the scientific
expertise to improve their missile-launching capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Disapproval of the satellite deal is likely to be another
sensitive issue raised next week when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visits China. With Chinese-American relations eroding over
other issues like human rights and trade, Beijing could interpret
the disapproval as a fundamental retreat from Washington's
commitment to expanded economic relations. At the moment, though,
no further sales are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after the Defense and State Departments
objected to allowing China to launch the satellite. The Commerce
Department favored the sale, but the State and Defense departments
overruled it, concluding that the technology to place the satellite
in orbit would help the Chinese military make its intercontinental
ballistic missile fleet more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts also feared that that Chinese military would
benefit, both commercially and technologically, by controlling the
satellite once it was in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involves a Hughes Space and Communications satellite
designed to set up a mobile telephone network over much of Asia,
reaching from China to Indonesia, and then across the Indian Ocean
as far as Pakistan. The Commerce Department is expected to formally
notify Hughes of its ``intent to deny'' in the next few days,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement on Monday night that made no
reference to a decision, but reiterated that the satellite deal
``can be used as a model for how we can protect national security
while launching satellites overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively revokes President Clinton's quiet
approval of the sale two and a half years ago. At the time,
Clinton's aides assured him it would not contribute to Chinese
military capabilities. The State Department and the Defense
Department concurred with the decision, but had not thoroughly
vetted the military links of the Singapore-based consortium, which
was the official buyer of the satellite. Top officials of the
consortium included top military officers of the People's
Liberation Army, who also served in posts with the China Satellite
Launch and Tracking Control Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes officials had sought an expedited review, and pressured
the administration to approve the deal, according to government
documents provided later to congressional investigators. A change
in the satellite's design forced the company to apply for a revised
license, and a raft of subsequent investigations into China's
efforts to obtain American technology helped prompt the
administration to reverse its position.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a time that relations between the United
States and China are eroding on many fronts, from human rights to
economic interchanges. A senior administration official, speaking
on the condition that he not be identified, said on Monday that
``we are heading into a very rough patch,'' and speculated that the
decision Monday could make it ``very difficult'' to approve other
satellite sales to China in the near future, though none are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The official also speculated that the Chinese would likely move
quickly to obtain a similar satellite from Europe, in part to drive
home their ability to circumvent American restrictions and reward
non-American competitors. However, it appears unlikely that China
could acquire technology as sophisticated as that offered by
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to visit Beijing next week in connection
with a visit to Washington in April by China's prime minister, Zhou
Rongji. Zhou is widely regarded as China's economic czar, and
administration officials believed until recently that his visit
would be preceded by intense negotiations to secure China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, a move Beijing and Washington
have long sought.
</P>
<P>
   But with China's economy slowing, and unemployment unrest around
the country, Zhou appears less eager to strike a deal that would
require him to open China's markets rapidly. The cancellation of
the satellite deal could easily be interpreted in Beijing as a
fundamental retreat from Washington's commitment to expanded
economic relations with China, and could also diminish the chances
of any broad trade agreement. Such an agreement would ultimately
require approval by Congress, and administration officials say that
in the current atmosphere, that would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the satellite deal would be approved has
diminished for months. On Monday morning, The Financial Times of
London reported that the deal was close to being rejected. By later
Monday, the Commerce Department had received the last of the votes
from four other agencies with a voice in the deal, and concluded
that it had been overruled.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Electronics or the Commerce Department could
theoretically ask for a reconsideration of the decision of the four
export licenses involved in the deal, but administration officials
said that as a practical matter they thought it was unlikely any
reconsideration would change the outcome.

</P>
<P>
   At a high level interagency meeting on Feb. 11, the Pentagon
said it was troubled by the involvement of the Chinese military in
the regional satellite system, called Asia-Pacific Mobile
Telecommunications, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's concerns at the meeting included
questions about Hughes' dealings in recent years with China, the
official added. One troubling episode involved a 1995 tutorial on
rocket launching given by Hughes engineers to Chinese scientists,
now the subject of a criminal inquiry. Another involved the
company's hiring of the son of the Chinese general who oversees his
country's military satellite programs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent findings of a select House committee also figured in
the decision to deny the Hughes deal, officials said. The panel
criticized Hughes' dealings with China and recommended that the
administration strengthen export controls. The administration
supports most committee findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is completing a similar
report, which officials said is likely to also harshly criticize
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hughes told the government that it faced
potentially large losses if the license was denied, including $100
million in unrecoverable costs and a possible penalty if the
government did not approve a license by Feb. 15, according to an
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the company's questioned deals with China, its
chairman was C. Michael Armstrong, who also served as head of
Clinton's export advisory council, a group of private-sector
executives and labor leaders who advice the administration on trade
policy. Armstrong now heads AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   His successor at Hughes, Michael T. Smith, wrote Albright last
December that Hughes ``will adopt new policies and procedures for
the export of technology and equipment,'' including a ``new
internal export compliance program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughes of today is a very different company than it was
even a year ago,'' Smith said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The license for the satellite deal was handled by the Commerce
Department, which must consult and win the consent of other
government departments involved in satellite exports. Next month,
as a result of legislation passed by Congress last year and
opposed, but signed, by Clinton, the State Department will once
again take on the lead role for a wider range of satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Deparment will no longer have a vote in licensing
reviews for many of the most sophisticated products, which will be
considered part of the State Department's ``munitions list,'' a
list of the nation's most sensitive military-related technologies.

NEW POLICY REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-DRUNK-DRIVERS, NY-DRUNK-REACT) 
 (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York City began seizing the cars of people
arrested on drunken-driving charges, police officials and lawyers
studied the new policy Monday to figure out exactly how it would
work and whose cars could be kept for resale.
</P>
<P>
   The most clear-cut of cases, officials said, is when the driver
charged with drunken driving is the registered owner of the
vehicle. In those cases the car will definitely be seized.
</P>
<P>
   But other situations are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of a teen-ager arrested for drunken driving in a
car registered to his mother. If the teen-ager can establish that
he borrowed the family car and that his mother had no idea he would
be drinking, officials said, the car will eventually be returned.
But if it appears that the teen-ager was the primary user of the
car, it might well be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Leased cars will also be seized and kept, though Robert Messner,
the executive managing attorney of the Police Department's Civil
Enforcement Unit, said the city would return most leased cars to
the leasing companies. But he said that the drivers of seized
leased cars would probably still be required to pay off the terms
of their leases.
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars will not be seized. Messner said that they might be
held briefly in case they are needed as evidence, but that they
would eventually be returned to the rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taxis and livery cabs will be seized when the owner is charged
with drunken driving or if the owner was aware that the car would
be driven by someone drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The police will also seize private automobiles if they can show
that the owner knowingly allowed the driver to operate the vehicle
while drunk. Those cases are easiest to prove, police officials
said, when the owner is a passenger _ and such seizures would also
eliminate the possibility that when two companions are drunk, the
owner can circumvent the law by having the other person drive.
</P>
<P>
   Only people arrested for driving while intoxicated _ and found
to have a blood alcohol level of .10 or higher _ will have their
cars seized. People arrested on the lesser charge of driving while
impaired _ meaning their blood alcohol level was between .06 and
.09 _ will have their cars returned.
</P>
<P>
   Once an arrest for drunken driving is made and a car is seized,
two processes begin: the criminal case against the driver and the
city's civil case to take ownership of the car.
</P>
<P>
   For the criminal case, the suspect is brought back to the
station house and given a Breathalyzer test on videotape. If a
driver refuses to be tested, that refusal is videotaped and the
driver's license will be suspended. His car can still be seized,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil case is separate. The Civil Enforcement Unit must
begin proceedings to have a car legally forfeited within 25 days of
the time a driver asks for his car back from the Police
Department's Property Clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Hessner said that a civil action could take anywhere from days
to years.
</P>
<P>
   The city may agree to give back cars to people who can make a
good case in court for their return, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that someone acquitted of driving
drunk in a criminal case still might not get his car back, because
the standard of proof the city must meet in a civil case is lower
then the standard in a criminal one.

 &HT;    Feds, foes reach truce on restoration plan
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal government reached a truce
Monday with scientists whose widely publicized criticisms could
have jeopardized Congress' approval of a $7.8 billion Everglades
restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, federal leaders agreed
to appoint an independent panel of researchers from outside South
Florida to review the restoration throughout the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan still will go to Congress on July 1, as the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers had intended. But the panel will have the
authority to review the science underlying the restoration and make
recommendations directly to Babbitt and his successors.
</P>
<P>
   And Babbitt will choose the experts with help from the National
Academy of Sciences, the not-for-profit society Congress created
during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   That could satisfy demands by the Sierra Club and other groups
that the academy, or some similarly renowned body, play a role in
the review.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Monday is a more detailed version of a
review proposal that federal advisers had announced Feb. 3. But
that announcement received nothing like the widespread approval
that emerged from Monday's hourlong meeting in Washington between
three of the scientists and Babbitt. ``I'm delighted,'' said
University of Tennessee ecologist Stuart Pimm, one of the
restoration plan's most vocal critics. Pimm embarrassed the
government last month by recruiting criticism from five other
nationally known scientists, including leading ecologists from
Harvard and Stanford universities.
</P>
<P>
   While his doubts about the plan remain, Pimm said the experts'
panel will have two crucial ingredients to ensure the government
makes the needed improvements: ``It's ongoing and it's an
independent advisory board. . . . That's what we wanted at the
outset.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which wasn't involved in the meeting, also
expressed optimism afterward. But Frank Jackalone, the club's
senior Florida representative, said he hopes the experts will have
enough clout to insist on changes if they find serious flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country will settle for nothing less than a plan
that begins to restore the Everglades,'' Jackalone said.
</P>
<P>
   The peer review proposal also won written endorsement last week
from Everglades National Park Superintendent Richard Ring, whose
scientists have called the restoration plan inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, perhaps the largest ever attempted, would be
the first major overhaul of the federally created drainage system
that made South Florida safe for expanded farming and development
after World War II. The plan calls for creating 251,000 acres of
reservoirs, marshes, quarries and well fields to store hundreds of
billions of gallons of water each year for farms, cities and the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the plan would rely too much on pricey engineering
experiments and provide too much water for suburban sprawl. They
say it would do too little to restore the Everglades' broad-flowing
sheets of water _ and even those improvements would not occur until
after 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The corps still had the support of many environmental groups,
including the National Audubon Society, which said the plan had
undergone exhaustive review during the past two years. Even so,
Monday's agreement ``will be very helpful'' when the plan goes to
Congress, Assistant Interior Secretary Patricia Beneke said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Beneke said the government had always intended to have an
ongoing scientific review, but ``perhaps we hadn't communicated
what the plan will be, how serious we are about it.''

 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert G. O'Meally, the Columbia University professor
and jazz writer who will be attending his first Grammy Awards
ceremony Wednesday night (he's been nominated), in his first tuxedo
(hey, he's not going to lie to you, he's excited), is one of those
guys who likes to put together music tapes, at least one a week.
</P>
<P>
   The family is driving to Queens, O'Meally makes a tape. He makes
tapes for his wife's exercise class. It was a tape, for his own
pleasure, that led to the Grammy contender. O'Meally had been
invited by Henry Louis Gates Jr. to a study group on black
intellectuals held in a villa in Bellagio, Italy. ``Kind of a
boondoggle _ I shouldn't call it that,'' O'Meally says. There was
great food, there was wine, there was no music.
</P>
<P>
   Out come some of O'Meally's tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's ``The Jazz Singers,'' a five-CD collection of more
than 100 artists, which was the last collection produced by the
Smithsonian Collection of Recordings. O'Meally co-produced the
collection with Bruce Talbot, then the executive producer at the
Smithsonian. The set also includes a 127-page booklet by O'Meally,
who, after all, has a Ph.D. from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to say here are the indispensable progenitors of the
traditions,'' O'Meally says of the project. ``I wanted some
historical sweep. I wanted to show that jazz singing is quite
various and diffuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we see the tux?
</P>
<P>
   Pleased as a kid stepping out for the prom, O'Meally brings it
out and, as requested, puts it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it in a store called Rue St. Denis on 11th Street,''
O'Meally says. ``I'm not going to pay $1,000 for a suit I'm going
to wear one day a year. They said it was from the 40s. It was
$150.''
</P>
<P>
   The jacket is double-breasted, with lapels sharp enough to cut
out your heart. Pretty slick. He looks like one of the guys he
writes about.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meally, a boyish 50, smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz musicians always liked to get dressed up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meally, a professor of American literature, is the first
Columbia professor nominated for a Grammy, as far as anyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a teacher of the best sort, excited about his field.
Talking about jazz in the expansive, prewar apartment he shares
with his wife and two teen-age sons, he illustrates his stories
with music. O'Meally's wife, Jacqui Malone, a professor of theater
and dance at Queens College who is working on a book about tap
dancing, gets up from her computer in the adjoining room and firmly
shuts the French doors without saying hello _ a signal, perhaps,
that there is more than one significant artist in this house.
O'Meally, meanwhile, is lost in the music.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the photos you might see on a visit to
O'Meally's place: His younger son on a fishing trip, so delighted
with the big, fat fish he has caught that he is giving it a kiss. A
photo of O'Meally's parents, his dad the map maker, his mother the
schoolteacher, at a costume party, talking with Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a photo, on the living room wall, of a middle-aged
man with a Panama hat and a flashy shirt, impatient and restless,
listening to another man _ possibly his producer _ whose face is
only partly visible. Is race important here? The artist is black,
the authority figure white. ``My hero, Johnny Hodges,'' O'Meally
says. ``He was a star soloist with Duke Ellington. Sax.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets out an old album, plays a few cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feigned this indifferent attitude, but you can't miss the
passion in his playing,'' O'Meally says. ``As a boy, I reacted to
the melody. He was also the essence of coolness, pretending to look
the other way while squeezing all this beauty out of the horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Most little boys choose other heroes: sports figures, John
Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of being too analytic about it, I grew up in
segregated Washington,'' O'Meally says. ``I had to go cope with the
fact that I couldn't go to certain theaters or restaurants. You had
to know what the limits were and operate within them. Hodges could
live within a partition and still have a full sense of life, still
test the limits. He traveled to the Far East, all over Europe. He
stood for the possibilities of exploding those boundaries, just as
Louis did. Great Ambassador Satch. For me, he was more than a John
Wayne. Wayne was a tough hero who would confront you at every turn.
You couldn't do that in Washington. You had to learn how to stop
around an aggressive police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his was an unhappy childhood, O'Meally stresses. Quite
the opposite. For all of his talk of segregated Washington, his
best friend _ out comes another picture _ was a white kid. There
was always music in his house. His mother, at the piano, playing
Beethoven and Chopin. His father, taking over, doing a
boogie-woogie variation or listening to Duke Ellington or
Cannonball Adderley, closing his eyes, sometimes, so you knew
something special was happening in the music.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meally, inspired by Hodges, played tenor sax.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't he become a musician?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never was that good,'' O'Meally says.
</P>
<P>
   Out comes another CD, ``One Hour With Duke Ellington'' and
Hodges, again, making the saxophone sing of love and longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've Got It Bad and That Ain't Good'' _ just the song with
which to leave O'Meally.

EDITORIAL: RENDEZVOUS IN LAHORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The city of Lahore, in the fertile plains of Punjab, lies along
the route of countless ancient military invasions of the Asian
Subcontinent. It was a fitting place for Prime Ministers Atal
Behari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to pledge a
new effort over the weekend to defuse the tensions that led both to
test nuclear weapons last year. Some stirring atmospherics
surrounded the renewed dedication by the rival nations to resolve
their differences peacefully. But many additional steps will be
necessary to reduce the catastrophic potential of a nuclear
conflict in this unstable region.
</P>
<P>
   It took courage for Vajpayee and Sharif to meet and redouble
their negotiating efforts while both are under fire from extremists
at home. Vajpayee's decision to travel by bus across the border and
pay the first visit to Pakistan by an Indian prime minister in 10
years was a rebuke to Hindu nationalists in his own ruling
coalition who believe that Pakistan has fomented the Muslim
rebellion in the Indian state of Kashmir. Sharif, for his part, had
to mobilize the police to put down anti-India rioters during the
visit. To translate the cordial expressions of Lahore into
achievements, both countries must now work hard to sign a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which they pledged to do
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions in Lahore led to a vague promise of sharing
information to prevent an accidental launch of nuclear weapons. The
goal has been talked about for years and now has obvious new
urgency. But both countries need to go further and reach agreement
to stop production of weapons-grade nuclear material, prevent the
export of nuclear technology and halt the deployment of missiles
that can deliver nuclear weapons. The United States, which imposed
heavy sanctions on India and Pakistan after the nuclear tests, is
right to wait for action on these steps before it lifts the
sanctions. But Washington has also wisely let the World Bank
proceed with some critical loans as a nudge to the dialogue that
both countries are engaged in.
</P>
<P>
   As India had wanted, both leaders pledged to discuss economic
and humanitarian steps to improve relations. As Pakistan had
insisted, both sides agreed to place the disputes over Kashmir,
India's only Muslim-dominated state, high on the agenda of their
talks. Two of the three wars between India and Pakistan have taken
place there, and a large portion of both countries' armies are
arrayed along the border. An estimated 30,000 civilians have been
killed in the Muslim rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has played a constructive role in
bringing two suspicious countries together. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott has held eight meetings with the leaders of
each country in the last eight months. But in the end, India and
Pakistan must learn to talk about their problems without the
prodding of intermediaries. It was thus especially encouraging that
the meeting in Lahore was initiated by Vajpayee and Sharif
themselves. Many Pakistanis are bound to be impressed that
Vajpayee's trip included a visit to the historic site where
Pakistan's founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, proclaimed his vision of a
Muslim state in South Asia. If the spirit of Lahore can be
translated into concrete steps, the way may be clear for the
long-deferred visit later this year by President Clinton.
