CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A settlement fund to cover the risks of failed
settlement of exchange operations on the fixed due dates will start
functioning as from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of "Egypt" company for clearing,
settlement and central reserve said that shares of all market
brokerage companies in the fund have already been fixed.
</P>
<P>
The fund's capital during the coming three months will amount to
27 million pounds (7.8 million U.S. dollars). The companies were
given one month to pay their dues, ending January 1, thus,
coinciding with the commencement of the fund's work.
</P>
<P>
The manager, Abdul Salam, pointed out that the settlement fund
is not meant to finance brokerage companies or to act as a bank for
credit facilities, but is a system to cover the risks of
unsettlement on the fixed time.
</P>
<P>
A delay penalty of 15 percent a year will have to be paid by
brokerage companies that fail to honour settlements on the fixed
time.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish pipeline-building company and a Spanish
credit bank signed a loan agreement Friday regarding the last part
of the Iran-Turko natural gas pipeline project, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Banco Santaner Hispano, the Spanish credit bank, will provide
102 million dollars in loans for the construction of the 260
kilometers long pipeline by the Turkish Pipeline Transportation
Corp. (BOTAS), the last stage of Iran-Turko gas project from Sivas
to Kayseri within the Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Gokhan Yardim, the Director General of BOTAS, said that they
planned to fulfil the project until the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
He will lead a Turkish delegation to visit Iran in the first
week of January 2000, evaluating the latest developments of the
project with the Iranian side.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are
likely to gradually increase customs duty on cigarette and other
tobacco products to 200 percent by 2001, the local Gulf News daily
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six states, namely Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, are now targeting to
achieve 100 percent customs duty on tobacco by next July, in line
with an agreement inked in 1983 to curb high cigarette consumption
levels in the region.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Issues Seven-Day Austerity Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
issued a circular of a seven-day austerity in state spending on
December 24-31 to keep financial balances at desired levels in line
with the current economic stabilization program.
</P>
<P>
The circular, issued by the Prime Ministry Friday, stipulates a
decrease in state expenditures and limit the purchase of goods and
services in many government departments, Turkish Daily News
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the cost-cutting measures, no additional staff will
be employed and no extra funds can be requested from the government
for the remaining seven days of this year.
</P>
<P>
The circular demands that state offices are obliged to pay on
time electricity, water, heating, telephone and fuel bills, not
being allowed to delay until next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministry sources said it was very likely that the
circular, currently being in force with only seven days, would be
reissued in early January for fiscal 2000 as well.
</P>
<P>
The measures are also designed to compensate losses in the
August 17 devastating earthquake in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But government spending on the southeastern "Emergency Rule"
region, the quake-stricken areas and in the solution to the Y2K
computer problem, will be immune from the restriction.
</P>
<P>
Huge governmental spending is a chronic problem in Turkey and
the austerity program is believed that the government has started
to cope with the crux.

<HEADLINE> Russian Advance Units Close to Central Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The pro-Russian Chechen militia
units led by Bislan Gantamirov, ex-mayor of the Chechen capital of
Grozny, approached the center of the city Sunday evening and are
fighting separatists near the Chechen Press House, reported the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The militia forces numbering about 800 "are carrying out a mop-
up operation in the city, inspecting all buildings and basements
where rebels may be taking refuge," the Interfax quoted Gantamirov
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Scattered groups of rebels are offering "fierce resistance," he
said. He was sure that Russians would have taken control of Grozny
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed reports that about 1,500 rebels led by well-known
field commanders Shamil Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev, Akhmed Zakayev
and Baudi Bakuyev in scattered groups remain in the city, trying
to break out of the beleaguered capital and escape to southern
mountain regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen rebel command, cited by an Interfax report, said
that Russian forces were fighting separatists in various parts of
Grozny Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the rebel Operations Department, fierce battles
were in progress in the districts of Oktyabrskoye,
Staropromyslovsky, Zavodskoi and other important places all the
day.
</P>
<P>
The fighting Saturday and Sunday was comparable in intensity to
the battles of January 1995 and August 1996, said senior rebel
figure Isa Munayev, cited by the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The report said the fighting had not grown any less intense
after dark with smashing artillery pounding and heavy explosions
heard everywhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu
and Chechen representative Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov started talks
in the neighboring federal republic of Ingushetia on plans to
evacuate civilians from Grozny, but reached no deal.
</P>
<P>
Russians launched the ongoing operation to storm the long-
besieged Grozny at Friday midnight.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israeli Decision on Third Release of Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) refused on Sunday the Israeli list of names of Palestinian
prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of State of Prisoners Affairs Hisham Abdul
Raziq told Voice of Palestine Sunday evening that the PNA turned
down the Israeli decision on the grounds that they are criminal
rather than political prisoners as the PNA demanded.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable," he said, adding that "the Palestinian
side expects another Israeli decision on the dispute."
</P>
<P>
"The PNA will never receive a single criminal," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday the Israeli security cabinet approved the release
of 28 Palestinian prisoners under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum
signed by the two sides in September.
</P>
<P>
The memo provides that the names of the third batch of
Palestinian detainees to be freed should be decided jointly by the
two sides, Abdul-Raziq noted.
</P>
<P>
The names of two prisoners of the third release were decided in
agreement with the Palestinian side, according to Radio Israel.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the third
batch of prisoners will be released within a few days after the
Ministry of Justice approves the move.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side refused the Palestinian demand that the batch
should include Palestinians residing in Jerusalem. But earlier
reports from Israel said six Palestinian prisoners from East
Jerusalem will also be released.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 350 Palestinian detainees in two batches
since the memo was signed in September. The two sides failed to
reach agreement on the names of the third batch, thus postponing
release that should take place before the Muslim holly fasting
month Ramadan that began more than two week ago.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails,
according to Palestinian estimates.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says U.S., Britain Suspend 54 Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry said on
Sunday that the U.S. and British envoys at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee had suspended 54 of its contracts signed under the sixth
phase of oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry told the Iraqi News Agency that
those contracts were put on hold during the committee's sessions
held on December 15-17 and December 20-23.
</P>
<P>
Those 54 contracts were signed with companies from France,
Egypt,Jordan, Turkey, India, Italy, Austria, Finland, Russia,
Tunisia and Spain for the purchases of oil and electricity spare
parts and equipment, medicine and medical appliances, tires,
sprinkling system and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat
Mubarak on Sunday held the U.S. responsible for putting Iraqi
medical contracts on hold.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in a statement that "all evidence exposes the deep
American spite on the Iraqi people," citing the fact that the U.S.
envoy at the Sanctions Committee suspended, under no reasonable
justification, a contract for the import of brain valves from
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that brain valves are not available in any
Iraqi hospitals, a matter which leads to the deaths of those who
are in urgent need of them.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people
reeling under the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately hampering the endorsement
of its contracts and impeding the implementation of the
humanitarian program.

<HEADLINE> Third Release of Palestinian Prisoners Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security cabinet
approved the overdue release of the third batch of Palestinian
prisoners, officials in Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight prisoners, including two who killed Palestinian
collaborators with Israelis and one Israeli taxi driver and had
served long terms in Israel's prison, will be freed in the coming
days, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The two killers' release, at the request of Palestinian National
Authority to rally Palestinian public opinion to support the peace
process, marked a policy change as Israel's traditional release
criteria prohibited freeing those who had murdered Israelis.
</P>
<P>
In a separate controversial decision, the security cabinet
agreed to free six Palestinian prisoners from East Jerusalem, which
had invited severe criticism from the opposition Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
The Likud said that as Israelis those persons had no part in
prisoner deals. Israel annexed East Jerusalem after 1967 Middle
East War and claimed as its "eternal and undivided capital," while
the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The release is still subject to approval by Israel's Justice
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed by Israel and the
Palestinians in September, Israel had released 350 Palestinian
prisoners on September 9 and October 15.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture, Israel had agreed to release another
batch of Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holy fasting month
of Ramadan which had started from December 8.
</P>
<P>
But the release was postponed until now as the two sides failed
to agree on the list of prisoners to be freed. Palestinians
insisted that both sides must agree on who are to be freed, while
Israelis said the list can only be decided by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Splitting Turkey up Unbearable: President Demirel </HEADLINE>

<P>
ANKARA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said that he will accept anything but splitting up Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remark during meeting with a delegation of
Human Rights Association, which called for lifting of emergency
rule and capital punishment in the country, the Anatolia News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "Turkey is ours, if we do not accept
that Turkey is ours, we can not preserve tranquility, peace and
order."
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that anarchy, terrorism and violence can not be
protected by democracy, adding that nobody can defend the actions
that aim to shed blood.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kurdish issues, he said "this was not an armed
clash. Some people took their guns and went to the mountains. They
have killed innocent civilians without discriminating elders and
children. You can not have sympathy on them."
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts were under way to solve economic problems
while pointing out that "actions aiming at splitting up Turkey are
not human rights issue. There is no use of hiding behind human
rights. People will not have problems if they abide by the rule and
laws of the country."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein arrived in Saudi Red Sea port city of Jeddah Sunday to
perform Umra (mini pilgrimage) and for talks with King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on key regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said that Abdullah
and Fahd would discuss bilateral relations and the latest Arab,
Islamic and international developments, according to reports from
Jeddah by the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks would center on means of enhancing
bilateral cooperation in all fields, the Mideast peace process, the
resumed Syrian-Israeli negotiations in particular.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their peace talks in Washington on
December 15 after nearly four years of suspension.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue next month to discuss the future of
Syria's Golan Heights captured by Israel during the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war, security arrangement and other issues.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to Saudi newspaper Okath published Sunday, King
Abdullah underlined that Jordan and Saudi Arabia agreed to support
all efforts to achieve a just and permanent peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that wide-spread and just peace means retaining all
rights to legal owners, adding that Amman and Riyadh are working
together to support Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese negotiations
with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jordanian sources, the Saudi-Jordanian meeting
would also tackle the situation in the Gulf in light of the recent
United Nations Council resolution on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed on December 17 Resolution 1284,
calling for Iraq's cooperation in allowing the return of the U.N.
weapons inspectors to Iraq in return for a possible suspension of
the nearly nine-year U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad expelled the arms inspectors last December shortly
before the U.S. and Britain launched massive air strikes against
Iraqi targets.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Regret Slow Indian Response to Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban's Foreign
Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel Sunday regretted India's slowness
in dealing with the situation involving a hijacked Indian Airlines
plane, which is now parked at Afghanistan's Kandahar airport.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that India has not so far sent any delegation. We
deeply regret the attitudes of India and the United Nations. There
are human lives at stake, they should act with speed to save them,
" Mutawakel was quoted as saying by the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP),
a Pakistan-based press agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had refused to mediate and India
showed "indifference."
</P>
<P>
A three-member U.N. delegation paid a brief visit to Kandahar,
a southern Afghan city, to "secure humanitarian assistance" to the
hostages on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They have returned to Pakistan and the United Nations has no
intention to send another delegation to resolve the problem,
according to Taliban sources.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil said the pilot of the hijacked plane had reported the
technical problems of the aircraft. "When these problems are
solved we will definitely ask the plane to leave," Mutawakil said.
</P>
<P>
Around 160 passengers and crew, most of them Indians, were
facing a third night in their terrifying ordeal on board the
Airbus-300 parked on the runway at the Kandahar airport.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Describes Hijacking as "Indian Plot" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar on Sunday night said the incident of the hijacking of
an Indian plane seemed to be part of a New Delhi design to malign
and isolate Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Since the change of government in Pakistan on October 12, the
Indian government has "made every possible effort to isolate
Pakistan," he told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Islamabad's condemnation of terrorism in all forms,
he regretted "the Indian tirade of baseless and malicious
allegations against Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian government was not disclosing the facts to
the Indian people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh had talked
about the transfer of hijackers from a Pakistan airlines to an
Indian aircraft at Kathmandu, Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Singh did not tell the people that the Pakistan International
Airlines (PIA) flight had left Kathmandu at 10:35 a.m. while the
Indian plane was not even present at that time at the Kathmandu
airport, Sattar said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "There were no transit passengers on the PIA flight
for the Indian airline at Kathmandu."
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Sattar questioned the conduct of the
pilot, the part played by the Indian airline staff at the
Kathmandu airport, the identity of hijackers and their motives,
and "even the accuracy of statements given to us by high Indian
government officials."
</P>
<P>
He said, "The possibility can no longer be ignored" that the
incident may be a preconceived design by a foreign intelligence
organization like what happened in 1971 when India foisted a so-
called hijacking of an Indian airliner to malign Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the conduct of the pilot of the hijacked
plane, he said the captain had not asked for the facilities from
the Indian authorities at Amritsar that he asked at the Lahore
airport of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"He did not make the same request of interception of the
airplane to the Indian authorities. Thirdly, he did not disclose
his destination to the Pakistani authorities when he took off from
Lahore," the foreign minister said, adding, "Fourthly, he told us
that the hijackers were Indians."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the pilot for not telling Pakistan the correct
situation, saying information from Dubai (of the United Arab
Emirates) later indicated that two of the hijackers were Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines Airbus-300 plane, with 185 people on board,
was hijacked Friday on its way from Kathmandu to New Delhi. Before
its landing in southern Afghan city of Kandahar early Saturday,
the plane grounded respectively in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Scores Wounded in Latest Clash in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Scores of people were wounded
in the latest communal clashes in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's
Maluku province, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency Monday, at least 11
civilians and two servicemen were wounded. Meanwhile the Media
Indonesia reported that as many as 42 persons were injured in the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
The wounded, including a journalist of "Suara Maluku" (Voice of
Maluku) daily, were hit by bullets, home-made arrows and shrapnel
of home-made bombs.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out after a group of people learned that
Fauzan Sarijan, 14, was hit by a city bus at Sangadji street.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accident, two groups of Muslims and Christians
gathered at the scene. Security guards fired warning shots but
they failed to disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
"Soon after the warning shots home-made bombs could be heard
exploding," the Jakarta Post quoted eyewitnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rival groups dispersed after two army armored vehicles
arrived at the scene, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the island of Buru near Ambon said that
besides the 22 people killed in last Wednesday's conflict, 55
people still remained missing. However, the Media Indonesia
reported that the conflict had taken a toll of 125 by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Buru fray started after a fight between two youths, a
resident of Wainabe village in Buru Utara Barat and a Pelauw
villager on Haruku island.
</P>
<P>
The province of Maluku, which consists of many islands, has
been rocked by fatal conflicts between Christians and Muslims for
almost a year, leaving hundreds of people dead.
</P>
<P>
The central government, provincial administrations and local
religious leaders have tried their best to put an end to the
violent conflicts, but sporadic clashes continued.
</P>
<P>
National Police chief Gen. Roesmanhadi said last week that the
police could not keep sending reinforcements to safeguard each
island, "otherwise we will run out of personnel."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Indonesian Leaders Exchange Messages on Forging Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council Senior-General Than Shwe and
President of Indonesia K H Abdurrahman Wahid Monday exchanged
messages of felicitations on the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe recalled in his message the time of the two countries
' struggle against colonialism during the final days in the late
1940s.
</P>
<P>
"When we both regained our independence, our friendship and
understanding became even stronger as we have closely cooperated
in defending our freedom and in leading our countries' independent
courses through the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which had
originated from the Bandung Conference," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar cherished the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and highly appreciated the support given by Indonesia
in re-joining of the NAM in 1992 and in becoming a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wahid expressed in his message the firm belief that the binding
bonds of friendship between Indonesia and Myanmar would become
even firmer as both countries belong to the same ASEAN family.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Indonesia established diplomatic relations on
December 27, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Their bilateral trade amounted to 233.7 million U.S. dollars in
the fiscal year 1998-99, up 76.37 percent compared with the
previous year's 132.5 million dollars, according to official
statistics.
</P>

Indonesia is Myanmar's fourth largest trading partner after
Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia among the ASEAN member countries.
</P>

During the past five years, Myanmar absorbed 237.42 million
dollars' investment from Indonesia, which ranked seventh among the
10 major foreign investors in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Ready for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National Y2K Task
Force (NTF) is confident that the island country is ready for
problems related with the millennium bug (Y2K) after having
assessed the Y2K readiness of all critical sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka "will be one of the countries to be least affected by
the Y2K problem," the task force said in a report published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem refers to the danger some computers will not
recognize dates beyond 1999 because their programmers once used
only two digits to refer to years.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998 the need for a national effort was identified in
Sri Lanka and the task force was accordingly established by the
Council for Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank had provided Sri Lanka a loan of 29 million U.S.
dollars for the banking and financial sectors to make them Y2K
ready by carrying out some remediation work.
</P>
<P>
Y2K readiness means updating computer codes to recognize the "
00" in two-digit date fields as 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
Besides the banking and financial sectors, nine other sector
groups have also been appointed by the task force to provide
reports of institutions coming within the sector groups such as
power, telecommunication services, civil aviation and healthcare.
</P>
<P>
Each sector group forwarded two interim reports and the final
report was submitted in July or August this year.
</P>
<P>
"The information received by the NTF indicated that Sri Lanka
is in a position to ensure day to day activities with minimum
disruption," said the report.
</P>
<P>
An event management center will act as the hub of Y2K
operations. It will have communication links to mission-critical
institutions and direct communication with the state media to
issue announcements.
</P>
<P>
The task force has also prepared a national contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan the Electricity Board will prioritize power
supplies in case of shortage of power. Priority will be given to
power generation over other requirements on the use of water
resources during the critical days.
</P>
<P>
Bank statements of December 1999 will be printed as hard copies
and posted by December 31, 1999, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Information technology staff will be on duty to cover midnight
December 31, 1999, and January 1 and 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Storage of water will also be a priority.
</P>
<P>
All key institutions will maintain a round-the-clock check on
all operations, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Extensive awareness programs and publicity campaigns have been
carried out to educate the public through the print and electronic
media.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Lower Prices for Int'l Phone Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 27 (Xinhua) -- In order to attract more
foreign investors and customers, Cambodia plans to reduce the
prices of international calls next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Telecommunication, the prices will
be reduced by some 30 percent, starting March 1, 2000. The
ministry now is drafting the new prices.
</P>
<P>
The prices for international calls in Cambodia are now much
higher than other countries. The calls to the neighboring
countries cost 2.46 U.S. dollars per minute, and 2.6 dollars for
the rest of Asian countries while those to other regions are 2.9
dollars per minute.
</P>
<P>
More phone lines and an increased number of users would make it
possible for the ministry to reduce prices, with the rapid
development of telecommunication and modern technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reducing international call prices, lowering
prices for domestic calls is also under way.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia now has 113,786 telephones, about 20-fold as compared
with six years ago. But the high prices of calls have prevented
many people from making calls, especially international ones.

<HEADLINE> First Bangladeshi Computer Virus Created in 1991 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Home-made computer viruses are
not new in Bangladesh, as the country's first locally-produced
virus, the Dhaka Virus, was created in 1991, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which was created by a local programmer and later
renamed T-virus, was not destructive but intended to disturb the
MS-Word working environment on the screen.
</P>
<P>
The virus used to erase the screen for a few seconds and then
an instruction box appeared to suggest pressing T to go back to
the working environment.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected
computers of several organizations. Some young programmers later
developed remedial programs to get rid of the virus.
</P>
<P>
Another local virus, the White Lion, which spread during 1992-
93, was destructive as it erased document files in the MS-Word
environment.
</P>
<P>
The local viruses have faded out of people's mind because of
their less-destructive nature and the frequent invasion of
international viruses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But computer experts feared that more locally-created viruses
would affect machines across the country as more students enrolled
in computer courses. "It will soon be a reality in Bangladesh
where the local virus creators would reign," computer expert Anko
Shohel was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Withdraw Fund From Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
likely to withdraw fund under the Annual Development Program (ADP)
from 84 projects under 12 ministries, divisions and wings, The
Financial Express reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Funds, allocated against the projects which still remain
unapproved, will be withdrawn unless those are approved by
December 30," the report quoted a meeting of the Planning
Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting evaluated the progress of ADP implementation during
July and December, the first half of the current 1999-2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The Roads and Railway Divisions had the highest number of 21
unapproved projects, followed by the Energy Ministry with 17 and
the Housing and Public Works Department with 13.
</P>
<P>
Some 422 projects under these ministries, divisions and wings
are being implemented under the ADP and 86 of them are scheduled
to be completed by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government announced in June this year an
annual development program of about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars for
fiscal 1999-2000, with 49.50 percent of the fund coming from
foreign donors, covering more than 1,200 projects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non Oil/ Gas Export to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's non oil and gas
commodity export is expected to increase by 11.6 percent annually
between 2000 and 2004, a daily newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"With the assumption that the Indonesian economy would recover,
we expect that for 2000-2004, non oil and gas export would
increase by 11.6 percent each year," Minister of Trade and
Industry Jusuf Kalla was quoted by the Bisnis Indonesia daily
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past few months import of materials for manufacturing
goods showed a rise, so the export is predicted to increase too,"
Kalla added.
</P>
<P>
Based on a Ministry of Trade and Industry report, the value of
the country's non oil and gas export would reach 44.2 billion U.S.
dollars in 2000, 49.3 billion dollars in 2001, 55.1 billions
dollars in 2002, 61.8 billion dollars in 2003 and 69.3 billion
dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The increase of non-oil and gas export mainly would be
supported by textiles, processed wood, electronics, shoes, pulp
and papers and processed palm products, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said a banking recapitalization program is expected to
complete in January-February 2000 so that the banks could disburse
capital credit and trade financing.
</P>
<P>
The value of Indonesia's non-oil and gas export between January-
October 1999 was 32 billion dollars, down 7.1 percent compared
with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's oil and gas commodity import reportedly
went up by 50 percent for November-December 1999 due to the
celebration of Christmas, New Year and Idul Fitri (the Great Day
for Muslims).
</P>
<P>
"Previously, PT Pertamina (a state-run oil and gas company)
imported 4 million barrels of oil each month, but in November and
December, we imported 6 million barrels each month," Director of
Processing of PT Pertamina Samto Utomo was quoted by the daily as
saying.

<P>
According to Afghan Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan Seyed
Haqqani, the hijackers told U.N. officials at the Kandahar airport,
where the plane has been staying since Saturday, that they would
begin killing the passengers on board if the Indian government
fails to satisfy their requirements.
</P>
<P>
There was only one hour left before the deadline when the
Taliban envoy was contacted by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the Airbus-300 plane, with more than 150 hostages
on board, told U.N. officials that the conditions of the plane in
the Kandahar airport were too poor for the plane to take off.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on its route from Kathmandu, Nepal, to
New Delhi last Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a terrifying journey in South Asia and to the Middle East,
the plane landed in Kandahar early Saturday and the hijackers told
the Taliban that they want the Indian government to release a
Kashmiri cleric and other Kashmiris in jails.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, an official from the Indian High Commission in
Pakistan left for Kandahar to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have been complaining about India's "indifference
about the hostages and urged the United Nations and the Indian
government to resolve the hijacking crisis earlier.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya Strives to Revive Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 will go down for
Kenya as a year of struggling to reverse its economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Although growth rate of the east African country has dropped
for the third consecutive year in 1999 with an estimated 1.4
percent after 1.8 percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997, the
economy is likely to recover in the second half of next year,
analysts forecast.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been declining since July 1997 when the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended lending to the country
on the pretext of its poor governance and rampant corruption,
resulting in the withdrawal of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two reasons leading to suspension of IMF loan,
analysts also blame structure constraints, crumbling
infrastructure and bad weather for the economic depression.
</P>
<P>
The first measures taken by the Kenyan government to revamp the
 economy was to streamline the government and fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
In July, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi declared war against
corruption by appointing technocrats drawn from the private sector
to key posts in various ministries, among them was famous
conservationist Richard Leaky, who was named as Head of Civil
Service and given a mandate to clean up government.
</P>
<P>
A number of heads and officials in parastatals, police force
and other departments have been dismissed over graft since the
Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority joined the Criminal Investigations
Department in probe into corrupt cases.
</P>
<P>
In September President Moi announced a major cabinet reshuffle
by cutting the number of ministries from 27 to 15 in a bid to
improve efficiency and reduce public expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The government has deployed special finance officers in various
 ministries as part of the ongoing economic recovery program to
monitor budget implementation on monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
In order to walk out of the economic morass, Kenya also
accelerated privatization process and invested more in the
agriculture sector, which contributes 30 percent of the country's
gross domestic product and about 70 percent of foreign exchange
income.
</P>
<P>
The government in September waived the value added taxes on
inputs for horticultural, vegetable and fruit farming, and spent
12.7 million U.S. dollars on rehabilitating irrigation systems and
roads in major horticulture areas.
</P>
<P>
It has allocated one billion shillings (12 million dollars) to
import chemical fertilizers for tea growers in a bid to reverse
the fall in tea production. Tea accounted for 20 percent of Kenyan
exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government stepped up privatization of
state-owned companies by selling its 100 percent stake in the
Kenya Reinsurance Corporation and two sugar mills.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it decided to sell 49 percent of the Telkom Kenya
and its 35 percent stake in the Kenya Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government has also invited foreign investors to
participate in the management of Mombasa Port.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's efforts to rebuild investors' confidence in the
country's economy have been applauded by the IMF which said
recently that it was ready to begin talks with Kenya on resumption
of aid.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that so long as the ongoing reforms go ahead,
 Kenya is expected to arrest the current slowdown in economic
growth in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Checking Rampant AIDS In Africa Calls for Intl Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Addressing the 11th
International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(ICASA) in Lusaka, Zambia in September, U.N. AIDS agency chief
Peter Piot called for measures with full human and financial
support to target the AIDS problem in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is a state of emergency," he said. "That requires emergency
measures, with full human and financial support. That is the only
way we might make progress."
</P>
<P>
 Africa, particularly the southern part of Africa, holds the
majority of the world's hard-hit countries. According to the
Joint U.N. Program on HIV/ AIDS, there are some 22.5 million
people living in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected with the
virus, which has killed some 11.5 million people. In 1998 alone,
AIDS killed an estimated two million Africans, or 5,500 a day.
</P>
<P>
In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Zambia, current
estimates show that between 20 to 26 percent of people aged 15-49
are living with HIV and AIDS. AIDS is wiping out their development
gains and sharply shortening their life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, a total of 11.2 million children
has been orphaned by AIDS so far and by the end of the year 2000,
the number of AIDS orphans will rise to more than 13 million, most
of them living in sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations took an innovative approach in 1996, drawing
six organizations -- the UNICEF, the United Nations Development
Program, the U.N Population Fund, the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, the WHO and the World Bank -- together
in a joint and co-sponsored program, the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
In order to mobilize more resources, African countries,
together with UNAIDS co-sponsors and bilateral development
agencies, resort to international assistance for fighting against
AIDS in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, leaders from over 20 African countries and the
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) held a summit in Algiers,
vowing to push forward regional and international partnership in
an effort to curb the No.1 killer in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a broad cross-section of African NGOs resolved in
Dakar, Senegal, in August this year to play an active role in
promoting the goals and activities of the International
Partnership against AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The International Partnership against AIDS in Africa is working
to fight the epidemic through strong national programs backed by
four main lines of action: encouraging visible and sustained
political support, helping to develop nationally-negotiated joint
plans of action, increasing financial resources and strengthening
national and regional technical capacity.
</P>
<P>
Experience from some African countries show that when
governments commit their political prestige and financial
resources, fully involve civil society and respond to the disease
through a wide range of prevention, care and support activities,
the rate of new infections can be slowed and societies can begin
to cope effectively with the HIV epidemic.
</P>
<P>
As one of the first countries in Africa where HIV was
recognized, the effect of the AIDS epidemic in Uganda was once
severe.
</P>
<P>
But in 1986, the Ugandan government responded to the AIDS
epidemic by becoming one of the first countries in Africa to
collaborate with the WHO to create a national AIDS control
program, which involves 13 AIDS Control Programs operating out of
12 government ministries.
</P>
<P>
Through carrying out extensive education campaigns aimed at
preventing further spread of HIV, promdeclines in the rate of HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, for the first time, the National AIDS Control
Program, supported by the UNAIDS, carried out this year an
extensive consultation with a wide range of stake-holders,
including the business sector represented by the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Zambia
Federation of Employers and the Zambia Congress of Trade Union
from which emerged the process of developing a National Strategy
Plan for 1999- 2000.
</P>
<P>
All participants welcomed the establishment of a business
coalition on HIV/AIDS in the country to support and facilitate
activities on a regular basis. Some people described the positive
response by the business sector to form a coalition to fight the
pandemic as the only and last solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these efforts and the progress made, the AIDS
problem still remains a dooming threat, with the situation worse
than ever.
</P>
<P>
The strongly felt negative consequences of the deadly AIDS
pandemic today will be present for many more years to come, not
only for the African continent, but for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the whole regional and international community must
be galvanized to help resolve this problem.
</P>
<P>
"We must all join hands of the people of the world against a
silent killer that threatens our lives and the very fabric of our
existence," stressed South African President Thabo Mbeki while
marking the World AIDS Day on December 1.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Announces New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski announced the line-up of a new cabinet on
Sunday, according to news reaching here from Skopje, capital of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski, head of the last government which resigned last
week due to political unrest and charges of voting irregularities
in the December 10 presidential elections, made the announcement
at a press conference in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Mandated by President Boris Trajkovski last Friday, Georgievski,
chairman of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-
Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (IMRO-DPMNU),
reshuffled the ruling government, with the foreign and defense
ministers unchanged and streamlined it from 26 to 25 members, with
24 ministers.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister did not name a vice premier but said the new
vice premiership will be set at the first government meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the new cabinet, the IMRO will hold 11 posts, the Democratic
Alternative eight and the Democratic Party of Albanians five. The
two posts given up by the IMRO and the Democratic Alternative were
annulled.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason of the old government's resignation, the
prime minister of the former Yugoslav republic said "recent
indications ... showed that we experienced a political crisis and
that citizens have not been satisfied with the government. We,
therefore, undertook this reconstruction to meet the people's
demand for a change."

<P>
He will submit the list of the new cabinet to the parliament
for approval on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Shas Threatens to Quit Ruling Coalition: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The ultra-Orthodox Jewish
Shas party Monday threatened to quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
ruling coalition, triggering the first major government crisis
since Barak took office in July.
</P>
<P>
Leading rabbis of Shas, the second largest party in Barak's
coalition with 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
decided that Shas should resign from the government, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Shas' move apparently showed its anger with the government for
its failure to fork out millions of dollars to bail out Shas'
bankrupt schools.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Party leader Eli Yishai has informed Barak of
decision, but Barak has asked Yishai to wait 48 hours for a try to
solve the spat.
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, Shas has either voted for bills
presented by opposition, or voted against or abstained in votes of
bills tabled by the coalition, although it denied its voting was
connected to the ongoing dispute.
</P>
<P>
Should Shas, which draws support from lower-class Sephardic Jews
with origins in Arab states, quit, Barak's government will become a
minority government, with only 51 seats.
</P>
<P>
Another ultra-orthodox party withdrew three months ago over a
dispute on work permits in Jewish weekend Shabbat, which had taken
away five seats from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak chose Shas as a coalition partner mainly because he wanted
to garner as much as support for his peace policy with Arab
neighbors. Shas holds a moderate position in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of Shas, it will be difficult for any peace
agreement Barak reaches with Syria to get approval by the
parliament since Israeli laws stipulate that an agreement with
Syria must be supported by an absolute majority of 61 legislators.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the unexpected decision was taken to
pressure Barak for concessions over the funding.
</P>
<P>
The religious party heavily rely on government subsidies. It has
raised similar threats in previous governments.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Palestinian Leaders to Discuss Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is expected to visit Egypt on Tuesday to discuss with President
Hosni Mubarak the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Mubarak on the outcome of his recent meetings
and contacts with world leaders on the Middle East peace process,
notably a message he received from President of the United States
Bill Clinton, Zohdi al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated in the message the U.S. and his personal
pledge to help push forward the peace drive on the Palestinian
track, Zohdi was quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also keep Mubarak posted on Israel's failure to
honor the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum, referring to the delay in
troops withdrawal from the West Bank and the release of Palestinian
prisoners, the Palestinian diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has released 350 Palestinian prisoners in two stages
since the deal was signed in September. But the two sides failed to
agree on the names of a third batch, postponing the release that
was to have taken place before the Muslim holy fasting month of
Ramadan beginning two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to get advice on the peace talks
from Mubarak, who, as president of the first Arab country to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Crisis or A Farce?  (by Tan Xinmu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The five-month-old coalition
of Prime Minister Ehud Barak saw its first major crisis Monday as
the powerful ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas party threatened to quit
over a budget dispute.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected decision of Shas was made by its spiritual
leaders to protest against the government's refusal to fund its
debt-ridden schools. The party has demanded in the last five months
that the government fork out the 100 million shekels (about 24
million U.S. dollars) of debts in its school and welfare networks.
</P>
<P>
It was especially furious after the treasury reached agreements
with two small religious parties Sunday over their budget demands,
which were much bigger than its demand. The party gave Barak 24
hours to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Shas, the second largest coalition partner
that controls 17 seats in the Knesset (parliament), would leave
Barak with a minority government with only 51 seats in the 120-
member legislature.
</P>
<P>
Its withdrawal would make it harder for Barak to garner wide
support for the ongoing final-status talks with the Palestinians
and the just-renewed talks with Syria. He has promised to present
any peace agreement with the Palestinians or Syria to a national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
After winning the election in May, Barak almost exhaust the 45
days given him by the laws to form a coalition of 75 seats, the
widest parliamentary majority in decades.
</P>
<P>
He knew that he needed a wide-based government as he entered key
peace talks that would require painful territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important decisions Barak made then was choosing
Shas as a coalition partner instead of the right-wing Likud, the
second largest party in the parliament with 19 seats. The main
reason was that Shas is moderate on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak had lost seven seats after another ultra-orthodox party
withdrew its support over a dispute on working permits on the
Jewish weekend Shabbat and two members of a Russian immigrant party
bolted from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But analysts believe that Shas' threat was mostly aimed at
squeezing final concessions from the government before the national
budget was approved.
</P>
<P>
A party that draws support from low-income Sephardic Jews with
origins in Middle Eastern and North African nations, Shas relies
heavily on government funds for its school and welfare networks,
which are instrumental in its efforts to get support.
</P>
<P>
It has joined every government - rightist, leftist, or centrist
- since its inception 15 years ago. In other words, it needs a
government more than a government needs it.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous governments, Barak has several alternatives to
Shas party if it quits. Barak could take in several small left-wing
or secular parties. At least one party, the six-member Shinui party
that was elected on a platform opposing religious coercion over
public lives, has offered to join in immediately after Shas'
pullout.
</P>
<P>
Barak could also form a unity government with the Likud, which
suffered a humiliating defeat in the May election and had showed
interest in joining in soon after the election.
</P>
<P>
Equally important, Barak can rely on the support of three Arab
parties from outside the coalition. These parties, which control 10
seats in the parliament, are unlikely to risk the danger of
toppling a left-wing or centrist government.
</P>
<P>
In other word, Shas' withdrawal would not pose an immediate and
serious threat to Barak's coalition.
</P>
<P>
For Barak, he would of course prefer resolving the current
dispute with Shas and keep it in the coalition. He has expressed
confidence that the problem could be resolved very soon, hinting
that he might agree to some kind of compromise.
</P>
<P>
Some coalition members have begun to criticize Education
Minister Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist secular party Meretz,
for his tough stand on the funding of Shas' school system. Sarid
has insisted that Shas adopt a plan reforming its school system
before it can get government funding.
</P>
<P>
Even President Ezer Weizman came to the rescue. He met Shas
leader Eli Yishai soon after the Shas announcement and urged him to
stay in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Shas has issued similar threats before the national
budget was finalized. It was not highly probable that this time
would be different.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Israeli military Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Israeli military
leaders began their two-day annual strategic talks in Tel Aviv on
Monday, with the just-renewed Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations
topping the agenda, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 30-strong Turkish delegation is led by Deputy Chief of
General Staff Edip Baser, consisting of officials from the general
staff, defense and foreign ministries, while the Israeli delegation
is headed by Defense Minsitry Director General Amos Yoran.
</P>
<P>
As Israel and Syria are to reconvene in Washington early next
month, a debate in Turkey on how a possible peace between Tel Aviv
and Damascus may affect Ankara gather pace.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, forging an ever-stronger partnership with Israel, and at
odds with Syria over the last 15 years, has been following the
talks very closely.
</P>
<P>
Turkish concerns are centered on the water issue, the
redeployment of Syrian troops, the Syrian stance on anti-Turkish
terrorist groups in its territory, future U.S.-Syrian relations and
the effects of a Syrian-Israeli peace on Turkish-Israeli ties.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Israeli officials were quoted as saying prior to
the talks that the Israeli side would like to reiterate that any of
possible agreements between Israel and Syria would not harm
Turkey's interests.
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that Turkey is very important to Israel,
adding that "an greement with Syria will only enhance the stability
in the region and contribute to security of Turkey. We will not do
anything that can endanger Israel's ties with Turkey."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides will exchange views on further
military and political cooperation, radical Islamic movements in
the Middle East and joint efforts against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Modernizing Turkish Army's M-60 tanks by Israel and the sale of
Israeli attack helicopters to Turkey are expected to be discussed
within the famework of bilateral cooperation in the field of
defense industry.

<HEADLINE> Syria Defines Principles in Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principles are Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan
Heights, Israeli return to the borders of June 4, 1967, balanced
security arrangements, future bilateral ties and water sharing in
the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has said that Israel and
Syria would try to work out a declaration of principles in the
second round of talks on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The radio in its comment asserted that the coming round will
test the seriousness of Israel on the land-for-peace principle.
Syria and Israel resumed peace talks on December 15 after a 45-
month freeze.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world and international community are unanimous in
supporting the Middle East peace process and agree that no fair and
comprehensive peace will be achieved without peace between Syria
and Israel, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
President Hafez Al-Assad has said that peace was a pressing need
for the region and the world at large and Syria, considering peace
a strategic option would take steps towards peace. Syria would not
put obstacles before the peace process, he reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The comment voiced hope that the other party (Israel) would not
plant any obstacles in the way toward peace. Peace is the only
guarantee of security, stability and progress in the region, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Peace can not be established without the return of the legal
rights to their owners, namely the return of the Golan to Syria and
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and occupied Palestinian
lands, it added.
</P>
<P>
The comment also stressed U.S. active involvement in the peace
process with a view to establishing a just, permanent and
comprehensive peace in the region.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The first Bahraini passenger
ship in more than nine years arrived at southern Iraq's Umm Qasr
port on Monday, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Jabal Ali, which left the Bahraini port of Salman on
Sunday afternoon, carried on board some 200 passengers, most of
whom are Muslim pilgrims from the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, said INA.
</P>
<P>
Among the travellers were Gulf businessmen bidding for new
contracts under the oil-for-food program which allows Iraq to
export limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian supplies for its
people.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Bahraini ship marks the resumption of sea
links between Iraq and Bahrain, which have been out of service
since the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee approved earlier this year the
opening of two shipping lines between Iraq and Bahrain and Qatar to
transport passengers.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, under the permission of the committee, the
United Arab Emirates opened the first shipping line to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that celebrations were planned in Umm Qasr and
Basra, another southern Iraq's port city.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Undersecretary of Transport and Communication Ministry
Jameel Ibrahim said that Iraq and Bahrain had agreed to facilitate
measures and mechanism to operate this shipping line.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said his ministry had provided modern means of
transportation in Umm Qasr port to carry passengers from Bahrain to
other Iraqi provinces, especially to those sacred religious
shrines.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the idea of opening this shipping line had been
welcomed in Bahrain and other Gulf Arab states because it will
reduce the burdens of long time travel by land to Iraq, which has
also been under an air ban.
</P>
<P>
Under the air embargo, the 1,000-kilometer Iraqi-Jordanian road
has become the only passage to Iraq for all but those U.N. weapons
inspectors who flew to Iraq by helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Countries Asked to Help for a Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Monday called on
foreign countries to assist efforts for a solution of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides briefed foreign ambassadors
here on his government's positions in the light of developments in
the U.N.-sponsored Cyprus proximity talks in New York and the
European Union summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Kasoulides stressed that all those
who could assist such efforts should continue doing so both in the
course of the second and third rounds of proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks aimed at reviving the stalled
peace talks in the island were held in New York on December 3-14.
The two sides have agreed to hold the second round of talks in
Geneva on January 27.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that "it has been shown that Turkey can,
if it desires, have a positive influence on Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Denktash finally entered proximity talks, despite
preconditions he had set, "because Turkey advised him to do so."
Denktash insisted that his breakaway state in northern Cyprus be
recognized internationally and a solution be based on a
confederation of two states before any talks could be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that active involvement of foreign governments
could also yield results.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision at its Helsinki summit early this month to
continue entry talks with Cyprus upset Turkey and Turkish Cypriots,
who maintained that it as wrong for the EU to negotiate with the
Clerides government, because it did not represent the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides expressed satisfaction because foreign countries had
reiterated their support to a solution of the Cyprus issue in the
framework of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.

With these figures taken into account, the report said, the
total foreign debt and commitments stand at 22 billion by September
22.
</P>
<P>
Iran's current account in the six months had a surplus of 2.116
billion dollars compared to 1.770 billion dollars of deficit in the
same period last Iranian year, it said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Rejects Attempts to Isolate Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 27 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
Monday that Russia's main foreign policy task is to prevent
attempts to isolate Russia under the pretext of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at the
Kremlin, Yeltsin gave the Russian Foreign Ministry a "B+" for its
performance in the outgoing year, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry's objective in the coming year is to deter
those forces "trying to create a regime for Russia's international
isolation," Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov urged the West to stop talking about sanctions over
Russia's military campaign against rebels in its breakaway
republic of Chechnya and embark on dialogue instead.
</P>
<P>
"The language of sanctions is not a language in which one can
and may speak to Russia," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov denied that Russia's ties with the West is
witnessing a new low.
</P>
<P>
"Such assessments are far from reality," he said, noting that
Moscow has maintained permanent contacts with Western countries at
the political level.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the presence of "differences of principle with
Western countries on the situation in the North Caucasus, but this
need not to be dramatized," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There are cases when even allies have serious differences," he
said. "It is necessary to step up a dialogue and to look for
coordinated approaches."
</P>
<P>
In another related development, Yeltsin sent U.S. President
Bill Clinton a Christmas and New Year's message, urging joint
efforts to find solutions to the most complex problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kremlin Press Service, Yeltsin said the
outgoing year was not an easy one for Russian-U.S. relations and a
lot of effort was put into strengthening a positive beginning in
bilateral ties.

<P>
ROME, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Atlantic weather front which
battered much of Europe over the Christmas weekend leaving a trail
of death and destruction was Monday bringing winds of up to 135 km
per hour to central Italy.
</P>
<P>
In the north-central Marche cities of Urbino and Macerata,
winds averaging 60 km per hour, with gusting of up to 135 km per
hour, toppled trees to down high-tension lines, lifted roof-tiles
and blew down billboards and scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
Power outages were reported in various areas around the region
and in the neighboring Abruzzo region where express highways to
and from L'Aquila, in the Apennines, and Pescara, on the Adriatic
coast, were closed to some types of truck trailers and caravans.
</P>
<P>
Also in the southern Calabria region, high winds, driving
torrential rains, were causing havoc and forcing the closure of
highways blocked by fallen trees.
</P>
<P>
In many towns and cities in the region, firefighters were kept
busy coping with wind-borne roof-tiles and gutters and fallen
chimneys.

ROME, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Four climbers died Sunday under
an avalanche in the Alpine Argentera valley east of Turin, between
Susa and Sestriere near the French border, and one of their

Monday morning, rescue teams found the bodies of three of them,
brothers aged 20 and 24, and that of a friend, 26.

Another young man was found semi-buried by the avalanche and

<HEADLINE> Calgary Witnesses Warmest Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's western city of
Calgary, Alberta, witnessed an ever warmest Christmas holiday with
nearly 18 degrees Celsius recorded in the daytime.
</P>
<P>
The city's temperature hit 17.6 on Christmas Eve in contrast to
the usual figures on the Celsius scale from minus 3.6 degrees for
the daytime and minus 15.7 at night -- at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Other warmest records for December in the city were 19.4
degrees on December 5, 1939 and 18 degrees on December 4, 1988,
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The third warmest day, however, was the first to fall on
Christmas time, the previous two having been far earlier in
December.
</P>
<P>
Calgary by far was the country's hottest big city on both
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when Calgarians were being seen
wandering around in shorts and sandals, without socks.
</P>
<P>
Some ended up cooking part of their Christmas meals on the
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
Calgary's fire department was driven to send out emergency
warnings to citizens to avoid walking on the dangerously thin ice
of rivers.
</P>
<P>
The department carried out six rescue operations after people
plunged through the shaky ice on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
If the forecast high temperatures keep up until the end of the
month, Calgary will record the hottest December ever, with the
average daily high temperature for the month reaching about 6.9
degrees, a local forecaster was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The weird winter comes after a bizarre summer swooped down on
the city, where citizens were shocked at a sudden snowfall on July
15.
</P>
<P>
A paradox is that Calgary's Christmas Eve was even warmer than
12 days of the city's frigid July this year.
</P>
<P>
The expected La Nina force has yet to prove itself with a
wetter, cooler winter than normal. The drier and much warmer
weather witnessed by far have put forecasters at a loss what to
explain.
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about it and I say we're living La Nina
Loca," Environment Canada forecaster Pieter Spyker was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Kills Eight in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight people died during a
Christmas weekend of atrocious weather with hundreds of families
in southern England still facing the threat of flooding.
</P>
<P>
While the south has struggled with two days of rain, many other
parts of Britain are experiencing freezing conditions with snow
and black ice causing major problems on the roads, BBC reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
An 80-year-old man from Nottinghamshire who had not been seen
since taking his dog for a walk Sunday afternoon has been found in
a field.
</P>
<P>
The alarm was raised after the man's dog returned home in
freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, flood alerts remain across southern England, with
the Environment Agency saying all rivers are swollen in the area
with 15 red alerts in place.
</P>
<P>
The Thames barrier will be closed Monday and with more rain
expected, the agency is warning that the risk of flooding could
continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Almost 48 hours of continuous rain has left rivers in Kent and
Sussex flowing dangerously fast.
</P>
<P>
Ray Kemp of the Environment Agency warned that trees blocking
rivers would cause flooding due to the volume of water in the
waterways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the freezing conditions further north -- along with
high winds -- have made travel conditions treacherous.
</P>
<P>
Police believe icy conditions may have contributed to a three-
car pile up in which two children were killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The freezing conditions were continuing in many parts of
Britain Monday, with motorists warned to take extra care.

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands Gives Century Picture of Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The working population in the
Netherlands has changed in terms of both size and composition in
the course of the 20th century, the Dutch government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While giving a picture of the economy in this century, the
government said that about 1.9 million people out of a total
population of 5.1 million had a job in 1899. The size of the
working population in 1998 was 6.6 million while the total
population was 15.7 million last year.
</P>
<P>
The share of agriculture has fallen steadily over the century
and is now nearly nine times as small as a century ago, the
government said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization of the Netherlands at the start of the
century is clearly visible, it pointed out. "From the 1960s
onwards the Netherlands has been transformed from a goods into a
services economy: nearly three quarters of all people now work in
this sector," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the personal contribution in the Dutch economy,
the government said each person in employment contributed less
than a thousand guilders, the Dutch currency, at the start of this
century. At that time, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the
Netherlands amounted to around 1.8 billion guilders (currently 0.
83 million U.S. dollars). In guilders of today, the contribution
per employed person at the beginning of the century would have
been over 20,000 guilders (9,217 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The GDP in 1999 has risen to 820 billion guilders (378 billion
U.S. dollars), while each person in employment now generates
around 120,000 guilders (55,300 U.S. dollars), the government said.
</P>
<P>
The composition of household consumption has also changed
radically this century. "Whereas food, beverages and tobacco
swallowed up nearly half the budget of family households in 1900,
the share now is less than 12 percent. Goods and services have
become roughly 20 times as expensive since 1900," it added.

<HEADLINE> Most Greeks Worried About Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- With the nearing of the end of
1999, most Greeks believe that the millennium bug will have an
adverse effect on their public utilities as computers try to
change over the year 2000, according to a poll published in the
Greek newspaper "Ta Nea" Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which was taken by the "Year 2000" Working Group set
up by the Greek government, showed that seven in 10 Greeks feared
that the millennium bug would cause cuts in power, water and phone
lines as 1999 ended.
</P>
<P>
The respondents also believed that payment of wages and
pensions would also be affected by the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
So far, Greece has spent an estimated 15 billion drachmas (
about 45.9 million U.S. dollars) to deal with the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Greece said last month that it was fully prepared to tackle any
problems caused by the millennium bug in computer and electronic
systems in the public sector at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But there had been delays in dealing with the millennium bug in
the country's private sector and in some smaller size
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Greece had contingency plans ready in the event of any problem
with the establishment of a special operations room at the
Secretariat General for Civil Protection specifically to deal with
problems related to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
As a precautionary measure on December 31, the Athens Stock
Exchange and all central financial and credit institutions in
Greece will be closed for business.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Expanded U.N. Military Presence in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Eckard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
Annan last week wrote to the president of the Security Council for
the month of December, Jeremy Greenstock who is the British
ambassador to the United Nations, recommending that the U.N.
Mission in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL, be expanded to "close
to 10 thousand military personnel," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said in the letter that Nigeria, Ghana
and Guinea were all preparing to withdraw their troops from the
Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG)
force in Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Sierra Leone continues to pose a threat to
peace and security in the region," Annan said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much concerned that the repatriation of ECOMOG
troops in the immediate future, without adequate security
protection provided by other peacekeepers, would create a
dangerous security gap in key areas," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan was recommending that the Security Council authorize the
addition of up to four infantry battalions and support personnel
to UNAMSIL as soon as possible, and that the force be mandated to
provide security at Lungi airport in the capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
More details of Annan's concept of an expanded UNAMSIL will be
provided in a report to the 15-nation Security Council on January
20, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, also in the letter, said that he had appealed to
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to review his decision to
withdraw Nigerian troops from the West African peacekeeping force,
but Obasanjo confirmed on December 21 that this troops would start
leaving in January and complete their pullout in February.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG helped end Sierra Leone's civil war and
pave the way for the July 7 cease-fire signed by the government
and rebels who terrorized the country for some eight years.
</P>
<P>
To back the cease-fire, the Security Council on October 22
authorized the deployment of a 6,000-strong peacekeeping force to
monitor its implementation and disarm fighters.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. force has been very slow in arriving, with only
several hundred Kenyan and Indian peacekeepers in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Forms Juridical Team for The Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan government has
formed a juridical team to face the trial against Honduras at the
International Court of Justice at The Hague, reported Monday "La
Prensa " daily paper.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's juridical team is made up by former foreign
minister Alejandro Montiel Aguello, former vice foreign minister
Edmundo Castillo, ex juridical director of the Foreign Ministry
Agusto Zamora and ambassador to the United Nations Alfonso Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua presented December 8 the demand against Honduras
before International Court of Justice of The Hague, where it asks
to determine the limit of maritime spaces on the Caribbean sea of
both Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
In this treaty, Colombia recognizes that Honduras' maritime
limit with Nicaragua stands at parallel 15, while Nicaragua
considers its limits in this zone stand at parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre said the demand
is being presented because "every intent Nicaragua has carried out
to come to a friendly accord with Honduras with regard to the
delimiting of its maritime spaces was unfruitful".
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Carlos Arguello Gomez, agent from Nicaragua at The Hague
said this trial against Honduras may cost between 5 and 7 million
dollars and last at least four years.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, from 1958 until November of this year, has in four
instances resorted to the International Court of Justice of The
Hague, with a result of 2 triumphs, 1 defeat and 1 abandoned cause.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, issued here
Monday, Annan said, "It is my hope that the results of the
legislative elections signal the emergence of an era of
pluralistic democracy."
</P>
<P>
Annan's report was mainly on development in the West African
country and the activities of the U.N. Peace-Building Force Office
in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS).
</P>
<P>
Annan said that since no clear winner emerged from the November
28 presidential elections, the formation of a new government was
not expected before February 2000, following the second round of
voting schedule for January 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called on Member States and interested
organizations to provide assistance in the conduct of the runoff
elections.
</P>
<P>
As for the activities of UNOGBIS, Annan said that following
consultations with Guinea-Bissau's interim government and Security
Council members, it had been recently agreed to extend the mission
's mandate for a three-month period until March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the continued success and effectiveness of the
U.N. office in Guinea-Bissau depended, in part, on the
availability of adequate resources. He stressed the "unwavering
support" of the international community was crucial for meeting
the challenges of ensuring sustainable peace and progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While pointing to "rather positive background" of latest
developments, Annan, however, said he was compelled to reiterate
his concern about the continued detention of military and
personnel prisoners in appalling conditions.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to "all concerned" in Guinea-Bissau to speed up the
judicial process and to take action to improve the detainees'
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The second-round runoff in Guinea-Bissau's presidential
elections is scheduled for January 16.

The U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told a press conference here
that the arrest of the 27-year Albanian suspect was made on the
basis of information received from witnesses, marking the first

<HEADLINE> Half of Forests in Urban Paris Destroyed by Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the trees of the
forests of Boulogne and Vincennes, the two most important forests
in urban Paris, were destroyed by Sunday's Storm which was
described as "a disaster and devastation."
</P>
<P>
"We need about three years to clean up these trees. As for the
reconstruction of our green heritage, it will need decades. So
many trees standing for hundreds of years were touched," a
government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 trees, many of which are tens of meters high and
several meters wide in girth, were torn up or pulled down by the
stormy wind in Boulogne and Vincennes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 2,000 trees out of a total of 35,000 in the
public parks and gardens in urban Paris were torn up, while 500
trees along the streets and 1,000 in the cemeteries were destroyed,
said the officials.
</P>
<P>
A botanical center in Rungis outside Paris, where the city of
Paris produces three million trees of decoration each year, was
also severely damaged with its storehouses devastated.
</P>
<P>
One race horse in the Vincennes was killed and another injured
by a collapsing house on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Paris looks desolate and some parts of the city devastated with
fallen trees seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The municipal services are doing their best to clean up some
important tourists' sites such as Tower Eiffel and Champs-Elysees
in expectation of a celebration for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But the mood of Parisians for celebrating the arrival of the
new millennium is more than darkened by Sunday's storm attack.

<HEADLINE> China to Become Global Manufacturing Center for GE CT Scanners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua)-- General Electric (GE), a world
giant in medical equipment manufacturing, announced here today
that a GE joint venture in Beijing will become one of the most
important global producers of helical CT scanners.
</P>
<P>
Chih Chen, President of GE Medical System, said at a news
conference that the move indicated that GE has transferred its
advanced CT scanner's research, development and manufacturing
centers from the U.S. and Japan to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said the GE joint venture plans to produce 500 CT ProSpeed
Ai, or epochal slipring helical CT scanners, a new model of CT
scanners, in Beijing in the coming year. The number accounts for
one-fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
David C. Wang, Chairman and CEO of GE (China) Ltd, said that
this development proves GE's confidence in China's further
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 percent of the advanced CT scanners produced in
Beijing will be exported to the U.S., Japan and European markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the move will enable China to rank among the world's
top five CT manufacturers in 2000. The other four are the U.S.,
Japan, Germany and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He added that the joint venture -- GE Hangwei Medical Systems
Co, Ltd -- will be located in the Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts here said the advanced CT scanner represents
the mid-level CT scanners of the 21st century. Apart from raising
the scanning speed and improving the efficiency of detection, the
CT scanner can also minimize X-ray damage to patients.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in addition to building the new plant in Beijing,
GE has also started construction of a joint venture for making
plastic products. The project will use 30 million U.S. dollars of
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said GE also announced it had built two joint ventures in
Shanghai to make circuit breakers, switches and related products.

KATHMANDU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat dismissed on Monday news reports that the hijackers
arrived at Kathmandu by a Pakistan International Airways (PIA)
flight and sneaked into the IC 814 flight through transit lounge
half an hour before it took off last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahat told a press conference that preliminary investigation
showed that reports of the hijackers entering the Indian airlines
directly from the PIA was baseless.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani airplane landed at 9:25 a.m. and took off
at 10:36 a.m. whereas the Indian airlines landed at 3:36 p.m. and
took off at 4:27 p.m. and there was no one at the transit lounge
during that time gap.
</P>
<P>
Indian media reports said that four Pakistani landed at the
Tribhuvan International Airport around 3:20 p.m. and boarded the
Indian airlines flight half an hour before it took off.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said there was no base in the rumor that one of the
hijackers was a Nepali.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the hijackers had any heavy weapons
including AK47 rifles and grenades.

"Some of the Falun Gong members claimed at that time that Falun
Dafa is the law that should be upheld, not the laws of the country,
" Zhou said. "However, those that opposed the law and acted as
enemies of the people will be severely punished according to the
law."
</P>
<P>
Ju Hongju, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of
Siping City, Jilin Province, noted that the sentences have
preserved the integrity of the law and reflected public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Many people from the legal circle in east China's Jiangsu
province noted that the court's sentences were fact-based and just.
Xue Jimin, vice chairman of the Nanjing Lawyers Association, said
that sufficient evidence existed to charge the four cult members
with the three crimes.

News of the sentences reverberated across the north China
province of Hebei. Li Jinchang, former head of a Falun Gong

cult had endangered the country and brought harm to the
practitioners themselves.

what I can to help other practitioners see the true nature of
Falun Gong and its dangers," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Special Meeting to Tackle Palestinian Prisoners Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Monday invited his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran to
attend an extraordinary meeting to discuss Israel's decision to
release 28 Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security cabinet on Sunday approved the release of 28
Palestinian prisoners who have served long terms in Israel's
prisons.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat said the decision is one-sided and in
contradiction to the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed by Israel
and the Palestinians in September, the Voice of Palestine radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the memorandum has explicitly called for
bilateral coordination through the joint Palestinian-Israeli
committee in charge of the prisoners issue, in deciding who are to
be freed.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, Israel released 350 Palestinian prisoners
on September 9 and October 15.
</P>
<P>
Also under the memorandum, Israel should release another batch
of Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holy fasting month of
Ramadan which started from December 8.
</P>
<P>
But the release was postponed until now as the two sides failed
to agree on the list of prisoners to be freed.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of State of Prisoners Affairs Hisham Abdul
Raziq said on Sunday that the Palestinian National Authority would
not accept any criminals to be released by Israel instead of those
political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Key Coalition Partner Threatens to Quit: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A key partner in Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's ruling coalition Monday threatened to
quit the government, triggering the first major government crisis
since Barak took office five months ago.
</P>
<P>
Leading rabbis of the ultra-Orthodox religious party Shas, the
second largest party in Barak's coalition with 17 parliamentary
seats, recommended that Shas should resign from the government,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The move was apparently made over a heated dispute with the
government over the funding of Shas' debt-ridden school system.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has refused to provide millions of shekels
of additional funds in the national budget as Shas demanded unless
the party adopted a plan reforming its school system first.
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, Shas has either voted for bills
presented by the opposition, or voted against or abstained in votes
of bills tabled by the coalition, although it denied its voting was
connected to the ongoing dispute.
</P>
<P>
If Shas withdrew its forces from the government, Barak would be
left with a government with only 51 seats in the 120-member
parliament. The coalition had held 75 seats, the widest
parliamentary majority in decades, before another ultra-Orthodox
party withdrew its five members three months ago over a dispute
over work permits in Jewish weekend Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Barak chose Shas as a coalition partner after winning a general
election in May mainly because he wanted to garner as much as
support for his peace policy with Israel's Arab neighbors. Shas
holds a moderate position in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of Shas, any peace agreement Barak reached
with Syria would be difficult to get approval by the parliament
since Israeli laws stipulate that an agreement with Syria must be
supported by an absolute majority of 61 legislators.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the unexpected decision, observers here believed
that it was likely that Shas was only trying to put pressure on
Barak in order to squeeze his concessions in the national budget.
</P>
<P>
The religious party, which represents low-income immigrants,
will run into financial difficulties because it heavily relies on
government subsidies. It has issued similar threats to previous
governments before.

57.
</P>
<P>
Mayfield died Sunday morning at the North Fulton Regional
Hospitalin Roswell, Ga., a nurse said. No details were given at
the request of his family.
</P>
<P>
Mayfield suffered a serious accident in August 1990. While
performing at an outdoor concert in New York, a lighting rig
collapsed on him, damaging his spine and leaving him a
quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
He is one of the few people to have been inducted more than
once into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was first inducted
with his gospel-soul group, the Impressions, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He was inducted again in 1999 for his solo career, which began
in 1970 after he left the Impressions.
</P>
<P>
Mayfied also became a Grammy Legend Award winner in 1994 an
Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner the next year.
</P>
<P>
Mayfield's hits included the soundtrack from "Superfly" and the
seminal singles "People Get Ready" and "Keep On Pushing."
</P>
<P>
His 1972 soundtrack to the film "Superfly" sold more than 4
million copies and received four Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago on June 3, 1942, Mayfield began singing by the
age of seven. He taught himself to play the guitar and began
writing and composing music, under the influence of his mother,
who loved poetry. His talents led him into a career in music,
which began in 1957, and lasted nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Even after leaving the stage his presence continued to be felt
in the work of other U.S. artists.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Whitney Houston, Elton John, The Isley Brothers and
Aretha Franklin recorded his composition in a special tribute
called, "All Men Are Brothers: A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield."

<HEADLINE> China to Audit Web Site Traffic with Unified Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The China Internet Network
Information Center (CINIC) and a group of web companies recently
proposed that web sites use unified standards to more accurately
gauge their traffic.
</P>
<P>
Mao Wei, director of the CINIC, explained that such a system
would remove the guesswork from the current web site auditing and
boost the development of net advertising and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
He said that web site traffic totals are not accurate now
because different web sites use different measurement criterion.
Some use figures based on amounts of hits on the sites, while
others determine volume totals through numbers of user sessions.
</P>
<P>
CINIC has formulated a set of new statistics terms and
evaluation standards, and is cooperating with Asiainfo
Technologies (China),Inc, to set up a third-party auditing system.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, when China linked with the Internet, the country
has seen breakneck development in its web economy. By the end of
this June, China had four million people with Internet access and
had set up nearly 10,000 web sites.

<HEADLINE> Manila Investigates Sinking of Ill-fated Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it is thoroughly investigating the sinking of M/V Asia
South Korea, which sank off Bantayan Island in Cebu in the central
Philippines last Thursday and killed more than 40 people.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera, secretary of the Department of Transportation
and Communications, said that the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)
divers have located the ill-fated vessel.
</P>
<P>
Initial ocular inspection has revealed that the vessel suffered
a long, deep dent on its port (left) side, close to the fan tail --
confirming earlier reports by survivors that the ship has
apparently ran aground and hit a hard object prior to sinking.
</P>
<P>
The vessel reportedly left Cebu City for Iloilo City with 606
passengers and 52 crewmen about 23:00 (15:00 GMT) last Wednesday
and sank at about 5:00 last Thursday (21:00 GMT Wednesday) off
Bantayan Island, about 300 kilometers southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The PCG has confirmed that the area of the sinking is generally
shallow, with some nearby large rocky formations lying in just a
fathom (1.8 meter) of water.
</P>
<P>
According to the PCG, these dangerous shallow waters are
clearly identified on the navigational charts and could have been
easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
The ship's captain, Porferio Labagday, has yet to explain why
the ship strayed from its pre-plotted course toward this area.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, owner of the ferry, immediately took
custody of Captain Labagday and the Chief Mate, who both survived
the sinking.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 passengers have been rescued so far and the
search operation is still going on.
</P>
<P>
With the known number of survivors and casualties already more
than the declared number of passengers and crewmen aboard the ill-
fated ship, officials cannot tell how many more people are missing
or dead.
</P>
<P>
The 2,840-ton Japanese-made ferry had a licensed capacity of
614 passengers aside from its crew.
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies have prompted officials to blame the accident
on the overloading of the 27-year-old ship, which was also found
to have altered its route to make for lost time after its
departure was delayed when inspectors found about 80 excess
passengers.

The department's new Olympic Travel Authorities would offer a

Immigration Department spokesman Peter Vardos said the
information exchange between the department and the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) would also be
electronic.
</P>
<P>
"Because there is no physical stamp in passports, airlines will
be able to confirm that the person in question has the right to
board a flight to Australia by simply checking the details through
electronic links between the airline's reservation system and (the
Immigration Department's) Electronic Travel Authority System," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Once these people arrive in Australia they will pass through
our border checks with a minimum of fuss and delay and they can

Conference, is participating in the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jing Shuping said the forum,
which was founded in 1996 to further promote the business
cooperation of private sectors between Nepal and China, has won
support from entrepreneurs as well as governments of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin spoke highly of the
forum. President Jiang had said that the forum "is a new mode with
considerable development potential. The governments of the two
countries could actively support and fully utilize this channel ...
so as to spur the economic cooperation and trade between our two
countries in a steady way," Jing Shuping told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping said, "private sectors have played a more and more
important role in the persistent and stable development of China's
economy" since China adopted a reform and open-up policy about 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said China is determined to adhere to this policy, which has
brought about sustained economic and social development for the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Also at the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai expressed sincere welcome for Chinese investors to come
to Nepal for economic ventures.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is "in a position to offer tremendous opportunities for
foreign investment ... we would welcome you and embrace you
whenever you want to do business in Nepal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the business-level cooperation between
our two countries could be further materialized with the state of
excellent relations that we are having between our two
governments," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, Chinese entrepreneurs held one-to-
one negotiations and consultations with their Nepalese
counterparts to discuss investment areas in Nepal and potential
items for trade between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Burundian National Assembly Leaders Clash Over Status in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Deputy President of the
Burundian National Assembly Augustine Nzojibwami has insisted that
the assembly must take part in the Arusha peace process as one
among warring parties, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Nzojibwami was against a statement made by assembly
President Leonce Ngendakumana that the Burundian National Assembly
would be taking part in the Arusha peace negotiations as a mere
observer, the independent Guardian newspaper quoted sources as
saying in Dar es Salaam at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nzojibwami said recently that the National Assembly should
continue with the Arusha peace process as a warring party but not
as a mere observer, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Ngendakumana had decided to put in
writing the stance of the National Assembly to become an observer
to the Arusha peace process so that no fresh stand could be made
by his Deputy President Nzojibwami.
</P>
<P>
Ngendakumana made the speech during the last consultations of
committees on conflict in Burundi which met in Arusha two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in six
years of civil war in Burundi between Hutu rebels and the
government led by minority ethnic Tutsis. Peace talks involving
related parties have made little progress until now.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Mayor Conditionally Accepts U.S. Heliport Relocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Tateo Kishimoto, mayor of Nago
city in Okinawa Prefecture, announced Monday that his city will
conditionally accept the relocation of the U.S. military heliport
from the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Nago already hosts a vast U.S. military base, and I know many
citizens are against accepting any more military facilities. But I
have decided to allow the relocation after considering the long
history of base problems in Okinawa and various circumstances,"
the report quoted Kishimoto as telling a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi promptly
welcomed Kishimoto's decision and vowed to assist the economic
development of the area.
</P>
<P>
Kishimoto's announcement is a milestone on the way to resolving
the issue of the return of the Futenma Air Station to Japanese
control, as agreed by Tokyo and Washington in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese central government is expected to endorse the
relocation plan Tuesday, along with a special budget of 100
billion yen (975 million U.S. dollars) to finance a 10-year plan
starting in April next year for boosting industries in parts of
northern Okinawa, where Nago is located.
</P>
<P>
Kishimoto said he will conditionally accept a proposal that the
heliport functions of the Futenma Air Station in Ginowan, central
Okinawa, be moved to an airport to be built in the Henoko district
of Nago.
</P>
<P>
Conditions set by the mayor include a time limit of 15 years on
use of the heliport by the U.S. military, and assurances that
steps will be taken to minimize the adverse effects of the airport
on citizens' lives and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Washington reached a basic accord on the relocation
of Futenma base, which is located close to residential areas, in
April 1996, as part of efforts to scale back the U.S. military
presence in Japan's southernmost prefecture.
</P>
<P>
In a December 1996 final accord on the issue, the U.S. agreed
to return the Futenma base to Japan in five to seven years on
condition that its heliport functions be relocated to somewhere
off the east coast of Okinawa's main island.
</P>
<P>
The agreement then stalled due to local opposition to
relocating the heliport within Okinawa. In a December 1997
referendum, Nago residents voted against the construction of a new
U.S. military facility in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, however, the Nago municipal assembly passed a
resolution accepting the relocation plan. The ruling camp in the
assembly argued that accepting the relocation plan in exchange for
industrial development aid is essential for boosting the regional
economy.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, ruled by the U.S. from the closing days of World War
II until 1972, accounts for 0.6 percent of Japan's total land area
but is home to some 75 percent of land occupied by U.S. military
facilities in Japan.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Reasserts Sovereignty Over Tokdo Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has made a protest
against Japan's accepting some Japanese residents' census
register transfers to disputed Tokdo island, which is called
Takeshima in Japan, in the East Sea, which is named the Japanese
Sea in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday said
South Korea has re-claimed its sovereignty over the Tokdo island
after some Japanese residents have shifted their household
registers to the island.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has sent a protest letter to Japan, urging it to
cancel the census register transfers to the island.
</P>
<P>
The ministry claimed that the island belongs to South Korea as
it virtually rules the islets by stationing garrisons and
installing a beacon and other facilities for ships, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Japan has confirmed the census register transfers and
reportedly said it could not ban its residents from changing their
census registers, as the island is its territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- France will maintain cooperation
with Cote d'Ivoire, one of its most important allies in Africa,
despite the coup d'etat which toppled the country's president, a
government minister in charge of cooperation said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Cooperation Charles Josselin said in an interview
with Radio France Internationale (RFI) that Cote d'Ivoire plays a
very important role in the regional security.

"From now on, it is the future of our relations with Cote
d'Ivoire which we should preserve," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized President Henri Konan Bedie, who was overthrown
last Friday in a bloodless coup by General Robert Guei, for "
deviations" and "error of piloting" during his presidency.

Josselin also said that the social and economic situation of
Cote d'Ivoire was showing bad signs.

He expressed his belief that Cote d'Ivoire's new strongman,
General Robert Guei, will stick to his promise to reestablish the
rule of democracy and law as quickly as possible.

<P>
"We will put pressure (on him) so that very quickly the
democratic situation can return so that new elections can be held,
" he said.

Asked whether the presidential election should be held next
year as was originally scheduled, he said that this is up to the
people of Cote d'Ivoire to decide.

<HEADLINE> Grottos Discovered in East China Remain Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The more than 24 enormous
grottos discovered in Longyou County in east China's Zhejiang
Province have drawn wide attention from the archeological,
architectural and cultural circles in China.
</P>
<P>
The rock caves, each with an area of at least 1,000 sq m, are
engraved with horses, birds, fish and other patterns.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hongxun, an archeologist with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that this is the largest number of grottos ever
discovered in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, opinions vary among experts as to by whom, when, how
and why the grottos were made.
</P>
<P>
Dong Chuping, a research fellow of the Zhejiang Provincial
Academy of Social Sciences who has just visited the grottos, said
that they constituted an armament base in the Spring and Autumn
Period (770 B.C.-476 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Others thought they might be imperial mausoleums, storehouses,
residences or just quarries.
</P>
<P>
What is unanimous is that all experts who visited the grottos
believe that they are of great value and should be well protected.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The
following are major news items in leading Israeli
newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided
Sunday to recommend for the first time freeing
Palestinian security prisoners with "blood on
their hands" as part of a deal that would release
34 inmates.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In the past two months, Israel issued
construction permits for 2,757 homes in the Jewish
settlements, with plans to build another 2,139
units in process and the installation of 85 mobile
homes in West Bank outposts being approved, the
Peace Now movement said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel released five Lebanese citizens held
for years in administrative detention on Sunday,
signaling a possible change in relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The five, who may be used as bargaining chips
in exchange for new information about the missing
Israeli Air Force navigator Ron Arad, boarded a
Lufthansa plane for their trip to Beirut via
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Hours after the Tel Aviv District Court
indicted former Israeli media magnate Ofer Nimrodi
on eight charges on Sunday, it was learned that
Nimrodi met at his initiative with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in August and asked him to help secure
a pardon for his sentence for wiretapping.

<HEADLINE> Freed Lebanese Prisoners Return Home From Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese prisoners who were
held without trial in Israel arrived at Beirut International
Airport early Monday aboard a Lufthansa flight via Germany.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners, all members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, were freed in Israel on Sunday under a deal brokered
by Germany.
</P>
<P>
They were warmly greeted at the airport by Hezbollah's senior
official Naim Qassem, representative of Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud and dozens of their relatives and Hezbollah supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We should thank German government for their efforts to seek the
release and this is a humanitarian gesture," Qassem told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Hezbollah will continue its resistance
movement until Israel withdraws from all Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 allegedly to protect its north from cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah and Lebanon's other guerrilla groups
launched a war of attrition to drive Israelis out of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Israel freed Hezbollah members since
1998 when it swapped 60 Lebanese detainees and the corpses of 40
guerrillas for the remains of Israelis killed in a botched raid in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the fresh move will help create a positive
atmosphere for the second round of talks between Israel and Syria,
slated for January 3 in Washington, and also for the resumption of
Israeli talks with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hezbollah and Israel reached an informal two-day
cease-fire in south Lebanon in order to recover the bodies of the
group's killed members.

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Approves More Settlement Projects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 27 (Xinhua)-- In the past two months, Israel
issued construction permits for 2,257 homes in the settlements and
approved the installation of 85 mobile homes in the West Bank
outposts, said an Israeli peace group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now, which supports the peace process, said in a report
that plans for building another 2,139 homes for Jewish settlers in
the West Bank are in the process of approval.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that many of the authorized construction
projects in the West Bank have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
The approved building projects include 780 new homes for
settlers at Revava, 508 at Givat Ze'ev and 500 at Mitzpeh Shalem,
while plans are in the pipeline for 1,668 homes at Kfar Adumim
settlement, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The mobile homes will be located at Mitzpeh Dani and Givat
Hahish, two outposts that were legalized as part of a compromise
between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Council of Jewish
Settlements, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The construction projects cited by Peace Now are located in
the "settlement blocs" which, according to Barak, will "remain
eternally under Israeli sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
But the data are inconsistent with Barak office's claim that no
new construction plans have been approved for building houses in
the settlements since Barak took office in July this year, the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks were held up in
November after Israel announced to issue new tenders for building
new houses for settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side refused to discuss any other issues than
the settlement expansion and requested the Israeli side to halt
immediately the settlement expansion activities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Israeli side gave its explanation to the settlement
activities, saying all ongoing construction projects in the West
Bank were approved by the previous government led by former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> 16 Ugandan Revelers Drowned in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Ugandan revelers got
drowned in Lake Victoria Sunday after their joy ride canoe
capsized about 100 meters off Old Nabugabo beach in the district
of Masaka.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place at around 3:00 p.m. when the
overloaded boat was hit by a big wave, the New Vision daily quoted
witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The number of the drowned is likely to rise and only two of
the victims have been identified. One is in Masaka hospital and
the other is a businesswoman," Asuman Mugenyi, a police spokesman
told Xinhua in a telephone interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that a drunk woman began to dance on the boat and
caused imbalance which led to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the revelers had no life jackets and tried in
vain to struggle from under the canoe. Horrified revelers at the
shore and numerous others who had been swimming and playing in the
water watched helplessly as the victims got drowned.
</P>
<P>
Mugenyi said that preparations are being made to get the bodies
out of the water.
</P>
<P>
The victims, including a woman with her twins, were among the
19 people who had hired the boat for a fun-sail as they waited for
an "ugliness contest" at the beach.
</P>
<P>
Mugenyi, however, said there is no confirmation of the number
of people on the boat.
</P>
<P>
Waterway being one of the key means of transport in Uganda,
there are often reports of passengers being drowned in lakes due
to overloading or poor quality of small boats.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Denies Harboring Burundi Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed has denied allegations by Burundi
that Tanzania allows rebels to launch attacks against Bujumbura
from refugee camps in the country's western Kigoma Region, local
media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister denounced the allegations at the weekend by saying
that refugees from Burundi, fleeing fierce fighting, entered the
country to save their lives but not to be trained for any military
warfare, the independent Guardian newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Time has come for Burundi to take back its endless accusations
without concrete evidence, said Ameir.
</P>
<P>
If Burundi were serious about its complaints and had any proof
to substantiate the allegations, it should forward them to
international institutions such as the United Nations, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugee and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Burundian Minister for Justice Terence Sinunguruza recently
accused Tanzania of harboring rebels who allegedly kill innocent
civilians and loot property.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that rebels have killed civilians at Burundi's
eastern Rutana Province and run away with the loot to the
Tanzanian side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Ameir said some of the Burundi refugees did involve themselves
with criminal activities such as robbery in villages close to the
refugee camps in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> French Railway Service Resumes After Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The railway service of France is
resuming Monday after a fierce storm caused cancellation of train
service on many lines across the nation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president of the state railway company SNCF, Louis Gallois,
said in an interview with the press that trains are moving again
everywhere except the three lines linking Paris with Strasbourg,
Normandy's Caen and Cherbourg and Belfort near the border with
Switzerland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He promised that all the trains will resume normal service by
Tuesday morning after security checks are completed on all railway
lines.
</P>
<P>
He said that tremendous damages were done by the storm as trees
fallen on the railway tracks are everywhere and many installations
of the SNCF have suffered damages.
</P>
<P>
The electricity cuts also have caused great problems for the
railway service, whose bullet train TGV relies on electricity as
motor power.
</P>
<P>
Gallois said that the storm was so unexpected that the SNCF
does not know what to do to compensate the passengers for their
losses.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, in the cases of exceptional circumstances completely
strange to our expectation, our system of compensation does not
function as usual, but we will see what we can do," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Likely on Way to Record Time in Sydney-Hobart Yacht Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Danish-Australian 60-footer
Nokia seemed to be on the way to a new record sailing time in the
Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Monday, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Nokia, a well-performed Whitbread round-the-world racer
equipped with such hi-tech devices as water ballast tanks, scored
a 16-nautical mile break over pre-race favorites Wild Thing and
1997 winner from Sydney Brindabella as the leaders started sailing
down the Tasmanian east coast Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Nokia is estimated, if things go well, to cross the Battery
Point finishing line at the end of the 630-nautical mile race
about 5am local time Tuesday morning (1800GMT Monday). That would
smash by almost a day the old record of two days, 14 hours, seven
minutes and 10 seconds, set in 1995 by German maxi Morning Glory.
</P>
<P>
Nokia was averaging 16.72 knots. Cruising Yacht Club of
Australia vice-commodore Han Sommer believed it a world record for
a bluewater classic.
</P>
<P>
The best average time in an Australian race was Bobsled's 14.84
knots in the 1993 Brisbane to Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
The fleet paused Monday to hear a message broadcast by Lew
Carter, the chief radio operator on the radio relay vessel Young
Endeavour, to commemorate the six sailors lost in last year's race.
</P>
<P>
Conditions this year were a bit better but still challenging,
with 25 knot winds gusting to 40 knots and waves up to six meters
in Bass Strait.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain and poor visibility made sailing more difficult
during the night.
</P>
<P>
Five boats have retired with mast damage but Sommer said he was
delighted for so few problems this year. The extra training and
new safety rules imposed after last year's tragedy had paid off,
he said.

</P>
<P>
As against 14 percent in 1998, the percentage of the local

rapid growing trend.
</P>
<P>
This makes it all the more important to develop a proper
infrastructure to facilitate e-commerce, the paper said.

MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Three persons were killed and
47 others injured when the passenger jeepney they were riding fell
into a ravine in Danao City in the central Philippines Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
A police report reaching here Monday said the accident happened
at around 6:45 Sunday evening when their jeepney lost its brakes
and plunged into a 15-meter deep ravine.
</P>
<P>
The report said the jeepney, which was hired by the passengers
to attend the wedding of a relative, crashed into a coconut tree
before it rolled down the ravine.
</P>
<P>
Three passengers died on the spot. However, it was the coconut
tree that ironically, saved the lives of the 47 others, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the coconut tree, all of them would have
died as the vehicle hit the trunk of the coconut, preventing it
from plunging beyond, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Delegation to Hold Direct Talks with  Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- India is rushing a
negotiating team to Kandahar, Afghanistan, to hold direct talks
with the hijackers of the Indian Airlines plane and ascertain
their demands, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A special aircraft carrying the team along with essential
material like food, water, medicines, blankets in addition to
doctors and relief crew is being flown Monday afternoon, the
minister told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Necessary permission from Pakistan and Afghanistan was being
obtained for the plane to reach Kandahar, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the announcement, Civil Aviation secretary
ravindra Gupta said the team was leaving at 13:00 hours local time
from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
According to Reports from Kandahar where the hijacked plane has
stationed since last Saturday, a Taliban spokesman confirmed that
India had agreed to send a high-level delegation to negotiate with
the hijackers after they threatened to begin killing passengers.
</P>
<P>
Gupta said India had received a message from Kandahar that the
hijackers had set a deadline of 08:30 hours (GMT) to meet their
demands.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked flight, an Airbus A-300 with 161 passengers and
crew still on board, landed in southern Afghan city of Kandahar,
some 650 km from Kabul Saturday morning, 16 hours after the
aircraft was seized during a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi
Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Distribute Cattle Vaccines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
promised to help livestock farmers by paying for at least half of
the cost of cattle vaccines in the corridor disease-hit Southern
Province, Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccines are very expensive for the farmers, Agriculture
Food and Fisheries Minister Suresh Desai was quoted as saying on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the measure is to encourage more farmers to regularly
vaccinate their cattle, adding that the program will be introduced
in other provinces as soon as it is formulated.
</P>
<P>
Corridor disease is a tick transmitted disease affecting cattle
in the Southern, Eastern, Northern, Copperbelt, Central and Lusaka
Provinces.
</P>
<P>
It is largely responsible for depleting cattle population from
the peak of about 1.5 million in mid-1980s to the current 700,000
in the Southern Province.
</P>
<P>
The government has set aside 400 million kwacha (about150,000
U.S. dollars) to buy 127 motor cycles for veterinary assistants in
the province to facilitate the implementation of the disease
control, said Desai.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ban on cattle movement from the Western Province
is still effective because the contagious bovine plural pneumonia
is yet to be fully controlled in the province, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Round-up: Philadelphia 76ers Wins in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson and Gary
Payton battled to a virtual standstill but coach Larry Brown was
raving about Tyrone Hill's defence after his Philadelphia 76ers
beat the Seattle SuperSonics 92-86 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iverson scored 34 points to break the 30-point mark for the
11th time this season and helped the 76ers win in Seattle for the
first time since January 4, 1992. Philadelphia snapped a seven-
game losing streak against the Sonics and completed its first
season sweep of Seattle in nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
Iverson shot 12-of-30 from the field and 9-of-13 from the line.
He grabbed six rebounds and handed out six assists.
</P>
<P>
Payton had 32 points, nine rebounds and nine assists for the
Sonics, although he was ejected nine seconds from time after his
second technical foul.
</P>
<P>
Seattle has lost three straight for the first time this season
and dropped to 7-1 in games decided by six points or less. The
defeat put on a halt the Sonics' seven-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Mitch Richmond contributed 27 points while
taking seven assists and three steals to lead the Wizards to a 103-
92 victory over the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Richmond hit 9-of-19 from field and 8-of-8 free throws, helping
Washington go 22-of-25 from the line.
</P>
<P>
In Milwaukee, Glenn Robinson scored 30 points and Ray Allen
made it 22 as the Bucks defeated the Miami Heat 93-85.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Maurice Taylor scored 26 points as the Clippers
came to a 103-100 victory over the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hill scored 30 points and Jerome Williams had a career-
high 21 rebounds as the Detroit Pistons dominated inside and
handed the Charlotte Hornets their third straight loss, 114-96, in
Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Chris Webber scored 31 points and Jason Williams
added 23 as the Kings posted their fifth straight home win over
the Dallas Mavericks, 118-111.
</P>
<P>
Cleveland saw Toronto Raptors hand the Cavaliers their season-
high seventh straight loss, 98-95, as Vince Carter of the Raptors
scored 13 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, Antonio McDyess and Nick Van Exel each scored 22
points to lead the Nuggets to a 109-86 victory over the Vancouver
Grizzlies, who were bidding for their first three-game winning
streak in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, Keith Van Horn scored all of his 17 points in
the first half as the Nets avenged their most embarrassing loss of
the season with a 103-76 rout of the Chicago Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Sailors in Sydney-Hobart Race Pause to Remember 1998 Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Competitors in the gruelling
Sydney-Hobart yacht race observed a minute's silence on Monday in
memory of the six sailors killed in a cyclone during the 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
Crews members sailing in Bass Strait paused Monday afternoon to
listen to a message broadcast by radio operator Lew Carter aboard
relay vessel The Young Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
"Please join me in a moment of remembrance for our crew mates
lost...a year ago," Carter told the hundreds of sailors aboard 75
yachts still in this year's fleet. Eighty boats started the race
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At roughly the same time last year competitors began a battle
for their lives when an intense low pressure system whipped up
winds of up to 80 knots and waves of 15-20 metres.
</P>
<P>
British Olympian Glyn Charles was washed overboard and his
protective harness snapped when a huge wave tore the deck off
Australian yacht Sword of Orion. His body has yet been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Three crewmen from the veteran cutter Winston Churchill were
lost after their life raft was shredded in the giant sea. Winston
Churchill sank after it was shattered by a series of waves.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Guy, skipper of Australian yacht Business Post Naiad,
died of a heart attack during the storm and his crewman Phil
Skeggs drowned when he became entangled in his lifeline after he
was swept overboard.
</P>
<P>
Twelve boats were abandoned or sank and 55 sailors were rescued.
Only 44 yachts of the original 115 starters finished the race.
</P>
<P>
Race organisers instituted new safety regulations after last
year's race, the worst experienced since the bluewater classic was
inaugurated in 1945.
</P>
<P>
All competitors have to report winds above 40 knots and all
boats have been fitted with Satcom C satellite and computer
communications which can position each yacht and issue weather
bulletins throughout the race.
</P>
<P>
All sailors must also meet minimum standards of safety and
ocean racing experience.
</P>
<P>
The fleet this year has enjoyed fresh northeasterly winds which
have leaders Nokia and Brindabella on course to smash the race
record of two days 14 hours seven minutes and 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But race officials had to take everything seriously. "Sailing
conditions are hard out there, requiring excellent downwind
steering and sail handling techniques, all of which vindicates the
new requirements we have placed on yachts," said race director
Phil Thompson.

<HEADLINE> Football Association of Zambia is 650,000 Dollars in Debts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
Zambia (FAZ) owes at least 1.7 billion Kwacha (650,000 U.S.
dollars) to various organizations and corporate entities, Times of
Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is about the same as FAZ had calculated for sending
the national team to next month's African Cup finals to be co-
hosted by Nigeria and Ghana, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Sports Minister Abel Chambeshi as saying
on Sunday that the ministry has, for the first time since the
differences between the FAZ executives and the government surfaced
last year, had a look into the financial state of the association.
</P>
<P>
He said a proper audit needed to be done to determine exactly
how much is owed and all the corporate entities concerned should
be asked to consider writing off some the debts so that FAZ could
start afresh.
</P>
<P>
Chambeshi thanked FAZ committee's decision to step down,
describing the move as an act of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
"In fact after the audit is done, maybe the government can
assist in paying off some of the debts but we hope everyone can
assist in one way or the other be it hotels, travel agencies and
even individuals who can write off some of the debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming African Cup of Nations finals, Chambeshi said
he will work to strengthen the current fund-raising committee and
help it reach the 1.7 billion Kwacha target.
</P>
<P>
FAZ executive committee resigned last Thursday. More than
three weeks earlier, FAZ President Teddy Mulonga quitted on
December 1 following a directive from Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mulonga has been at loggerheads with the government over the
alleged misuse of the money given to FAZ by the government for
1998 African Cup of Nations in Burkinafaso. Zambia was eliminated
in the early stages of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
FAZ was given 577 million Kwacha (about 380,000 U.S. dollars)
for the event but failed to account for the money.
</P>
<P>
Mulong's executive has been under government squeeze since
April last year when his executive was dissolved by Sports Council
of Zambia (SCZ) over allegations that it had misapplied 577
million kwacha
</P>
<P>
Two months after Zambia's poor performance at the 1998 Africa
Cup finals, the FAZ executive was removed on the charge of
misapplication of government fund.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international football activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed in September, 1998 that Mulonga and his
team came back to office but the Association be imposed a
financial squeeze in a bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
In March this year the government said that it was waiting for
a new FAZ executive to be elected before it could once again begin
to provide FAZ the financial, moral and logistical support it
withdrew last year.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects Expected for Cooperation Between Wuhan, Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan City, the capital of
central China's Hubei Province, is expected to forge still closer
ties with Macao in the fields of industry, science, technology,
finance, tourism, said a leading city official.
</P>
<P>
Though Macao enjoys trade preferences in export of commodities
to Europe and the United States, it has a hard time to develop
industries owning to increased costs for land and labor and a
shortage of qualified scientific personnel and advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
However, Wuhan, an industrial city with a sound base, has a lot
of scientific personnel. And city leadership has urged local
enterprises with essential conditions to go in for trans-regional
production or set up marketing conglomerates in cooperation with
firms from Macao and take Macao as the shopsite and Wuhan as the
manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
"The practice will further help increase Macao's industrial and
technological capacities while helping more Wuhan firms to gear to
world market," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Macao has forged close scientific information ties with
European Union and is home to the EU's only scientific information
center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
By stepping up its cooperation with Macao in the fields of
science and technology, the city of Wuhan will be able to know
scientific and technological information and trends from EU
promptly, invite more advanced European manufacturers to Wuhan, or
improve technical capacity and add contents to local industries by
means of going to inspect high-tech firms in Europe and studying
their valuable experiences, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao, with its highly developed banking sector, can
be served as a good stepping stone for overseas investment to
enter China's interior. Cooperation between Wuhan and Macao in
this regard will help propel Wuhan's bid to draw more investment
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Casino business epitomizes Macao's tourism industry, but Macao
is a tiny place with only a few scenic sites. Through intensifying
its cooperation with Macao in tourism business, Wuhan, with an
abundance of tourist resources and cultural relics, is hoping to
set up unified sight-seeing travel programs between the two places,
and eventually open up Wuhan's tourism markets to Taiwan,
Southeast Asia and Europe, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is now home to 93 Macao-financed businesses. Macao
investors are now involved in the upgrading of 13 major
enterprises of Wuhan. And Macao has played a major role in the
business of re-exporting commodities from Wuhan, and a group of
its local firms have also found development space in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Projects Help Resolve Yellow River's Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, China's
second longest and the main provider of water to China's western
region, is now facing a serious water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River now shoulders a heavier burden of water
supply amidst the central government's drive to develop China's
western regions.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of water may reach 23 billion cubic meters a year
in the coming century and will reach its peak by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
To try to resolve the shortage of water by 2010, the Yellow
River Water Conservation Committee plans to build a number of
water saving projects, covering 50 percent of the irrigation area
and to channel another 4 billion cubic meters of water a year from
the south to north of the River, said Chen Xiaoguo, chief engineer
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Channeled water is expected to reach 23 billion cubic meters by
the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, water shortages have occurred almost every
year.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow river holds two percent of the country's total water
resources and provides water to 15 percent of China's farmland
mainly in the middle and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken this year have helped cut the dry period of the
river to 42 days as against 132 days last year.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, China's
leading exporter, is expecting one to two percent in exports for
1999 despite a serious plunge in exports in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics, from January to November, the
province recorded 125.97 billion U.S. dollars in imports and
exports, up eight percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports made up 69.71 billion U.S. dollars of the total foreign
trade volume, up 2.4 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has grown from a economically poor region into a
place of prosperity due to China's reform and open-drive. In the
20 years before 1998, the province had its foreign trade growing
at a high speed. It contributes 40 percent of China's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the Asian financial crisis and Guangdong's
concentrated export market in Southeast Asia, foreign trade in the
province has fallen since May 1998. By February this year, foreign
trade hit a record low and Guangdong reported a negative growth of
24.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress
early this year, Governor Lu Ruihua said that despite the present
economic downturn,the province could expect some growth in foreign
trade this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports picked up again in July. Guangdong exported 7.7 billion
U.S. dollars worth of commodities in October, the highest monthly
record for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ziqiang, head of the Guangdong Provincial Commission for
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that the improvement
of Guangdong's exports is due to a range of policies implemented
by the local government to encourage exports, economic recovery in
Southeast Asia and Japan, industrial restructuring as well as the
improvement in the quality of durable consumer commodities.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- In a move to improve
textile mills, north China's Hebei province has destroyed 850,400
outdated spindles this year.
</P>
<P>
Destruction of those spindles has been part of China's strategy
of bailing the debt-ridden textile industry out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province eliminated 596,000 outdated spindles,
and 27 textile mills declared bankruptcy, writing off nearly 1.7
billion yuan of bad debts. And tens of thousands of workers have
been transferred to other jobs, said Chong Yangzhi, deputy
director of the Hebei Provincial Association of Textiles.
</P>
<P>
Although the province has reduced its total spindles by 24
percent, the performance of the textile mills has picked up
considerably after enterprises began to upgrade their technology
and change their focus of production.
</P>
<P>
Textile mills are now concentrating on the production of new
fibers, high quality garment materials rather than yarn and cloth
only.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, textile mills in the province have
developed 90 new products, adding an output value totaling 1.3
billion yuan (about 157 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
From January to November, State-owned textile mills recorded

percent and 38.6 percent more than that for the same period last

<HEADLINE> E. China Province to Upgrade Traditional Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the country's leading economic powerhouses, will take
measures to upgrade seven traditional industries with new and high
technologies over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Provincial Governor Li Chunting referred to the
decision as a major part of a massive plan to improve the quality
of the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are encouraged to join in the effort, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the traditional industries of paper making
wine brewing, chemical fertilizers, cement, textiles, plastic, and
farm machinery have played a major role not only in the local
economy but also in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Li said, Shandong's paper output accounts for one-
fifth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Li added that about 16.5 billion yuan will be used for the
upgrading program before 2002, with the focus on 54 projects in 36
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, the combined sales of the seven industries will
increase by 91 percent compared with that in 1998, with pre-tax
profits rising 67 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) --Water conservancy facilities
are being built in northeast China's Liaoning Province to create
better conditions for agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
 Liaoning is traditionally an industrial base, but lags behind
in agriculture. The province relies heavily on grain and other
farm products from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A drought in the western part of the province this year
affected more than half a million people. To rectify the situation,
the provincial government implemented a number of measures
including planting trees, dredging rivers, and strengthening dykes
so that agriculture could develop in a sustainable way.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to invest 3.6 billion yuan (about
433.7 million U.S. dollars) in the coming five years developing
333,000 hectares of farms irrigated with water efficient pipelines.
</P>
<P>
One fifth of the program has been completed and pipelines
already installed have proven to be effective in fighting drought
this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the provincial water conservancy department said
that they have launched projects against floods along the Hun and
Daliaohe Rivers.
</P>
<P>
The province has also worked out policies to encourage private
businessmen and government-owned enterprises to invest in water
conservancy projects in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Adopts Water Efficient Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A new irrigation method - drip
irrigation under plastic sheeting - is being widely used in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an arid area in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers lay a network of pipelines with a tiny hole every
20 cm in the field, covering the pipelines with plastic sheeting.
When turned on, water will run directly to crops from those
numerous tiny holes.
</P>
<P>
Previous use of drip irrigation shows that it raised the unit
output of ginned cotton from 40 kg to 100 kg and save 50 percent
of water compared with the traditional flood irrigation method,
said Zhang Guoxiang, an official with the China Irrigation
Technology Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 20 million hectares of farmland, most of which are
arid or semi-arid. The annual rainfall in the region averages 147
millimeter while annual evaporation ranges between 1,600 mm and 2,
000 mm.
</P>
<P>
This new irrigation method will help change the structure of
cultivation and improve crop quality, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Strives to Become Asia's Premier Tourist Destination (1) by Li Zhijun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, a popular tourist
destination in Asia, is ready for a new era in which tourism is
expected to take off and give vitality to the local rebounding
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We have targeted Hong Kong's future as the premier
international city of Asia, and we want to turn the vision of Hong
Kong as the events capital of Asia into reality," said Mike Rowse,
commissioner for tourism of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Rowse outlined the ambitious
vision of Hong Kong and said the Disney Theme Park will help make
Hong Kong a truly world-class city.
</P>
<P>
"What Disney gives us in five years' time is a reason for
people to choose Hong Kong, their first choice as a family holiday
destination.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, Disney gives us a kind of magnet for other
types of family holiday attractions to be established in," he
pointed out, adding that other entertainment companies may come to
Hong Kong as well.
</P>
<P>
The Disney Theme Park, a landmark project hopeful of benefiting
the economy as a whole, has given great confidence to the
community and especially the tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also listed as one of the top 50 traveling places
of a lifetime by the National Geographic Traveler, an
authoritative tourist publication in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the economic pillars in Hong Kong, now employs
some 330,000 people, or 10 percent of the local work force and
constituted about 4 percent of Hong Kong's GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen this economic pillar, the Hong Kong SAR
government has pledged to take various measures to enhance its
competitive edge, including enhancing coordination, reviewing the
tourism development strategy and developing the necessary
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has allocated 50 million HK dollars (6.4
million U.S. dollars) to the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
since last April to help it in its market promotion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Disney Theme Park that will cost the Hong
Kong SAR government 22.45 billion HK dollars (2.88 billion U.S.
dollars), the SAR government is considering a number of other
development projects to increase Hong Kong's attractiveness as a
popular tourism destination. These projects include an
international wetland park, a new world-class performing arts
venue and a 50-million HK dollars (6.4 million U.S. dollars) "
Adventure Bay" attraction at Ocean Park.
</P>
<P>
These projects, which are all market-oriented, will enhance
Hong Kong's position as a world city and provide tourists with
enjoyable world-class entertainment facilities and holiday resorts,
said analysts.

<P>
Hong Kong's tourist arrivals, which have maintained a double-
digit growth for 16 consecutive months, totaled 8,727,645 during
the January-October period of this year, representing a growth of
11.8 percent over the same period of 1998, according to the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
However, tourism revenue for the first three quarters of this
year stood at only 38 billion HK dollars (4.9 billion U.S. dollars)
, a drop of 3.4 percent from a year ago, as a result of Hong Kong'
s lower costs right across the board for accommodation, services
and goods.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA has pledged to focus its efforts on increasing
tourists' consumption in the coming one or two years, said Tony
Tse, general manager of marketing communications of HKTA.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, Tse told Xinhua, the HKTA will identify
high-yield markets in the Chinese mainland, traditionally the
largest source of consumption for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We identify high-yield markets from the Chinese mainland as
those who come to do business, attend conferences and exhibitions,
" said Tse. "There is a growing market for entrepreneurs and
businessmen who have high spending power."
</P>
<P>
"In the case of America, we are very much after incentive
market, because a lot of companies will award the staff and send
them on a trip to a more luxurious place," he said. "Traveling to
the Far East is a good incentive program by a lot of corporations
in America."
</P>
<P>
For the Taiwan market, the HKTA and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways jointly sponsored a special package in October for Taiwan'
s office ladies to taste the metropolitan lifestyle of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Travelers are expected to stay in five-star hotels, enjoy
delicious cuisine and go shopping at luxurious shops in Hong Kong,
Tse said, noting that all these efforts are made to promote Hong
Kong's status as an international tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
Tse said the HKTA is closely cooperating with the China
National Tourism Administration (CNTA) in consolidating the
Chinese mainland market and has signed agreements with Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces to promote two-way tourism. It also signed
accords with the Beijing Tourism Administrative Bureau to promote
convention and exhibition visits.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Disney Theme Park, Tse said it will
consolidate Hong Kong's image as a top metropolis in Asia and help
improve the service quality of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Disney is a world-renowned organization promoting quality
customer-focused service," Tse said. "Disney believes in creating
happiness for customers."
</P>
<P>
"In training staff, they are asked to be actors, not employees.
They act in the way that customers feel welcome and at home. All
customers are VIPs.
</P>
<P>
"All the ways of managing the business of Walt Disney are going
to bring a lot of influence to our industry. This is very positive,
" he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tse also highlighted the Disney effects on the whole economy,
including a higher hotel occupancy rate, more employment and huge
construction.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong dimension to our tourism and the
significance to do the Disney project will promote image, service
quality and family travel," he said.
