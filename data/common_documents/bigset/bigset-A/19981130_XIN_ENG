<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Quick Implementation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan Sunday called for a quick implementation of the
contracts signed between Iraq and foreign companies under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Hans Von Sponeck, the U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator for Iraq, Ramadhan expressed disappointment at the
previous four phases of the program.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the fifth phase of the oil-for-food
program between Iraq and the U.N. would be strictly implemented.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan also criticized the U.N. sanctions committee for
placing various obstacles in approving the contracts. "An
effective implementation of the new phase of the program can only
be guaranteed by full cooperation between both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
should not forget the fact that more than 22 million Iraqi people
were suffering from the U.N. sanctions which has lasted for eight
years.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck, who took office in October, said he was
optimistic about his mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
George Comerwill, spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq, announced earlier that Iraq has agreed to
extend the oil-for-food program for a fifth phase of six months
and has submitted to the U.N. a specific plan for implementing
the new phase.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase of the program expired on November 25 and the
U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously to renew the program
for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990, but approved an oil-for-food deal to allow
Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil every six months since
December 1996 to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods
for its hardship-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil export ceiling has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars in the fourth phase from 2 billion dollars in the
previous phases.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq's dilapidated oil industry and the sagging world oil
prices have made it difficult for Iraq to earn that amount. It
only fetch Baghdad 3.3 billion dollars in the fourth phase.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Ready for Equal Ties with Iran: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Sunday that the U.S., a vowed foe for nearly
two decades, is not ready to establish relations with Iran based
on mutual respect and equality.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is sure that the relationship sought by the U.S. with
Iran is based on U.S. domination," Kharrazi told visiting Libyan
Deputy Foreign Minister Saad Mojber.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Kharrazi said that on the other hand, Iran does not feel any need
to establish relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cut off ties with Iran after the 1979 take-over of
U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students following the Islamic
revolution, and has accused Tehran of being a sponsor of
international terrorism and been eager to contain it in every
possible way.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's remarks came after Iranian hardliners stirred up
strong opposition to any links with Washington. They have called
for the impeachment of Kharrazi, criticizing the Foreign Ministry
for issuing visas to 13 Americans to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were accused as spies and attacked by a group of
hardliners in Tehran on November 21. Apparently unscathed, the
Americans, said to be businessmen by the government, left Iran
the next day.
</P>
<P>
Iranian government officials have vowed to punish the
assailants, saying anyone entering Iran with a valid visa is
entitled to the country's protection of safety and security.
</P>
<P>
The hardliners, however, urged President Mohammad Khatami to
punish those responsible for invited the Americans. "If any
American delegation visits Iran under any title, it will be more
seriously dealt with," the hardliners warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
A confrontation between moderates and hardliners, sparked by
the incident, seemed unfolding.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran enjoys growing diplomatic relations
with many other countries, which are revising their policies
towards Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between Iran and Libya, Kharrazi
said Iran welcomes regular exchange of official visits between the
two countries, adding that boosting bilateral relations will
strengthen economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mojber said Libya is willing to develop relations and exchange
views on international issues with Iran.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Not to Pull Down BJP-led Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Congress party made it
clear on Sunday that it would not pull down the central government
led by the Bharatiya Janata Party following its landslide victory
in three of the four states which conducted assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition party in India got unprecedented
majorities in the states of Rajasthan and Delhi and retained power
in Madhya Pradesh in the elections, the results of which were
published here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that he was prepared
to face any challenge from the opposition including a trial of
strength in the winter session of Parliament beginning on Monday
</P>
<P>
As the Congress and other opposition party leaders asked the
Congress to take initiative to usher in a fresh realignment of
forces against the BJP, Congress President Sonia Gandhi told the
press here that "we will wait for it to fall."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vajpayee met top leaders of his party at separate
meetings of the BJP executive and Parliamentary Board and the
leaders of the allied parties.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the BJP had finalized a strategy to face
the opposition onslaught in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to final results of the polls just released by the
Election Commission, the Congress won 380 of the 626 assembly
seats in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and
Mizoram, far ahead of the ruling BJP by 212 seats.
</P>
<P>
It won a major victory in Rajasthan, where the BJP had ruled
for eight years, with 150 seats gained out of the total of 197
while the BJP got only 33.
</P>
<P>
In Delhi, which was also ruled by the BJP, the Congress wrested
power from the BJP with 51 of the 69 seats, pushing the latter a
distant second at only 15.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that a flood of onion tears besides rises in
prices of other essential commodities was one of the factors which
helped Congress win the assembly election in the national capital.
</P>
<P>
In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP's hopes of overthrowing the ruling
Congress were dashed as the ruling party received 173 of the 320
seats, leading the BJP ahead by 53.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the outcome of the results of the assembly
elections, Vajpayee conceded Saturday that while in Delhi, the BJP
was not very optimistic, but the outcome of the polls in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh had come as a "complete surprise to him and
other BJP leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although the Congress strategy for dealing with the political
turmoil was yet to be finalized, several important leaders of the
party confidently predicted the fall of the BJP government with
the withdrawal of support by some of the 13 allies now backing it.
</P>
<P>
However, virtually all of BJP allies except All-India Anna
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which had threatened to
withdraw support to the BJP coalition, expressed their solidarity
with the government on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Vajpayee had with leaders of allied parties
Sunday, it was decided that the ruling coalition would oppose any
no confidence motion that might be tabled by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The left parties, which also met here Sunday, decided that it
would press for the resignation of the government, which they said
lost its moral and political legitimacy to rule.

<HEADLINE> President: Eritrea to Join Arab League at Proper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea will join the Arab
League when "the time is appropriate," visiting Eritrean President
Issias Afwerki said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Afwerki made the remark at a press conference after his meeting
with Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary general of the Cairo-based
organization, which has 22 member states in the Middle East and
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Blaming Addis Ababa for triggering the border disputes between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, Afwerki expressed hope that the mediation
efforts made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and other
parties would lead to a peaceful solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The border between the two countries has not been officially
delineated after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in
1993. Armed clashes took place in May and June between the two
sides due to disputes over a number of border areas.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and some other parties are seeking ways to help resolve
the conflict, but no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Afwerki said that he discussed with Abdel-Meguid a number of
other issues related to the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea and the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president arrived here Saturday for a two-day
visit after attending the 20th Franco-African summit in Paris.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Privatize Oil Refineries: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi
Al-Banbi on Sunday ruled out the possibility of privatizing the
country's oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
Al-Banbi told a meeting of the General Assemblies of Oil
Refineries that Egypt has "no intention to privatize or sell" the
oil refineries as they "are strategic" for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But he assured that "the door is open" to the private sector to
build new refineries or set up specialized companies to operate in
the field.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund, Egypt
started economic reforms in 1991, featuring privatization of
state-run companies. So far, more than one third of the 314
enterprises selected in the process have been sold to the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Egypt's refineries with an annual
production of 30 million tonnes are able to meet the needs of
domestic consumption and economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has planned to modernize the refineries in a bid to
expand their production capacity and raise the quality of the
products to the world level in the coming century, Al-Banbi said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Israel to Exercise Restrain on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged
Israel to exercise restraint in its policy on the Lebanese issue,
Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Israel Edward Walker relayed to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday afternoon Washington's concern
over the recent developments in South Lebanon, it said.
</P>
<P>
Walker urged both Israel and Lebanon to show restraint because
any more military action in the region could lead to further
complication of the situation, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli cabinet ministers called Sunday for air
strikes against Lebanon in retaliation for the killing of Israeli
soldiers by Islamic guerillas in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ministers issued the call before attending a meeting
called by Netanyahu, who returned home Friday from his interrupted
European tour, to assess the situation in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, known as the security cabinet meeting, will hear
military and security chiefs' reports on the Lebanon situation and
formulate Israel's policy toward Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, member of the security cabinet,
has called for a staged withdrawal from South Lebanon but added
that the Lebanese government should be held responsible for
Hezbollah attacks from the areas which Israel have evacuated.
</P>
<P>
If the Lebanese government fails to prevent these anti-Israeli
attacks, Israel could target Lebanese power stations, water
pumping facilities, bridges and roads, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers Sunday voiced support for attacks on Lebanese
civilian facilities in retaliation for the recent stepped-up
Lebanese guerilla campaign in which seven Israeli soldiers were
killed in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli armed forces are concerned that Israeli
air strikes against Lebanon would lead to an escalation of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soliders were killed by Hezbollah militia in the
security zone Thursday, bringing the death toll in 10 days to
seven.
</P>
<P>
With rising casualties of Israeli troops in the region, nearly
half of the Israelis now prefer Israeli army's pullout from the
security zone, which Israel set up in South Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its northern territories from guerilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Refugees Flee to Tanzania Since Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 29 (Xinhua) - Some 20,000 refugees
from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and
Burundi have so far entered Tanzania since a bloody crisis broke
out in DRC early August.
</P>
<P>
"About 15,600 refugees are from the DRC and 3,800 from
Burundi," a spokesman for the Home Affairs Ministry here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official said the arrivals have brought the grand total
refugees from the two countries currently in the refugee camps in
western Kigoma Region to 236,425.
</P>
<P>
He said this includes the Congolese refugees who had been
repatriated voluntarily from Kigoma camps under an exercise which
was however halted on August 8 following the eruption of new
fighting in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"By the time the voluntary repatriation of Congolese refugees
came to a halt, 27,075 refugees had been repatriated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese refugees are fleeing battles taking place in the
eastern part of their country between DRC government forces loyal
to President Laurent Kabila and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in the DRC conflict, Tanzania recalled
its military advisors from DRC almost immediately after the
conflict broke out while other neighboring countries rushed their
troops to either side of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war has so far already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe
and Chad on Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are backed
by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Greece Denies Rift With Cyprus Over Missile Installation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece Sunday denied reports of
a rift between Athens and Nicosia over the deployment of the S-300
anti-aircraft missiles that Cyprus has bought from Russia to
strengthen the island republic's defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
There was no difference of opinion between Greece and Cyprus on
the issue of the Russian-made S-300 missiles, Greece's Alternate
Foreign Minister George Papandreou said in the western Greek port
city of Patras.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation between the two governments, which he
described as "systematic and close," was aimed at achieving the
best for both sides.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that what the two countries were doing was
for the action needed to achieve an actual reinforcement of
Cyprus' defense and to advance the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides denied Saturday that there
was any breach between Greece and Cyprus and said that the joint
defense pact between the two countries was sound.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-dominated
north and the Greek Cypriots-controlled south in 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense, the Cyprus government decided
earlier last year to purchase the Russian-made missiles, but
Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the installation of
the missiles. With the nearing of the missile deployment, the
tension on the divided island has been increasingly intensified.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, who visited here later in August, came to Greece
Friday for talks with Greek leaders focusing on the installation
of the missiles, but he reportedly failed to reach a consensus
with Athens regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
To avoid being dragged into hostilities with neighboring
Turkey, Greece reportedly supports the idea of deploying the
missiles in the southern Greek island of Crete instead of Cyprus,
but Clerides insists that the missiles will be deployed on the
island republic as planned.

<HEADLINE> UK's Royal Family Agrees to Give Up Seats in House of Lords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's royal family has
agreed that it will not fight to keep its right to sit and vote in
the House of Lords when the government reforms the unelected upper
house.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the royal household had told the
government that members of the family, which has been included in
the House of Lords since it was set up 900 years ago, would "fall
into line" with the government's plans and give up its seats with
out a fight if the legislation announced in the Queen's Speech
last week is passed.
</P>
<P>
"We have been informed the royal family accepts the decision
and the dukes would no longer have the right to sit," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles, first in line to the throne, his brother Prince
Andrew and Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband, all have a
right to vote in the upper chamber, although they rarely do.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said they made clear they want no
special arrangements after the reform.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which follows months of negotiations between the
government and the Palace, shows the lengths to which the
government is prepared to go in its drive to reform the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
The government will be relieved it does not have to face an
unseemly row with the royal family, the major beneficiaries of the
same hereditary principle the government wants to scrap in the
upper chamber.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Peacekeeping in Africa Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A UN official said here
on Sunday that there is no better time than now to examine ways
of strengthening relations between the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and the United Nations system in resolving conflicts
and peace building.
</P>
<P>
Lalla Ben Barka, Deputy Executive Secretary of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), made the remark
when she recalled that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presented
a report to the Security Council on "the causes of conflict and
the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in
Africa" in April this year.
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement at an OAU/International Peace Academy
(IPA) seminar on peacekeeping in Africa, Ben Barka said that the
report "squarely identified conflict as the major constraint to
development in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Ben Barka pointed out that the report "calls for a holistic
approach to Africa's problems and highlights the need for peace
as a prerequisite for sane and stable societies".
</P>
<P>
She stressed need of peace education in Africa and said "we
should prioritize investment in raising awareness about the
dividends of peace and the downsides of war."
</P>
<P>
"Peace education should encourage harmonious living, nurture a
willingness to cooperate, and build constituencies for peace,"
she said, adding that "civic education in schools can also build
positive social values and promote democratic governance at the
national as well as community levels."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Insurance Companies Not to Pay September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Most claims by Lesotho
business people for compensation on their businesses destroyed
during a week of violence in September would not be paid, an
insurance official has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special meeting of the Lesotho Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (LCCI) in Maseru, Claims Manager for the
Lesotho National Insurance Group, Tlai Tlai, said that the
businessmen could not be paid because the September disturbances
were not constituted as political riots, South African Press
Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho suffered a national turmoil in mid-September which
witnessed looting and arson in the capital of Maseru following a
one-and-half month political unrest resulted from allegation by
opposition parties that the May election was rigged.
</P>
<P>
The mountain kingdom returned to normal in early October after
military intervention by neighboring South Africa and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Tlai said it was found that most buinesses destroyed in Maseru
and the southern towns of Mafeteng and Mohales Hoek were not
insured for political riots which were not covered by the Lesotho
National Insurance Group.
</P>
<P>
What Tlai said had drawn castigation from angry businessmen
who maintained that they should be compensated for damages on
their businesses during the uprising.
</P>
<P>
There are only two insurance companies in Lesotho, and persons
who wish to be insured by foreign companies have to do so through
insurance brokers.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that by the time turmoil occurred, most
businesses had no insurance coverage but some had standard
insurance against storm, theft and other forms of disaster.
</P>
<P>
Tlai said wrap around insurance cover for large businesses
such as five-star hotels and big industrial undertakings was not
available in Lesotho because the market was not large enough.
</P>
<P>
Thabang Nyeoe, deputy chairman of the LCCI Crisis Committee,
said that individual business people may wish to take legal
action against insurance companies which refused to make any
payments.

JOHANNESBURG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Voter registration in
South Africa's five northern provinces picked up as more
potential voters rushed to meet the deadline Sunday, South Africa
television reported.
</P>
<P>
Although the exact number of voters who have registered will
not be known until Thursday, the Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC) estimated that five million of the 12.7 million eligible
voters in the five provinces have had their names on the voters'
roll.
</P>
<P>
The registration points throughout the provinces were
scheduled to be closed at 9 p.m. local time Sunday. Those who had
not registered would be given another chance next January and
February.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration in the other four provinces will be
conducted next week.
</P>
<P>
The process got off to a rocky start Friday with widespread
confusion over where to register, faulty bar code scanning
machines and logistic problems.
</P>
<P>
The IEC believes that voter registration in the other four
provinces will definitely improve.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Taliban to Punish Killers of Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday urged the
Afghan Taliban militia to identify and punish those responsible
for killing Iranian diplomats and reporter in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that the
Taliban should submit to decisions by the international community
and meet all demands set forth by Iran, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the Taliban should have realized that they have to
be accountable regarding their violation of international
regulations, otherwise they should face its consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban troops killed eight Iranian diplomat and an IRNA
reporter on August 8 when they overrun Mazar-e-Sharif, a
stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance, supported by
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian pressure with a buildup of more than 200,000
troops along the border, the Taliban repatriated the bodies of
killed Iranians and release of all Iranian captives it held during
the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the civil war in Afghanistan, Asefi said that there
is no military solution and a lasting peace, and tranquility in
Afghanistan is possible only with the formation of a broad-based
government through peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian Foreign Ministry closely follows Afghan
developments because security and stability in the neighboring
country will have a direct impact on Iranian security.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Weddings Under Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- For 24-year-old Kamil Fatima,
the biggest dream is to live a peaceful life with neither war nor
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"War can destroy our houses, sanctions can make us poor, but
they cannot deprive us the right to survive," the newly-wed Iraqi
young woman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fatima and her bridegroom Adela were among dozens of newlyweds
at Baghdad's Hilton Hotel, at the riverside of Tigris, on Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The custom remains: the Iraqis still hold weddings on Thursday,
Muslims' weekend. But the ceremonies are much simpler than before.
</P>
<P>
Eight years of sanctions, imposed on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, have damaged the life of the Iraqi people in
almost all respects, and among others, the matrimony of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Many young people can not get married because they cannot afford
the wedding expense.
</P>
<P>
Ahamad Ali and his wife were among the couples present at the
night.
</P>
<P>
"I might have got married earlier if there is no sanctions.
Although I often moonlighted after work, I still could not afford
the wedding expense and my wedding date had been postponed for
several times," Ali said.
</P>
<P>
Working as a clerk, his salary was 6,400 Iraqi dinars (about
four U.S. dollars) a month. "I borrowed money for the wedding, my
suit and my wife's wedding dress are all rented," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the sanctions, many Iraqis used to hold luxurious
weddings at five-star hotels, inviting bands and famous singers to
the banquets to add to the fun, according to the hotel's reception
manager.
</P>
<P>
The newlyweds usually lived at least one week in the hotels
during their honeymoons, some rich people even stayed for one
month.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sanctions, the number of such hotel weddings fell
sharply.
</P>
<P>
One night in the hotel cost a couple about 9,000 dinars (six
dollars) for room renting, almost equivalent to two months' income
for ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
More and more young couples have to hold their banquets at home
and spend just one night in hotels. Many poor families could not
even afford to hold weddings for their children.
</P>
<P>
Although the newlyweds were happy during honeymoon, they were
at a loss for their future life under the sanctions.

CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs
from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The capital of Arab Funds invested in the Egyptian
market amounted to about 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the chairman of the Egyptian Banks Federation Mahmoud
Abdul Aziz, Sunday's daily Alam Al Yom said that about 100 million
dollars of the funds was invested through the National Bank of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>

imposed by the Saudi quarantine authorities on Egyptian potatoes
during the last export season.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- A container vessel belonging to the Maersk Shipping
Line late Saturday arrived at the Raysut port and handled a total

</P>
<P>
The vessel was one of the early ships that commercially docked

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Navy to Expand Antimissile Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy is to
construct the first reliable medium-range antimissile shield,
turning its fleet of cruisers and destroyers into platform for
launching high-altitude interceptors, the Washington Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A high-level Pentagon panel that authorizes major defense
acquisition programs is soon to approve the Navy's concept for an
expanded antimissile program, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the move comes in the wake of a faltering 14
billion dollars Army program that has encountered quality-control
problems and five consecutive intercept test failures.
</P>
<P>
But the Navy's project is less tested than the Army option and
actual intercept flight tests will not begin until 2000, putting
the service on a tight schedule to meet the Pentagon's goal of
developing a system with at least modest capability of shooting
down incoming ballistic missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The earliest version of the Navy system is designed to shoot
down missiles that have ranges of 600 to 800 miles (1100-1500 km).
</P>
<P>
With Congress pressing for faster development of U.S.
antimissile defenses, the Navy already has spent 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars in perfecting the concept for its Theater Wide system
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's five-year budget provides another 1.5 billion
dollars for the program, but the Navy believes that the amount
could be doubled to meet the 2005 target date.

WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States plans to
boost U.S. aid to the Palestinians by 400 million U.S. dollars
while extending its current assistance program of 100 million
dollars per year for five more years, the White House announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was disclosed as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met with President Clinton in search of help in protecting the new
Mideast peace agreement. The meeting was in advance of the
international donors conference, which the president was due to
open.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. commitment is designed to push further
contributions from more than 40 nations assembled in Washington
for a one-day conference on economic assistance for the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, more than two billion was pledged, "and I would
expect we will do that again," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said while announcing the U.S. increase.
</P>
<P>
The United States is providing 500 million dollars over five
years to the Palestinian Authority. Other nations have contributed
2.1 billion dollars, which U.S. sponsors of the donors conference
hope to see increased.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi condemned Israel's recent attacks on south Lebanon, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In separate telephone calls with his Lebanese and Syrian
counterparts on Sunday, Kharrazi voiced Iran's concern over the
latest developments in south Lebanon and reiterated its support
for Lebanon's resistance against "the Israeli aggressions and
usurpation."
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes on Sunday blasted suspected positions of
Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon in retaliation for the
killing of seven Israeli soldiers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said the recent Israeli measures are aimed
to delay its withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel should withdraw its troops from Lebanon without any
preconditions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and Syrian Foreign
Ministers Farouq al-Sharaa respectively briefed Kharrazi on the
latest developments in south Lebanon and widespread concern over
more Israeli operations.
</P>
<P>
They stated that the Lebanese people and army will continue to
resist Israeli occupation, according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon
in 1985 after two invasions, with the claimed aim of protecting
its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has criticized Syria of supporting Lebanese guerrillas
in escalating attacks against Israel, and of using south Lebanon
as a bargaining chip to force Israel return the Golan Heights it
captured in the 1967 Mideast War.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite road difficulties
created by clan clashes and land mines, the first international
food convey has reached southern Somalia stricken by famine, a
local official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ali Meris, the Rahwanwein official accompanying the food
convoy, said between 4,000 and 5,000 people in 13 villages last
Saturday received more than 360 tons of food including maize and
lentil.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 48 tons of nutritious food known as UNIMAX was
donated collectively by the United Nations agency for the food
program and U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
It took nine days for the food convoy on 32 trucks to reach
its destination from Mogadishu to Huddor area in south Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The food was delivered by the local contracting agency known
as Deqa which also provided the trucks and the escorts.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report reaching here, the people in Bay
and Bakol regions continue dying because of famine and its
related diseases such as tuberculosis, severe diarrhoea and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Four children died from famine three days ago. Hundreds of
people are now suffering from marasmus owing to hunger in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This is the first humanitarian response since famine stalked
Bay and Bakol regions two months ago after the food shortage
precipitated by floods and drought had seriously affected these
regions since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Many other regions in central and southern Somalia are also
suffering from the same problem and an estimated people of
700,000 are reportedly facing food shortage.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will
approve and issue a list of new import tariffs in early December,
according to the Saigon Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily said the new import tariffs are in
line with the newly-revised law on import-export duty, due to come
in force on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The revised tariffs contains three major changes, the daily
quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
First, there are 7,000 tax lines instead of 3,500 tax lines
previously.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the new tariffs have only one column specifying
preferential tax rates for goods of origin of countries or groups
of countries having most-favored nation agreements with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the new tariffs limit the highest tax rate at 50
percent, except for special groups of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of the General Tax Department Truong Chi Trung
said Vietnam now has trade agreement with 64 countries, and their
goods will be eligible for preferential import duty rates.
</P>
<P>
Imports to Vietnam from members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
will enjoy specially preferential rates. However, these goods must
be named specifically in the trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
A list of goods exempted from import duty will also be detailed
in a guiding circular which is being worked out by the Ministry of
Finance and will be announced together with the new tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Party's Work at Central Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji
today called on departments of the central government to enhance
the construction of honest government and improve their
functioning and working style to meet the new situation resulting
from the restructuring of the organs of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
At the 13th Working Conference of the Party Organizations at
the Central Government Departments, Zhu said that the Party's
construction at the departments constitutes an important part of
of the work of the Party as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), said that since the departments of the State Council
engage in many functions of macro guidelines and management, the
Party organizations and Party members are expected to undertake
this arduous historical task in high spirits, high standards and
with high capability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory and
called on Party members at the central government departments to
keep clear heads and a correct political direction in order to
resist wrong ideological tendencies.
</P>
<P>
He called on them to further emancipate their minds and to
create new situations in their work.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government departments as well as the
Party organizations there should persist in the construction of
honest government and the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said that the task of restructuring the State Council organs
has been completed, and that next year the central departments
should get down to the work of realizing the "three changes," that
is, the change of department functions, the change of working
methods, and the change of working style.
</P>
<P>
He urged the departments to set up new regulations, formulate
working procedures and strict discipline in line with the new
functions of the departments. "The working efficiency and service
quality of the departments are expected to be remarkably
improved," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resolutions and decisions of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council must be resolutely carried
out.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), stressed here today that
greater efforts must be made to foster more qualified Chinese

implementation of central policies.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made while Hu, who is also president of the Party
School of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the

study of Deng Xiaoping Theory and educate officials with the
Party's spirit and style focusing on study, politics and a healthy

<HEADLINE> Hariri Refuses to Stay as Lebanon's PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri has refused an offer by the newly-elected
President Emile Lahoud to remain as the country's prime minister,
said a presidential palace statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has accepted Hariri's refusal to head the
new government and is expected to restart consultations to
choose a new premier from Tuesday," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that Lahoud, a former army commander who was sworn in
last week, invited Hariri on Friday to remain in his post but he
refused.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Hariri said he turned down the offer because
the results of the consultations were considered to breach the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under Lebanon's law, the president designates a prime minister
after formally briefing parliament speakers on the outcome of
binding consultations with members of parliament (MP).
</P>
<P>
However, last week's consultations between Lahoud and members
of the 128-seat legislature produced a three-way split with 83
in favor of Hariri's reappointment, a handful against his return
to power and 31 MPs authorizing the president to choose on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
And the MPs' authorization for the president to choose the
premier violated the constitution, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Others say that Hariri's lack of enthusiasm to return had more
to do with trying to gain more control over the new cabinet than
with constitutional considerations.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Elias Hrawi's mandate, the billionaire
prime minister, who first assumed the post in 1992, had virtually
had a free hand in running the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Monday that Israel rejects Arafat's
speech about the declaration of an independent Palestinian state
next year.
</P>
<P>
"Such a statement run counter to the agreements reached between
the two sides and will never be accepted by Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat told the
gathering of Arab-American community in Washington on Sunday that
he will declare an independent Palestinian state next May with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that such a move by Arafat could only cause
damage to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is part of Israel and Jerusalem is the capital of
Israel," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the
establishment of a Palestinian state in the territory and the
Palestinians could only have an entity running daily business, but
without military forces or other powers a state has.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the five-year transitional period
expires next May and Arafat has the right to declare an
independent state by then.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian leader recently declared that any pending
disputes should be settled peacefully through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Spreads Quickly in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS was spreading quickly
in Vietnam with between 100 and 200 more cases detected nationwide
in a week, Vietnam news agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had detected 10,961 HIV/AIDS carriers in 60 of
Vietnam's 61 provinces and cities by November 23, 234 cases more
than the figure of mid-November, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 1,995 cases have developed full-blown AIDS and 1,059
have died.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam's biggest city, has contributed the
highest number with 2,662 cases, followed by Quang Ninh province
with 1,368 cases. Hanoi ranks seventh in the country with 331 HIV
carriers, and six of them have died.
</P>
<P>
The highest AIDS mortality per year was found in Ho Chi Minh
city, Khanh Hoa, An Giang, Dac Lac and Can Tho provinces.
</P>
<P>
Quang Ninh province has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS carriers
of 136.4 per 100,000 people. Ninety percent of newly detected
HIV/AIDS people in Quang Ninh are drug addicts and 27 percent of
them are under 19 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The rate of HIV/AIDS carriers among young people increased
rapidly, with the number of those in the age group of 13-19 rising
by 8.3 times.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Announces 12-Year Program of AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China aims to keep its HIV
infection level under 1.5 million people by the year 2010, while
ending the transmission of HIV through blood transfusions and
intravenous drug use, according to the latest national
AIDS-control program.
</P>
<P>
The program, with approval from the State Council, China's
cabinet, will direct the country's fight against HIV/AIDS that has
preyed upon over 300,000 Chinese so far.
</P>
<P>
The number of people infected by the human immuno deficiency virus
(HIV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS),
may increase to 1.2 million in China by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government and AIDS experts blame the critical situation on
cross-border transmission of HIV in southwestern areas bordering
other countries, where there is a very large floating
population, uncontrolled drug use, and rampant prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The Medium- and Long-term Program of AIDS Prevention and
Control (1998-2010) has determined that the annual increase rate
of the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) should be
under 15 percent by 2002, compared with 16 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of STD incidence has sounded an alarm bell for
AIDS control in China, even though the majority of current HIV
carriers were infected by sharing contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
The country reported 460,000 STD cases last year, a rise of
nearly 16 percent over 1996. But experts fear that the
true figure may be five to ten times that, because most
patients turn to private or unauthorized clinics in order to
remain anonymous, and thus fail to be counted.
</P>
<P>
In order to stir public awareness of disease prevention, the
program includes public information and educational campaigns
which cover 80 percent of the people considered to be at high
risk, such as prostitutes and drug users, as well as 70 percent of
urban dwellers and 40 percent of rural residents.
</P>
<P>
AIDS and STD education will be carried out among all students
at institutions of higher education, secondary schools and
vocational schools. Drug rehabilitation centers, jails and special
schools for reeducation through labor will also hold related
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Places of entertainment or those with large flows of changing
populations, as well as work units whose personnel often go abroad,
should prepare educational material on AIDS," said an outline of
the program provided to Xinhua today by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
A surveillance network will be set up throughout the country
by 2005 composed of a national reference laboratory, some 30
provincial-level AIDS labs, and local institutions which are
able to conduct regular HIV checks.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals able to offer standard treatment, and nursing and
counseling services for HIV carriers and AIDS patients will be
established in major cities and AIDS-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Domestic researchers working on anti-HIV drugs and vaccines
will face a challenging task in the coming decade, as some
breakthroughs are expected to be made in this field.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
today outlined major state-owned-enterprise reforms for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, Sheng
Huaren, said at a press conference here today that reforms for
improving enterprise quality and economic efficiency will continue
next year, with special emphasis on breakthroughs in system
reform, management reinforcement and reduction of losses.
</P>
<P>
At the top of the agenda will be freeing key industries from
difficult conditions. The textile industry will complete its task
of eliminating 10 million spindles, diverting 1.2 million laid-off
workers, and cutting losses by six billion yuan. The same efforts
will be made simultaneously in the wool spinning and silk
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coal industry should reach its target of
closing 25,800 illegal or irrationally located small mines, and
cutting down coal output by 250 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgical, oil and petrochemical, and some other
industries should optimize their structures and stop irrational
repetitive production, he added.
</P>
<P>
The formation of large enterprise groups will continue to be
encouraged. Existing large enterprises and enterprise groups will
be further standardized and improved, while a number of
competitive large enterprise groups will be organized through
market mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
New industrial policies will be designed to optimize industrial
structure, and small enterprises in coal mining, oil refining, cement,
power generation and some other industries with obsolete equipment
will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren also explained next year's plans to reemploy
laid-off workers, remold technology, and enhance market
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned
enterprises have achieved initial results in reform and
restructuring, said a senior government official today.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, told a press conference today that state-owned
enterprises further reinforced their reform efforts this year in a
bid to reach the target of freeing most state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises from their difficulties in about three
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the textiles industry, which is in the forefront
of reform, is expected to reach its target of eliminating 4.8
million cotton spindles, diverting 600,000 laid-off workers and
cutting losses by three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have eliminated 4.808 million spindles and, by the
end of September, diverted 450,000 laid-off workers. By the end of
November, the industry had cut losses by 2.3 billion yuan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all 94 state-owned key coal mines have been
transferred to local governments, and efforts have been made to
close illegal or irrationally located small coal mines.
</P>
<P>
The formation of two large oil and petrochemical groups has
helped establish a unified, open and orderly oil and petrochemical
product market, with overall economic efficiency obviously
improved. The combined profits of the two groups in the first 10
months this year was 2.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Asset restructuring has also helped some metallurgical
enterprises shake off their difficulties and sharply recover
economic efficiency, he said.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank to Take Over Bankers Trust Next Spring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Deutsche Bank Chairman Rolf
Breuer said Monday that he expected the 10 billion U.S. dollar
takeover of the Bankers Trust Corp. to be completed by the spring
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal approved by the directors of Deutsche Bank and
the Bankers Trust Sunday, Deutsche Bank will buy the latter's
stocks at a price of 93 dollars for each share.
</P>
<P>
The takeover is expected to create the world's largest
financial service company with assets of some 850 billion dollars
and 96,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Breuer said at a Frankfurt press conference that the deal could
also save some 1 billion dollars for the two banks, which would
come mainly from reduced personnel and data processing costs.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank chief executive dismissed worries about
possible culture conflicts between the two banks, one German and
the other American.
</P>
<P>
"If one were relationship-oriented and the other transaction-
oriented, there might be culture clashes," he said, confirming his
belief that the merger would proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Breuer admitted that there would be job losses, perhaps
amounting to around 5,500 worldwide. But he said most of the job
losses would be in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
If the merger finishes in the spring of 1999, the actual
launching date for the financial giant would be September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, if successful, will be the largest foreign
takeover of a U.S. financial company. The Bankers Trust is the
eighth-largest U.S. bank.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Aid for Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Monday that it has approved humanitarian aid worth 2.8
million ECU (about 3 million U.S. dollars) for victims of
Hurricane Georges in the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the
funding would cover emergency aid such as food, survival kits,
water and sanitation measures, and materials for house patching up.
</P>
<P>
The aid, covering Saint Kitts, the Dominican Republic, Haiti
and Cuba, would be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office and would enable non-governmental organizations to carry
out an emergency aid program over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, over 400 people died and about
250,000 were rendered homeless after the devastating hurricane
swept through the region.
</P>
<P>
Damage to crops and infrastructure was very serious. Although
those countries did have disaster preparedness and mitigation
strategies, they have called for stepping up and improving such
measures, the EU said.

<HEADLINE> Did Acid Rain Kill the Dinosaur? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said it is suspected that severed acid rain at the end of
Cretaceous period dissolved trace elements including strontium into
the soil. Dinosaurs could have ingested strontium from water and
food both directly and indirectly, causing them to finally became
extinct.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists believe the Earth was hit by a meteor at the
end of the Cretaceous period.
</P>
<P>
"If it was a metal meteorite, the content of nitrogen oxide in
Earth's atmosphere could have increased 100 to 1,000
fold. If it was a comet, nitrogen oxide might have increased
10 million to 100 million fold. The result of both is severe acid
rain," said Deng.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know whether a high strontium content will also
be found in fossilized dinosaur eggs in other places around
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that small mammals emerged on earth at the end of
Cretaceous period, and the acid rain also affected them. But
unlike the gigantic dinosaurs, the small mammals could easily
change their habits and adapt to the environment.

<HEADLINE> Did Acid Rain Kill the Dinosaur? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
recently found new clues from fossilized dinosaur eggs leading
them to believe that it may have been acid rain that killed off
the dinosaurs more than 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Deng Tao of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said
today that chemical analysis of the fossilized dinosaur eggshells
unearthed in the Shanyang Basin in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province contains an unusually high amount of the trace element
strontium.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a high strontium content in the body of an
animal causes holes in the bones and slows down the growth of the
animal.
</P>
<P>
"Experiments show that if hens eat forage containing strontium
to a level 30 percent more than usual, the eggshell will be thin
and fragile, and chickens will not hatch," said Deng.
</P>
<P>
Chemical analysis shows that the content of strontium in the
dinosaur eggshells in Shanyang Basin increased from 0.06 percent
in the early years of the Cretaceous period to 1 percent at the
end of the period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the strontium content in the dinosaur eggs found
in the Nanxiong Basin in south China's Guangdong Province is also
as high as 0.1 percent to 0.38 percent, said Deng.
</P>
<P>
"We found that the dinosaur eggshells in the Shanyang Basin at
the end of Cretaceous period is very thin, with more holes, a
phenomenon similar to the one in the chicken experiment," said
Deng, adding that a dinosaur diet containing too much strontium
could have caused the dinosaurs to lay eggs that would not
hatched.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA to Talk on Third Stage Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will start talks soon to define the scope of the
Israel's third stage troop redeployment in the West Bank, Israeli
Foreign Ministry said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has assigned a ministry official,
along with a low-ranking officer from the Israel Defense Force, to
talk this matter with the Palestinians in the near future, said
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not say how many percent of the West Bank will
be handed over to the Palestinians during the third stage
pullback, but Sharon said in the past that it will only be 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
and Palestinian Preventive Security Chief in Gaza Mohammed Dahlan
will head the Palestinian delegation to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Defining Israel's third stage troop redeployment in the West
Bank is part of implementing the Wye peace accord signed last
month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulates that a Third Further Redeployment
Committee starts its work soon after the accord entering in force
on November 2.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Monday that the United States will not join
the two sides to discuss this matter but let them finalize it by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
the Palestinian side insisted that under the Oslo Accords, the
third stage redeployment should be 30 percent, not 1 percent as
Israel stated.

BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China has almost completed the
building of a unified social security network for retired and
unemployed people, Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, said today.
</P>
<P>
Sheng, speaking at a press conference, said that around 98

KUALA LUMPUR, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has expressed
its desire to establish air links with Malaysia to forge closer
ties and improve trade relations between the two countries,
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia welcomed such a proposal but due to the current
economic slowdown, the government would have to keep the matter in
view, he said after receiving a trade delegation from Kazakhstan
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is prepared to make a study on the route but it is not
likely that air links with the former Soviet republic could be
establish soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the establishment of an air link is important to
businessmen as this would create a business link and could help
"business bloom" among businessmen of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Malaysia and Kazakhstan from January to September
this year stood at 11 million ringgit (2.894 million U.S. dollars)
with exports from Malaysia amounting to 9.9 million ringgit (2.605

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor Values Macao's Peculiarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira said here on Monday that the government will continue to
take effective measures in the coming year to retain Macao's
peculiar life style and status.
</P>
<P>
Expounding his policy and budget for 1999 at the local
Legislative Assembly, the governor said that the peculiarity of
Macao is of importance to both Macao residents and China's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
To maintain Macao's peculiarity conforms to the mutual benefits of
China and Portugal and is of equal value with the concept of "one
country, two systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and gambling have been playing an important role in Macao,
and the future Macao Special Administrative can still make use of the
revenue from these sectors to promote local modernization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Like other areas such as Monaco and Las Vegas which take tourism
and gambling as their economic mainstay, the revenue from these
sectors in Macao is a key to balancing the local budget, the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been paying attention to maintaining these traditional
sectors in Macao's economy, and I believe that the future special
administrative region will firmly carry out the practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor pointed out that Macao's grassroots organizations have
been showing vitality and taken an active part in cultural activities.
The government will surely take the responsibility of financing the
activities of non-governmental bodies.
</P>
<P>
These activities are not held because of the financial support of
the government, but they lie in the residents' deep confidence in
local social values.
</P>
<P>
The policy of localizing personnel and judicial system also acts as
a guarantee for maintaining Macao's special life style and status, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
The government will make great efforts to finance institutions
of higher learning so as to enable them to nurture talented people
for the future.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a sound legal system and clear interest
protection system can attract business people to invest in Macao,
the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Competition in Tanzanian Beer Market to Get Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Competition in
Tanzania's beer market is expected to become tense with a new
brewery going into operation in the northern town of Moshi.
</P>
<P>
The first bottle of beer from Kibo Breweries Ltd. will hit the
market in mid January after its building is completed in late
December, the company's New Product Development Manager Donogh
Lane said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kibo is expected to produce 3.6 metric cases annually, gaining
10 percent of the beer market in Tanzania, Lane told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The company was founded in 1997 as a joint venture between
East African Breweries, the largest brewing group in east Africa,
and the Tarimo family at Moshi.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the company totaled 19 billion Shillings (about
28 million U.S. Dollars), with East African Breweries controlling
82 percent shares and Tarimo family having the rest stake, Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our entry into the market means that there will now be real
competition...," he said. However, he added it will encourage all
competitors to improve their standards through training and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Kibo will recruit 300 people when it reaches full
capacity, but in the short term plans to have some 250 employees,
95 percent of whom are Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Kibo's brands include Tusker Lager, Tusker Keg, Pilsner Lager,
Pilsner Extra and Guinness Stout, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to launch some new Tanzanian beers, which will be
of the highest quality, combined with a significant investment in
marketing," the manager added.
</P>
<P>
Lane said the South Africa-backed Tanzania Breweries Ltd.
(TBL) and the Dar es Salaam-based Associated Breweries will
control 85 percent and five percent of the country's beer market
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Major brands of TBL include Kilimanjaro, Safari, Castle and
Ndovu, while Associated Breweries is famous for the Serengeti
beer.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania's beer market is still at very young stage of
development, and at the moment consumers do not tend to have as
much disposable income as in other markets, and so the rate of
purchase is relatively low.
</P>
<P>
A standard bottle of beer of the company is sold at 500
Shillings, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As the economy develops and grows, we expect the rate of
purchase to increase quite strongly, so there is a good
opportunity for all beer companies to grow their sales in this
situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Party and Government Organizations to Unlink from Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese
government official today reaffirmed that the business firms
associated with the Communist Party of China (CPC), government
organizations and the army will be unlinked by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"All commercial businesses will be cleared by the end of
this year, and some will be reorganized and some others will be
closed," said Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The remaining firms will be divided into two parts: financial
institutions and non-financial ones. The financial institutions
will be supervised by the People's Bank of China and the CPC
Central Committee's Financial Working Committee, and those
non-financial ones will be supervised by the Large and
Medium-sized Enterprises Working Committee under the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sheng gave a detailed time table for the separation, saying
that by December 20, the Party and government organizations will
have to transfer their firms to local governments.
</P>
<P>
As for firms associated with the Army and the Armed Police, the
deadline will be December 15, and for the judicial organs, the
transfers will have to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sheng noted that preparatory work has been done for the
unlinking, and the transfers are already smoothly underway in some
areas, such as Tianjin and Shanghai municipalities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the practice of associating these organs with

<HEADLINE> Camels May Hold Secrets to River Blindness Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MUSCAT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Omani researchers believe that
the immune system of camels may hold the key to the treatment of
river blindness, a major scourge afflicting millions of people in
the third world.
</P>
<P>
Immunological studies underway at the Suhan Qaboos University
suggest that a camel is endowed with a unique immune system, which
protects it from many pests including one that is similar to the
parasite that causes river blindness, Oman's English Observer
Newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The associate professor of the university, Eugene Johnson, who
leads the study, said that he and his teammates hope that their
findings will eventually lead to the development of a vaccine
against the parasite that causes river blindness.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the research on camels' immune system began two
years ago when "we have found that camels become infected with a
parasite very similar to the parasite that causes river blindness
in human beings, but the camel has evolved very unique protective
measures to destroy its parasite."
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore studying how camels kill their parasites to
gain insight into how we may stimulate the immune systems of
humans to rid themselves of their parasites," he said.
</P>
<P>
River blindness afflicts 35 to 40 million people around the
world and is the second largest cause of infectious blindness. It
is endemic in parts of Africa, Latin America and Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Reform of Small State-Owned Enterprises Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China will focus more closely
on the reform of small state-owned enterprises, a State Economic
and Trade Commission (SETC) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 99 percent of China's state-owned enterprises are
small ones, generating about half of all output value and
pre-tax profits and employing some 70 percent of workers
in the state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bangzhu, vice-minister of the SETC, told a press
conference this afternoon that the government will increase its
support to small state-owned enterprises "to cultivate a new
growth point."
</P>
<P>
The policy of liberalizing small enterprises will remain
unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a lack of finances and technological innovation
capabilities are two major problems affecting most small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The SETC is planning to improve the loan guarantee system for
small businesses and to set up regional technological centers for
upgrading these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The SETC is also considering setting up a guarantee fund for
small businesses in the near future. It has chosen Qingdao, Hefei
and Liuzhou as pilot cities for technological innovation in
small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China and the SETC have both issued
circulars on offering better financing to small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that related regulations will be released to prevent
irrational practices in the reform of these enterprises, including
indiscriminate selling of small enterprises and the erosion of
state assets and bank obligations.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to create an environment conducive to fair
competition among enterprises of various sizes and ownership
structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of
Parliament which began here Monday was forced to be adjourned as
soon as it started in a storm.
</P>
<P>
Members of some Opposition parties stalled the proceedings in
the Lower House of Parliament demanding resignation of the
Vajpayee government, which was held responsible for the defeat of
the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the just concluded
four-State Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Opposition Sharad Pawar, a senior leader from the
Congress, the biggest Opposition in the House, demanded that the
question hour be suspended and the House should discuss the issue
of spiraling price rise. As Pawar was on his legs, some other
Opposition members rushed into the well of the House shouting, the
prime minister must resign.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, non-Congress Opposition in the Upper House of
Parliament Monday also demanded resignation of the Vajpayee
government for its utter failure to control prices in the country.
The Congress charged the government with mismanagement pushing the
country's economy to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House Manmohan Singh said
that alarming price situation was a reflection of gross
mismanagement of the economy and that the government was lax to
the point of criminality.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India member Gurudas Dasgupta said that
the Vajpayee government should resign forthwith before greater
disaster strikes the economy as unabated price rise was due to
total mismanagement and collapse of the government.
</P>
<P>
The speaker repeatedly requested the members to take their
seats and allow taking up of the question hour. Later on he was
forced to adjourn the House till Monday afternoon as the members
refused to leave the well.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Raises Alarm over Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's population is likely
to increase from 108 million at present to 178 million in another
25 years if unchecked, a senior Nigerian official said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of National Population Commission (NPC) Lt. General
Chris Ugokwe was delivering a lecture entitled "The Challenge of
Population and Environment in the Next Millennium", according to
a This Day report Monday.
</P>
<P>
He told a workshop organized by the National Council on
Population and Environmental Activities (NCPEA) at the weekend
that the population of Nigeria had grown at an annual growth rate
of about 2.83 percent, slightly more than double the world
average rate of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the implication of this rapid population
growth is the shortage of water and arable land, and it also
results in the low per capita income which stands at about 283
U.S. Dollars in this West African country.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chief disclosed that the high rate of population
growth in Nigeria's urban centers was largely responsible for
over-crowding, traffic congestion, pollution from vehicle
emissions and solid waste management.
</P>
<P>
He suggested population stabilization measures involving the
education of the feminine gender as a counter-strategy to keep
the nation's population growth trends in check.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, detrimental impact on the environment would, in
many contexts, be best reduced by a combined strategy of slowing
down population growth, rationalizing population distribution,
alleviating poverty...," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The poverty eradication scheme, Ugokwe stated, should involve
a program package with special focus on girls and women which
will help reduce fertility.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, NCPEA National President Prince Juli
Adelusi-Adeluyi pledged the support of his organization to the
Nigerian government in its efforts of population stabilization.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to
intensify research into tea production so that the output of the
cash crop could reach 400,000 tons by the end of this century,
compared with 25,500 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The government responsibility in tea research has been taken

</P>
<P>
The institute will be funded by all producers and British

principal sites, namely Ngwazi Tea Research Station in the Iringa
Region in the southern highlands and Marikitanda Tea Research
Station in the Tanga Region in the north.

Tea is one of Tanzania's major foreign exchange earner, along
with coffee, cotton, cashew-nuta, tobacco and sisal. Major
producing regions include Mbeya, Kagera, Iringa and Tanga.

BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises saw a 59.5-percent decrease in the amount

period.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and

</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sheng noted, the state-owned enterprises have
continuously reduced the range of downturn in profits on a monthly

<HEADLINE> SAARC to Host Workshop on NAFTA, SAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A five-day workshop on the
North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) is scheduled to open here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the Kathmandu-based
Secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) and the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), will bring together eminent economic experts,
government officials from the SAARC countries, academics and
representatives of the private sector, the SAARC Secretariat said
in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop primarily aims to apprise the participants about
the present trends in different parts of the world toward the
establishment of free trade areas, the secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
It would particularly aim at facilitating the sharing of
experience on the creation of the NAFTA and its relevance for the
creation of a free trade area in South Asia, the secretariat
added.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The workshop would also provide an important
opportunity for the participants to gain important insights into
the recent evaluations in the world trading system, regional trade
arrangements, participation of developing countries in free trade
areas, trade in goods and services, trade-related aspects of
intellectual property rights, and specific issues on tariff
regimes, rules of origin and issues relating to services and
investment."
</P>
<P>
"Leading experts in these areas from Canada would make the main
presentations on these subjects at the workshop," the secretariat
noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that the workshop is one of the first joint activities
within the framework of a SAARC/CIDA memorandum of understanding
signed in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC originally decided to establish the SAFTA by 2001,
but the SAARC leaders deferred the deadline indefinitely at their
10th summit in July.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote economic and
social development in the region, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China has enjoyed dynamic
diplomacy since adoption of the reform and opening-up policies 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The second and third generations of the collective leadership
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has seriously implemented
Deng Xiaoping's ideology on diplomacy and has steadfastly carried
out the independent foreign policy of peace devised by his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and countries throughout the world
have universally improved significantly and developed on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. China's
international standing has improved remarkably along with the
noticeable rise in its influence in the world affairs.
</P>
<P>
China has emerged as a major force in maintaining world peace
and promoting the progress of mankind. The nation has established
diplomatic relations with 164 countries, including the United
States on January 1, 1979, and with Tonga earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's introduction of peace and development as the
top priorities in the modern world has served as the guide for
readjustments in China's international strategy and diplomatic
efforts since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Deng advocated the establishment of a new just and rational
international political and economic orders in line with the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin, have clearly
expounded China's position and principled stand on the
establishment of the new just and rational international political
and economic orders.

Numerous other countries, especially developing countries, have
praised China's active participation in multilateral and
international activities, as well as its efforts to uphold justice
in world affairs and strict opposition to hegemonism and power
politics.
</P>
<P>
China, a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, has played a special and active role in promoting just
and peaceful settlements of major regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
China has ignored pressure and staunchly insisted on ensuring
the stability of its yuan throughout the ongoing financial crisis
engulfing Asia currencies. Moreover, the 5.5 billion U.S. dollars
in aid China has provided to relevant countries have helped
prevent the crisis from worsening and have been the subject of
high praise from the international community.
</P>
<P>
China has initiated dialogue and cooperation on the basis of
equality and mutual respect, and opposes interference in the
internal affairs of any country under the pretext of human
rights. China has successfully defeated seven anti-China motions a
few western countries have tabled at human right conferences in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has actively participated in disarmament
activities and talks on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. China
was in fact one of the first nations to sign the treaty.

The development momentum of Sino-Japanese relations has
continued in recent years, with the two important neighboring
states in East Asia scoring great stride in wide-ranging
cooperation and exchanges. This year marks the 20th anniversary of
China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty. President Jiang has
returned from a state visit to Japan during which the two sides
agreed to build a friendly and cooperative 21st century
partnership devoted to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
China has entered a new period with the comprehensive
development of relations with Europe, including members of
European Union (EU) such as Germany, Britain and France. President
Jiang visited Germany in 1995 and pointed out that the guiding
principles for relations between China and West Europe center on
mutual respect, equality, mutual benefits and seeking common
interests while setting difference aside. Said principles have
established a solid foundation for strengthening cooperative
Sino-European relations. Last February, the EU decided to refrain
from tabling anti-China resolutions during the annual session of
United Nations Commission on Human Rights. A short time later, in
March, the European Commission released a document entitled
"Building a Comprehensive Partnership with China" which advocated
strengthening relations between China and the EU. Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji held his first meeting with EU leaders last April and
the two sides stressed their willingness to form a healthy and
stable constructive partnership geared to the 21st century and to
devise mechanisms for regular annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The smooth resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the
approaching return of Macao undoubtedly represent the victory of
Deng Xiaoping's monumental concept of "one country, two systems."
Relations between China and Britain also improved since the
handover of Hong Kong, with reciprocal visits by Premier Zhu and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair injecting new vitality into
Sino-British relations.

<P>
Over the past two decades, and especially since the beginning
of the 1990s, China's leaders have implemented Deng Xiaoping's
concepts on diplomacy, while at the same time scoring noteworthy
achievements in blueprinting and carrying out a series of policies
for handling bilateral and multilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In spite of serious setbacks along the way, Sino-U.S. relations
have witnessed signs of improvement and development in the second
half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin completed a successful visit to the
United States in October 1997, with U.S. President Bill Clinton
reciprocating in June this year. The two leaders agreed to extend
great efforts to establish a constructive strategic partnership,
defining the framework and direction for Sino-U.S. relations in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to strengthen and expand cooperation
in the environmental, energy, scientific and technological, legal,
educational and cultural arenas.
</P>
<P>
The United States is currently China's second largest trade
partner, with the later ranking as the fourth largest trade
partner of the former.
</P>
<P>
China strictly adheres to its principles on issues such as the
Taiwan issue, bilateral trade and human rights, and safeguarding
China's sovereignty, territory integrity and dignity.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia normalized their relations in 1992 with bilateral
ties having since witnessed stable and healthy growth. The 21st
century strategic partnership the two nations established on the
basis of equality and trust marked the advent of a new phase of
comprehensive bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and three central Asian nations have signed
agreements on border issues and the reduction of military forces
in related areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreements have successfully resolved problems involving
stability and security along the 7,000-km long borders separating
the five nations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed a joint statement in Moscow in April 1997, calling for
advancing the multipolarization process and establishing new
political and economic orders based on "peace, stability, justice
and fairness."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese president completed an informal visit
to Russia recently, with the two sides reaching a consensus on
international development trends in trans-century period and
strengthening bilateral cooperation. The visit raised mutual
understanding and trust between the two nations to a new plateau.

<P>
China has extended great efforts over the past 20 years to
expand its foreign relations by developing interparliamentary,
inter-party and nongovernmental diplomatic exchanges. The National
People's Congress (NPC) has established links with 140
parliaments worldwide and formed extensive friendly ties with 50
of the organizations. The Communist Party of China (CPC) has
carried out comprehensive exchanges with ruling parties and other
major political parties in countries throughout the world. The CPC
has established various links with 300-odd political parties in
130 countries. The Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) has also played its role in foreign
relations. The Chinese military has also actively engaged in
exchanges with nongovernmental organizations, and Chinese cities
have formed sister city with 800 cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
Active and highly successful diplomatic efforts over the past
20 years have greatly supported China's socialist modernization
efforts, reform and opening drive based on economic
construction. Related efforts have also created favorable
international environment for development of the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
China's diplomacy has formed a multifaceted diplomatic
structure as a result of adjustments and development over the past
two decades of reform and opening. On the eve of the new century,
the CPC's third generation leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at
the core has demonstrated its diplomatic finesse in a bid to meet
challenges and opportunities amidst international changes, and
confidently bring a prosperous, thriving and powerful China into
the 21st century.

China has strengthened ties with both neighboring and
developing countries over the past 20-odd years, while at the same
time carrying out active exchanges via different channels.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and bordering countries, as well as
other Asian nations, have continually improved and developed since
the 1980s. China and its neighboring countries have recorded major
progress in addressing historic problems, demarcating borders and
promoting economic and trade cooperation. China has also
significantly improved bilateral ties with some neighboring
countries. President Jiang attended the informal summit between
China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
December 1997. The Chinese president and ASEAN leaders outlined
targets and guiding principles for strengthening good-neighborly
partnerships and mutual confidence geared to the 21st
century. Jiang's state visits to the Philippines, India, Pakistan
and Nepal defined the direction for developing ties in the coming
century. A number of Chinese leaders' visits to Viet Nam, the
Democratic Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and all
ASEAN members as well as the status of the "comprehensive dialogue
partnership" inked between China and ASEAN in 1996 have greatly
promoted relations between the aforementioned countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
China's has solidified and strengthened relations with
developing countries in Africa and Latin American. China, the
world's largest developing country, has consistently supported and
in turn won the support of other developing countries in
international affairs, and has expanded cooperation with related
nations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. President
Jiang presented five suggestions during his tour of Africa and
Premier Li Peng listed five principles during his 1996 visit to
Latin America. The suggestions and principles have since served as
the guidelines for developing ties between China and countries on
both continents. They have also played a positive role in
promoting political and economic cooperation, as well as common
development.

<HEADLINE> hke113027 - Australian Trade Deficit Still Stands High in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's deficit for trade
in goods and services remained at more than 1 billion Australian
dollars (630 million U.S. dollars) in October for the second
consecutive month, official figures released Monday show.
</P>
<P>
A 147-million-U.S.-dollar surge in imports, coupled with a rise
in exports worth 86 million U.S. dollars, led to the trade balance
of goods and services widening to a seasonally adjusted 1.11
billion Australian dollars (699.3 million U.S. dollars), the
Australian Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a deficit of about 544 million U.S.
dollars, after the figure reached 1.01 billion Australian dollars
(636 million U.S. dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
Imports were worth 10.9 billion Australian dollars (6.93
billion U.S. dollars) in October, while exports were worth 9.79
billion Australian dollars (6.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the deficit in October was the second highest
on record, after it reached 1.162 billion Australian dollars
(738.7 million U.S. dollars) in August 1989.
</P>
<P>
It said merchandise exports to 10 selected trading partners in
Southeast and north Asia fell in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
In October, exports to such economies as China, Hong Kong and
Indonesia plunged although sales to Japan and South Korea were
strong and gold bullion sales to Europe rose.
</P>
<P>
"October 1998 exports to Japan are the third highest on
record," the bureau said.

Accompanying Daley will be senior officials of 18 U.S.
transnational corporations including AT&AMP;T, Chevron, Dupont,
Cargill, Eastman Kodak and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. private sector shares strong interest in the African
market, Daley said before leaving for Africa.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Assimilated Into Zambian Society: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 14,000 refugees in
Zambia have been assimilated into the local society in the past
years, according to a report obtained Monday from the office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
These refugees who reside in urban areas of Zambia, mostly in
capital Lusaka but also in the towns of the Copperbelt province,
have been integrated into the Zambian society since they have
been in the country for many years and have secured means to
sustain themselves, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia hosts some 167,000 refugees with the
majority originating from Angola while others arrived in Zambia
from such countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda,
Burundi and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government only allows refugees to assimilate into
the mainstream society if they could fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR supports some of the refugees, who find it more
difficult to assimilate, through skills training activities or
the provision of micro-loans, to facilitate their economic
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the U.N. refugee body hailed the Zambian
government for upholding and protecting refugees' basic human
rights and maintaining an open door policy toward the victims of
war, political and other forms of persecution.

TOKYO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo on
Monday with the key Nikkei index closing below 15,000 for the
first time in a week as skepticism over an alliance between the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Liberal Party (LP) thickened.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 185.69 points, or 1.23
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 14,883.70.

<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 14.85 points or 1.28 percent to

Turnover on the major section slid to an estimated 382 million
shares from Friday's 506.20 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Selling accelerated in the afternoon when Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi told the Diet (parliament) it would be
"difficult" to reduce or suspend the 5 percent consumption tax,
something LP lawmakers want to encourage personal spending.

It looks like some investors have lost hope on a sales tax cut,
and this is having a psychological impact on the market, a dealer

<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Analogue mobile phone owners
in Australia will have up to an extra 12 months of service after
their government and the country's major mobile phone carriers
Telstra, Optus and Vodafone agreed to extend the phase-out period.
</P>
<P>
Instead of cutting out on January 1, 2000, the last of the 400
base stations will close by December 31, 2000, Australian
Communications Minister Richard Alston said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The analogue service will be replaced with digital service,
which is superior.

<P>
"We'll have digital technology, which is clearly superior in
every respect," the minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the analogue phase-out in metropolitan
Australia remained unchanged, with services ceasing on December
31, 1999, replaced entirely by the existing GMS digital service.

<HEADLINE> This Year's Hurricane Season Ends Monday, Say U.S. Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 29 (Xinhua) -- This year's Atlantic
hurricane starting June 1 winds up Monday after racking up the
deadliest toll in more than 200 years, said a U.S. scientist
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic season's last gasp was Tropical Storm Nicole,
which formed last week and expected to weaken as it was swept even
farther north over cooler seas, said pioneering hurricane
forecaster William Gray at Colarado State University.
</P>
<P>
With the gradual fading of the latest cycle of the El Nino
phenomenon, which tends to suppress Atlantic hurricanes, 1998 saw
10 hurricanes and four tropical storms, Gray added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Pacific hurricane season was about average
with 13 named storms and nine hurricanes and will also end Monday.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from Mitch, the season's monster, is estimated
at more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Explaining that the last four years have been the most active
ever for hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, Gray warned more of the
same hurricane season is possible next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see the return of some of these types of
storms," he said. "People have to face up to it. The insurance
industry has a major problem."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker Amid Rate Cut Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Monday, as market expectations that the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA), the country's central bank, could cut interest
rates this week.
</P>
<P>
"Basically the currency is just slowly edging down on
expectations that tomorrow or later in the week the RBA may well
cut rates (when the central bank board meets)," said Angelo
Gangemi, foreign exchange manager of Bankers Trust Australia.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed in Sydney Monday at 63.15 U.S. cents,
from 63.58 U.S. cents previously, after marking a 63.14 to 63.45
U.S. cent band during the session.
</P>
<P>
Gangemi said volume had been light, but there had been a lot of
speculative sellings during the past four trading sessions in
anticipation of a RBA move on rates.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last cut rates on July 30, 1997, by 50 basis points to
5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recently several overseas central banks, including the U.S.
Federal Reserve, have eased monetary policy but the RBA has so far
not responded.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates the Australian dollar was buying 78.12
Japanese yen from 78.03 yen Friday and 1.0798 German marks from
1.0821 marks.

NEW YORK -- U.S. billionaire financier George Soros warned that
the global economy is facing the risk of recession in the next
couple of years despite the current stock market revival, said a
report in the Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stock market is expected to retest previous lows
probably next year despite the current record highs in the wake of
three rounds of interest cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve since
September 29, he told the December 7 issue of Newsweek. The
U.S. economy is amid a "fairly mature boom" and faces growing cost
pressures while Japan is still in recession and Brazil may follow
suit, although it has received an aid package of 41.5 billion
U.S. dollars, he said. (US-Soros-Economic Outlook)

<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee's head coordinator for the 2000 Olympics warned Sydney
Olympic Games organizers to expect problems in Sydney Olympics,
according to reports from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rogge's comments came after Rod McGeoch, an important
member of the Sydney Games'(SOCOG) organizing board, resigned
last week.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts within the board were obvious after other members
claimed that McGeoch, also the hero who brought the 2000 Games to
Sydney during the bid in 1993, charged a fee to address the
preparatory work for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Of course, McGeoch denied the allegation. His resignation
shocked the IOC and became the climax of the event.
</P>
<P>
Rogge believed that McGeoch's quit would bring about great
loss to SOCOG and other bickering and turmoil would loom on the
rugged and rough road to 2000 Olympic Games.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zainur Zakaria, one of
former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's defense
lawyers, was sentenced by the High Court here Monday to three
months' jail for contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur High Court Judge S. Augustine Paul made the order
after Zainur refused to apologize over his application to remove
two senior Deputy Public Prosecutors from conducting the
prosecution in Anwar's on-going corruption trial which entered the
16th day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who faces five corruption charges and five sodomy
charges, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, related to
allegations that he used his position to cover up claims of
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Zainur had filed Anwar's application to remove Abdul Gani and
Azahar, charging them with "going out of their way" to get Anwar's
tennis partner, S. Nallakaruppan, to fabricate evidence in order
to charge him (Anwar) with further sexual offenses.
</P>
<P>
Anwar claimed that Abdul Gani had indicated to Nallakaruppan's
lawyer, Manjeet Singh Dhillon, that he would consider reducing
Nallakaruppan's charge if he was prepared to "falsely implicate me
(Anwar) in the commission of sexual offenses with various married
and unmarried women."
</P>
<P>
Nallakaruppan is facing a charge of unlawful possession of
bullets under the Internal Security Act which carries the death
penalty upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's application was filed in the High Court over the
weekend by Zainur.
</P>
<P>
Justice Augustine Paul said he had found that there was no such
fabrication as alleged in the application.
</P>
<P>
The High Court also issued a warrant of arrest against lawyer
Manjeet Singh Dhillon for contempt of court over the same issue.
</P>
<P>
Manjeet should be brought to the High Court as soon as possible
to show cause why he should not be charged for contempt of court,
Justice Augustine Paul said.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) is seeking to set up joint ventures with
Zambia of gemstone industry, Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ILO is seeking Zambian partners to go into the joint
ventures and establish a center to cut and polish gemstones
locally, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted ILO program officer Adel Gromov as saying
that the ILO has secured a building and trainers to assist
emerging entrepreneurs to become self-reliant but needs the
support of local business houses.
</P>
<P>
Gromov said setting up the center equipped with stone
polishing and cutting machines for use by various small scale
entrepreneurs will generate foreign exchange through the export
of high grade gemstones.
</P>
<P>
The center is expected to employ 40,000 people including
trainers, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for Zambian partners to support the center
which will be run by Zambians where we shall provide various
skills in gemstone processing," said the ILO official.
</P>
<P>
Chairman for Emeralds and Semi-Precious Stones Mining
Association of Zambia, Ndiwa Yuyi, is supportive of the ILO's
initiative and expressed hope that Zambian businessmen will
support the cause to increase the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said recently that his
country's gemstones are exported in raw form, thus fetching low
prices. In 1997 for instance, a total of 1,050,000 grams of
emerald was sold at a paltry nine million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said something must be done to improve the gemstone
processing capacity in order to raise national income.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The predominant tasks of the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, are to keep the
value of Chinese currency (yuan) stable and promote economic
growth, according to PBOC Governor Dai Xianglong.
</P>
<P>
Dai outlined the tasks in an article carried in today's
People's Daily. The article -- Historical Responsibilities of
PBOC -- marks 50th anniversary of the founding of PBOC on December
1.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the stability of the yuan is the primary task of
China's monetary policy and represents a summary of international
and domestic macroeconomic management experience and lessons, said
Dai. The bank official also cited the PBOC's contributions to
fighting inflation and maintaining the stability of the yuan
during different periods of New China.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC has attached great importance to adjusting monetary
and credit policies needed to support economic growth and advance
the rational reorganization of the economic structure in
accordance with different economic development strategies and
national economic construction policies in different periods of
time, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC has depended on the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory
and has persistently proceeded in line with China's actual
situations. The bank has scientifically applied monetary
policies as tools to regulate macro financial operations in line
with basic experience in successfully drafting and implementing
monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Adherence to a comparatively tight monetary policy and
flexibly regulating the money supply represent basic
requirements for ensuring the stability the Chinese currency and
goals for economic growth, according to Dai.

<P>
Efforts must be made to reform the management of rural credit
cooperatives and improve financial service networks in rural areas
in line with the principle of a cooperative system. said Dai.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the gradual expansion of diverse financial
institutions in accordance with objective demands of economic
development, and the supervisory management capacity of the PBOC,
the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the importance of intensifying supervisory
management and safeguarding the steady and healthy operations of
the financial sector in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Dai stressed that improved supervision is needed to safeguard
the normal operations of the financial sector and ensure the
foundation for effectively implementing monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
"Existing supervisory management should be carried out in line
with the operational principles for different business lines,"
said Dai. He added that restructuring of the PBOC management
system of PBOC represents a major step towards intensifying
supervision.

He emphasized that efforts should also be made to improve
standards for gradually opening China's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The central government has acted responsibly by maintaining the
stability of the yuan and extend loans exceeding four billion
U.S. dollars to countries and regions hit by the ongoing financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a stable exchange rate and gradually realizing the
full convertibility of the yuan are goals for the restructuring of

institutions accounted for a quarter of total hard currency loans
in China.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign banks in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been
granted approval to settle accounts in Chinese currency on a trial
basis.
</P>
<P>
Nine insurance companies from eight countries have established
12 branches in China, with 10 branches currently in operation.
</P>
<P>
China will observe the following principles while expanding and
improving efforts to open its financial sector: guaranteeing fair
competition and mutual benefits; ensuring that efforts to open the
financial sector are compatible with development of economic and
trade cooperation, as well as the capability of supervision;
approving more credible foreign financial institutions with
economic might and management expertise; and gradually granting
national treatment to all foreign financial institutions in terms
of taxation, services and supervision, according to Dai.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Govt. May Withdraw from National Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government could
pull out of the troubled National Bank of Kenya (NBK), and
banking altogether, after resolving the crisis caused by panic
withdrawals and huge bad debts owed by powerful individuals.
</P>
<P>
Even after the state paid 33.3 million U.S. Dollars two weeks
ago to counter a run on NBK, it still requires an additional 50
million Dollars recommended by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stressed that the Kenyan government should pump in
more money to stabilize the bank and then the World Bank's
International Finance Corporation may help find a willing buyer
for Kenyan government's 22.5 percent stake in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The NBK, the fourth largest in this east African country, has
accrued 8.4 billion Shillings (140 million Dollars) of bad debts
owed by parastatals and powerful individuals including two
cabinet ministers and the deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
The IMF proposals follow the recent collapse of five small
private commercial banks and a run on the NBK by frightened
depositors which took 26.6 million Dollars out of the bank's
reserves three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government also has shares in the Kenyan Commercial
Bank and Consolidated Bank.

<HEADLINE> Polar Seabed Core Recovered by Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists, including a
team of New Zealanders working on the Cape Roberts Project in
Antarctica, have recovered a core of the sea floor that dates back
20 to 33 million years, a Wellington-based newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted the project's chief scientist, Peter
Barrett of Victoria University in Wellington, as saying that
scientists working on the six-country, multi-million-dollar
project are delighted with its progress.
</P>
<P>
Drillers had worked in sub-zero temperatures off Cape Roberts
completing coring for the season at 624 meters below the sea
floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a credit to the 11 drillers and nine support staff who
have worked around the clock in 12-hour shifts since
mid-October," he said.
</P>
<P>
The drillers had worked in unusually difficult conditions for
several weeks before reaching firmer drilling and making
spectacular progress in the final days, Professor Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
Electric logs were being run the full length of the hole to
fully characterize the strata, he added.
</P>
<P>
The core is being studied by more than 50 scientists from
Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and the United
States at laboratories at the drill site, base camp and McMurdo
Station, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
The core, he said, represents strata deposited on the sea floor
at the edge of the Antarctic continent.
</P>
<P>
Sedimentary features in the core -- mud, sand and stones --
deposited from glaciers or floating ice, record the waxing and
waning of ice sheets in the distant past when the earth's average
temperature was between three and four degrees Celsius warmer
than at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the project's third attempt at drilling the hole, he
said, adding that the team would produce an initial report on
their findings before December 14, and then return to their home
countries.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand-Germany Air Services Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Monday welcomes
Germany's agreement to remove a quota restricting Air New
Zealand's carriage of Germany-U.S. and Germany-Australia
passengers on its services to and from Frankfurt, to the benefit
of Lufthansa's services on those routes.
</P>
<P>
The quota was introduced in 1993 as a condition for allowing
Air New Zealand to operate a third weekly service to Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
"The quota was an irritant in our aviation relationship with
Germany, and we are pleased to see it gone," New Zealand Minister
of Transport Maurice Williamson said Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that following success in recent air
services negotiations between New Zealand and Germany, flight
frequencies for the airlines of each side, when using their own
aircraft, increase from three services per week to five services
per week with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
"A further increase to seven services per week will be
effective from October next year," he said, adding that there are
now no restrictions on the number of code-share flights that can
be provided, nor on the number of cargo-only services that can be
operated.
</P>
<P>
"Access for New Zealand airlines to more destinations in
Germany was also agreed," Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
"Three destinations in Germany are now available for
own-aircraft services, with all other destination points
available through code-shared services," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Previously, only one destination point was available for
own-aircraft services," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Williamson said Air New Zealand is looking to
join early next year the Star Alliance, an airline grouping with
Lufthansa being a founder member.

<HEADLINE> Soros Sees Recession Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. billionaire financier
George Soros warned that the global economy is facing the risk of
recession in the next couple of years despite the current stock
market revival, said a report in the Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stock market is expected to retest previous lows
probably next year despite the current record highs in the wake of
three rounds of interest cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve since
September 29, he told the December 7 issue of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is amid a "fairly mature boom" and faces
growing cost pressures while Japan is still in recession and
Brazil may follow suit, although it has received an aid package of
41.5 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the situation, the global economy "is liable to slip into
a recession next year or the year after," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Soros made a fortune in previous years through his fund
management business. As the Asian financial crisis has been
spreading, his 20 billion dollar Quantum group of hedge funds has
suffered loses this year, like many other hedge funds have.
</P>
<P>
He believed that international cooperation and global efforts
could help stabilize the world financial system.
</P>
<P>
"To put it bluntly, the choice confronting us is whether we
will regulate global financial markets internationally or leave it
to each individual state to protect its own interests as best as
it can," he said.

<P>
Some BJP members and its allies even said that the Assembly
election results, which were generally regarded as a referendum,
would not pose any threat to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress winning a big victory in the assembly elections is
expected to move an adjournment motion in the Parliament on the
spiraling prices to expose the "fragility" of the Vajpayee
government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sonia Gandhi has given the green signal for
the move in the winter session aiming at parliamentary censure
against the ruling party and government. The Congress, however,
decided not to take any immediate plan to topple the central
government, but to take a wait-and-watch attitude at the moment.
</P>
<P>
In one of its resolutions here Sunday, the Congress Working
Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the party,
described the victory in the assembly elections as a vote for Mrs.
Sonia Gandhi's leadership and against the "anti-people" policies
of the BJP government at the center and in the states.
</P>
<P>
But the CWC did not demand the resignation of the prime
minister, in line with the stand of Sonia Gandhi, who gave
indications to reporters the Congress was prepared to wait for the
moment. She also indicated that the party was ready for a mid-term
poll if it was forced upon the country.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has won 173 of the 320 seats in Madhya Pradesh,
150 of the 200 seats in Rajasthan and 51 of the 70 seats in Delhi.
The BJP's tally is 120, 33 and 15 respectively.
</P>
<P>
After Sonia cleared the plan for an adjournment motion,
Congress Parliamentary Party leaders immediately began
consultations with other Opposition leaders on the strategy to be
adopted on the floor of the two Houses. The Congress is confident
that the BJP allies will not stand up for the BJP on the price
issue and that a Parliamentary censure is certain.
</P>
<P>
Although the government will not have to quit if the House
adopts the adjournment motion, the prime minister and the BJP will
lose face. The ruling party will be left with no option but to
acknowledge that it had mismanaged the price issue, the Congress
party sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the case of a no-trust motion, the allies of the BJP may
decide to stick together for the time being as they do not see an
alternative in sight. Sonia Gandhi maintains this is not the right
time for a no-trust motion, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Left Front in the country is said to have stopped short of
demanding an outright resignation from the Central Government, but
observed that it had "no moral right to continue" in view of a
"clear verdict" in the assembly polls. "If they do, it would be an
affront to the people," said senior leader of the Communist Party
of India (Marxism) Somnath Chatterjee.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The electoral setback
suffered by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the
assembly elections has led to exasperation in the corporate
sector, with industry captains calling the situation "fluid", The
Business Standard said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Mid-term polls are inevitable in 1999. The only questions left
to be answered are whether they will be held before the summer or
after the summer and who will lead us to it: a BJP government or a
Congress government. Neither the BJP government nor a Congress
government - if it is formed - can complete the full five-year
term of the Lower House of Parliament," the paper quoted Bajaj
Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj as saying.
</P>
<P>
A mid-term poll next year would have adverse impacts on the
economy as it would mean more populist policies besides the high
expenditure on conducting elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were two positive fallouts of the political
developments: first, that only the BJP and the Congress are
serious contenders to form the government at the Center, and
secondly, the Congress leaders have become aware that there is an
alternative to the party, he further said.
</P>
<P>
Another corporate chief executive (Eicher Group) Subodh
Bhargava said that the assembly election results were a
"qualitative assessment" of the BJP rule by the voters. "The
Madhya Pradesh election results, in particular, have proved that
the voting pattern was not just blind anti-incumbency."
</P>
<P>
Asian Paints vice-chairman Ashwin Choksi said that a mid-term
poll could not be ruled out. "One should not be surprised (if it
happens)."
</P>
<P>
Sanmar Group chairman N. Kumar said that "more fluid" was the
right expression to describe the current political situation. "It
was always fluid," he said.

BEIJING -- China's shoe industry, one of the world's largest,
is now facing serious challenges in a more competitive market as
well as from its large capacity, and analysts are calling for a
new round of changes.

Since the late 1980s, China has imported a large amount of
production equipment that made the industry grow rapidly.
According to the State Statistics Bureau, China produced more than
6.29 billion pairs of shoes last year, about four times the 1985

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Forms New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's new government
was officially formed Monday after the National Assembly approved
the new political platform and a cabinet led by new Prime Minister
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Ninety nine out of the 116 parliamentarians who attended the
confidence vote of the new government voted to endorse Hun Sen as
prime minister and his 82-member cabinet, while 13 voted against,
three abstained and one vote was declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Sam Rainsy Party's 10 parliamentarians were among
those who voted against.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy Party lawmakers said they voted against the new
government because of un-investigated election-related complaints
and the lack of change between the last government and the new
one.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, nominated by his own Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
for the sole premiership, was named new prime minister by King
Norodom Sihanouk last Wednesday night and appointed to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who has been prime minister since 1985, will lead a
new coalition comprising two major political parties for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The vote for the legitimacy of the government brought an end to
nearly 17 months of political uncertainty prompted by the ouster
of former first prime minister Prince Ranariddh in July last year.
</P>
<P>
In the new government, the CPP holds 12 ministers among 25
ministries while Prince Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gains 11. The two
key ministries of defense and interior still have co-ministers.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong, senior advisor to Hun Sen and ambassador to
France, was appointed minister of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, also a CPP member and former co-minister of
interior, was named deputy prime minister while remaining as
co-minister of interior with his FUNCINPEC partner You Hockry.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sisowath Sirirath, a FUNCINPEC member and ambassador to
the United Nations, became co-defense minister with the CPP's Tea
Banh who has been holding the post since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CPP member Keat Chhon remains the minister of
finance and economy.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of FUNCINPEC Tol Lah became deputy prime
minister while maintaining his former post of minister of
education.

NANNING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and domestic tourists
alike tend to avoid harsh winter weather in north China and
instead prefer the pleasant weather and scenery in coastal cities
in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful beaches in Beihai, mountains covered with colorful
trees in Qinzhou and charming trips organized by Fangchenggang
are attracting an increasing number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tourism represents a new growth area in these three coastal
cities which are accelerating the construction of infrastructure
and opening new tour itineraries.
</P>
<P>
For example, Beihai has leased a luxury cruise ship from a Hong
Kong and is currently offering cruises to Viet Nam. In addition,
Weizhou Island is preparing to construct an Ocean Park, Thai
Culture Center and Vacation Village.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wenyan, Party secretary of Fangchenggang, said the
prospering tourism industry has promoted the city's overall
economic growth. Fangchenggang expects to attract 2.9 million
tourists this year, with the sector's earning expected to hit 10
million yuan (about 1.25 U.S. million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Hainan Farmers Enjoy Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "green passage"
in Hainan, China's southernmost island province, not only supplies
fresh fruits and vegetables to other parts of China throughout the
year, but also provides a good income for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Hainan farmers enjoy good harvests throughout the year
and ensure abundant market supplies of fruit and vegetable to
parts of the country subject to harsh winter weather. The
integration of production and marketing have created favorable
conditions greatly enhancing the prosperity of farmers.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yacheng Town in the province's second largest city
of Sanya has emerged as the largest production base in the
province. Struggling local farmers who eked out a meager living a
short 10 years ago now grow vegetables but operate transport
companies.
</P>
<P>
The annual per capita income of farmers has jumped to 3,000
yuan (375 U.S. dollars), up dramatically from less than 400 yuan
only a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The improved status of farmers has been attributed to their
increased awareness of modern agriculture, including both
processing and marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has established a marketing network linked to 14 cities
and an information center under the Ministry of Agriculture.
Farmers currently market products to 47 cities in 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The province is gradually expanding its transportation and
marketing network, and is increasing funding for road construction
in counties and villages. The provincial government allocated 800
million yuan between 1996-1997 to construct roads stretching 1,600
kilometers.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six Tamil rebel
suspects have gone on hunger strike atop the roof of the Kalutara
remand prison, 60 kilometers from Colombo, in Western province, to
protest against "their indefinite detention by the authorities,"
said reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are continuing their hunger strike, police
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to police, Saturday evening three Tamil rebel
suspects found their way to the roof and announced the hunger
strike which is believed to be a planned exercise. Thirty-three
other suspects joined them Sunday, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers are demanding that they be transferred to
Batticaloa prison in Eastern province as it is difficult for their
family members in the east to visit them at the present prison.
</P>
<P>
The rebel suspects also want an assurance by the authorities
that their grievances will be looked into, according to concerned
sources.
</P>
<P>
The prison authorities have so far not called in the police.
But Kalutara police have informed the relevant authorities of the
situation and are closely following the developments, the reports
added.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Projections call for
Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial center, to
export products valued at 16.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, a
5.3 times the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
The city's foreign trade volume has scored an 18 percent annual
growth rate since 1993, or some four percentage points higher than
the period growth rate for its gross domestic product -- the value
of good and services produced.
</P>
<P>
Development of the city's foreign trade mechanisms over the
past two decades has been characterized by a shift from a
planned economy to a multi-channel and multifaceted strategy,
according to Zhu Xiaoming, director of the Municipal Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The city had 711 state-owned foreign trade agencies by the
end of last year, with some some 3,600 and foreign-funded
enterprises enjoying import and export authority.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of primary products to the city's exports dropped to
2.8 percent in 1997 as a result of industrial restructuring, while
that of manufactured goods grew 10 percent to 97.2
percent. Electronic and machinery products accounted for close to
a third of the total export volume. The annual export trade volume
for name brand and high-tech products has hit six billion
U.S. dollars over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The city imported 9,500 advanced technology and equipment items
valued at 6.24 billion US dollars during the 1985-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Shanghai will continue to make full use of Chinese and
foreign resources and markets in order to become an international
economic, financial and trade center in the near future.

As a result, the handling capacity of the port will be raised
to 85 to 90 million tons from the 78 million tons projected
for this year, port officials said.
</P>
<P>
The central government, and the Guangdong provincial and
Guangzhou city governments will jointly invest a total of 750
million yuan (90.36 million U.S. dollars) in the project, which is
expected to dredge 40 million cubic meters of silt out of the
channels.
</P>
<P>
The project was decided on as it became apparent that the
present channels have become inadequate to cope with the growing
commerce of the port. Preparations for the dredging began as early
as 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's Shoe Manufacturers Facing Serious Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's shoe industry, one of
the world's largest, is now facing serious challenges in a more
competitive market as well as from its large capacity, and
analysts are calling for a new round of changes.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, China has imported a large amount of
production equipment that made the industry grow rapidly.
According to the State Statistics Bureau, China produced more than
6.29 billion pairs of shoes last year, about four times the 1985
figure. Nearly half of those were sold abroad.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, more shoe manufacturers have had market
problems, leaving some 300 million pairs of leather shoes in
warehouses. By the end of 1997, even the best manufacturers had to
operate at least 50 percent under capacity.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute this partly to a lack of variety and
disorderly competition between manufacturers and dealers and say
that manufacturers should improve their product line to meet
international demand, and should replace imported materials with
domestic materials to cut costs, while looking for new overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
A major part of Chinese shoes are made with imported materials
for re-export worth of 5.78 billion U.S. dollars each year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman has capped
off a bizarre month by suing World Championship Wrestling (WCW).
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, the eccentric basketball star who
has been married, separated, and sued in last two weeks, alleges
he wasn't fully paid under two pay-per-view contracts with WCW.
</P>
<P>
According to the suit filed in Orange County Superior Court
and moved Wednesday to federal court in Los Angeles, Rodman
claims under one contract, he was to be paid a base amount of $750
,000 to be host for an event in Charleston, South Carolina, and
to wrestle in Daytona, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 37, was to get half of all gross cable sales revenue
more than $3.9 million for each event, the suit charges.
</P>
<P>
Rodman's lawyer Richard Howell said the WCW has "given us
different sets of numbers that confuse us and appear to be in
conflict with other numbers that we have been provided."
</P>
<P>
Howell said the WCW also now claims Rodman is entitled to a
percentage of the pay-for-view cable TV sales, but not the cable
satellite sales.

LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza is to fly to Spain Monday in his continuing bid to
stop the extradition of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet
from the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Insulza, who came to London specially for Pinochet's case,
still maintains the 83-year-old general should be allowed to fly
home to face justice there.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said his hope is to persuade the Spanish
authorities to drop their extradition request.
</P>
<P>
His three-day-long effort in London to stop the extradition
proceeding has not been fruitful. UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
assured Insulza in their talks that the extradition process would
keep going as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, The Observer and The Sunday Times reported that
British ministers and Insulza nearly reached a deal to allow
Pinochet to fly back home to face justice in Chile.
</P>
<P>
But the UK government and Insulza said later that no deal was
reached.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hopes 1999 Will See State of Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Sunday said he hopes 1999 will be "the year of the
independent Palestinian state," and urged U.S. President Bill
Clinton to help him support peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this year will be the year of the independent
Palestinian state.... We say that holy Jerusalem is going to be
its capital," Arafat said at a gathering of Arab Americans in
suburban Virginia outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
The questions of Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood are two of
the most explosive issues that the Israelis and Palestinians still
have to tackle in permanent status talks, which have just resumed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
annex huge chunks of Palestinian land if Arafat declares a state
next May. The Clinton administration has cautioned against
unilateral acts by either side.
</P>
<P>
Asked later about the dangers of declaring a state, Arafat said
the Oslo peace accord reached in September 1993 gives him the
right to do it after the interim period expires in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Constant U.S. attention is crucial, the Palestinian leader
said, because "there are enemies of peace in more than one place."
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to meet Clinton at the White House Monday.
Clinton plans in two weeks to visit Israel, the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is in Washington to attend an international donors'
conference Monday that is expected to boost U.S. aid to the
Palestinians beyond the 500 million U.S. dollars delivered over
the past five years and to get other wealthy countries to kick in
more as well.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, 2.3 billion U.S. dollars was pledged at a
similar conference to assist the Palestinians in the West Bank and
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also had lunch Sunday with Secretary of Commerce William
Daley and a group of 15 American business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Daley said he hoped Monday's conference, which will be attended
by officials from more than 40 countries, will stimulate the
private sector to be more active in investing in Palestinian
areas.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who recently returned from the Middle East, also
reiterated the U.S. pledge to promote financial prosperity in Gaza
and the region.
</P>
<P>
"I am committed to helping chairman Arafat involve the business
community in the Middle East peace process," Daley said. "A
lasting peace can only be built on economic stability and jobs."

</P>
<P>
He is in consultation with the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh
which created Dolly, the first cloned mammal, and said that within
the next 12 years it would be routine for every baby to have an
embryonic clone.
</P>
<P>
"All it takes now is financial investment," he said. "This
therapy will be the medicine of the next century."
</P>
<P>
A working party from Britain's Human Fertilization and
Embryology Authority and the human genetics advisory commission
will report to the government within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that it will recommend approval of new
"therapeutic" cloning but come down firmly against reproductive
cloning by replicating a living human being.
</P>
<P>
If the group's report is accepted by ministers, it would mean
that Britain could be the first to clone a human embryo, The
Sunday Times said.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Develop Drug for Chickenpox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have
developed the first drug that can cure chickenpox and shingles,
The Sunday Times said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Trojan Horse compound, expected to be used on the
first human patients in the next 12 months, makes the virus
self-destruct by tricking it into using the drug as a building
block for its own DNA.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems in dealing with the chickenpox virus has
been in finding ways of destroying it once it has caused an
infection. When a virus infects a person, it needs to expand
rapidly and it does this by hijacking the host DNA.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chris McGuigan and colleagues at Cardiff University
have created a compound that mimics a nucleoside, which the virus
mistakes for a real DNA building brick.
</P>
<P>
The compound, designed to look sufficiently like the real thing
to trick the virus, has enough differences for human bodies to
recognize it as a fake.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit like the Trojan Horse idea in that these molecules
go into the cells and the virus believes them to be the real
components of DNA and builds its own DNA on them," Professor
McGuigan was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Urges Syria to Negotiate With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman called on Syria Sunday to resume negotiations with Israel
over Israel's pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The key is in Syria's hands and Syria could restart its
negotiations with Israel to solve this issue in the spirit of the
1991 Madrid Peace Conference," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made this call during his visits to the families of the
Israeli soldiers killed Thursday in the occupied zone in south
Lebanon, the Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the difficulties for an immediate solution, the two
sides should try to meet with each other because this issue could
only be solved peacefully through negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were killed Thursday in south Lebanon,
bringing the death toll to seven in ten days. A total of 22
Israeli soliders and one Israeli civilian have been killed so far
this year in the area.
</P>
<P>
The rising death toll brought about increased urge by the
Israeli public for ending Israel's occupation in south
Lebanon. Israel set up the self-styled security zone there in 1985
after two invasions, with the declared aim to protect its northern
border from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
A war of attrition has since been engaged between Lebanese
resistance guerrillas and Israeli occupation forces and their proxy
South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
A poll in the Israeli newspaper Maariv on Friday indicated
that 40 percent of the Israelis support a unilateral withdrawal,
compared to only 16 percent in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his
European trip Friday to return home to work out Israel's strategy
on South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the security zone Sunday morning, Netanyahu
called his security cabinet ministers and military leaders in the
afternoon to assess the situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw from south Lebanon, but
conditioned it on Lebanese government's guarantee of its
security. The offer was rejected by Lebanon, and its close ally
Syria, who demanded Israel pull out unconditionally as asked by
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Syria is a major power broker in Lebanon. Israeli has accused
Damascus of using south Lebanon as a bargaining chip to force
Israel to return the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast
War.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Syria and Israeli broke up in early
1996 and Syria insisted that a resumption should be from where
they were left off - Israel should honor the oral promise made by
the previous Labor government to eventually return the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's left-wing Likud government rejected the demand.

objective to divert the public opinion from dangerous schemes of
Israel, "which has turned the region into a depot of nuclear

TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday reiterated Tehran's "all-out and full-fledged
readiness to support" the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said in a statement that the Palestine land belongs to
all Palestinians, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed regret that the Palestinian issue remained
unsolved. Unfortunately, he said, the most basic rights of the
Palestinians have been denied despite international efforts to
restore legitimate rights of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the settlement of Palestinian crisis will be
impossible if the occupation by Israel of Palestinian land and the
expulsion of Palestinian people from the land were not stopped.

Despite numerous peace agreements and repeated urges of the
international communities, Israel is continuing with its
aggressive policy of violating the Palestinians' rights, he

BEIRUT, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Sunday
blasted suspected positions of Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon as a retaliation for the killing of seven Israeli
soldiers in recent days.

<P>
They staged two sorties, dropping two air-to-surface missiles

</P>
<P>
The area is believed to be used by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, as a base for operations against
Israeli soldiers and their militia allies South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
This is the second straight day for Israeli air raid after its
two soldiers were killed by a Hezbollah guerrillas' roadside bomb
inside the Israeli self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
set up in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks, a total of seven Israeli soldier have
been killed by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The mounting losses, which have raised to 23 the number of
Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year, rekindled heated debates in Israel over its continued
presense in south Lebanon.

The ministers made the call before attending a meeting called

The rising casualties caused growing concern among the Israelis

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Differ on Impeachment, Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton must
state clearly that he lied in the Monica Lewinsky matter before
the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee can consider any
alternative to impeachment, Republican members said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But other lawmakers warned not to ignore momentum for the
option of censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
Representative Peter King, a Republican of New York, said that
a vote to impeach would fall short in the House and pursuing that
course could perpetuate the image that Republicans put the scandal
ahead of the nation's legislative needs.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make it harder to get our agenda across. We have
to show that we can lead, that we can bring an end to this," he
said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
But the move to censure was complicated last week by
Republicans' dissatisfaction with Clinton's answers to 81
questions concerning the affair, which were presented to him by
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
"This censure idea without an admission on the president's part
is a political cop-out," committee member Lindsey Graham, a
Republican, told NBC. "I do not want to have an unrepentant
perjurer leading the nation into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay said on CNN's "Late Edition,"
"The Congress and the House have no other option but to vote
impeachment or not."
</P>
<P>
Clinton or his representatives have been invited to testify
before the committee on December 8, but White House spokesman Jim
Kennedy said the White House is still evaluating how to respond to
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
One Senate Republican, Arlen Specter, said on "Fox News Sunday"
that Clinton should personally appear to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
After that, the committee is to decide whether to recommend
articles of impeachment to the full House, which could take up the
matter the following week.
</P>
<P>
If 218 House members vote to impeach, action would move to the
Senate where a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, are needed to
convict and remove the president from office. With opinions split
down party lines, there is little chance of that happening.
</P>
<P>
The first House Democrat to urge Clinton to resign over the
affair, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, said on NBC that while the
president's alleged offenses may be impeachable, it would be
"profoundly unwise" for the House to impeach him on a party-line
vote "against the manifest will of the American people."
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Orrin Hatch, a
Republican, said he saw a "50-50 chance" that the House would
refer articles of impeachment to the Senate. He said he would meet
with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Democratic leader Tom
Daschle and others to prepare for that possibility.
</P>
<P>
Censure comes into the picture, Hatch said, if it's clear the
Senate doesn't have the 67 votes to convict. The question becomes,
he said on ABC's "This Week," "Do you just let the president off
scot-free."
